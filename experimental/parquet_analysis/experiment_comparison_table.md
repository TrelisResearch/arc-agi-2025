# All-Correct Programs by Task Across Experiments

Comparison of 5 experimental runs showing count of all-correct (non-transductive) programs per task.

## Experiment Descriptions

- **Baseline 1**: No refinement (Sept 2 - used as source for refinement)
- **Baseline 2**: No refinement (Sept 3 control run)
- **Refine + Diff**: Refinement with output diffs
- **Refine + Full**: Refinement with full outputs
- **Refine Only**: Refinement with program only (no outputs)

## Results Table

Numbers show count of all-correct programs for each task. Empty cells indicate zero all-correct programs.
