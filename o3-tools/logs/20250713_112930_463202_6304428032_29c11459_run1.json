          "Input grids and outputs are 5\u00d711 grids.\n\nObservations from the training pairs:\n\n- There are exactly two nonzero points in the input grid, located somewhere on the grid but each on a different row.\n- In the output grid:\n  - The row of the first nonzero input point gets replaced by a \"stretched\" horizontal pattern spanning the entire row.\n  - Similarly for the row of the second nonzero input point.\n- Each of those rows with nonzero points is turned into a contiguous horizontal line of length 5 of the first color on the left side, then a 1-cell \"middle\" with color 5, then 5 cells of the second color on the right side.\n- For example, in Example 1:\n  - Input has 1 at (1,0) and 2 at (1,10).\n  - Output at row 1: five 1's on the left, a 5 in the middle (index 5), and five 2's on the right.\n- In Example 2:\n  - Input points at (3,0) = 3 and (3,10) = 7\n  - Output row 3: five 3's on left, a 5 in middle  (col 5), five 7's on right.\n\nNo other rows are changed.\n\nHypothesis:  \n- Find rows that have exactly 2 nonzero points at the far left and far right (column 0 and column 10)  \n- Replace that row by 5 copies of the left color, then a 5 in the middle cell, then 5 copies of right color.\n\nIn the test input, there are three nonzero points on different rows (row 1, value 4; row 4, value 6; also row 1, col 10=8; row 4, col 10=9). Possibly transform each row independently applying the same pattern.\n\nBut in training, only rows with both endpoints filled get transformed.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation plan:**\n\n- Input generator: simply recreate the given inputs and test input.\n- Output generator: recreate given outputs.\n- Transform:\n  - Initialize output grid as zeros (5x11).\n  - For each row, scan for nonzeros.\n  - If exactly 2 nonzero points, one near left side and one near right side (at col 0 and col 10), then:\n    - Fill positions 0-4 with left color.\n    - Position 5 with 5.\n    - Positions 6-10 with right color.\n  - Else, leave the row as zeros.\n\n---\n\nCode follows:\n\nInput Grid Generator:\n```python\ndef generate_input_grids():\n    # Training input 1\n    train_input_1 = [\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    ]\n\n    # Training input 2\n    train_input_2 = [\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    ]\n\n    # Test input\n    test_input = [\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9],\n    ]\n\n    return [train_input_1, train_input_2, test_input]\n```\n\nOutput Grid Generator:\n```python\ndef generate_output_grids():\n    train_output_1 = [\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [1,1,1,1,1,5,2,2,2,2,2],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    ]\n\n    train_output_2 = [\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [3,3,3,3,3,5,7,7,7,7,7],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    ]\n\n    return [train_output_1, train_output_2]\n```\n\nTransformation function:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Output grid always 5x11 zeros\n    output = [[0]*11 for _ in range(5)]\n\n    for r in range(5):\n        # Find nonzero positions and values in this row\n        nonzeros = [(c, grid[r][c]) for c in range(11) if grid[r][c] != 0]\n        if len(nonzeros) == 2:\n            left_pos, left_val = nonzeros[0]\n            right_pos, right_val = nonzeros[1]\n            # Check if points are at start and end positions\n            # We allow tolerance for \"at edges\" as pos==0 and pos==10\n            if left_pos == 0 and right_pos == 10:\n                # fill left half with left_val\n                for i in range(5):\n                    output[r][i] = left_val\n                # middle cell 5\n                output[r][5] = 5\n                # right half with right_val\n                for i in range(6,11):\n                    output[r][i] = right_val\n                continue\n        # otherwise row remains zeros\n\n    return output\n```\n\n---\n\nThis code reproduces the training outputs exactly and reflects a clear pattern.

              "Input grids and outputs are 5\u00d711 grids.\n\nObservations from the training pairs:\n\n- There are exactly two nonzero points in the input grid, located somewhere on the grid but each on a different row.\n- In the output grid:\n  - The row of the first nonzero input point gets replaced by a \"stretched\" horizontal pattern spanning the entire row.\n  - Similarly for the row of the second nonzero input point.\n- Each of those rows with nonzero points is turned into a contiguous horizontal line of length 5 of the first color on the left side, then a 1-cell \"middle\" with color 5, then 5 cells of the second color on the right side.\n- For example, in Example 1:\n  - Input has 1 at (1,0) and 2 at (1,10).\n  - Output at row 1: five 1's on the left, a 5 in the middle (index 5), and five 2's on the right.\n- In Example 2:\n  - Input points at (3,0) = 3 and (3,10) = 7\n  - Output row 3: five 3's on left, a 5 in middle  (col 5), five 7's on right.\n\nNo other rows are changed.\n\nHypothesis:  \n- Find rows that have exactly 2 nonzero points at the far left and far right (column 0 and column 10)  \n- Replace that row by 5 copies of the left color, then a 5 in the middle cell, then 5 copies of right color.\n\nIn the test input, there are three nonzero points on different rows (row 1, value 4; row 4, value 6; also row 1, col 10=8; row 4, col 10=9). Possibly transform each row independently applying the same pattern.\n\nBut in training, only rows with both endpoints filled get transformed.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation plan:**\n\n- Input generator: simply recreate the given inputs and test input.\n- Output generator: recreate given outputs.\n- Transform:\n  - Initialize output grid as zeros (5x11).\n  - For each row, scan for nonzeros.\n  - If exactly 2 nonzero points, one near left side and one near right side (at col 0 and col 10), then:\n    - Fill positions 0-4 with left color.\n    - Position 5 with 5.\n    - Positions 6-10 with right color.\n  - Else, leave the row as zeros.\n\n---\n\nCode follows:\n\nInput Grid Generator:\n```python\ndef generate_input_grids():\n    # Training input 1\n    train_input_1 = [\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    ]\n\n    # Training input 2\n    train_input_2 = [\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,7],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    ]\n\n    # Test input\n    test_input = [\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,9],\n    ]\n\n    return [train_input_1, train_input_2, test_input]\n```\n\nOutput Grid Generator:\n```python\ndef generate_output_grids():\n    train_output_1 = [\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [1,1,1,1,1,5,2,2,2,2,2],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    ]\n\n    train_output_2 = [\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n        [3,3,3,3,3,5,7,7,7,7,7],\n        [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n    ]\n\n    return [train_output_1, train_output_2]\n```\n\nTransformation function:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Output grid always 5x11 zeros\n    output = [[0]*11 for _ in range(5)]\n\n    for r in range(5):\n        # Find nonzero positions and values in this row\n        nonzeros = [(c, grid[r][c]) for c in range(11) if grid[r][c] != 0]\n        if len(nonzeros) == 2:\n            left_pos, left_val = nonzeros[0]\n            right_pos, right_val = nonzeros[1]\n            # Check if points are at start and end positions\n            # We allow tolerance for \"at edges\" as pos==0 and pos==10\n            if left_pos == 0 and right_pos == 10:\n                # fill left half with left_val\n                for i in range(5):\n                    output[r][i] = left_val\n                # middle cell 5\n                output[r][5] = 5\n                # right half with right_val\n                for i in range(6,11):\n                    output[r][i] = right_val\n                continue\n        # otherwise row remains zeros\n\n    return output\n```\n\n---\n\nThis code reproduces the training outputs exactly and reflects a clear pattern.
