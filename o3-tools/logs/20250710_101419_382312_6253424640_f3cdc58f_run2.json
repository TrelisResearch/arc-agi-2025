          "Let's analyze the examples carefully based on both the numeric and the color-coded grids:\n\n- All grids are 10x10.\n- In inputs, colors (values) are scattered in various positions.\n- In outputs, blocks appear aligned mostly on the left side (first few columns).\n- There is a clear \"stacking\" or \"column filling\" effect on the left side in outputs.\n- Specifically, in outputs:\n  - We see vertical color columns starting from the bottom rows going upwards.\n  - Colors seem to be those used in the input but rearranged.\n- Looking at the colors involved:\n  - Blue (1), Red (2), Green (3), Yellow (4) appear to be the main colors used.\n  - In outputs, we see columns mostly of these four colors starting from the bottom row upwards.\n\nLooking deeper:\n\n- The outputs look like forming a \"color bar chart\" along the left:\n  - Each color used in the input forms a vertical stack of that color blocks.\n  - The stacks are arranged in increasing color-number order from left to right or left to right bottom up.\n\nChecking the numbers:\n\nExample 1 Input:\n- Colors used: 1,2,3,4 scattered around.\nOutput:\n- The vertical stacks for 1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly for Examples 2 and 3.\n\nHypothesis:\n- Find all the colored points with colors 1 to 4.\n- Count how many occurrences of each color are in the input.\n- Then create vertical columns of each color on the bottom-left corner.\n- For example, color 1 forms a vertical column starting at bottom-left upwards, same for color 2 in the next column to the right, and so on.\n- Length of each color's column = number of pixels of that color in input, but capped by grid height 10.\n- However, the examples show the columns mostly reaching the bottom of the grid and fixed heights (max 10).\n- Yet from the output grids, the columns for color1 usually bottom left, color2 next, etc.\n\nChecking exact heights:\n- In example 1 output column for color1 is 6 blocks high; color2 is 3 blocks high, etc. Counting the pixels in input matches this.\n\nTherefore:\n\nSteps to implement:\n- Count occurrences of colors 1,2,3,4 in the input grid.\n- Create empty 10x10 grid of zeros.\n- For each color from 1 to 4:\n  - Draw a vertical column on the left, starting at the bottom row up.\n  - The column index increments for each color: col 0 for 1, col 1 for 2, col 2 for 3, col 3 for 4.\n  - The height = number of pixels of that color counted, capped by 10.\n- Leave other parts of grid zero.\n\nThis matches the observed outputs very well.\n\n---\n\nFinal Implementation Notes:\n\n- Other colors (like 0 = black) are ignored.\n- We only handle colors 1 to 4 as vertical bars.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create empty 10x10 grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Count occurrences of colors 1 to 4\n    color_counts = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  # index 0 unused, colors 1-4 at indices 1-4\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            val = grid[row][col]\n            if 1 <= val <= 4:\n                color_counts[val] += 1\n                \n    # For each color 1-4, draw vertical column on left, bottom-up\n    for color in range(1,5):\n        count = min(color_counts[color], 10)  # max possible height is 10\n        col_pos = color - 1  # color 1 goes to column 0, etc.\n        for i in range(count):\n            # Place color from bottom row upwards\n            transformed_grid[9 - i][col_pos] = color\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```"

              "Let's analyze the examples carefully based on both the numeric and the color-coded grids:\n\n- All grids are 10x10.\n- In inputs, colors (values) are scattered in various positions.\n- In outputs, blocks appear aligned mostly on the left side (first few columns).\n- There is a clear \"stacking\" or \"column filling\" effect on the left side in outputs.\n- Specifically, in outputs:\n  - We see vertical color columns starting from the bottom rows going upwards.\n  - Colors seem to be those used in the input but rearranged.\n- Looking at the colors involved:\n  - Blue (1), Red (2), Green (3), Yellow (4) appear to be the main colors used.\n  - In outputs, we see columns mostly of these four colors starting from the bottom row upwards.\n\nLooking deeper:\n\n- The outputs look like forming a \"color bar chart\" along the left:\n  - Each color used in the input forms a vertical stack of that color blocks.\n  - The stacks are arranged in increasing color-number order from left to right or left to right bottom up.\n\nChecking the numbers:\n\nExample 1 Input:\n- Colors used: 1,2,3,4 scattered around.\nOutput:\n- The vertical stacks for 1,2,3,4.\n\nSimilarly for Examples 2 and 3.\n\nHypothesis:\n- Find all the colored points with colors 1 to 4.\n- Count how many occurrences of each color are in the input.\n- Then create vertical columns of each color on the bottom-left corner.\n- For example, color 1 forms a vertical column starting at bottom-left upwards, same for color 2 in the next column to the right, and so on.\n- Length of each color's column = number of pixels of that color in input, but capped by grid height 10.\n- However, the examples show the columns mostly reaching the bottom of the grid and fixed heights (max 10).\n- Yet from the output grids, the columns for color1 usually bottom left, color2 next, etc.\n\nChecking exact heights:\n- In example 1 output column for color1 is 6 blocks high; color2 is 3 blocks high, etc. Counting the pixels in input matches this.\n\nTherefore:\n\nSteps to implement:\n- Count occurrences of colors 1,2,3,4 in the input grid.\n- Create empty 10x10 grid of zeros.\n- For each color from 1 to 4:\n  - Draw a vertical column on the left, starting at the bottom row up.\n  - The column index increments for each color: col 0 for 1, col 1 for 2, col 2 for 3, col 3 for 4.\n  - The height = number of pixels of that color counted, capped by 10.\n- Leave other parts of grid zero.\n\nThis matches the observed outputs very well.\n\n---\n\nFinal Implementation Notes:\n\n- Other colors (like 0 = black) are ignored.\n- We only handle colors 1 to 4 as vertical bars.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create empty 10x10 grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Count occurrences of colors 1 to 4\n    color_counts = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  # index 0 unused, colors 1-4 at indices 1-4\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            val = grid[row][col]\n            if 1 <= val <= 4:\n                color_counts[val] += 1\n                \n    # For each color 1-4, draw vertical column on left, bottom-up\n    for color in range(1,5):\n        count = min(color_counts[color], 10)  # max possible height is 10\n        col_pos = color - 1  # color 1 goes to column 0, etc.\n        for i in range(count):\n            # Place color from bottom row upwards\n            transformed_grid[9 - i][col_pos] = color\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```"
