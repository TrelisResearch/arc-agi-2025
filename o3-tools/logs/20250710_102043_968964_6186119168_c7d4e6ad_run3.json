          "Let's analyze the task thoroughly:\n\n---\n\n### Observations from Provided Training Examples (Text + Image):\n\n- Both numeric training examples have:\n  - A vertical column of nonzero numbers on the leftmost column (in text, e.g., 8 and 2 in example 1; 9,6,4 in example 2).\n  - A \"shape\" (mostly gray in visualization = \"5\" in text examples) forming some shape connected to those numbers.\n  \n- The transformation:\n  - In the output, the \"5\" shape is replaced by the number in the left column **located on that same row**.\n    - For example, in Example 1, wherever the input has 5's, the output replaces them with the **number found on the leftmost column of that row**.\n      - The 5s surrounded by 8s get replaced by 8.\n      - Others by 2, depending on the row.\n  - The digits in the left column keep their places.\n  - Zeros remain zeros.\n  \n- This is also consistent in Example 2.\n  - The 5's are replaced by the left column digit on the same row.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of pattern:\n\n**For each cell in the grid:**\n\n- If the cell is 0 \u2192 output 0.\n- If the cell is in the leftmost column and non-zero \u2192 output is same digit.\n- If the cell is 5 (or part of the shape), replace it by the digit from the left column in the same row.\n- Any other digit stays the same (except 5 gets replaced).\n\nThis explains the visual examples too:\n\n- There is a vertical column of different color pixels on the left.\n- The \"gray\" shape pixels (value 5) are replaced with the corresponding left-column color on the same row.\n- The colors on the left column don't spread or move.\n- Rest pixels remain unchanged or zero.\n\n---\n\n### Applying same reasoning to the colored grid visual:\n\n- Left column colors do not move.\n- The gray shape pixels get replaced by the left column's color per row.\n  \n---\n\n### Implementation Plan:\n\n- Create a new grid (copy of input to start).\n- For each row:\n  - Identify the left column digit.\n  - Iterate columns:\n    - If cell value = 5:\n      - Replace with left column digit on that row.\n    - Else if cell value is 0, keep 0.\n    - Else (including left column digits and others), keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases & Notes:\n\n- Left column digit can be zero (then 0 replaces all 5's?) - doesn't appear in examples.\n- If 5 appears outside the shape? Just replace anyway.\n- Only shape digit replaced is 5.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer is implementing this logic.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Make a deep copy of grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for r in range(10):\n        left_val = grid[r][0]\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = left_val\n            else:\n                # keep original value otherwise (including 0 and left column numbers)\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n    return transformed_grid\n```"

              "Let's analyze the task thoroughly:\n\n---\n\n### Observations from Provided Training Examples (Text + Image):\n\n- Both numeric training examples have:\n  - A vertical column of nonzero numbers on the leftmost column (in text, e.g., 8 and 2 in example 1; 9,6,4 in example 2).\n  - A \"shape\" (mostly gray in visualization = \"5\" in text examples) forming some shape connected to those numbers.\n  \n- The transformation:\n  - In the output, the \"5\" shape is replaced by the number in the left column **located on that same row**.\n    - For example, in Example 1, wherever the input has 5's, the output replaces them with the **number found on the leftmost column of that row**.\n      - The 5s surrounded by 8s get replaced by 8.\n      - Others by 2, depending on the row.\n  - The digits in the left column keep their places.\n  - Zeros remain zeros.\n  \n- This is also consistent in Example 2.\n  - The 5's are replaced by the left column digit on the same row.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of pattern:\n\n**For each cell in the grid:**\n\n- If the cell is 0 \u2192 output 0.\n- If the cell is in the leftmost column and non-zero \u2192 output is same digit.\n- If the cell is 5 (or part of the shape), replace it by the digit from the left column in the same row.\n- Any other digit stays the same (except 5 gets replaced).\n\nThis explains the visual examples too:\n\n- There is a vertical column of different color pixels on the left.\n- The \"gray\" shape pixels (value 5) are replaced with the corresponding left-column color on the same row.\n- The colors on the left column don't spread or move.\n- Rest pixels remain unchanged or zero.\n\n---\n\n### Applying same reasoning to the colored grid visual:\n\n- Left column colors do not move.\n- The gray shape pixels get replaced by the left column's color per row.\n  \n---\n\n### Implementation Plan:\n\n- Create a new grid (copy of input to start).\n- For each row:\n  - Identify the left column digit.\n  - Iterate columns:\n    - If cell value = 5:\n      - Replace with left column digit on that row.\n    - Else if cell value is 0, keep 0.\n    - Else (including left column digits and others), keep as is.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases & Notes:\n\n- Left column digit can be zero (then 0 replaces all 5's?) - doesn't appear in examples.\n- If 5 appears outside the shape? Just replace anyway.\n- Only shape digit replaced is 5.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer is implementing this logic.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Make a deep copy of grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for r in range(10):\n        left_val = grid[r][0]\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = left_val\n            else:\n                # keep original value otherwise (including 0 and left column numbers)\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
