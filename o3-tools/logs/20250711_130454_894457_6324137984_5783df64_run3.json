          "Let's analyze the training examples carefully:\n\n- Each input is a grid with mostly zeros and some colored cells (non-zero).\n- The output is always a 3x3 grid.\n- The 3x3 output grid seems to be formed by extracting one colored cell from each of the 3x3 \"regions\" or \"blocks\" of the input.\n- In the training examples, the input grids are either 6x6 or 9x9.\n- The outputs correspond to picking the \"colored\" cell in each of the 3x3 regions:\n\n  For example, in the first example (6x6 input), the grid can be divided into 3 horizontal segments of 2 rows each, and 3 vertical segments of 2 columns each, making 3x3 blocks of size 2x2. For each block, the non-zero (colored) digit is extracted into the corresponding position in the output grid.\n\n- Similarly, the second example input is 9x9, and we would divide it into 3x3 blocks of 3x3, picking the colored cell from each block.\n- Third example is again 6x6, same logic applies.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n- Divide the input grid into a 3x3 grid of blocks.\n- For each block:\n  - Find the single non-zero value in that block.\n  - Place that value in the corresponding cell in the output 3x3 grid.\n\nAdditional observations:\n- It's stated in the problem that the output must always be 3x3.\n- The input grids are either 6x6 or 9x9.\n- Each block contains exactly one colored cell.\n- There are no conflicting multiple colored cells per block.\n\nHence, the approach is straightforward:\n- Calculate block height and width: `block_h = rows // 3`, `block_w = cols // 3`\n- For each block (3x3):\n  - search inside the block for non-zero value(s)\n  - take the first detected colored cell's value.\n- Fill that into the output 3x3 grid.\n\nLet's write code for this logic.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    block_h = rows // 3\n    block_w = cols // 3\n\n    output = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            found_value = 0\n            # iterate inside block\n            for r in range(i*block_h, (i+1)*block_h):\n                for c in range(j*block_w, (j+1)*block_w):\n                    if grid[r][c] != 0:\n                        found_value = grid[r][c]\n                        break\n                if found_value != 0:\n                    break\n            output[i][j] = found_value\n\n    return output\n```"
