Numbers in the input grid seem to \"spread\" or \"expand\" to adjacent cells in the output grid\n2. The number 2 in Example 1 spreads to the right and down\n3. The number 6 in Example 2 spreads to the right and down\n4. The number 8 in Example 3 spreads to the right and down\n5. The number 7 in Example 4 spreads to the right and down\n6. The number 2 in Example 4 spreads to the right and down\n7. The number 6 in Example 4 spreads to the right and down\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading a number to all adjacent cells in the output grid, but only if the original cell contains a non-zero value.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(6):\n        for j in range(6):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value to adjacent cells\n                # Right\n                if j + 1 < 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = grid[i][j]\n                # Down\n                if i + 1 < 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = grid[i][j]\n                # Right and Down\n                if j + 1 < 6 and i + 1 < 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j+1] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(6):\n        for j in range(6):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value to adjacent cells\n                # Right\n                if j + 1 < 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = grid[i][j]\n                # Down\n                if i + 1 < 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = grid[i][j]\n                # Right and Down\n                if j + 1 < 6 and i + 1 < 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j+1] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
