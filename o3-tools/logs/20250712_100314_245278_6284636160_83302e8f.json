          "Analyzing the training examples:\n- In all cases, the transformation involves identifying a pattern in the input grid (e.g., specific shapes or structures) and converting that pattern into some form of segmented or colored output.\n- The output grid size is fixed at 24\u00d724, regardless of input size.\n- Common transformations include:\n  - Identifying and highlighting specific lines or shapes (e.g., grids, cross patterns)\n  - Filling certain areas based on contained shapes\n  - Transforming specific colors (values in input) into different values in output\n  - Emphasizing or extending patterns (such as lines or clusters)\n\nBased on this, a particularly consistent pattern across examples is:\n- Detecting the position of certain special values (like 5, 9, or 1)\n- In the output, these values are often transformed into a different value, usually to highlight these regions\n- Turning lines or specific shapes into wider lines or colored regions\n- For the test input, the pattern appears similar: a grid structure formed by specific values (here 5 and 0), and the output emphasizes these regions with a specific color or pattern.\n\n**Likely transformation hypothesis:**\n\n- Detect certain \"lines\" (rows, columns) with specific values (like 5)\n- Convert these lines into a bounding box or wider lines with a different label\n- Transform other regions based on certain key values (e.g., 0 \u2192 4, 5 \u2192 9, or similar pattern)\n\nGiven the test input has grid values of 0 and 5, and based on previous examples, I hypothesize:\n\n- Convert the regions with 5 into thicker lines or different colors (say 9)\n- Possibly highlight the grid structure of 5s into a thicker outline in the output\n- Fill non-5 regions with a basic pattern, perhaps turning the grid background into a specific value\n\n---\n\n### Implementation for the transformation:\n\n- The key pattern observed: \"Highlight areas where 5 appears, turning them into a thicker or more prominent line (e.g., 9)\"\n- Expand the 'lines' of 5 into broader lines, perhaps by replacing 5s and their neighboring cells, to emphasize the grid structure.\n\n---\n\n### Approximate code:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    new_grid = np.zeros((24, 24), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Define the pattern: highlight the lines where 5 occurs.\n    # Expand the 5s into a thicker outline.\n    # First, identify where 5 is.\n    mask = arr == 5\n    \n    # Create a thicker line: for each 5, expand to neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n    from scipy.ndimage import binary_dilation\n    thick_mask = binary_dilation(mask, iterations=1)\n    \n    # Turn these into value 9 to highlight\n    new_grid[thick_mask] = 9\n    \n    # Fill remaining cells with a background pattern\n    # For simplicity, fill all other cells with value 4 (as in previous guesses)\n    new_grid[arr != 5] = 4\n    \n    return new_grid.tolist()\n\n# Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```"

              "Analyzing the training examples:\n- In all cases, the transformation involves identifying a pattern in the input grid (e.g., specific shapes or structures) and converting that pattern into some form of segmented or colored output.\n- The output grid size is fixed at 24\u00d724, regardless of input size.\n- Common transformations include:\n  - Identifying and highlighting specific lines or shapes (e.g., grids, cross patterns)\n  - Filling certain areas based on contained shapes\n  - Transforming specific colors (values in input) into different values in output\n  - Emphasizing or extending patterns (such as lines or clusters)\n\nBased on this, a particularly consistent pattern across examples is:\n- Detecting the position of certain special values (like 5, 9, or 1)\n- In the output, these values are often transformed into a different value, usually to highlight these regions\n- Turning lines or specific shapes into wider lines or colored regions\n- For the test input, the pattern appears similar: a grid structure formed by specific values (here 5 and 0), and the output emphasizes these regions with a specific color or pattern.\n\n**Likely transformation hypothesis:**\n\n- Detect certain \"lines\" (rows, columns) with specific values (like 5)\n- Convert these lines into a bounding box or wider lines with a different label\n- Transform other regions based on certain key values (e.g., 0 \u2192 4, 5 \u2192 9, or similar pattern)\n\nGiven the test input has grid values of 0 and 5, and based on previous examples, I hypothesize:\n\n- Convert the regions with 5 into thicker lines or different colors (say 9)\n- Possibly highlight the grid structure of 5s into a thicker outline in the output\n- Fill non-5 regions with a basic pattern, perhaps turning the grid background into a specific value\n\n---\n\n### Implementation for the transformation:\n\n- The key pattern observed: \"Highlight areas where 5 appears, turning them into a thicker or more prominent line (e.g., 9)\"\n- Expand the 'lines' of 5 into broader lines, perhaps by replacing 5s and their neighboring cells, to emphasize the grid structure.\n\n---\n\n### Approximate code:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    new_grid = np.zeros((24, 24), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Define the pattern: highlight the lines where 5 occurs.\n    # Expand the 5s into a thicker outline.\n    # First, identify where 5 is.\n    mask = arr == 5\n    \n    # Create a thicker line: for each 5, expand to neighbors (up, down, left, right)\n    from scipy.ndimage import binary_dilation\n    thick_mask = binary_dilation(mask, iterations=1)\n    \n    # Turn these into value 9 to highlight\n    new_grid[thick_mask] = 9\n    \n    # Fill remaining cells with a background pattern\n    # For simplicity, fill all other cells with value 4 (as in previous guesses)\n    new_grid[arr != 5] = 4\n    \n    return new_grid.tolist()\n\n# Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
