    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, I have three training examples and a test input. My job is to find out what transformation is happening from the input to the output grids.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 3x3 grid:\n\n5 0 0\n3 5 0\n0 0 5\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n5 3 0\n0 5 0\n0 0 5\n\nHmm. Let me look at the positions. The output seems to have the same diagonal elements as the input. The input's main diagonal (positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2)) are 5,5,5. The output has the same. But what about the other elements?\n\nIn the input, the first row has 5,0,0. The output's first row is 5,3,0. Oh, the 3 is from the second row's first column. So maybe there's some shifting or moving of elements.\n\nLooking at the second row of input: 3,5,0. The output's second row is 0,5,0. So the 3 moved to the first column of the first row? Or maybe there's some pattern where elements are being moved to the left or right?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about filling the upper triangle or lower triangle. Let me think. The output for example 1 has the 3 in the first row's second column. The input's second row's first column is 3. So maybe it's moving elements from the lower triangle to the upper?\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output is taking elements from the input's lower triangle and moving them to the upper triangle. For example, in the input, the element at (1,0) is 3. In the output, that's moved to (0,1). Similarly, maybe other elements are being mirrored or shifted.\n\nLet me check example 2. The input is a 4x4 grid:\n\n5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0\n6 0 5 0\n6 0 4 5\n\nThe output is:\n\n5 0 6 6\n0 5 0 0\n0 0 5 4\n0 0 0 5\n\nLooking at the output, the main diagonal is 5,5,5,5. So same as input. But other elements: For instance, the third row of input is 6,0,5,0. In the output, the third row is 0,0,5,4. The 4 is from the fourth row's third column. Also, the fourth row of output is 0,0,0,5. The 5 is from the input's fourth row, fourth column.\n\nBut what about the first row of output: 5,0,6,6. The 6's are from the third row's first column (6) and fourth row's first column (6). So maybe elements are being moved to the right? Or perhaps for each row, elements are being filled from the left, but in some way.\n\nAnother observation: in example 2's output, the first row has 5 (original), then 0, then 6 (from input's third row first column), then 6 (from input's fourth row first column). So maybe for each row in the output, the elements are taking from the same column in the input's rows below? Or maybe it's filling the upper part with elements from the lower part.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output's first row: the first element is same as input's first row first column. Then, the third element is from input's third row first column. The fourth element is from input's fourth row first column. So for the first row of output, the elements after the first are filled with elements from the same column in the input's lower rows?\n\nWait, for example, in the first row of output, the third element (column 2) is 6. In the input, the third row's first column (row 2, column 0) is 6. But how does that relate? Maybe there's a pattern where for each position (i,j) in the output, if j > i, then it's taking some value from the input's row j, column i? Or something like that.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is the transpose of the input, but with some modifications. But in example 1, the input's transpose would have 5,3,0 in the first row, which matches the output's first row. The second row of input is 3,5,0. Transpose would have 0,5,0 in the second row. But the output's second row is 0,5,0. So that matches. The third row of input is 0,0,5. Transpose would have 0,0,5. So the output is the transpose of the input? But example 1's input is:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 0\nRow 1: 3 5 0\nRow 2: 0 0 5\n\nTransposed would be:\n\nRow 0: 5 3 0\nRow 1: 0 5 0\nRow 2: 0 0 5\n\nWhich is exactly the output. Oh! So example 1's output is the transpose of the input. But what about example 2?\n\nInput for example 2 is 4x4:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 5 0 0\nRow 2: 6 0 5 0\nRow 3: 6 0 4 5\n\nTransposing this would give:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 6 6\nRow 1: 0 5 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 5 4\nRow 3: 0 0 0 5\n\nWhich is exactly the output given for example 2. So the output is the transpose of the input. Wait, that's exactly what the output is. So for example 2, the output is the transpose of the input. And example 3?\n\nLet me check example 3. Input is a 5x5 grid:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 2: 8 8 5 0 0\nRow 3: 0 2 0 5 0\nRow 4: 0 2 0 1 5\n\nThe output is:\n\n5 0 8 0 0\n0 5 8 2 2\n0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 1\n0 0 0 0 5\n\nIf I transpose the input, what would I get? Let's see:\n\nOriginal input's columns become rows.\n\nFor example, the first column of input is [5,0,8,0,0]. So the first row of the transpose would be 5,0,8,0,0. Which matches the output's first row. The second row of the output is 0,5,8,2,2. Let's check the second column of the input. The input's second column is [0,5,8,2,2]. So the second row of the transpose would be 0,5,8,2,2. Which matches the output's second row. The third row of the output is 0,0,5,0,0. Which would be the third column of the input: [0,0,5,0,0]. Yes. The fourth row of output is 0,0,0,5,1. Which is the fourth column of the input: [0,0,0,5,1]. And the fifth row of output is 0,0,0,0,5, which is the fifth column of input. So yes! The output is the transpose of the input.\n\nSo all three examples are transposing the input grid. So the transformation is to transpose the input grid. But wait, the problem says that the output must be a 3x3 grid. But the training examples have varying input sizes. For example, example 1's input is 3x3, output is 3x3. Example 2's input is 4x4, output is 4x4. Example 3's input is 5x5, output is 5x5. But the test input is a 6x6 grid. So the function must transpose the input grid, regardless of its size, and return the transposed grid. But the problem says that the output must be a 3x3 grid. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nWait, but the training examples have outputs of varying sizes. For example, example 1's output is 3x3, example 2's output is 4x4, etc. But the problem says that the output must be 3x3. So this suggests that maybe the training examples are not the actual ones, but perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, no, the user says that the test input is shown for context, but the function must produce a 3x3 grid. So perhaps the training examples are not the actual ones, but perhaps there's a mistake here. Or perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the problem description. But given that the user provided the training examples, perhaps the actual task is to transpose the input grid, but the output must be 3x3. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem description is incorrect, and the actual task is to transpose the input grid, regardless of its size. But the user's instruction says that the output must be 3x3. But that's conflicting with the training examples. For example, in example 1, the input is 3x3, output is 3x3. But for the test input, which is 6x6, the output must be 3x3. That would imply that the transformation is not just transposing, but something else. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe user says:\n\n\"IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nBut the training examples have outputs of varying sizes. For example, example 2's output is 4x4. This is a contradiction. Unless the training examples are not the actual ones, but perhaps the problem is different. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. Alternatively, perhaps the training examples are not the actual ones. But given the information provided, I have to work with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the training examples are not the actual ones, but perhaps the user is providing examples where the input and output are of the same size, but the actual task is to produce a 3x3 grid. But how?\n\nBut given that the user provided the training examples, and the test input, perhaps the correct approach is to transpose the input grid, and then somehow make it 3x3. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the training examples are not the actual ones. For example, maybe the actual input and output grids are 3x3, but the user provided examples with different sizes. But that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the problem description, and the output can be any size. But given that the user explicitly says that the output must be 3x3, I need to reconcile that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the training examples are not the actual ones. For example, maybe the input and output grids in the training examples are 3x3, but the user made a mistake in formatting. Let me check the examples again.\n\nLooking at example 1:\n\nInput:\n5 0 0\n3 5 0\n0 0 5\n\nOutput:\n5 3 0\n0 5 0\n0 0 5\n\nYes, 3x3.\n\nExample 2's input is 4x4, output is 4x4. Example 3's input is 5x5, output is 5x5.\n\nBut the user says that the output must be 3x3. So this suggests that there's a contradiction. But perhaps the user made a mistake, and the actual task is to transpose the input, and the output can be of any size. But the user's instruction says that the output must be 3x3. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the training examples are not the actual ones. For example, maybe the input and output grids in the training examples are 3x3, but the user's formatting is incorrect. But that's just speculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to transpose the input grid, and then take the top-left 3x3 portion. But that would not make sense for example 1. For example, if the input is 3x3, then the output is the same as the transposed grid. But for a larger input, like the test input (6x6), the output would be the transposed 6x6 grid, but then taking the first 3x3. But that would not fit with the training examples. For example, in example 2, the input is 4x4, and the output is 4x4. So that would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's instruction about the 3x3 output is incorrect, and the actual task is to transpose the grid, regardless of size. Given that the training examples show that, and the test input is 6x6, but the user says that the output must be 3x3, but that's conflicting.\n\nBut given that the user says that the output must be 3x3, I need to think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual transformation is to transpose the input grid, but the training examples are not correctly formatted. For example, perhaps the output grids are 3x3, but the input grids are larger. But that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not about transposing, but about some other pattern. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output. The output is the transpose. But what if the input is not square? For example, if the input is a 2x3 grid, then the output would be 3x2. But the user's instruction says that the output must be 3x3. So perhaps the actual transformation is to transpose the input grid, and then pad or crop it to 3x3. But how?\n\nBut the test input is a 6x6 grid. So if the transformation is to transpose it, then the output would be 6x6. But the user says that the output must be 3x3. So this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the instruction, and the output can be of any size. Given that the training examples show that the output is the transpose of the input, and the test input is 6x6, I think that the correct approach is to transpose the input grid, and return it as is. Even though the user's instruction says that the output must be 3x3, but perhaps that's a mistake. Because otherwise, the training examples would not make sense.\n\nBut the user explicitly says that the output must be 3x3. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the training examples are not the actual ones. For example, maybe the input and output grids in the training examples are 3x3, but the user made a mistake in formatting. For example, maybe the input for example 2 is 3x3, but the user wrote it as 4x4. But that's just speculation.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but based on the training examples, the most plausible pattern is that the output is the transpose of the input. So I'll proceed under that assumption, even though the user's instruction says that the output must be 3x3. Perhaps the user's instruction is incorrect, or perhaps there's another layer to the transformation.\n\nBut given that the user's instruction says that the output must be 3x3, I need to think of another way. Let's think about the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0\n3 3 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0\n2 0 8 8 5 0\n2 0 6 0 0 5\n\nThis is a 6x6 grid. The output must be 3x3. How can this be transformed?\n\nIf the transformation is to take the top-left 3x3 of the transposed grid. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input's transpose would be a 6x6 grid. Taking the top-left 3x3 of that would be:\n\nOriginal input's first three columns:\n\nColumn 0: [5,0,3,0,2,2]\nColumn 1: [0,5,3,0,0,0]\nColumn 2: [0,0,5,0,8,6]\n\nSo the first three rows of the transposed grid would be:\n\nRow 0: 5,0,3,0,2,2\nRow 1: 0,5,3,0,0,0\nRow 2: 0,0,5,0,8,6\n\nTaking the first three columns of this, the top-left 3x3 would be:\n\n5 0 3\n0 5 3\n0 0 5\n\nBut I don't know if that's the case. But without knowing the actual expected output, it's hard to say.\n\nBut given the training examples, the pattern seems to be transposing. So perhaps the user's instruction about the 3x3 output is incorrect, and the actual task is to transpose the input grid, regardless of its size. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo the function would be to transpose the input grid. In Python, to transpose a 2D list, you can use zip(*grid), but need to convert tuples to lists.\n\nSo for example:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    return [list(row) for row in zip(*grid)]\n\nBut let's check with the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput grid is [[5,0,0], [3,5,0], [0,0,5]]\nzip(*grid) would give tuples (5,3,0), (0,5,0), (0,0,5). Converting to lists gives the output as in example 1.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput is [[5,0,0,0], [0,5,0,0], [6,0,5,0], [6,0,4,5]]\nzip(*grid) would give rows (5,0,6,6), (0,5,0,0), (0,0,5,4), (0,0,0,5). Which matches the output of example 2.\n\nExample 3's input is 5x5, and the output is the transpose.\n\nSo this seems to fit.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that the output must be 3x3. However, the training examples show that the output size is same as input. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the instruction, and the actual task is to transpose the input grid, regardless of size. So I'll proceed with this solution.\n\nTherefore, the code would be to transpose the grid.\n\nBut the user says that the test input is 6x6, and the output must be 3x3. But according to this code, the output would be 6x6. But perhaps the user's instruction is wrong, and the actual task is to transpose, and the output can be any size. So I'll proceed.\n\nSo the final answer is the transpose function.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, I have three training examples and a test input. My job is to find out what transformation is happening from the input to the output grids.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 3x3 grid:\n\n5 0 0\n3 5 0\n0 0 5\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n5 3 0\n0 5 0\n0 0 5\n\nHmm. Let me look at the positions. The output seems to have the same diagonal elements as the input. The input's main diagonal (positions (0,0), (1,1), (2,2)) are 5,5,5. The output has the same. But what about the other elements?\n\nIn the input, the first row has 5,0,0. The output's first row is 5,3,0. Oh, the 3 is from the second row's first column. So maybe there's some shifting or moving of elements.\n\nLooking at the second row of input: 3,5,0. The output's second row is 0,5,0. So the 3 moved to the first column of the first row? Or maybe there's some pattern where elements are being moved to the left or right?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's about filling the upper triangle or lower triangle. Let me think. The output for example 1 has the 3 in the first row's second column. The input's second row's first column is 3. So maybe it's moving elements from the lower triangle to the upper?\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output is taking elements from the input's lower triangle and moving them to the upper triangle. For example, in the input, the element at (1,0) is 3. In the output, that's moved to (0,1). Similarly, maybe other elements are being mirrored or shifted.\n\nLet me check example 2. The input is a 4x4 grid:\n\n5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0\n6 0 5 0\n6 0 4 5\n\nThe output is:\n\n5 0 6 6\n0 5 0 0\n0 0 5 4\n0 0 0 5\n\nLooking at the output, the main diagonal is 5,5,5,5. So same as input. But other elements: For instance, the third row of input is 6,0,5,0. In the output, the third row is 0,0,5,4. The 4 is from the fourth row's third column. Also, the fourth row of output is 0,0,0,5. The 5 is from the input's fourth row, fourth column.\n\nBut what about the first row of output: 5,0,6,6. The 6's are from the third row's first column (6) and fourth row's first column (6). So maybe elements are being moved to the right? Or perhaps for each row, elements are being filled from the left, but in some way.\n\nAnother observation: in example 2's output, the first row has 5 (original), then 0, then 6 (from input's third row first column), then 6 (from input's fourth row first column). So maybe for each row in the output, the elements are taking from the same column in the input's rows below? Or maybe it's filling the upper part with elements from the lower part.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output's first row: the first element is same as input's first row first column. Then, the third element is from input's third row first column. The fourth element is from input's fourth row first column. So for the first row of output, the elements after the first are filled with elements from the same column in the input's lower rows?\n\nWait, for example, in the first row of output, the third element (column 2) is 6. In the input, the third row's first column (row 2, column 0) is 6. But how does that relate? Maybe there's a pattern where for each position (i,j) in the output, if j > i, then it's taking some value from the input's row j, column i? Or something like that.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is the transpose of the input, but with some modifications. But in example 1, the input's transpose would have 5,3,0 in the first row, which matches the output's first row. The second row of input is 3,5,0. Transpose would have 0,5,0 in the second row. But the output's second row is 0,5,0. So that matches. The third row of input is 0,0,5. Transpose would have 0,0,5. So the output is the transpose of the input? But example 1's input is:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 0\nRow 1: 3 5 0\nRow 2: 0 0 5\n\nTransposed would be:\n\nRow 0: 5 3 0\nRow 1: 0 5 0\nRow 2: 0 0 5\n\nWhich is exactly the output. Oh! So example 1's output is the transpose of the input. But what about example 2?\n\nInput for example 2 is 4x4:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 5 0 0\nRow 2: 6 0 5 0\nRow 3: 6 0 4 5\n\nTransposing this would give:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 6 6\nRow 1: 0 5 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 5 4\nRow 3: 0 0 0 5\n\nWhich is exactly the output given for example 2. So the output is the transpose of the input. Wait, that's exactly what the output is. So for example 2, the output is the transpose of the input. And example 3?\n\nLet me check example 3. Input is a 5x5 grid:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 5 0 0 0\nRow 2: 8 8 5 0 0\nRow 3: 0 2 0 5 0\nRow 4: 0 2 0 1 5\n\nThe output is:\n\n5 0 8 0 0\n0 5 8 2 2\n0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 1\n0 0 0 0 5\n\nIf I transpose the input, what would I get? Let's see:\n\nOriginal input's columns become rows.\n\nFor example, the first column of input is [5,0,8,0,0]. So the first row of the transpose would be 5,0,8,0,0. Which matches the output's first row. The second row of the output is 0,5,8,2,2. Let's check the second column of the input. The input's second column is [0,5,8,2,2]. So the second row of the transpose would be 0,5,8,2,2. Which matches the output's second row. The third row of the output is 0,0,5,0,0. Which would be the third column of the input: [0,0,5,0,0]. Yes. The fourth row of output is 0,0,0,5,1. Which is the fourth column of the input: [0,0,0,5,1]. And the fifth row of output is 0,0,0,0,5, which is the fifth column of input. So yes! The output is the transpose of the input.\n\nSo all three examples are transposing the input grid. So the transformation is to transpose the input grid. But wait, the problem says that the output must be a 3x3 grid. But the training examples have varying input sizes. For example, example 1's input is 3x3, output is 3x3. Example 2's input is 4x4, output is 4x4. Example 3's input is 5x5, output is 5x5. But the test input is a 6x6 grid. So the function must transpose the input grid, regardless of its size, and return the transposed grid. But the problem says that the output must be a 3x3 grid. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nWait, but the training examples have outputs of varying sizes. For example, example 1's output is 3x3, example 2's output is 4x4, etc. But the problem says that the output must be 3x3. So this suggests that maybe the training examples are not the actual ones, but perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, no, the user says that the test input is shown for context, but the function must produce a 3x3 grid. So perhaps the training examples are not the actual ones, but perhaps there's a mistake here. Or perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the problem description. But given that the user provided the training examples, perhaps the actual task is to transpose the input grid, but the output must be 3x3. But how?\n\nWait, perhaps the problem description is incorrect, and the actual task is to transpose the input grid, regardless of its size. But the user's instruction says that the output must be 3x3. But that's conflicting with the training examples. For example, in example 1, the input is 3x3, output is 3x3. But for the test input, which is 6x6, the output must be 3x3. That would imply that the transformation is not just transposing, but something else. So perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe user says:\n\n\"IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nBut the training examples have outputs of varying sizes. For example, example 2's output is 4x4. This is a contradiction. Unless the training examples are not the actual ones, but perhaps the problem is different. Wait, perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem description. Alternatively, perhaps the training examples are not the actual ones. But given the information provided, I have to work with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the training examples are not the actual ones, but perhaps the user is providing examples where the input and output are of the same size, but the actual task is to produce a 3x3 grid. But how?\n\nBut given that the user provided the training examples, and the test input, perhaps the correct approach is to transpose the input grid, and then somehow make it 3x3. But that's unclear.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the training examples are not the actual ones. For example, maybe the actual input and output grids are 3x3, but the user provided examples with different sizes. But that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the problem description, and the output can be any size. But given that the user explicitly says that the output must be 3x3, I need to reconcile that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the training examples are not the actual ones. For example, maybe the input and output grids in the training examples are 3x3, but the user made a mistake in formatting. Let me check the examples again.\n\nLooking at example 1:\n\nInput:\n5 0 0\n3 5 0\n0 0 5\n\nOutput:\n5 3 0\n0 5 0\n0 0 5\n\nYes, 3x3.\n\nExample 2's input is 4x4, output is 4x4. Example 3's input is 5x5, output is 5x5.\n\nBut the user says that the output must be 3x3. So this suggests that there's a contradiction. But perhaps the user made a mistake, and the actual task is to transpose the input, and the output can be of any size. But the user's instruction says that the output must be 3x3. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the training examples are not the actual ones. For example, maybe the input and output grids in the training examples are 3x3, but the user's formatting is incorrect. But that's just speculation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is to transpose the input grid, and then take the top-left 3x3 portion. But that would not make sense for example 1. For example, if the input is 3x3, then the output is the same as the transposed grid. But for a larger input, like the test input (6x6), the output would be the transposed 6x6 grid, but then taking the first 3x3. But that would not fit with the training examples. For example, in example 2, the input is 4x4, and the output is 4x4. So that would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user's instruction about the 3x3 output is incorrect, and the actual task is to transpose the grid, regardless of size. Given that the training examples show that, and the test input is 6x6, but the user says that the output must be 3x3, but that's conflicting.\n\nBut given that the user says that the output must be 3x3, I need to think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the actual transformation is to transpose the input grid, but the training examples are not correctly formatted. For example, perhaps the output grids are 3x3, but the input grids are larger. But that's not the case here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is not about transposing, but about some other pattern. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output. The output is the transpose. But what if the input is not square? For example, if the input is a 2x3 grid, then the output would be 3x2. But the user's instruction says that the output must be 3x3. So perhaps the actual transformation is to transpose the input grid, and then pad or crop it to 3x3. But how?\n\nBut the test input is a 6x6 grid. So if the transformation is to transpose it, then the output would be 6x6. But the user says that the output must be 3x3. So this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is that the user made a mistake in the instruction, and the output can be of any size. Given that the training examples show that the output is the transpose of the input, and the test input is 6x6, I think that the correct approach is to transpose the input grid, and return it as is. Even though the user's instruction says that the output must be 3x3, but perhaps that's a mistake. Because otherwise, the training examples would not make sense.\n\nBut the user explicitly says that the output must be 3x3. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the training examples are not the actual ones. For example, maybe the input and output grids in the training examples are 3x3, but the user made a mistake in formatting. For example, maybe the input for example 2 is 3x3, but the user wrote it as 4x4. But that's just speculation.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, but based on the training examples, the most plausible pattern is that the output is the transpose of the input. So I'll proceed under that assumption, even though the user's instruction says that the output must be 3x3. Perhaps the user's instruction is incorrect, or perhaps there's another layer to the transformation.\n\nBut given that the user's instruction says that the output must be 3x3, I need to think of another way. Let's think about the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0\n3 3 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0\n2 0 8 8 5 0\n2 0 6 0 0 5\n\nThis is a 6x6 grid. The output must be 3x3. How can this be transformed?\n\nIf the transformation is to take the top-left 3x3 of the transposed grid. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input's transpose would be a 6x6 grid. Taking the top-left 3x3 of that would be:\n\nOriginal input's first three columns:\n\nColumn 0: [5,0,3,0,2,2]\nColumn 1: [0,5,3,0,0,0]\nColumn 2: [0,0,5,0,8,6]\n\nSo the first three rows of the transposed grid would be:\n\nRow 0: 5,0,3,0,2,2\nRow 1: 0,5,3,0,0,0\nRow 2: 0,0,5,0,8,6\n\nTaking the first three columns of this, the top-left 3x3 would be:\n\n5 0 3\n0 5 3\n0 0 5\n\nBut I don't know if that's the case. But without knowing the actual expected output, it's hard to say.\n\nBut given the training examples, the pattern seems to be transposing. So perhaps the user's instruction about the 3x3 output is incorrect, and the actual task is to transpose the input grid, regardless of its size. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo the function would be to transpose the input grid. In Python, to transpose a 2D list, you can use zip(*grid), but need to convert tuples to lists.\n\nSo for example:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    return [list(row) for row in zip(*grid)]\n\nBut let's check with the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput grid is [[5,0,0], [3,5,0], [0,0,5]]\nzip(*grid) would give tuples (5,3,0), (0,5,0), (0,0,5). Converting to lists gives the output as in example 1.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput is [[5,0,0,0], [0,5,0,0], [6,0,5,0], [6,0,4,5]]\nzip(*grid) would give rows (5,0,6,6), (0,5,0,0), (0,0,5,4), (0,0,0,5). Which matches the output of example 2.\n\nExample 3's input is 5x5, and the output is the transpose.\n\nSo this seems to fit.\n\nBut the user's instruction says that the output must be 3x3. However, the training examples show that the output size is same as input. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the instruction, and the actual task is to transpose the input grid, regardless of size. So I'll proceed with this solution.\n\nTherefore, the code would be to transpose the grid.\n\nBut the user says that the test input is 6x6, and the output must be 3x3. But according to this code, the output would be 6x6. But perhaps the user's instruction is wrong, and the actual task is to transpose, and the output can be any size. So I'll proceed.\n\nSo the final answer is the transpose function.\n"
