Wait, this suggests an inconsistency if taken at face value.\n\nWait, the output is all 4's, which is the value present in the original grid besides the minimum (which is 0). But in the output, they all become **4**.\n\nIf the rule was \"replace all with maximum\", then in example 2, output would be 8s.\n\nHence, the pattern is not uniform across the examples.\n\nLooking again:\n- Example 1: output all 9's, which is the maximum in input grid.\n- Example 2: output all 4's, which is the minimum in input grid, but converted to 4 (original 4's are replaced with 4). \n- Wait, in Input: '4 4 8' in first row, output all 4's, which is the minimum value? Yes, all replaced with the value **8** in example 1, minimum in second example is 0, but the output is 4.\n\nHmm, perhaps the second example is different \u2014 perhaps the pattern is the most common value in the grid. Is 4 the value that appears most in the second example? Let's check:\n\n- Example 2 grid:\n  ```\n  4 4 8\n  6 4 3\n  6 3 0\n  ```\n- Counts:\n  - 4 appears 3 times\n  - 6 appears 2 times\n  - 3 appears 2 times\n  - 8 appears 1 time\n  - 0 appears 1 time\n- The most frequent value is **4**.\n\nThe output in example 2 is all 4s, so perhaps the transformation is replacing all grid values with the **most frequent value** in the grid.\n\nCheck example 3:\n\n- Input:\n  ```\n  4 6 9\n  6 4 1\n  8 8 6\n  ```\n- Counts:\n  - 6 appearing 3 times\n  - 4 appearing 2 times\n  - 8 appearing 2 times\n  - others 1 time each\n- Most frequent: 6.\n- Output:\n  ```\n  6 6 6\n  6 6 6\n  6 6 6\n  ```\n- As per pattern, replacing grid with the most frequent value.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The transformation seems to be replacing all grid values with the **most frequent value** in the input grid.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    # Flatten the grid to count frequencies\n    flat_grid = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]\n    # Find the most frequent value\n    from collections import Counter\n    counts = Counter(flat_grid)\n    most_common_value, _ = counts.most_common(1)[0]\n    \n    # Create the new grid with the most common value\n    transformed_grid = [\n        [most_common_value for _ in row]\n        for row in grid\n    ]\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis logic ensures the function passes all the provided examples."
