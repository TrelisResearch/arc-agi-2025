Always start by attempting to find a complete rule that solves all training examples and should generalize to the test input.\n2. If you cannot find a perfect solution, provide your best attempt at a transformation that solves as many training examples as possible - ideally more than in the best previous turn.\n3. Even if your solution doesn't solve all examples perfectly, ensure it demonstrates meaningful pattern recognition and provides reasonable outputs that minimize pixel-level errors.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your improved transformation logic here (even if partial)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nTraining results: 0/3 examples solved, 88.8% pixel accuracy - Good partial progress!

that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Always start by attempting to find a complete rule that solves all training examples and should generalize to the test input.\n2. If you cannot find a perfect solution, provide your best attempt at a transformation that solves as many training examples as possible - ideally more than in the best previous turn.\n3. Even if your solution doesn't solve all examples perfectly, ensure it demonstrates meaningful pattern recognition and provides reasonable outputs that minimize pixel-level errors.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your improved transformation logic here (even if partial)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nTraining results: 0/2 examples solved, 90.8% pixel accuracy - Good partial progress! Your approach is capturing some patterns. Next, try to identify a transformation that solves at least one of the training examples.\n\nTraining Example 1 \u2717:\nExpected: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n2 2 3\n5 5 5\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n2 2 3\n5 5 5\n0 2 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n3 6 4 2 4\n8 4 3 3 4\n5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n3 6 4 2 4\n8 4 3 3 4\n5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n1 9 9 6 1 8 4\n4 6 7 8 9 7 1\n9 3 1 4 1 3 6\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 9 9 6 1 8 4\n4 6 7 8 9 7 1\n9 3 1 4 1 3 6\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n9 1 2 8 4 9 8 2 1\n4 4 3 1 2 7 6 7 9\n2 1 6 9 7 8 4 3 6\n9 8 6 3 4 2 9 1 7\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Always start by attempting to find a complete rule that solves all training examples and should generalize to the test input.\n2. If you cannot find a perfect solution, provide your best attempt at a transformation that solves as many training examples as possible - ideally more than in the best previous turn.\n3. Even if your solution doesn't solve all examples perfectly, ensure it demonstrates meaningful pattern recognition and provides reasonable outputs that minimize pixel-level errors.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your improved transformation logic here (even if partial)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nTraining results: 0/3 examples solved, 94.7% pixel accuracy - Good partial progress!

Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n2 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2\n2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2\n2 0 1 2 2 2 0 0 8 2 0\n0 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0\n1 2 2 0 0 2 8 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 2 2\n0 0 2 1 2 0 0 0 2 8 0\n0 2 0 0 1 2 2 2 0 2 8\n0 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 0\n2 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 2 0\n2 1 2 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 0\n2 2 2 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2\n0 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 2 0\nOutput:\n2 2 2 0 0\n2 2 0 0 2\n2 0 0 0 2\n2 2 2 0 2\n2 2 2 2 2\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0\n2 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\nOutput:\n0 2 0 0 0 0 2\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n2 2 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0\n1 0 2 0 8 0 2 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2\n2 0 2 0 0 1 2 0 0 8\n2 2 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0\nOutput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 0\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n2 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 2\n2 0 1 2 0 2 0 8 0 2 0 2\n1 2 2 2 2 8 2 0 0 0 2 0\n2 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 0 0\n2 2 1 0 2 2 2 8 2 0 2 2\n2 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 0\nOutput:\n2 0 2 0\n2 2 2 2\n0 2 2 2\n\nExample 5:\nInput:\n1 2 0 2 0 0 0 8 2 0 0 2\n1 2 0 2 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 2\n1 0 2 2 0 2 2 8 0 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0\n0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 2 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 2\n2 0 0 2 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0\nOutput:\n2 0 2 0 0 0\n2 0 2 0 2 0\n0 2 2 0 2 2\n\nTest Input:\n2 0 1 0 2 0 2 2 8 2 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 1 0 2 2 0 2 8 2 0 0 0 0 2\n0 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 8 2 2 0 2 2\n2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 0\n0 1 2 2 0 0 0 8 0 2 2 2 2 2\n2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 0 2 2 2 0\n2 2 2 2 1 0 0 2 0 0 8 0 2 2\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 1 1 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 1 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Always start by attempting to find a complete rule that solves all training examples and should generalize to the test input.\n2. If you cannot find a perfect solution, provide your best attempt at a transformation that solves as many training examples as possible - ideally more than in the best previous turn.\n3.

Next, try to identify a transformation that solves at least one of the training examples.\n\nTraining Example 1 \u2717:\nExpected: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Always start by attempting to find a complete rule that solves all training examples and should generalize to the test input.\n2.

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 2\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 2 1 1 0 0 0\n2 2 0 1 2 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 2\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 1 2 2\n0 2 3 3 1 1 0 2\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6\n0 0 2 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2\n1 1 0 0 2 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n0 2 0 1 1 0 0 3 0 5 5\n2 2 0 0 1 0 3 3 0 0 5\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Always start by attempting to find a complete rule that solves all training examples and should generalize to the test input.\n2. If you cannot find a perfect solution, provide your best attempt at a transformation that solves as many training examples as possible - ideally more than in the best previous turn.\n3.

The output keeps that plus unchanged and draws extra patterns\n        around it:\n        \u2022 Two main diagonals through the centre are coloured 1\n          (starting one step away from the centre until the edge).\n        \u2022 The four orthogonal axes, starting TWO steps away from the\n          centre (so we do not touch the original plus), are filled with\n          a repeating colour cycle\n                 8, 8, 4 , 8, 8, 4 , \u2026\n          i.e. 8,8,4 repeating outward in every direction.\n\n    3.  All other cells remain as they were (0 in the training data).\n\n    The following code implements exactly that rule set.  It solves both\n    training examples and can be applied to the unseen test grid.\n    \"\"\"\n    # deep-copy input grid so we do not alter the original\n    out = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    n_rows, n_cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n\n    # ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    # 1. locate the centre of the plus made of 2\u2019s\n    centre = None\n    for r in range(1, n_rows - 1):\n        for c in range(1, n_cols - 1):\n            if (grid[r][c] == 2 and\n                grid[r-1][c] == 2 and grid[r+1][c] == 2 and\n                grid[r][c-1] == 2 and grid[r][c+1] == 2):\n                centre = (r, c)\n                break\n        if centre:\n            break\n    # if we did not find it, just return copy of input\n    if centre is None:\n        return out\n\n    cr, cc = centre\n\n    # ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    # 2. draw the two diagonals with colour 1 (start at distance 1)\n    diag_dirs = [(-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    for dr, dc in diag_dirs:\n        r, c = cr + dr, cc + dc\n        while 0 <= r < n_rows and 0 <= c < n_cols:\n            out[r][c] = 1\n            r += dr\n            c += dc\n\n    # ------------------------------------------------------------------\n    # 3. draw the four orthogonal axes with repeating 8,8,4\n    cycle = [8, 8, 4]\n    axis_dirs = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    for dr, dc in axis_dirs:\n        step = 2                # start two squares away from the centre\n        r, c = cr + dr*step, cc + dc*step\n        while 0 <= r < n_rows and 0 <= c < n_cols:\n            colour = cycle[(step - 2) % 3]\n            out[r][c] = colour\n            step += 1\n            r += dr\n            c += dc\n\n    return out\n```"
