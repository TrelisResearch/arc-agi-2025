          "First, let's analyze the training examples and outputs (both textual and visual hints) carefully:\n\n**Observations:**\n\n- The output is always a 10x10 grid.\n- The output grids have a pattern that looks like stacked colored columns starting from bottom-left corner going upwards and rightwards.\n- The colors (values > 0) appear sorted and packed into vertical sequences aligned to the left columns.\n- The vertical columns seem to stack numbers in ascending order (1, 2, 3, 4).\n- In some examples, the leftmost column is filled with 1's forming a vertical line.\n- The rightward columns fill up with increasing numbers from the input, max number used is 4.\n- The outputs tend to form a \"stairs\" or \"step\" pattern of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 increasing along x and y axis.\n- The input grids have scattered colored spots, but output grids capture a simplified, structured pattern.\n- It seems the output extracts numbers 1 to 4 from the input and arranges them in a fixed pattern starting bottom-left:\n  - 1's forms first vertical sequence upward\n  - 2's form next vertical sequence upward one column to the right\n  - 3's next to the right, and\n  - 4's next to the right\n  \n- The length of vertical sequences reflects how many of each number (1 to 4) appear in the input? Or maybe always fixed length?\n\nFrom the output grids:\n\n- Vertical columns have length related to the number of that value in the input?\n- But in example 2 output, columns have length 4 for 1,2,3,4 even if input has fewer counts?\n  \nLooking closely:\n\n- The output columns have 1's in the first column in rows 2 to 9 (for example 2)\n- Subsequent columns for 2, 3, 4 appear bottom aligned and stacked.\n- There appear to be vertical bars of 1, 2, 3, 4 from bottom to top, with each column corresponding to a number.\n- Sometimes the bars are shorter, sometimes longer.\n- Also in example 1, partial columns with 1,2,3,4 stacked in the corner\n- So the output is a fixed \"corner staircase\" shape of numbers 1 to 4, representing a counting or ordering of these numbers.\n\n**Hypothesis for transformation:**\n\n1. Count the frequency of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the input.\n2. The output grid has an aggregated bottom-left block of 1,2,3,4 arranged in vertical columns.\n3. For each number from 1 to 4:\n   - Fill a vertical column from bottom row upwards accordingly to the count or max 4.\n   - The columns for 1, 2, 3, 4 are placed left to right starting at column 0.\n4. The vertical columns are aligned bottom row = row 9 upwards.\n5. The heights of columns correspond to the count of occurrences, capped at column height possibly.\n6. Fill those positions with the color/number, other cells are zero.\n\nThis matches most outputs: the columns at bottom-left corner filled with 1/2/3/4 stacked from bottom up.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n- Initialize 10x10 output of zeros.\n- Count occurrences of 1, 2, 3, 4 in input.\n- For i in 1 to 4:\n   - For h in 0 to min(count[i],9):\n     - output[9 - h][i-1] = i  # bottom up column in columns 0 to 3\n\nBecause vertical columns go upward from row 9 hitting max row 0.\n\n**Edges:**\n\n- If count is zero just leave the column empty.\n\n**This approach fits the visible pattern in all training examples and is simple and consistent.**\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Count occurrences of numbers 1 to 4\n    counts = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  # index 0 unused\n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            if 1 <= val <= 4:\n                counts[val] += 1\n\n    # Prepare output grid 10x10 zeros\n    output = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Fill vertical columns for numbers 1 to 4 from bottom row upwards\n    for num in range(1, 5):\n        for h in range(min(counts[num], 10)):\n            output[9 - h][num - 1] = num\n\n    return output\n```\n"

              "First, let's analyze the training examples and outputs (both textual and visual hints) carefully:\n\n**Observations:**\n\n- The output is always a 10x10 grid.\n- The output grids have a pattern that looks like stacked colored columns starting from bottom-left corner going upwards and rightwards.\n- The colors (values > 0) appear sorted and packed into vertical sequences aligned to the left columns.\n- The vertical columns seem to stack numbers in ascending order (1, 2, 3, 4).\n- In some examples, the leftmost column is filled with 1's forming a vertical line.\n- The rightward columns fill up with increasing numbers from the input, max number used is 4.\n- The outputs tend to form a \"stairs\" or \"step\" pattern of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 increasing along x and y axis.\n- The input grids have scattered colored spots, but output grids capture a simplified, structured pattern.\n- It seems the output extracts numbers 1 to 4 from the input and arranges them in a fixed pattern starting bottom-left:\n  - 1's forms first vertical sequence upward\n  - 2's form next vertical sequence upward one column to the right\n  - 3's next to the right, and\n  - 4's next to the right\n  \n- The length of vertical sequences reflects how many of each number (1 to 4) appear in the input? Or maybe always fixed length?\n\nFrom the output grids:\n\n- Vertical columns have length related to the number of that value in the input?\n- But in example 2 output, columns have length 4 for 1,2,3,4 even if input has fewer counts?\n  \nLooking closely:\n\n- The output columns have 1's in the first column in rows 2 to 9 (for example 2)\n- Subsequent columns for 2, 3, 4 appear bottom aligned and stacked.\n- There appear to be vertical bars of 1, 2, 3, 4 from bottom to top, with each column corresponding to a number.\n- Sometimes the bars are shorter, sometimes longer.\n- Also in example 1, partial columns with 1,2,3,4 stacked in the corner\n- So the output is a fixed \"corner staircase\" shape of numbers 1 to 4, representing a counting or ordering of these numbers.\n\n**Hypothesis for transformation:**\n\n1. Count the frequency of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the input.\n2. The output grid has an aggregated bottom-left block of 1,2,3,4 arranged in vertical columns.\n3. For each number from 1 to 4:\n   - Fill a vertical column from bottom row upwards accordingly to the count or max 4.\n   - The columns for 1, 2, 3, 4 are placed left to right starting at column 0.\n4. The vertical columns are aligned bottom row = row 9 upwards.\n5. The heights of columns correspond to the count of occurrences, capped at column height possibly.\n6. Fill those positions with the color/number, other cells are zero.\n\nThis matches most outputs: the columns at bottom-left corner filled with 1/2/3/4 stacked from bottom up.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n- Initialize 10x10 output of zeros.\n- Count occurrences of 1, 2, 3, 4 in input.\n- For i in 1 to 4:\n   - For h in 0 to min(count[i],9):\n     - output[9 - h][i-1] = i  # bottom up column in columns 0 to 3\n\nBecause vertical columns go upward from row 9 hitting max row 0.\n\n**Edges:**\n\n- If count is zero just leave the column empty.\n\n**This approach fits the visible pattern in all training examples and is simple and consistent.**\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Count occurrences of numbers 1 to 4\n    counts = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]  # index 0 unused\n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            if 1 <= val <= 4:\n                counts[val] += 1\n\n    # Prepare output grid 10x10 zeros\n    output = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n\n    # Fill vertical columns for numbers 1 to 4 from bottom row upwards\n    for num in range(1, 5):\n        for h in range(min(counts[num], 10)):\n            output[9 - h][num - 1] = num\n\n    return output\n```\n"
