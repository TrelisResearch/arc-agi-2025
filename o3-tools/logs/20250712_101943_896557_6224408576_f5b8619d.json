          "Let's analyze the transformation step by step using the visual and textual clues:\n\n### **Observations**\n\n#### 1. **Grid Sizes**\n- Input \u2192 Output is an \"explosion\": for each input cell, the output gets a 2x2 block.\n    - Example 1: Input 3x3 \u2192 Output 6x6\n    - Example 2: Input 6x6 \u2192 Output 12x12\n    - Example 3: Input 2x2 \u2192 Output 4x4\n\n#### 2. **Mapping of Numbers and Colors**\n- The original value from the *input* cell appears in the top-left cell of the 2x2 block in the *output*.\n- The remaining cells in the block fill with other colors:\n    - Example 1: Input value 2 \u2192 [2 0; 8 2] pattern in output.\n    - But it's not always this: Example 3, yellow (4) produces (0,4,0,4), and (0,8,0,8). Example 2, (5) gives blocks with 5 and 8.\n- It looks like:\n    - **The original value is copied to multiple places in the block.**\n    - **Background (0) is sometimes replaced with 8, sometimes left as 0.**\n    - **Certain color-coding:** 8 (light blue) often fills the space around non-0 or background, especially in Example 2.\n\n#### 3. **Pattern Guess**\n- Each input cell becomes a 2x2 block.\n- *If the input cell is 0:* The whole block is filled with either 0 or 8, depending on neighbors or context.\n    - In Example 1 and 3, blocks from zeros keep zeros (except in the lower right, where it becomes 8).\n    - In Example 2, the majority of output is filled with 8s, except for vertical bars corresponding to columns of zeros in the input.\n    - Suggests: in certain columns/rows, background (0) is replaced with 8, except when adjacent to a non-zero value.\n- *If the input cell is nonzero:* \n    - In most examples, the cell is replicated into multiple positions within the block, possibly with some 8s or zeros around.\n\n#### 4. **Final Output Size**\n- The task says: output must always be **6x6**.\n\nBut training Example 2\u2019s output is **12x12** (double 6x6). So, for this ARC task, the *underlying rule* is \u201cexpand by 2x in both directions, then crop or pad to 6x6\u201d.\n\n### **Likely Transformation**\nLet\u2019s try this:\n- **Step 1**: For each cell in the input, expand to a 2x2 block using a repeating pattern:\n    - The block is [A, B; C, D], where values depend on the input value (see below).\n- **Step 2**: Tile/repeat/wrap the input grid until you have a grid at least 6x6, then crop to 6x6.\n\n#### **Block Creation Hypothesis**\nBased on outputs, blocks look like:\n- Nonzero input cell: Fill block corners with input value, fill any non-corner with 8.\n    - But in the examples, it's clear that 8 fills all except where the input value is! (Example 2: block for 5 is [5,8;8,5])\n- Zero input cell: All 8 in the block (except possibly certain edges).\n\nSo:\n- If cell value is 0: fill block with 8.\n- If cell value nonzero: top-left and bottom-right are the input value, others are 8.\n\n#### **Assembling the Output**\n- Tile the expanded input grid (as per above) until you have at least 6x6, then crop.\n\n---\n\n## **Pseudocode Algorithm**\n\n1. For each cell (i, j) in input:\n    - If input[i][j] == 0: block = [[8,8],[8,8]]\n    - Else: block = [[V,8],[8,V]], with V = input[i][j]\n2. Place block at (i*2, j*2) in a result grid of doubled size.\n3. Repeat this process (tiling, if needed) so that grid reaches at least 6x6.\n4. Crop result to 6x6.\n\n---\n\n## **Code Implementation**\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = grid.shape\n\n    # Step 1: For each cell, expand to a 2x2 block in an expanded grid\n    expanded = np.zeros((h*2, w*2), dtype=int)\n    for i in range(h):\n        for j in range(w):\n            v = grid[i, j]\n            if v == 0:\n                block = np.full((2,2), 8)\n            else:\n                block = np.array([[v,8],[8,v]])\n            expanded[2*i:2*i+2, 2*j:2*j+2] = block\n\n    # Step 2: Tile as needed to get at least 6x6, then crop\n    eh, ew = expanded.shape\n    reps_row = (6 + eh - 1) // eh\n    reps_col = (6 + ew - 1) // ew\n    tiled = np.tile(expanded, (reps_row, reps_col))\n    result = tiled[:6,:6]\n    \n    return result.tolist()\n```\n"
