          "First, let's analyze the first set of explanatory training examples provided in text:\n\n**Training Examples Analysis (Text-based):**\n\n- Each input is a grid of varying size (either 6x6 or 9x9).\n- The input grid mostly contains zeros except for some cells having colored digits.\n- The output is always a 3\u00d73 grid.\n- The output grid contains all the non-zero digits in the input, arranged spatially in a 3x3 block.\n- Looking closely at Example 1:\n\n  Input 6x6, output 3x3:\n  - The output seems to be formed by looking at three vertical slices of the input (6 columns split into 3 parts of 2 columns), and three horizontal slices (6 rows split into 3 parts of 2 rows).\n  - Within each block (2x2 cell area in input), pick the non-zero drawing.\n  - Then arrange those collected numbers into the output 3x3 grid by positions.\n\n- Same logic also applies to Example 2 (9x9 input), here the input is partitioned into 3x3 blocks of 3x3 cells each.\n- The output grid effectively places the unique non-zero numbers in corresponding blocks in a 3x3 output grid.\n- Example 3 (6x6 input) again confirms this: tripartition rows and columns, collect elements with values into each 2x2 block normally, and output them in the same relative order in the 3x3 block.\n\n**Summary of pattern:**\n- The input grid can be divided into a 3x3 grid of blocks, where each block corresponds to a sub-rectangle of the input.\n- These blocks are:\n  - If input size is NxM, then each block is of height = N/3 and width = M/3 (expecting input dimensions divisible by 3 or 6).\n- For each block, find the unique non-zero digit within that block.\n- Arrange those digits in the same layout (top-left block is top-left output cell, etc.)\n- The final output grid is the 3x3 grid of those digits.\n\n**Visual training examples with colors confirm this idea:**\n- Each color appears in a block of the input grid, and the corresponding cell of output grid has that same color in the corresponding position in a 3x3 layout.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation details:**\n\n- Input: list of lists grid.\n- Determine input height and width.\n- Calculate block_height = height // 3, block_width = width // 3.\n- For each block (i,j) in 3x3:\n  - Scan the cells inside input grid corresponding to that block.\n  - Find the unique non-zero value (or zero if none).\n- Put these values into 3x3 output grid.\n- Return the 3x3 grid.\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- The training examples never show multiple non-zero numbers in the same block, so picking the unique non-zero value should be safe.\n- If multiple non-zero digits appear, just pick the first one found (or max).\n- If none found, output 0 (though not shown in training, but we handle gracefully).\n\n---\n\n**Now, let's write the Python function implementing this logic:**\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    height = len(grid)\n    width = len(grid[0]) if height > 0 else 0\n    \n    block_height = height // 3\n    block_width = width // 3\n    \n    output = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    for block_row in range(3):\n        for block_col in range(3):\n            # Define block limits\n            r_start = block_row * block_height\n            r_end = (block_row + 1)*block_height\n            c_start = block_col * block_width\n            c_end = (block_col + 1)*block_width\n            \n            # Find unique non-zero in block\n            val = 0\n            found_values = []\n            for r in range(r_start, r_end):\n                for c in range(c_start, c_end):\n                    cell_val = grid[r][c]\n                    if cell_val != 0:\n                        found_values.append(cell_val)\n            if found_values:\n                # pick the first, or could pick max or min\n                val = found_values[0]\n            output[block_row][block_col] = val\n    \n    return output\n```"
