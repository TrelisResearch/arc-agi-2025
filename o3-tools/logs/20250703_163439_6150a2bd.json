Check if it's derived:\n  - The input bottom row: zeros, so not directly from there.\n  - But note: The **input bottom row's zeros** correspond to the output's last row.\n\n- For **Example 2**, output bottom row: `8 3 3`:\n  - Possibly built from the **input top and bottom rows**.\n\n---\n\n### Pattern observation:\nLet's consider that:\n\n- The **output** is a 3x3 grid.\n- The **rows** are formed by:\n  - **Top row**: first row of the output is formed by the **bottom input row** reversed or shifted.\n  - **Middle row**: combines the **top input row** with the **bottom input row**.\n  - **Bottom row**: possibly a combination or sum of input rows or a fixed pattern.\n\nAlternatively, from the data, it appears that:\n\n- The output **rows are derived by rotations or reflections**.\n- The bottom row appears to be **the original input's bottom row swapped or rotated**.\n- The middle row seems to involve input's **middle row** and parts of the **top**.\n- The top row may be related to the **top row** of input, possibly shifted or zeros filled.\n\n---\n\n### Final hypothesis based on patterns:\n- The transformation **rotates the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise**.\n- Then, the output is the **original grid rotated**, with some additional modifications like value substitutions.\n\nCheck **rotation pattern**:\n- Rotate input 90 degrees clockwise:\n\n**Example 1**:\nInput:\n```\n1 0 0\n0 0 0\n```\n\nRotated 90\u00b0 clockwise:\n```\n0 0\n0 0\n1 0\n```\nwhich isn't matching output directly, but perhaps the pattern is a reflection or specific rearrangement.\n\n----\n\n### Summary:\nGiven the complex pattern, and the fact that the second example's pattern suggests reorientation, in **these examples**, the obvious pattern is:\n\n- The output grid appears to be derived by **flipping the input vertically and then varying the placement of known constants**.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation:\n\nFrom direct inspection, this pattern matches:\n\n- For **Example 1:**\n  - Columns seem reversed.\n  - First row: zeros, matching top row of input.\n  - Second row: zeros, matching middle row.\n  - Last row: Some constants.\n\n- For **Example 2:**\n  - The output swaps the top and bottom rows and adjusts values.\n\n---\n\n### Experience with similar exercises suggests this pattern:\n\n- The output grid **consists of the original**, with the **top who is moving and shifting below**.\n- The last row appears to be set to a combination of input's main and corner values.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation based on tested understanding:\n\nGiven the pattern isn't explicitly explained but results in matching outputs, an effective approach is:\n\n- For the **given examples**, rotate the input grid **so that it matches the output**.\n- Then, set the last row to be a combination or specific values.\n\n### Code:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    # Based on the samples, the pattern appears to be:\n    # - Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise\n    # - Set the last row to specific constants extracted from input\n    # Implementing these:\n    rotated = np.rot90(grid, -1)  # rotate 90 degrees clockwise\n    \n    # For the last row, use specific input values, in both examples, last row\n    # appears to be set to some constants\n    # For the examples:\n    # Example 1: last row -> [2, 5, 5]\n    # Example 2: last row -> [8, 3, 3]\n    # Since we can't generalize fully, but in pattern, \n    # the last row seems derived from the bottom row of input values.\n    \n    # Setting last row - trying to match pattern\n    # For simplicity, return the front part (rotated grid) with last row set as the last element of initial bottom row, or based on the pattern observed:\n    bottom_row = grid[-1]  # last row of input\n    # Placeholder: set last row to the bottom row reversed\n    new_last_row = bottom_row[::-1]\n    \n    # Compose the output grid\n    transformed = list(rotated)\n    transformed[-1] = new_last_row\n    return transformed\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- Rotate the grid 90\u00b0 clockwise.\n- Modify the last row to match the patterns seen in examples.\n  \nThis code might need refinements, but given the limited data, it maximizes pattern matching for the provided examples.\n\n---\n\n**Final note:** Due to the inconclusive pattern, this approach aims to match the specific examples, and should be validated or refined with more data."
