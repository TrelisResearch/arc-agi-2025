    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let's start by analyzing each example.\n\nFirst, Example 1:\nInput is a 3x3 grid:\nRow 0: 0 7 0\nRow 1: 0 0 7\nRow 2: 0 7 7\n\nOutput is a 3x6 grid:\nRow 0: 0 7 0 0 7 0\nRow 1: 0 0 7 7 0 0\nRow 2: 0 7 7 7 7 0\n\nHmm. Let me see. The input is 3x3, output is 3x6. So each row in the input is being expanded into two rows? Or maybe each input row is being duplicated or transformed in some way. Let's look at the first row of input: 0 7 0. The output first row is 0 7 0 0 7 0. So maybe the original row is being mirrored or extended. Wait, the first three elements are the same as the input row, then the next three are 0 7 0? Or maybe there's some pattern where each element is repeated or mirrored.\n\nLooking at the second row of input: 0 0 7. The output row is 0 0 7 7 0 0. So the original three elements are followed by 7 0 0? Or maybe the original row is being mirrored and then combined. Wait, the original row is 0 0 7. The output row is 0 0 7 7 0 0. So the first three elements are the same as the input row, and the next three are 7 0 0. Wait, that's not a mirror. Alternatively, maybe the original row is being mirrored in some way. Let's see: the original row is [0,0,7]. If we mirror it, it would be [7,0,0], but in the output, the second part is 7 0 0. So maybe the original row is split into two parts, and then mirrored or something?\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row in the input is being expanded into two rows. For example, the first input row is 0 7 0. The output row is 0 7 0 followed by 0 7 0? But that would make the output row 0 7 0 0 7 0. Which matches the first output row. Wait, but the second input row is 0 0 7. The output row is 0 0 7 7 0 0. So maybe the original row is followed by a mirrored version. Wait, the original row is 0 0 7. If you mirror it, you get 7 0 0. So the output row is original + mirrored. So for the first row, original is 0 7 0, mirrored would be 0 7 0? Wait, that's the same. So the output row is original + mirrored. But for the second row, original is 0 0 7, mirrored is 7 0 0, so the output row is 0 0 7 7 0 0. That seems to fit. Let's check the third input row: 0 7 7. The output row is 0 7 7 7 7 0. So original is 0 7 7, and the mirrored part is 7 7 0? Wait, no. Wait, if the original is 0 7 7, then the mirrored would be 7 7 0. So the output row is original + mirrored, which would be 0 7 7 7 7 0. Which matches. So that seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern here is that each row in the input is being duplicated, but the second half is the mirror of the original row. Wait, but the output is 3x6. So each input row is expanded into two rows? Or each input row is transformed into a 6-element row by appending the mirrored version. Wait, the input is 3x3, and output is 3x6. So each input row is being transformed into a 6-element row. So for each input row, the output row is the original row concatenated with its mirrored version. Let's check that.\n\nOriginal row for example 1: [0,7,0]. Mirrored would be [0,7,0], so the output row is [0,7,0,0,7,0]. Which matches. The second input row is [0,0,7]. Mirrored is [7,0,0]. So output row is [0,0,7,7,0,0]. Which matches. Third input row is [0,7,7]. Mirrored is [7,7,0]. So output row is [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Which matches. So that seems to be the pattern for example 1.\n\nNow let's check example 2:\n\nInput is 3x3 grid:\nRow 0: 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 7 7\nRow 2: 0 0 0\n\nOutput is 3x6:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 7 7 7 7 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo for the first input row, [0,0,0], the output row is [0,0,0,0,0,0]. Which is the original row concatenated with itself. Because mirroring [0,0,0] would be [0,0,0], so the output row is original + mirrored. Which is [0,0,0,0,0,0]. For the second input row, [0,7,7], the mirrored is [7,7,0]. So the output row would be [0,7,7,7,7,0]. Which matches the output row. And the third input row is [0,0,0], same as first. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, in example 2, the output row 1 is 0 7 7 7 7 0. Which is the original row [0,7,7] followed by [7,7,0]. So that's the same as the pattern. So that seems to fit.\n\nNow example 3:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0\nRow 1: 7 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 7 0 0 0 0 7\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo for the first input row [0,0,0], output is [0,0,0,0,0,0], which is original + mirrored. For the second input row [7,0,0], the mirrored would be [0,0,7]. So the output row is [7,0,0,0,0,7]. Which matches the output. So again, the same pattern. So the output row is original row + mirrored row.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each row in the input, the output row is the original row concatenated with its mirrored version. So for each input row, the output row is [row[0], row[1], row[2], row[2], row[1], row[0]]? Wait, no. Wait, the original row is [a, b, c]. The mirrored would be [c, b, a]. So the output row is [a, b, c, c, b, a]. Wait, but in example 1, the first input row is [0,7,0]. The mirrored is [0,7,0], so the output row is [0,7,0, 0,7,0]. Which is the same as original + mirrored. But that would be [a, b, c, c, b, a]? Wait, no. Wait, original is [a, b, c], mirrored is [c, b, a]. So the output row would be original + mirrored, which is [a, b, c, c, b, a]. But in example 1's first output row, the first three elements are 0 7 0, then the next three are 0 7 0. Which is the same as original + original. But according to the mirrored idea, the mirrored would be [0,7,0], so the output would be original + mirrored. So that's the same as original + original. But that's only if the original is symmetric. So perhaps the mirroring is not the same as the original row, but the mirrored version.\n\nWait, but in example 3's second input row [7,0,0], the mirrored is [0,0,7]. So the output row is [7,0,0, 0,0,7]. Which is the original row followed by the mirrored row. So that's the pattern.\n\nSo the transformation for each input row is to take the original row and append its mirrored version. So for each row in the input, the output row is the original row concatenated with the reversed row.\n\nWait, but the original row is [a, b, c]. The reversed row is [c, b, a]. So the output row is [a, b, c, c, b, a]. Which is the original row followed by the reversed row. So for example 1's first row: [0,7,0] reversed is [0,7,0], so the output is [0,7,0, 0,7,0]. Which matches. For example 3's second row [7,0,0], reversed is [0,0,7], so the output is [7,0,0, 0,0,7]. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern is that each input row is transformed into a 6-element row by concatenating the original row with its reversed version.\n\nBut wait, let's check example 2's second input row [0,7,7]. Reversed is [7,7,0]. So the output row is [0,7,7,7,7,0], which matches the example's output. So yes, this seems to be the pattern.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each row in the input grid, create a new row that is the original row concatenated with its reversed version. Then, the output grid is three rows, each of six elements.\n\nSo the function would take each row of the input grid, process it as such, and return the new grid.\n\nBut let's check the test input. The test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n7 7 0\n0 7 0\n0 0 7\n\nSo the input grid is 3x3. Let's apply the transformation.\n\nFirst row: [7,7,0]. Reversed is [0,7,7]. So the output row is [7,7,0, 0,7,7].\n\nSecond row: [0,7,0]. Reversed is [0,7,0]. So output row is [0,7,0, 0,7,0].\n\nThird row: [0,0,7]. Reversed is [7,0,0]. Output row is [0,0,7, 7,0,0].\n\nSo the transformed grid would be:\n\nRow 0: 7 7 0 0 7 7\n\nRow 1: 0 7 0 0 7 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 7 7 0 0\n\nBut I need to make sure that this is the correct pattern. Let me check if there's any other possible patterns.\n\nWait, but what about example 3's output? The second row of the input is [7,0,0], reversed is [0,0,7], so the output row is [7,0,0,0,0,7]. Which matches the example's output. So yes, the pattern seems to hold.\n\nSo the code would process each row of the input grid, take the row, reverse it, and concatenate the two. Then, the output grid is three rows, each of six elements.\n\nSo the Python function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = row + row[::-1]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but the input grid is a list of lists. For example, the first example's input is:\n\n[\n [0,7,0],\n [0,0,7],\n [0,7,7]\n]\n\nSo for each row in grid, row is a list. row[::-1] reverses it. So for the first row, [0,7,0], reversed is [0,7,0], so new_row is [0,7,0, 0,7,0], which is correct.\n\nYes. So this code would generate the correct output for the examples.\n\nBut wait, let me check example 2's input. The second input row is [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0]. So the new row is [0,7,7,7,7,0], which matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. For each row in the input grid, create a new row by appending the reversed version of the original row. Then return the transformed grid as a list of lists.\n\nTherefore, the Python function is as described.\n"

For the second input row [7,0,0], the mirrored would be [0,0,7]. So the output row is [7,0,0,0,0,7]. Which matches the output. So again, the same pattern. So the output row is original row + mirrored row.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each row in the input, the output row is the original row concatenated with its mirrored version. So for each input row, the output row is [row[0], row[1], row[2], row[2], row[1], row[0]]? Wait, no. Wait, the original row is [a, b, c]. The mirrored would be [c, b, a]. So the output row is [a, b, c, c, b, a]. Wait, but in example 1, the first input row is [0,7,0]. The mirrored is [0,7,0], so the output row is [0,7,0, 0,7,0]. Which is the same as original + mirrored. But that would be [a, b, c, c, b, a]? Wait, no. Wait, original is [a, b, c], mirrored is [c, b, a]. So the output row would be original + mirrored, which is [a, b, c, c, b, a]. But in example 1's first output row, the first three elements are 0 7 0, then the next three are 0 7 0. Which is the same as original + original. But according to the mirrored idea, the mirrored would be [0,7,0], so the output would be original + mirrored. So that's the same as original + original. But that's only if the original is symmetric. So perhaps the mirroring is not the same as the original row, but the mirrored version.\n\nWait, but in example 3's second input row [7,0,0], the mirrored is [0,0,7]. So the output row is [7,0,0, 0,0,7]. Which is the original row followed by the mirrored row. So that's the pattern.\n\nSo the transformation for each input row is to take the original row and append its mirrored version. So for each row in the input, the output row is the original row concatenated with the reversed row.\n\nWait, but the original row is [a, b, c]. The reversed row is [c, b, a]. So the output row is [a, b, c, c, b, a]. Which is the original row followed by the reversed row. So for example 1's first row: [0,7,0] reversed is [0,7,0], so the output is [0,7,0, 0,7,0]. Which matches. For example 3's second row [7,0,0], reversed is [0,0,7], so the output is [7,0,0, 0,0,7]. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern is that each input row is transformed into a 6-element row by concatenating the original row with its reversed version.\n\nBut wait, let's check example 2's second input row [0,7,7]. Reversed is [7,7,0]. So the output row is [0,7,7,7,7,0], which matches the example's output. So yes, this seems to be the pattern.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each row in the input grid, create a new row that is the original row concatenated with its reversed version. Then, the output grid is three rows, each of six elements.\n\nSo the function would take each row of the input grid, process it as such, and return the new grid.\n\nBut let's check the test input. The test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n7 7 0\n0 7 0\n0 0 7\n\nSo the input grid is 3x3. Let's apply the transformation.\n\nFirst row: [7,7,0]. Reversed is [0,7,7]. So the output row is [7,7,0, 0,7,7].\n\nSecond row: [0,7,0]. Reversed is [0,7,0]. So output row is [0,7,0, 0,7,0].\n\nThird row: [0,0,7]. Reversed is [7,0,0]. Output row is [0,0,7, 7,0,0].\n\nSo the transformed grid would be:\n\nRow 0: 7 7 0 0 7 7\n\nRow 1: 0 7 0 0 7 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 7 7 0 0\n\nBut I need to make sure that this is the correct pattern. Let me check if there's any other possible patterns.\n\nWait, but what about example 3's output? The second row of the input is [7,0,0], reversed is [0,0,7], so the output row is [7,0,0,0,0,7]. Which matches the example's output. So yes, the pattern seems to hold.\n\nSo the code would process each row of the input grid, take the row, reverse it, and concatenate the two. Then, the output grid is three rows, each of six elements.\n\nSo the Python function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = row + row[::-1]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but the input grid is a list of lists. For example, the first example's input is:\n\n[\n [0,7,0],\n [0,0,7],\n [0,7,7]\n]\n\nSo for each row in grid, row is a list. row[::-1] reverses it. So for the first row, [0,7,0], reversed is [0,7,0], so new_row is [0,7,0, 0,7,0], which is correct.\n\nYes. So this code would generate the correct output for the examples.\n\nBut wait, let me check example 2's input. The second input row is [0,7,7], reversed is [7,7,0]. So the new row is [0,7,7,7,7,0], which matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. For each row in the input grid, create a new row by appending the reversed version of the original row. Then return the transformed grid as a list of lists.\n\nTherefore, the Python function is as described.\n"
