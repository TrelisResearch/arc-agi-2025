          "From analyzing the training examples, a common pattern appears to be:  \n- The transformation tends to preserve the position of the bottom (or a specified) row or column of non-zero values.  \n- The non-zero values from input are often moved to the bottom row in the output, maintaining their relative order.  \n- The shape of the grid remains the same (assuming the input and output are 4x4 as specified).  \n- Zero-padding fills other areas.\n\nIn the test input, the specific pattern seems to be to move non-zero values to the bottom of the grid, keeping their relative positions, and zero elsewhere.\n\nBased on this, I hypothesize that **the transformation isolates the bottom-most non-zero values and moves them to the bottom row in the output, preserving their order**.  \n\nHere's a Python implementation that captures this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Ensure grid is 4x4\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Collect all non-zero elements from the input grid, maintaining order\n    non_zero_vals = [cell for row in grid for cell in row if cell != 0]\n    \n    # Prepare output grid filled with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n    \n    # Place the non-zero elements at the bottom row, left to right\n    bottom_row = rows - 1\n    for i, val in enumerate(non_zero_vals):\n        if i < cols:\n            transformed_grid[bottom_row][i] = val\n        else:\n            # If more values than columns, extend to above rows (though unlikely)\n            # For safety, just keep within the bottom row\n            transformed_grid[bottom_row][i % cols] = val\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis approach:\n- Collects all non-zero values,\n- Places them along the bottom row in order,\n- Fills other cells with zeros.\n\nThis captures the general pattern of moving the non-zero values toward the bottom, as seen in the examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Ensure grid is 4x4\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Collect all non-zero elements from the input grid, maintaining order\n    non_zero_vals = [cell for row in grid for cell in row if cell != 0]\n    \n    # Prepare output grid filled with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n    \n    # Place the non-zero elements at the bottom row, left to right\n    bottom_row = rows - 1\n    for i, val in enumerate(non_zero_vals):\n        if i < cols:\n            transformed_grid[bottom_row][i] = val\n        else:\n            # If more than 'cols' values, continue on the same bottom row (or handle accordingly)\n            transformed_grid[bottom_row][i % cols] = val\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```"
