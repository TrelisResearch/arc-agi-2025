The original values in certain positions\n2. Some transformation of the values in other positions\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n- The first 4 columns of the output seem to be a combination of the original values and some transformation\n- The last 7 columns seem to be a combination of the original values and some transformation\n- There appears to be some pattern where values are repeated or modified based on their position\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n1. Takes the first 4 columns of the input and uses them as is in the output\n2. For the last 7 columns, it seems like there's a pattern where values are repeated or modified based on their position\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 3x11 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(11)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Copy the first 4 columns as is\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(4):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Process the last 7 columns\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(4, 11):\n            # For the first row, copy the value from the 4th column\n            if i == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][3]\n            # For the second row, copy the value from the 4th column\n            elif i == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][3]\n            # For the third row, copy the value from the 4th column\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][3]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 3x11 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(11)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Copy the first 4 columns as is\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(4):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Process the last 7 columns\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(4, 11):\n            # For the first row, copy the value from the 4th column\n            if i == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][3]\n            # For the second row, copy the value from the 4th column\n            elif i == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][3]\n            # For the third row, copy the value from the 4th column\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][3]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The original values in certain positions\n2. Some transformation of the values in other positions\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n- The first 4 columns of the output seem to be a combination of the original values and some transformation\n- The last 7 columns seem to be a combination of the original values and some transformation\n- There appears to be some pattern where values are repeated or modified based on their position\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n1. Takes the first 4 columns of the input and uses them as is in the output\n2. For the last 7 columns, it seems like there's a pattern where values are repeated or modified based on their position\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 3x11 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(11)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Copy the first 4 columns as is\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(4):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Process the last 7 columns\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(4, 11):\n            # For the first row, copy the value from the 4th column\n            if i == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][3]\n            # For the second row, copy the value from the 4th column\n            elif i == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][3]\n            # For the third row, copy the value from the 4th column\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][3]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 3x11 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(11)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Copy the first 4 columns as is\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(4):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Process the last 7 columns\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(4, 11):\n            # For the first row, copy the value from the 4th column\n            if i == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][3]\n            # For the second row, copy the value from the 4th column\n            elif i == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][3]\n            # For the third row, copy the value from the 4th column\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][3]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
