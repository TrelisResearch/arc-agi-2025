Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 1\u00d71 output grid.**\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 8 0 8\n2 2 8 0 0\n2 2 0 0 8\n0 0 0 2 2\n8 8 0 2 2\nOutput:\n0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 8 8 8 0\n2 2 8 8 0 2 2\n0 0 8 0 0 2 2\n0 8 0 0 8 0 0\nOutput:\n8\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n8 2 2 8 8 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 8\n0 8 8 0 0 8 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 8\n8 0 8 8 8 2 2\n8 0 0 0 0 2 2\nOutput:\n8\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n8 8 0 0 2 2 0\n0 8 8 0 2 2 8\n0 0 0 8 0 8 0\n8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 8 0 8\n0 2 2 8 8 0 8\nOutput:\n0\n\nExample 5:\nInput:\n8 0 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 2 2 0 8 0\n8 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 8 0\n0 0 8 2 2 0 8\n8 0 0 2 2 8 0\nOutput:\n8\n\nExample 6:\nInput:\n8 0 0 2 2 8\n8 0 8 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0\n2 2 8 0 8 0\n2 2 0 0 0 8\n0 8 8 0 8 0\nOutput:\n0\n\nTest Input:\n2 2 8 8 0 8\n2 2 0 8 0 0\n8 8 0 0 0 8\n0 8 8 8 0 0\n8 0 8 0 0 8\n0 0 8 2 2 0\n8 0 0 2 2 0\n0 8 0 0 0 8\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

              "Let's reconsider the problem based on the feedback and results:\n\n- The previous simple heuristic (compare count of 8 vs 0) only solved examples 1,4,6 correctly (all output 0).\n- It missed correctly classifying 2,3,5 which require output 8.\n- So the presence or count of just 8s and 0s is insufficient.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n\n- Examples where output is **8** (2,3,5):\n  - These grids contain **regions where 8 is adjacent or connected to 2's** in multiple clusters.\n  - Often the 8's and 2's are \"paired/tagged\" or clustered closely.\n- Examples where output is **0** (1,4,6):\n  - Either less 8's adjacent to 2's or 8's appear more isolated.\n  - Possibly there are more zero-clustered regions or the 2's and 8's are separated more.\n\nHypothesis:\n\n**Output 8 if there exists at least one cluster containing both 8 and 2 cells connected orthogonally (i.e., a connected component containing both 8 and 2). Otherwise output 0.**\n\nSupporting observations:\n- Example 2, 3, 5 (output 8) inputs have 8 and 2 joined in connected groups.\n- Examples 1,4,6 (output 0) seem to lack any cluster that contains both 8 and 2.\n\nLet's implement:\n\n- Find connected components where adjacency is orthogonal (up/down/left/right).\n- For each component, check if it contains color 8 and color 2.\n- If found, output 8.\n- Else output 0.\n\nThis should improve on the previous heuristic and fix the misclassified examples.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    from collections import deque\n\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    visited = [[False]*cols for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    def neighbors(r,c):\n        for nr,nc in [(r-1,c),(r+1,c),(r,c-1),(r,c+1)]:\n            if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                yield nr,nc\n\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if not visited[r][c]:\n                color_set = set()\n                q = deque()\n                q.append((r,c))\n                visited[r][c] = True\n\n                while q:\n                    rr, cc = q.popleft()\n                    color_set.add(grid[rr][cc])\n                    for nr,nc in neighbors(rr,nc):\n                        if not visited[nr][nc] and grid[nr][nc] == grid[rr][cc]:\n                            visited[nr][nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr,nc))\n\n                # After collecting a connected component\n                # Check if this component contains both 8 and 2\n                # The above logic collects cells of same color only, so it cannot find mixed clusters\n                # We need clusters of same colors merged?\n                # Correction: Actually, above clusters are single color only.\n                # We need clusters of all connected cells = connectivity ignoring color?\n                # Or clusters of connected cells with color 8 or 2?\n                # Let's instead find connected components of cells with colors from {2,8} (only these colors),\n                # and so clusters will be mixed with 2 and 8.\n\n    # Fix: redo logic for clusters of 2 or 8 (only these colors), ignoring others.\n\n    visited = [[False]*cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if not visited[r][c] and grid[r][c] in (2,8):\n                q = deque()\n                q.append((r,c))\n                visited[r][c] = True\n                colors_in_cluster = set()\n                while q:\n                    rr, cc = q.popleft()\n                    colors_in_cluster.add(grid[rr][cc])\n                    for nr,nc in neighbors(rr,cc):\n                        if not visited[nr][nc] and grid[nr][nc] in (2,8):\n                            visited[nr][nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr,nc))\n                if 8 in colors_in_cluster and 2 in colors_in_cluster:\n                    return [[8]]\n    # If no cluster contains both 2 and 8, return 0\n    return [[0]]\n```\nThis approach should identify mixed clusters of 2 and 8, solving more training examples correctly."
