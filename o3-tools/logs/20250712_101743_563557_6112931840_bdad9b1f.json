          "Let's analyze the given training examples and deduce the transformation rules.\n\n---\n\n## Analysis of Provided Numeric Grids (First Set)\n\n### Example 1:\nInput snippet that is non-zero:\n- Vertical column of 8's near the right edge (positions: (0,4), (1,4))\n- A horizontal pair of 2's (positions: (2,0), (2,1))\n\nOutput:\n- The vertical 8's column stays mostly in place but extends downward in the 5th column (at rows 3,4,5).\n- The horizontal 2's row expands from just two 2's to a longer horizontal line of 2's in row 2, from position (2,0) to (2,3), then columns 4 and 5 are different color:\n  - At col 4, row 2: a 4 is added\n  - At col 5, row 2: a 2 is added\n- The 8's column from before is extended downward in column 4 (rows 3,4,5) after which the output shows 8's there.\n\n### Example 2:\nInput snippet:\n- Vertical 8's near the left (positions (0,1), (1,1))\n- Horizontal 2's near bottom right (positions (3,4), (3,5))\n\nOutput:\n- The vertical 8's are extended downwards (filled column 1 from row 0 to 5)\n- At row 3, a horizontal line is formed that connects the 2's on right edge (cols 4,5) with 2's and a middle 4 filling leftwards up to col 1.\n- So a horizontal line of 2's and 4 appears at row 3, positions 0 to 5.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe transformation seems to:\n- For each vertical \"bar\" (of color 8 or maybe other colors), extend it downwards to fill the entire column.\n- For each horizontal \"bar\" (color 2), extend it horizontally.\n- Insert a 4 (maybe at intersection or transition points).\n- Extend bars to connect vertical and horizontal lines.\n\n---\n\n## Visual Analysis of the Second Set (images with colored bars)\n\n- Both have a vertical colored bar (blue) and a horizontal one (red)\n- Output introduces a yellow cell at the intersection of these bars\n- Extends the vertical bar fully (all rows)\n- Extends the horizontal bar fully (all columns)\n- Essentially forms a cross with an intersection highlighted in yellow\n\n---\n\n## Hypothesis for Numeric Grids:\n\n- Find the vertical columns with color 8, fill whole column with 8\n- Find horizontal rows with color 2, fill row with 2\n- At intersection of these extended lines, place 4 (some kind of highlight)\n- Also, extend horizontal lines beyond original in presence of vertical bars, and vertical lines beyond original where horizontal bars exist, effectively connecting the bars fully\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Plan:\n\n1. Identify all vertical bars: columns which contain color 8\n2. Identify all horizontal bars: rows which contain color 2\n3. For each such column, fill it entirely with 8\n4. For each such row, fill the whole row with 2\n5. Where vertical and horizontal bars intersect, put 4 instead of 2 or 8\n6. Add the original non-zero parts we find (like extra 2's \u2014 not always needed since the whole rows are filled)\n\n---\n\n## Important:\n\n- Output size always 6x6\n- Keep zeros elsewhere\n\n---\n\n## Note on Test Input:\n\n- Vertical bar of 8's at column 3: positions (0,3), (1,3)\n- Horizontal bar of 2's at bottom left (4,0), (4,1)\n\nOutput:\n- Column 3 will be set to 8 fully\n- Row 4 will be set to 2 fully\n- Intersection (4,3) become 4\n\n---\n\n# Now let's implement this understanding.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize 6x6 output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0]*6 for _ in range(6)]\n\n    # Find vertical bars (columns containing 8)\n    vertical_cols = set()\n    for r in range(6):\n        for c in range(6):\n            if grid[r][c] == 8:\n                vertical_cols.add(c)\n\n    # Find horizontal bars (rows containing 2)\n    horizontal_rows = set()\n    for r in range(6):\n        for c in range(6):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                horizontal_rows.add(r)\n\n    # Fill vertical bars: set entire column to 8\n    for c in vertical_cols:\n        for r in range(6):\n            output[r][c] = 8\n\n    # Fill horizontal bars: set entire row to 2\n    for r in horizontal_rows:\n        for c in range(6):\n            output[r][c] = 2\n\n    # At intersections of vertical and horizontal bars, set 4\n    for r in horizontal_rows:\n        for c in vertical_cols:\n            output[r][c] = 4\n\n    # Also keep original non-zero values not covered by bars (e.g. isolated 2's or 8's)\n    # But our filling already covers these cases\n\n    return output\n```\n"

Identify all vertical bars: columns which contain color 8\n2. Identify all horizontal bars: rows which contain color 2\n3. For each such column, fill it entirely with 8\n4. For each such row, fill the whole row with 2\n5. Where vertical and horizontal bars intersect, put 4 instead of 2 or 8\n6. Add the original non-zero parts we find (like extra 2's \u2014 not always needed since the whole rows are filled)\n\n---\n\n## Important:\n\n- Output size always 6x6\n- Keep zeros elsewhere\n\n---\n\n## Note on Test Input:\n\n- Vertical bar of 8's at column 3: positions (0,3), (1,3)\n- Horizontal bar of 2's at bottom left (4,0), (4,1)\n\nOutput:\n- Column 3 will be set to 8 fully\n- Row 4 will be set to 2 fully\n- Intersection (4,3) become 4\n\n---\n\n# Now let's implement this understanding.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize 6x6 output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0]*6 for _ in range(6)]\n\n    # Find vertical bars (columns containing 8)\n    vertical_cols = set()\n    for r in range(6):\n        for c in range(6):\n            if grid[r][c] == 8:\n                vertical_cols.add(c)\n\n    # Find horizontal bars (rows containing 2)\n    horizontal_rows = set()\n    for r in range(6):\n        for c in range(6):\n            if grid[r][c] == 2:\n                horizontal_rows.add(r)\n\n    # Fill vertical bars: set entire column to 8\n    for c in vertical_cols:\n        for r in range(6):\n            output[r][c] = 8\n\n    # Fill horizontal bars: set entire row to 2\n    for r in horizontal_rows:\n        for c in range(6):\n            output[r][c] = 2\n\n    # At intersections of vertical and horizontal bars, set 4\n    for r in horizontal_rows:\n        for c in vertical_cols:\n            output[r][c] = 4\n\n    # Also keep original non-zero values not covered by bars (e.g. isolated 2's or 8's)\n    # But our filling already covers these cases\n\n    return output\n```\n"
