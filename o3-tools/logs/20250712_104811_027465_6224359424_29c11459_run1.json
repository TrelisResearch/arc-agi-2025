          "Analyzing the training examples and their outputs:\n\n- The grids are 5 rows \u00d7 11 columns, which remain the output size.\n- In both training examples, only one row contains the two colored cells (non-zero values).\n- The output copies that row but replaces the zero cells between the two colored cells with a sequence.\n- The cells between the two non-zero numbers in that row are replaced by a run of the left color's number up to the midpoint column, then a single '5' in the middle cell, and then the right color's number from mid+1 to right boundary.\n- The '5' always appears in column index 5 (0-based counting, middle of 11 columns).\n- The left color fills from the left colored cell's column to column 4 inclusive.\n- The right color fills from column 6 to the right colored cell's column inclusive.\n- All other cells remain zero.\n- The row where this transformation occurs is the one containing the original two colored cells.\n\nExample 1: colors 1 at col 0 and 2 at col 10. Left run 1's: cols 0-4, middle '5' at col 5, right run 2's: cols 6-10, rest 0.\n\nExample 2: colors 3 at col 0 and 7 at col 10 in row 3. Same pattern.\n\nThe test input has two rows with two colored cells at columns 0 and 10. Likely approach:  \n- Find all rows having exactly two colored cells (values != 0) at columns 0 and 10.  \n- For each such row, fill from left cell's column to 4 with left color, put '5' at col 5, fill cols 6 to right cell's col with right color.  \n- Keep other rows all zero.\n\n---\n\nWe will implement this transformation.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows, cols = 5, 11\n    # Initialize output with zeros\n    out = [[0]*cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        # Find nonzero cells in this row\n        nonzeros = [(c, grid[r][c]) for c in range(cols) if grid[r][c] != 0]\n        # Check if there are exactly two nonzero cells and they are at first and last column\n        if len(nonzeros) == 2 and nonzeros[0][0] == 0 and nonzeros[1][0] == cols-1:\n            left_col, left_color = nonzeros[0]\n            right_col, right_color = nonzeros[1]\n            # Set left run from col 0 to col 4 inclusive\n            for c in range(0, 5):\n                out[r][c] = left_color\n            # Set middle cell col 5 to 5\n            out[r][5] = 5\n            # Set right run from col 6 to 10 inclusive\n            for c in range(6, cols):\n                out[r][c] = right_color\n        else:\n            # No matching row, all zeros\n            continue\n            \n    return out\n```"

              "Analyzing the training examples and their outputs:\n\n- The grids are 5 rows \u00d7 11 columns, which remain the output size.\n- In both training examples, only one row contains the two colored cells (non-zero values).\n- The output copies that row but replaces the zero cells between the two colored cells with a sequence.\n- The cells between the two non-zero numbers in that row are replaced by a run of the left color's number up to the midpoint column, then a single '5' in the middle cell, and then the right color's number from mid+1 to right boundary.\n- The '5' always appears in column index 5 (0-based counting, middle of 11 columns).\n- The left color fills from the left colored cell's column to column 4 inclusive.\n- The right color fills from column 6 to the right colored cell's column inclusive.\n- All other cells remain zero.\n- The row where this transformation occurs is the one containing the original two colored cells.\n\nExample 1: colors 1 at col 0 and 2 at col 10. Left run 1's: cols 0-4, middle '5' at col 5, right run 2's: cols 6-10, rest 0.\n\nExample 2: colors 3 at col 0 and 7 at col 10 in row 3. Same pattern.\n\nThe test input has two rows with two colored cells at columns 0 and 10. Likely approach:  \n- Find all rows having exactly two colored cells (values != 0) at columns 0 and 10.  \n- For each such row, fill from left cell's column to 4 with left color, put '5' at col 5, fill cols 6 to right cell's col with right color.  \n- Keep other rows all zero.\n\n---\n\nWe will implement this transformation.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows, cols = 5, 11\n    # Initialize output with zeros\n    out = [[0]*cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        # Find nonzero cells in this row\n        nonzeros = [(c, grid[r][c]) for c in range(cols) if grid[r][c] != 0]\n        # Check if there are exactly two nonzero cells and they are at first and last column\n        if len(nonzeros) == 2 and nonzeros[0][0] == 0 and nonzeros[1][0] == cols-1:\n            left_col, left_color = nonzeros[0]\n            right_col, right_color = nonzeros[1]\n            # Set left run from col 0 to col 4 inclusive\n            for c in range(0, 5):\n                out[r][c] = left_color\n            # Set middle cell col 5 to 5\n            out[r][5] = 5\n            # Set right run from col 6 to 10 inclusive\n            for c in range(6, cols):\n                out[r][c] = right_color\n        else:\n            # No matching row, all zeros\n            continue\n            \n    return out\n```"
