          "Based on the training examples and the test input, the overall pattern appears to be:\n\n- The grids contain colorful symmetrical patterns with intricate geometric arrangements.\n- The common transformation involves extracting the core symmetrical shape, possibly centered, and translating or extending it in some manner.\n- The \"core\" shape, often a diamond or square, is aligned around the center of the grid.\n- The transformation seems to be: \"Identify main shape and colors, preserve their structure while adjusting the placement or filling in some areas\"\n\nSpecifically, observations:\n- The output typically maintains the same colors and shapes within the central region.\n- The shape appears scaled or shifted to be more centered or extended to larger borders.\n- The test input color pattern, being consistent with the previous examples, suggests that the transformation involves a symmetry or centralization, possibly a reflection or translation that preserves the pattern shape and makes it more symmetric or centralized.\n\n**My hypothesis:**  \nThe transformation likely involves:\n- Centering the main pattern in the grid\n- Possibly scaling or extending the pattern to fill the entire 30\u00d730 grid\n- Maintaining the pattern structure and colors, but aligning or normalizing the pattern centered around the middle of the grid\n\n**Implementation outline:**\n- Find the bounding box of the prominent pattern (non-zero or specific colors)\n- Center this pattern inside a blank (zeroed) 30\u00d730 grid\n- Optionally, scale or stretch the pattern to fill more space if necessary\n\nDue to the significant similarity in patterns and the focus on symmetry and centralization, I will implement a \"center and preserve patterns\" transformation.\n\n---\n\n### Code implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier handling\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    size = 30\n\n    # Find non-zero cells \n    coords = np.argwhere(arr != 0)\n    if len(coords) == 0:\n        # No pattern, just return a blank grid of zeros\n        return [[0]*size for _ in range(size)]\n    \n    # Find bounding box of the pattern\n    min_y, min_x = coords.min(axis=0)\n    max_y, max_x = coords.max(axis=0)\n\n    pattern_height = max_y - min_y + 1\n    pattern_width = max_x - min_x + 1\n\n    # Extract the pattern\n    pattern = arr[min_y:max_y+1, min_x:max_x+1]\n\n    # Create a blank 30x30 grid\n    new_grid = np.zeros((size, size), dtype=int)\n\n    # Calculate the center position to place the pattern\n    center_y = size // 2\n    center_x = size // 2\n\n    # Determine the offset to center the pattern\n    start_y = center_y - pattern_height // 2\n    start_x = center_x - pattern_width // 2\n\n    # Place the pattern into the new grid centered\n    new_grid[start_y:start_y+pattern_height, start_x:start_x+pattern_width] = pattern\n\n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return new_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nThis implementation:\n- Finds the core of the pattern in the original grid\n- Centers that pattern within the 30\u00d730 output grid\n- Preserves the pattern's shape and colors\n\nThis approach aligns well with the observed pattern of symmetrical, centered shapes in the training examples.\n\n**Final answer:**\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier handling\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    size = 30\n\n    # Find non-zero cells \n    coords = np.argwhere(arr != 0)\n    if len(coords) == 0:\n        # No pattern, just return a blank grid of zeros\n        return [[0]*size for _ in range(size)]\n    \n    # Find bounding box of the pattern\n    min_y, min_x = coords.min(axis=0)\n    max_y, max_x = coords.max(axis=0)\n\n    pattern_height = max_y - min_y + 1\n    pattern_width = max_x - min_x + 1\n\n    # Extract the pattern\n    pattern = arr[min_y:max_y+1, min_x:max_x+1]\n\n    # Create a blank 30x30 grid\n    new_grid = np.zeros((size, size), dtype=int)\n\n    # Calculate the center position to place the pattern\n    center_y = size // 2\n    center_x = size // 2\n\n    # Determine the offset to center the pattern\n    start_y = center_y - pattern_height // 2\n    start_x = center_x - pattern_width // 2\n\n    # Place the pattern into the new grid centered\n    new_grid[start_y:start_y+pattern_height, start_x:start_x+pattern_width] = pattern\n\n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return new_grid.tolist()\n```"

              "Based on the training examples and the test input, the overall pattern appears to be:\n\n- The grids contain colorful symmetrical patterns with intricate geometric arrangements.\n- The common transformation involves extracting the core symmetrical shape, possibly centered, and translating or extending it in some manner.\n- The \"core\" shape, often a diamond or square, is aligned around the center of the grid.\n- The transformation seems to be: \"Identify main shape and colors, preserve their structure while adjusting the placement or filling in some areas\"\n\nSpecifically, observations:\n- The output typically maintains the same colors and shapes within the central region.\n- The shape appears scaled or shifted to be more centered or extended to larger borders.\n- The test input color pattern, being consistent with the previous examples, suggests that the transformation involves a symmetry or centralization, possibly a reflection or translation that preserves the pattern shape and makes it more symmetric or centralized.\n\n**My hypothesis:**  \nThe transformation likely involves:\n- Centering the main pattern in the grid\n- Possibly scaling or extending the pattern to fill the entire 30\u00d730 grid\n- Maintaining the pattern structure and colors, but aligning or normalizing the pattern centered around the middle of the grid\n\n**Implementation outline:**\n- Find the bounding box of the prominent pattern (non-zero or specific colors)\n- Center this pattern inside a blank (zeroed) 30\u00d730 grid\n- Optionally, scale or stretch the pattern to fill more space if necessary\n\nDue to the significant similarity in patterns and the focus on symmetry and centralization, I will implement a \"center and preserve patterns\" transformation.\n\n---\n\n### Code implementation:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier handling\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    size = 30\n\n    # Find non-zero cells \n    coords = np.argwhere(arr != 0)\n    if len(coords) == 0:\n        # No pattern, just return a blank grid of zeros\n        return [[0]*size for _ in range(size)]\n    \n    # Find bounding box of the pattern\n    min_y, min_x = coords.min(axis=0)\n    max_y, max_x = coords.max(axis=0)\n\n    pattern_height = max_y - min_y + 1\n    pattern_width = max_x - min_x + 1\n\n    # Extract the pattern\n    pattern = arr[min_y:max_y+1, min_x:max_x+1]\n\n    # Create a blank 30x30 grid\n    new_grid = np.zeros((size, size), dtype=int)\n\n    # Calculate the center position to place the pattern\n    center_y = size // 2\n    center_x = size // 2\n\n    # Determine the offset to center the pattern\n    start_y = center_y - pattern_height // 2\n    start_x = center_x - pattern_width // 2\n\n    # Place the pattern into the new grid centered\n    new_grid[start_y:start_y+pattern_height, start_x:start_x+pattern_width] = pattern\n\n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return new_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nThis implementation:\n- Finds the core of the pattern in the original grid\n- Centers that pattern within the 30\u00d730 output grid\n- Preserves the pattern's shape and colors\n\nThis approach aligns well with the observed pattern of symmetrical, centered shapes in the training examples.\n\n**Final answer:**\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier handling\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    size = 30\n\n    # Find non-zero cells \n    coords = np.argwhere(arr != 0)\n    if len(coords) == 0:\n        # No pattern, just return a blank grid of zeros\n        return [[0]*size for _ in range(size)]\n    \n    # Find bounding box of the pattern\n    min_y, min_x = coords.min(axis=0)\n    max_y, max_x = coords.max(axis=0)\n\n    pattern_height = max_y - min_y + 1\n    pattern_width = max_x - min_x + 1\n\n    # Extract the pattern\n    pattern = arr[min_y:max_y+1, min_x:max_x+1]\n\n    # Create a blank 30x30 grid\n    new_grid = np.zeros((size, size), dtype=int)\n\n    # Calculate the center position to place the pattern\n    center_y = size // 2\n    center_x = size // 2\n\n    # Determine the offset to center the pattern\n    start_y = center_y - pattern_height // 2\n    start_x = center_x - pattern_width // 2\n\n    # Place the pattern into the new grid centered\n    new_grid[start_y:start_y+pattern_height, start_x:start_x+pattern_width] = pattern\n\n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return new_grid.tolist()\n```"
