          "Let's analyze the transformation patterns:\n\n## Observations\n\n- **Input** grids contain:\n  - Single colored cells scattered across the grid (various colors).\n  - (Optional) One or more \"block\" structures, each a 3x3 shape with the same color and a hole in the center.\n- **Output** grids have:\n  - The original single colored cells unchanged.\n  - At each single cell's row/column (depending on the example) NOT already part of a 3x3 block, a new 3x3 \"block\" of the same color is placed.\n  - The placement of blocks happens at a fixed offset in a particular direction from the cell, depending on the grid orientation:\n    - In Example 1: The single cells are at the top row, blocks appear below them in fixed positions (filling across the row per color).\n    - In Example 2: Single cells run down the leftmost column and blocks are placed to the right of each single cell, with the same color.\n    - Example 3 is a vertical version; single cells are on the left, new blocks are placed to the right.\n  - In all training cases, the 3x3 blocks surround the original cell's location (centered at that offset) and are the same color.\n\n- **Rule deduction**:\n  - For each single colored cell, a corresponding 3x3 \"block\" is drawn at a specific offset, matching the single cell's color.\n  - If a block already exists at the target position, it is NOT duplicated.\n- The size of all outputs is always 16x22, regardless of input.\n\n## Hypothesis of the pattern\n\nFor each single colored cell:\n- Draw a 3x3 block around an offset from its position (either below, right, or both, depending on orientation, but always consistent per example).\n- Do so for *every* colored cell (except zeros).\n- If some blocks already exist in the input, preserve them.\n  \nIt appears that:\n- The blocks form rows or columns of the same color, matching the orientation of the single cell \u201cclues\u201d.\n\nFor simplicity, let's reverse-engineer how the new positions are determined:\n\n**Training Example 1 (horizontal clues):**\n- Single colored cells at row 1. \n- Their blocks appear in a row further down, in the same columns as each colored clue, but all in the same row, i.e., all blocks at row 9 (suggesting a fixed offset). The blocks for each colored cell fill rows 9, 10, 11 for row 1 clues.\n\n**Training Example 2 (vertical clues):**\n- Single colored cells along column 1.\n- Their blocks appear further right (columns 9, 10, 11), vertically aligned with original clue at same row.\n\n**Training Example 3 (single clues in column):**\n- Same as above, but blocks are offset to the right.\n\nOverall: Each single colored cell gets \"expanded\" into a 3x3 block farther into the grid at fixed offsets, all in alignment.\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- Create a blank 16x22 output grid.\n- Copy all input grid nonzero cells into output.\n- For each nonzero, non-block cell in the input, add a corresponding 3x3 block of their color in the output, at the right place:\n    - Identify the \"clue row\" or \"clue column\" (where there are nonzero cells).\n    - For each, compute where the block should be placed (by mapping training input-output).\n- If there is already a block present, do not duplicate.\n\n**Specifics inferred from training:**\n\n- If single colored clues appear in the topmost row (as in Example 1), their 3x3 blocks are placed on a fixed row below, at fixed offset. (rows 9-11).\n- If single colored clues appear in the leftmost column (as in Example 2), blocks are placed at right at a fixed offset (cols 9-11).\n- In all cases, each colored cell expands to a block of its color at that canonical offset. \n\nWe can generalize as:\n- For clues in row 0, blocks appear with center at row 10.\n- For clues in col 0, blocks appear with center at col 10.\n- Otherwise, in case of mixed location of clues, use the \"orientation\" that maximizes the number of clues (row or column) and follow mapping accordingly.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Ensure output is 16x22\n    OUT_H, OUT_W = 16, 22\n    input_np = np.array(grid)\n    in_h, in_w = input_np.shape\n    \n    output = np.zeros((OUT_H, OUT_W), dtype=int)\n    # Copy input into its position in output\n    output[:in_h, :in_w] = input_np\n\n    # Find clue positions (single colored cells that aren't part of a 3x3 block)\n    # Let's treat any colored cell as a \"clue\" if it is not in the center of a 3x3 block of the same color\n    # But as seen in the training, single clues are always in a top row or leftmost column, so we check both\n\n    positions = []\n    for r in range(in_h):\n        for c in range(in_w):\n            v = input_np[r, c]\n            if v == 0:\n                continue\n            # Ignore cell if it's part of a 3x3 filled block centered at (r,c)\n            is_block = False\n            if r-1 >= 0 and r+1 < in_h and c-1 >= 0 and c+1 < in_w:\n                neighborhood = input_np[r-1:r+2, c-1:c+2]\n                if np.all((neighborhood == v) | (neighborhood == 0)):\n                    nonzero_count = np.count_nonzero(neighborhood == v)\n                    if nonzero_count >= 5:  # Block is made mostly of the color (hole in center allowed)\n                        # It's a block, as in training examples -- don't treat as clue\n                        is_block = True\n            if not is_block:\n                positions.append((r, c, v))\n\n    # Count if clues are mostly on row 0 or column 0 to decide orientation\n    row0_clues = [p for p in positions if p[0] == 0]\n    col0_clues = [p for p in positions if p[1] == 0]\n\n    # Mapping clues to block positions\n    if len(row0_clues) >= len(col0_clues):  # Clues are on top row; blocks will go to fixed row below\n        # For row 0 clues, map (0, c) to block at (rows 9..11, centered at row 10, same column)\n        block_row_center = 10\n        for (r, c, v) in positions:\n            # Only process clues in row 0\n            if r != 0:\n                continue\n            # Place 3x3 block centered at (block_row_center, c)\n            for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    rr = block_row_center + dr\n                    cc = c + dc\n                    if 0 <= rr < OUT_H and 0 <= cc < OUT_W:\n                        output[rr, cc] = v\n    else:\n        # For column 0 clues, map (r, 0) to block at (same row, cols 9..11)\n        block_col_center = 10\n        for (r, c, v) in positions:\n            if c != 0:\n                continue\n            for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    rr = r + dr\n                    cc = block_col_center + dc\n                    if 0 <= rr < OUT_H and 0 <= cc < OUT_W:\n                        output[rr, cc] = v\n\n    # Return as Python list of lists\n    return output.tolist()\n```"

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 16\u00d722 output grid.**\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0

patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

          "Let's analyze the transformation patterns:\n\n## Observations\n\n- **Input** grids contain:\n  - Single colored cells scattered across the grid (various colors).\n  - (Optional) One or more \"block\" structures, each a 3x3 shape with the same color and a hole in the center.\n- **Output** grids have:\n  - The original single colored cells unchanged.\n  - At each single cell's row/column (depending on the example) NOT already part of a 3x3 block, a new 3x3 \"block\" of the same color is placed.\n  - The placement of blocks happens at a fixed offset in a particular direction from the cell, depending on the grid orientation:\n    - In Example 1: The single cells are at the top row, blocks appear below them in fixed positions (filling across the row per color).\n    - In Example 2: Single cells run down the leftmost column and blocks are placed to the right of each single cell, with the same color.\n    - Example 3 is a vertical version; single cells are on the left, new blocks are placed to the right.\n  - In all training cases, the 3x3 blocks surround the original cell's location (centered at that offset) and are the same color.\n\n- **Rule deduction**:\n  - For each single colored cell, a corresponding 3x3 \"block\" is drawn at a specific offset, matching the single cell's color.\n  - If a block already exists at the target position, it is NOT duplicated.\n- The size of all outputs is always 16x22, regardless of input.\n\n## Hypothesis of the pattern\n\nFor each single colored cell:\n- Draw a 3x3 block around an offset from its position (either below, right, or both, depending on orientation, but always consistent per example).\n- Do so for *every* colored cell (except zeros).\n- If some blocks already exist in the input, preserve them.\n  \nIt appears that:\n- The blocks form rows or columns of the same color, matching the orientation of the single cell \u201cclues\u201d.\n\nFor simplicity, let's reverse-engineer how the new positions are determined:\n\n**Training Example 1 (horizontal clues):**\n- Single colored cells at row 1. \n- Their blocks appear in a row further down, in the same columns as each colored clue, but all in the same row, i.e., all blocks at row 9 (suggesting a fixed offset). The blocks for each colored cell fill rows 9, 10, 11 for row 1 clues.\n\n**Training Example 2 (vertical clues):**\n- Single colored cells along column 1.\n- Their blocks appear further right (columns 9, 10, 11), vertically aligned with original clue at same row.\n\n**Training Example 3 (single clues in column):**\n- Same as above, but blocks are offset to the right.\n\nOverall: Each single colored cell gets \"expanded\" into a 3x3 block farther into the grid at fixed offsets, all in alignment.\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- Create a blank 16x22 output grid.\n- Copy all input grid nonzero cells into output.\n- For each nonzero, non-block cell in the input, add a corresponding 3x3 block of their color in the output, at the right place:\n    - Identify the \"clue row\" or \"clue column\" (where there are nonzero cells).\n    - For each, compute where the block should be placed (by mapping training input-output).\n- If there is already a block present, do not duplicate.\n\n**Specifics inferred from training:**\n\n- If single colored clues appear in the topmost row (as in Example 1), their 3x3 blocks are placed on a fixed row below, at fixed offset. (rows 9-11).\n- If single colored clues appear in the leftmost column (as in Example 2), blocks are placed at right at a fixed offset (cols 9-11).\n- In all cases, each colored cell expands to a block of its color at that canonical offset. \n\nWe can generalize as:\n- For clues in row 0, blocks appear with center at row 10.\n- For clues in col 0, blocks appear with center at col 10.\n- Otherwise, in case of mixed location of clues, use the \"orientation\" that maximizes the number of clues (row or column) and follow mapping accordingly.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Ensure output is 16x22\n    OUT_H, OUT_W = 16, 22\n    input_np = np.array(grid)\n    in_h, in_w = input_np.shape\n    \n    output = np.zeros((OUT_H, OUT_W), dtype=int)\n    # Copy input into its position in output\n    output[:in_h, :in_w] = input_np\n\n    # Find clue positions (single colored cells that aren't part of a 3x3 block)\n    # Let's treat any colored cell as a \"clue\" if it is not in the center of a 3x3 block of the same color\n    # But as seen in the training, single clues are always in a top row or leftmost column, so we check both\n\n    positions = []\n    for r in range(in_h):\n        for c in range(in_w):\n            v = input_np[r, c]\n            if v == 0:\n                continue\n            # Ignore cell if it's part of a 3x3 filled block centered at (r,c)\n            is_block = False\n            if r-1 >= 0 and r+1 < in_h and c-1 >= 0 and c+1 < in_w:\n                neighborhood = input_np[r-1:r+2, c-1:c+2]\n                if np.all((neighborhood == v) | (neighborhood == 0)):\n                    nonzero_count = np.count_nonzero(neighborhood == v)\n                    if nonzero_count >= 5:  # Block is made mostly of the color (hole in center allowed)\n                        # It's a block, as in training examples -- don't treat as clue\n                        is_block = True\n            if not is_block:\n                positions.append((r, c, v))\n\n    # Count if clues are mostly on row 0 or column 0 to decide orientation\n    row0_clues = [p for p in positions if p[0] == 0]\n    col0_clues = [p for p in positions if p[1] == 0]\n\n    # Mapping clues to block positions\n    if len(row0_clues) >= len(col0_clues):  # Clues are on top row; blocks will go to fixed row below\n        # For row 0 clues, map (0, c) to block at (rows 9..11, centered at row 10, same column)\n        block_row_center = 10\n        for (r, c, v) in positions:\n            # Only process clues in row 0\n            if r != 0:\n                continue\n            # Place 3x3 block centered at (block_row_center, c)\n            for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    rr = block_row_center + dr\n                    cc = c + dc\n                    if 0 <= rr < OUT_H and 0 <= cc < OUT_W:\n                        output[rr, cc] = v\n    else:\n        # For column 0 clues, map (r, 0) to block at (same row, cols 9..11)\n        block_col_center = 10\n        for (r, c, v) in positions:\n            if c != 0:\n                continue\n            for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    rr = r + dr\n                    cc = block_col_center + dc\n                    if 0 <= rr < OUT_H and 0 <= cc < OUT_W:\n                        output[rr, cc] = v\n\n    # Return as Python list of lists\n    return output.tolist()\n```"

              "Let's analyze the transformation patterns:\n\n## Observations\n\n- **Input** grids contain:\n  - Single colored cells scattered across the grid (various colors).\n  - (Optional) One or more \"block\" structures, each a 3x3 shape with the same color and a hole in the center.\n- **Output** grids have:\n  - The original single colored cells unchanged.\n  - At each single cell's row/column (depending on the example) NOT already part of a 3x3 block, a new 3x3 \"block\" of the same color is placed.\n  - The placement of blocks happens at a fixed offset in a particular direction from the cell, depending on the grid orientation:\n    - In Example 1: The single cells are at the top row, blocks appear below them in fixed positions (filling across the row per color).\n    - In Example 2: Single cells run down the leftmost column and blocks are placed to the right of each single cell, with the same color.\n    - Example 3 is a vertical version; single cells are on the left, new blocks are placed to the right.\n  - In all training cases, the 3x3 blocks surround the original cell's location (centered at that offset) and are the same color.\n\n- **Rule deduction**:\n  - For each single colored cell, a corresponding 3x3 \"block\" is drawn at a specific offset, matching the single cell's color.\n  - If a block already exists at the target position, it is NOT duplicated.\n- The size of all outputs is always 16x22, regardless of input.\n\n## Hypothesis of the pattern\n\nFor each single colored cell:\n- Draw a 3x3 block around an offset from its position (either below, right, or both, depending on orientation, but always consistent per example).\n- Do so for *every* colored cell (except zeros).\n- If some blocks already exist in the input, preserve them.\n  \nIt appears that:\n- The blocks form rows or columns of the same color, matching the orientation of the single cell \u201cclues\u201d.\n\nFor simplicity, let's reverse-engineer how the new positions are determined:\n\n**Training Example 1 (horizontal clues):**\n- Single colored cells at row 1. \n- Their blocks appear in a row further down, in the same columns as each colored clue, but all in the same row, i.e., all blocks at row 9 (suggesting a fixed offset). The blocks for each colored cell fill rows 9, 10, 11 for row 1 clues.\n\n**Training Example 2 (vertical clues):**\n- Single colored cells along column 1.\n- Their blocks appear further right (columns 9, 10, 11), vertically aligned with original clue at same row.\n\n**Training Example 3 (single clues in column):**\n- Same as above, but blocks are offset to the right.\n\nOverall: Each single colored cell gets \"expanded\" into a 3x3 block farther into the grid at fixed offsets, all in alignment.\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- Create a blank 16x22 output grid.\n- Copy all input grid nonzero cells into output.\n- For each nonzero, non-block cell in the input, add a corresponding 3x3 block of their color in the output, at the right place:\n    - Identify the \"clue row\" or \"clue column\" (where there are nonzero cells).\n    - For each, compute where the block should be placed (by mapping training input-output).\n- If there is already a block present, do not duplicate.\n\n**Specifics inferred from training:**\n\n- If single colored clues appear in the topmost row (as in Example 1), their 3x3 blocks are placed on a fixed row below, at fixed offset. (rows 9-11).\n- If single colored clues appear in the leftmost column (as in Example 2), blocks are placed at right at a fixed offset (cols 9-11).\n- In all cases, each colored cell expands to a block of its color at that canonical offset. \n\nWe can generalize as:\n- For clues in row 0, blocks appear with center at row 10.\n- For clues in col 0, blocks appear with center at col 10.\n- Otherwise, in case of mixed location of clues, use the \"orientation\" that maximizes the number of clues (row or column) and follow mapping accordingly.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Ensure output is 16x22\n    OUT_H, OUT_W = 16, 22\n    input_np = np.array(grid)\n    in_h, in_w = input_np.shape\n    \n    output = np.zeros((OUT_H, OUT_W), dtype=int)\n    # Copy input into its position in output\n    output[:in_h, :in_w] = input_np\n\n    # Find clue positions (single colored cells that aren't part of a 3x3 block)\n    # Let's treat any colored cell as a \"clue\" if it is not in the center of a 3x3 block of the same color\n    # But as seen in the training, single clues are always in a top row or leftmost column, so we check both\n\n    positions = []\n    for r in range(in_h):\n        for c in range(in_w):\n            v = input_np[r, c]\n            if v == 0:\n                continue\n            # Ignore cell if it's part of a 3x3 filled block centered at (r,c)\n            is_block = False\n            if r-1 >= 0 and r+1 < in_h and c-1 >= 0 and c+1 < in_w:\n                neighborhood = input_np[r-1:r+2, c-1:c+2]\n                if np.all((neighborhood == v) | (neighborhood == 0)):\n                    nonzero_count = np.count_nonzero(neighborhood == v)\n                    if nonzero_count >= 5:  # Block is made mostly of the color (hole in center allowed)\n                        # It's a block, as in training examples -- don't treat as clue\n                        is_block = True\n            if not is_block:\n                positions.append((r, c, v))\n\n    # Count if clues are mostly on row 0 or column 0 to decide orientation\n    row0_clues = [p for p in positions if p[0] == 0]\n    col0_clues = [p for p in positions if p[1] == 0]\n\n    # Mapping clues to block positions\n    if len(row0_clues) >= len(col0_clues):  # Clues are on top row; blocks will go to fixed row below\n        # For row 0 clues, map (0, c) to block at (rows 9..11, centered at row 10, same column)\n        block_row_center = 10\n        for (r, c, v) in positions:\n            # Only process clues in row 0\n            if r != 0:\n                continue\n            # Place 3x3 block centered at (block_row_center, c)\n            for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    rr = block_row_center + dr\n                    cc = c + dc\n                    if 0 <= rr < OUT_H and 0 <= cc < OUT_W:\n                        output[rr, cc] = v\n    else:\n        # For column 0 clues, map (r, 0) to block at (same row, cols 9..11)\n        block_col_center = 10\n        for (r, c, v) in positions:\n            if c != 0:\n                continue\n            for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    rr = r + dr\n                    cc = block_col_center + dc\n                    if 0 <= rr < OUT_H and 0 <= cc < OUT_W:\n                        output[rr, cc] = v\n\n    # Return as Python list of lists\n    return output.tolist()\n```"
