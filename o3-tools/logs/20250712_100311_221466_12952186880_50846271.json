          "Based on the analysis of the training examples and the pattern observed in the transformations, the key features include:\n\n- The central focus on specific regions around the middle of the grid, often with a small cluster of color (notably `5`) and shapes (`2`, `8`) appearing near the core.\n- The transformations tend to emphasize adding a blue (value `8`) around certain features, often centered or nearby the existing features.\n- The overall transformation appears to be a \"layering\" or \"highlighting\" process that adds blue (`8`) in the vicinity of the existing key shapes, especially around the new center or key points.\n- The output grids seem to have the same overall dimension (20\u00d722) with some regions highlighted, especially with the introduction or expansion of blue (`8`), perhaps emphasizing objects or connections.\n\nGiven this understanding, I hypothesize the main transformation involves:\n- Identifying the positions of the significant features (such as `5`, `2`, `8`) in the input\n- Adding or expanding the blue (`8`) around these features, especially near the core or connectors\n- Keeping the background black (`0`) and other regions unaltered except for introducing or emphasizing the blue color in regions where features are located or connected.\n\nThe current implementation will attempt:\n- To create a layer of `8` around existing non-zero features to mimic the expansion seen in the examples\n- To preserve the overall size (20\u00d722)\n- To focus on the key features (`5`, `2`, `8`) when making modifications\n\nHere's an implementation of that hypothesis:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Ensure grid is numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # Create a copy for output\n    output = grid.copy()\n\n    # Find positions of features of interest\n    feature_positions = np.argwhere((grid == 2) | (grid == 5) | (grid == 8))\n    \n    # For each feature, add blue (8) to nearby cells\n    for r, c in feature_positions:\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                    # Expand blue around feature if not already\n                    output[nr, nc] = 8\n    \n    # Keep other features like 5 and 2 as is or highlight around them\n    # (alternatively, just the expansion suffices)\n\n    # Output grid shape is maintained\n    return output.tolist()\n```\n\nThis approach emphasizes the addition of a blue layer (`8`) around existing features, mimicking the observed pattern of annotations or highlights in the trained examples.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    # Ensure grid is numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # Create a copy for output\n    output = grid.copy()\n\n    # Find positions of features of interest\n    feature_positions = np.argwhere((grid == 2) | (grid == 5) | (grid == 8))\n    \n    # For each feature, add blue (8) to nearby cells\n    for r, c in feature_positions:\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                    # Expand blue around feature if not already\n                    output[nr, nc] = 8\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list\n    return output.tolist()\n```"

              "Based on the analysis of the training examples and the pattern observed in the transformations, the key features include:\n\n- The central focus on specific regions around the middle of the grid, often with a small cluster of color (notably `5`) and shapes (`2`, `8`) appearing near the core.\n- The transformations tend to emphasize adding a blue (value `8`) around certain features, often centered or nearby the existing features.\n- The overall transformation appears to be a \"layering\" or \"highlighting\" process that adds blue (`8`) in the vicinity of the existing key shapes, especially around the new center or key points.\n- The output grids seem to have the same overall dimension (20\u00d722) with some regions highlighted, especially with the introduction or expansion of blue (`8`), perhaps emphasizing objects or connections.\n\nGiven this understanding, I hypothesize the main transformation involves:\n- Identifying the positions of the significant features (such as `5`, `2`, `8`) in the input\n- Adding or expanding the blue (`8`) around these features, especially near the core or connectors\n- Keeping the background black (`0`) and other regions unaltered except for introducing or emphasizing the blue color in regions where features are located or connected.\n\nThe current implementation will attempt:\n- To create a layer of `8` around existing non-zero features to mimic the expansion seen in the examples\n- To preserve the overall size (20\u00d722)\n- To focus on the key features (`5`, `2`, `8`) when making modifications\n\nHere's an implementation of that hypothesis:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Ensure grid is numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # Create a copy for output\n    output = grid.copy()\n\n    # Find positions of features of interest\n    feature_positions = np.argwhere((grid == 2) | (grid == 5) | (grid == 8))\n    \n    # For each feature, add blue (8) to nearby cells\n    for r, c in feature_positions:\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                    # Expand blue around feature if not already\n                    output[nr, nc] = 8\n    \n    # Keep other features like 5 and 2 as is or highlight around them\n    # (alternatively, just the expansion suffices)\n\n    # Output grid shape is maintained\n    return output.tolist()\n```\n\nThis approach emphasizes the addition of a blue layer (`8`) around existing features, mimicking the observed pattern of annotations or highlights in the trained examples.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    # Ensure grid is numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # Create a copy for output\n    output = grid.copy()\n\n    # Find positions of features of interest\n    feature_positions = np.argwhere((grid == 2) | (grid == 5) | (grid == 8))\n    \n    # For each feature, add blue (8) to nearby cells\n    for r, c in feature_positions:\n        for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if 0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols:\n                    # Expand blue around feature if not already\n                    output[nr, nc] = 8\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list\n    return output.tolist()\n```"
