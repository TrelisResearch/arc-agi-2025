Colored cells left aligned.\n- The color in the output triangle matches the color of the leftmost colored cell in the input.\n- Rest of output cells are black (0).\n- Output height fixed to 3 rows, width fixed to 6 columns.\n- If input colored length < 3, the triangle will have some rows with zero width of colored cells.\n\nFrom these observations:\n\n- The output is always a 3x6 grid.\n- The leftmost color in the input row defines the color to fill.\n- The number of colored cells in input (left side) determines the triangle size.\n- The triangle is constructed as:\n  Row 0: n colored cells\n  Row 1: n-1 colored cells (if >=0)\n  Row 2: n-2 colored cells (if >=0)\n- Then rest cells in the row are black (0).\n- For columns beyond n, the output is black for all rows.\n\nImplementing these steps should reproduce the outputs as presented.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # fixed output size\n    rows, cols = 3, 6\n    output = [[0]*cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    \n    # Find the first colored cell (non-zero color) and its color\n    # Also find number of colored cells (non-zero) at the start of the input row\n    input_row = grid[0]\n    color = None\n    length = 0\n    for val in input_row:\n        if val != 0:\n            if color is None:\n                color = val\n            length += 1\n        else:\n            break\n    \n    if color is None:\n        # No color found, output all zero grid\n        return output\n    \n    # Construct triangle with heights 3 and widths length, length-1, length-2 (>=0)\n    for r in range(rows):\n        width = length - r\n        if width <= 0:\n            continue\n        for c in range(width):\n            output[r][c] = color\n    \n    return output\n```"

              "Let's analyze the patterns in the training examples:\n\n- Each input is a 1x6 grid.\n- The leftmost cells have a colored value (e.g., blue, red, gray, light blue, orange).\n- The remaining cells in the input row are black (likely 0).\n- The output is always a 3x6 grid.\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n- The colored blocks appear in the upper-left corner of the output grid.\n- They form a right-angled triangle or staircase shape made of the input's colored value.\n- The size of the block is related to the horizontal position of the colored cell in the input.\n- Black cells fill the remaining output grid.\n\nSpecifically:\n- The number of colored squares in each row of the output decreases from top to bottom.\n- The triangle shape in the output has a height and base of 3 rows and 6 columns (as output is always 3x6).\n- The size of the colored triangle corresponds to the position of the colored cell in the input:\n    - The triangle spans rows 0 to 2 (top 3 rows).\n    - The colored cells in output fill a triangle that extends horizontally upto the colored cell's position + 1 row down (form a stair-step pattern).\n- The color of the output block equals the color of the colored input cell.\n\nThus, the best interpretation is:\n- Find the position `p` of the first colored cell (non-black) in the input row.\n- Produce a 3x6 grid:\n  - For row r in 0 to 2\n    - Fill cells from 0 to p - r with the colored value (if `p-r>=0`)\n  - All other cells are black (0).\n\nIf `p-r` is less than 0, no colored cell is placed for that row.\n\nThis matches the triangle pattern seen. For example, in Input 1:\n- colored cell at pos 0,\n- output row 0: cols 0 to 0 (1 cell) colored,\n- row 1: cols 0 to -1 no cells,\n- row 2: none.\nBut the example shows a 3x6 grid where colored cells fill more places, so let's carefully check the example 1 again:\n\nWait, Input 1 has the first colored cell at position 0 (blue), rest black.\n\nOutput 1 shows blue cells filling the first 3 rows and first 3 columns; others black.\n\nWait, so more accurate observation:\n\nIt looks like the colored block extends over rows 0 to 2 and columns 0 to p+2 (3 columns colored). It forms a right-angled triangle with bottom row fully colored to p+2, top rows decreasing columns.\n\nRe-examining example 1: input with blue at position 0 \u2192 output blue occupies a 3x3 triangle on the top-left.\n\nSimilarly, input 2: red at position 0 \u2192 same 3x3 triangle at top-left.\n\nInput 3: gray at pos 0 \u2192 same 3x3 triangle at top-left.\n\nInput 4: light blue at pos 2 \u2192 output triangle at top-left with colored block covering cols 0 to 4 (5 columns wide)\n\nInput 5: orange pos 0 \u2192 3x3 triangle top-left.\n\nSo Input 4 is special: the colored cell is at pos 2, so output extends triangle up to col 4; why col 4? Possibly positions in output expand two columns beyond input colored cell position.\n\nLet's formulate this precisely:\n\n- For input with colored cell at position p\n- The output grid is 3x6\n\n- The colored triangle occupies columns from 0 to 2+p (capped at column 5)\n- The triangle is a stair-step shape that in row r fills columns from 0 to (2 + p) - r\n\n- Cells beyond that are black.\n\nExample input 4: p=2 \u2192 columns 0 to 4 inclusive (five columns), triangle shape:\n\nRow 0: col 0 to 4 (5 cells)\nRow 1: col 0 to 3 (4 cells)\nRow 2: col 0 to 2 (3 cells)\n\nThe number of colored cells per row is largest at top row, decreasing by 1 each next row - forming a right triangle.\n\nThis matches the output.\n\nIf p=0, then 2+p=2 \u2192 3 columns triangle (cols 0 to 2) consistent with examples 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\nNote: Output side length of the triangle base column length = 3 + p if we fix 3 rows.\n\nThis aligns with the outputs.\n\nConclusion:\n\n- Identify `p` as position of the first non-zero color cell (non-black).\n- The \"triangle base\" column count = 3 + p, but maximum columns is 6, clamp accordingly.\n- For each row r in 0..2:\n    - Fill columns from 0 to base_col_count - r - 1 with the input color at `p`.\n- Others black (0).\n\nImplement this logic now.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # grid: 1x6 input grid (list of lists)\n    # output: 3x6 grid with colored triangle top-left\n    \n    # Find the position and color of first colored cell (non-zero)\n    row = 0\n    p = None\n    color = 0\n    for c in range(len(grid[0])):\n        if grid[row][c] != 0:\n            p = c\n            color = grid[row][c]\n            break\n    if p is None:\n        # No colored cell, return 3x6 black grid\n        return [[0]*6 for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Determine base of triangle columns (3 + p), capped at 6\n    base_width = min(3 + p, 6)\n    \n    output = []\n    for r in range(3):\n        row_out = []\n        for c in range(6):\n            # Fill colored color if col <= base_width - r -1\n            if c <= base_width - r - 1:\n                row_out.append(color)\n            else:\n                row_out.append(0)\n        output.append(row_out)\n    \n    return output\n```\n"

              "Observations from training examples:\n\n- All input grids are 1 row by 6 columns.\n- The leftmost cell has a color/value different from black (which is presumably 0).\n- The right cells are mostly black (0).\n- Output grids are always 3 rows by 6 columns.\n- Output grids show a triangle (or a right triangle) of the color from the leftmost cell of the input on a black background.\n- The triangle always starts in the top-left, filling the left color in a triangle shape.\n- The triangle \"height\" corresponds roughly to 3 rows.\n- The triangle grows from left to right column-wise and rows such that at column c, rows from 0 up to (2 - c + col) are filled with the input color. Visually, the triangle appears as a block of color cells on the top-left corner and black cells elsewhere.\n\nConcretely:\n- In output, for column c in [0..5], the rows filled with the color go from 0 up to row index (2 - c+ start index?), but since max rows is 3, that translates roughly to a triangle fully filling a 3x6 grid.\n- Simplifying, the triangle shape can be made by filling rows where row + col < 3 (the triangle condition).\n- The non-black color is the one seen in the leftmost cell of input.\n\nPlan for implementation:\n\n- Extract leftmost color from input[0][0]\n- Set output grid 3x6\n- For each cell in output, if row + col < 3, fill with left color, else 0 (black)\n- Return output grid\n\nThis matches all given training examples.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The output grid size is fixed 3x6\n    n_rows, n_cols = 3, 6\n    \n    # Leftmost color (non-black)\n    left_color = grid[0][0]\n    \n    transformed_grid = []\n    for r in range(n_rows):\n        row = []\n        for c in range(n_cols):\n            if r + c < n_rows:\n                row.append(left_color)\n            else:\n                row.append(0)  # black background\n        transformed_grid.append(row)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```"
