          "Let's analyze the examples carefully:\n\n- Input grids are always 3x2.\n- Output grids are always 9x4.\n- From the examples and visual clues:\n  - The output seems to be a vertically repeated pattern built by taking each row of the input and horizontally replicating or mirroring the 2 columns into a 4-column row.\n  - Then the 3 rows (from input) are repeated vertically 3 times, so 3 rows * 3 repeats = 9 rows.\n  - Each input row (2 cols) is expanded horizontally into 4 columns.\n  \nLooking at example 1:\nInput:\n```\n0 8\n0 0\n0 8\n```\nOutput first row:\n```\n8 0 0 8\n```\nWait, the output row 0 is not an exact horizontal replication of input row 0 (0 8). It seems swapped/mirrored or rearranged or somehow symmetric.\n\nSimilarly, the output rows in example 1 contain mostly the same values 0 and 8 arranged in a symmetric pattern.\n\nLook at output row 0: 8 0 0 8 <-- looks like reverse of input row 0 and its mirror:\nInput row 0: [0,8]\nOutput row 0: [8,0,0,8]\n\nInterpretation:\nOutput row = reverse(input_row) + input_row\n\nLikewise output row 1: [0,0,0,0] which is zeros, perhaps corresponds to input row 1: [0,0]\n\nOutput row 2: same as output row 0 or similar.\n\nFrom training 2:\nInput:\n2 0  \n2 2  \n2 0  \n\nOutput top row:\n0 2 2 0\n\nInput row 0: 2 0  \nOutput row 0: 0 2 2 0 <-- looks reverse + input_row again.\n\nSimilarly output rows have this pattern.\n\nTraining 3:\nInput row 0: 0 0  \nOutput row 0: 0 5 5 0 -- not straightforward reverse+input analogy here, here some colors appear not present in input row 0.\n\nBut they do appear in input, input has 0 0 / 0 5 / 5 0\n\nIt looks like the output rows are constructed by mirroring each input row horizontally (reverse + original) to create 4 columns.\n\nVertically, the 3 input rows are repeated 3 times to get 9 rows.\n\nSome rows that are all zeros appear as \"empty\" rows (e.g. in example 1 the second input row 0 0 becomes output row 1 0 0 0 0 - so zeros expanded horizontally).\n\nSo the main consistent transformation:\n\n- Each input row (length 2) becomes an output row of length 4 by reversing and concatenating: output_row = reversed(input_row) + input_row\n- The three input rows become 9 output rows by repeating the block 3 times vertically.\n\nImplementation plan:\n\n- Given input grid size (3x2)\n- For each input row, create output row = reversed(row) + row (length 4)\n- Construct the output 3x4 block\n- Repeat that 3 times vertically to get 9x4\n\nThis matches training example 1 and 2 fully.\n\nTraining example 3 is a bit different visually from the images (different colors), but the above rule fits mostly except some pixels replaced by zeros. We'll apply the same rule as best hypothesis.\n\nNow let's write code implementing this transformation.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # grid is 3 rows x 2 cols\n    # Output layout: 9 rows x 4 cols\n    # Each input row (length 2) -> output row = reversed(row) + row (length 4)\n    # Then repeat this 3-row block vertically 3 times\n    \n    out_block = []\n    for row in grid:\n        out_row = list(row[::-1]) + list(row)\n        out_block.append(out_row)\n    \n    # Repeat this block vertically 3 times\n    transformed_grid = out_block * 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```"
