          "Analysis:\n\n- The training examples show grids with multiple green crosses (value 3) - each cross is a shape of 5 cells (center + up, down, left, right).\n- The output grids add a new color (value 2, shown as red) forming line segments connecting some of these green crosses.\n- The red path connects three of the crosses in the first and third examples in a certain order:\n  - In example 1 & 3, three crosses are connected in a path, passing between their centers (green cells). The red cells fill the straight or angled line segments to connect the centers.\n  - In example 2, the red cells form a V shape connecting three crosses' centers, with some intermediate points to make the bend.\n- The number 2 cells start from or next to a cross's center green cell and connect them.\n- The output foreground grid and size do not change.\n- This suggests the transformation connects certain crosses (value=3 shapes) by drawing red paths (value=2) between their centers, following horizontal/vertical/diagonal moves.\n\nHypothesis for solution:\n- Identify centers of all crosses (cells with 3 and neighbors with 3 in all four directions).\n- Pick a subset of crosses that form a main pattern (e.g. 3 crosses in example 1, 4 centers in example 2 but only three connected, etc.)\n- Connect these detected crosses with value=2 cells along grid-lined shortest paths (horizontal/vertical/diagonal lines allowed).\n- Keep other cells unchanged.\n\nSince there's no obvious selection rule for which crosses to connect if many are present, a reasonable heuristic is:\n- Find all cross centers.\n- Find the three crosses that form the shape closest to the main cluster (or first three crosses by row order).\n- Connect these 3 crosses with paths by filling value=2 cells along the straight or L-shaped path between them.\n\nUse Bresenham-like line drawing or similar to draw connecting lines on the grid between centers.\n\nImplementation details:\n- The final output grid size should always match input size.\n- We will mark value=2 cells for connecting paths, preserving the original value=3 for crosses.\n- We'll connect the crosses in the order of their rows (or sort by coordinates) to build a chain.\n- We'll draw segments connecting cross 1\u21922, then 2\u21923, etc.\n- If fewer than 3 crosses detected, connect all pairwise crosses.\n- Drawing lines horizontally, vertically or diagonally on an integer grid.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    output = grid.copy()\n\n    # Find centers of crosses (where cell==3 and at least in 4-neighborhood is a cross)\n    # Cross centers have cross shape: center + up/down/left/right == 3\n    centers = []\n    for r in range(1, height - 1):\n        for c in range(1, width - 1):\n            if grid[r, c] == 3:\n                if (grid[r-1, c] == 3 and grid[r+1, c] == 3 and\n                    grid[r, c-1] == 3 and grid[r, c+1] == 3):\n                    centers.append((r, c))\n\n    # If fewer than 2 centers found, just return output unchanged\n    if len(centers) < 2:\n        return output.tolist()\n\n    # Sort centers by row then col\n    centers = sorted(centers)\n\n    # Function to get points on a line between two points using Bresenham-like method (8-connected)\n    def points_on_line(r0, c0, r1, c1):\n        points = []\n        dr = r1 - r0\n        dc = c1 - c0\n        steps = max(abs(dr), abs(dc))\n        if steps == 0:\n            return [(r0, c0)]\n        for i in range(steps + 1):\n            rr = r0 + i * dr / steps\n            cc = c0 + i * dc / steps\n            rr_int = int(round(rr))\n            cc_int = int(round(cc))\n            if (rr_int, cc_int) not in points:\n                points.append((rr_int, cc_int))\n        return points\n\n    # Connect centers with value=2 cells\n    # We'll connect in order centers[0] -> centers[1] -> centers[2] (if exists)\n    n = len(centers)\n    max_connect = min(3, n)  # connect up to 3 centers if available\n    for i in range(max_connect - 1):\n        r0, c0 = centers[i]\n        r1, c1 = centers[i + 1]\n        line_pts = points_on_line(r0, c0, r1, c1)\n        for (rr, cc) in line_pts:\n            if output[rr, cc] == 0:\n                output[rr, cc] = 2  # mark connecting path with 2\n\n    return output.tolist()\n```\n"

              "Analysis:\n\n- The training examples show grids with multiple green crosses (value 3) - each cross is a shape of 5 cells (center + up, down, left, right).\n- The output grids add a new color (value 2, shown as red) forming line segments connecting some of these green crosses.\n- The red path connects three of the crosses in the first and third examples in a certain order:\n  - In example 1 & 3, three crosses are connected in a path, passing between their centers (green cells). The red cells fill the straight or angled line segments to connect the centers.\n  - In example 2, the red cells form a V shape connecting three crosses' centers, with some intermediate points to make the bend.\n- The number 2 cells start from or next to a cross's center green cell and connect them.\n- The output foreground grid and size do not change.\n- This suggests the transformation connects certain crosses (value=3 shapes) by drawing red paths (value=2) between their centers, following horizontal/vertical/diagonal moves.\n\nHypothesis for solution:\n- Identify centers of all crosses (cells with 3 and neighbors with 3 in all four directions).\n- Pick a subset of crosses that form a main pattern (e.g. 3 crosses in example 1, 4 centers in example 2 but only three connected, etc.)\n- Connect these detected crosses with value=2 cells along grid-lined shortest paths (horizontal/vertical/diagonal lines allowed).\n- Keep other cells unchanged.\n\nSince there's no obvious selection rule for which crosses to connect if many are present, a reasonable heuristic is:\n- Find all cross centers.\n- Find the three crosses that form the shape closest to the main cluster (or first three crosses by row order).\n- Connect these 3 crosses with paths by filling value=2 cells along the straight or L-shaped path between them.\n\nUse Bresenham-like line drawing or similar to draw connecting lines on the grid between centers.\n\nImplementation details:\n- The final output grid size should always match input size.\n- We will mark value=2 cells for connecting paths, preserving the original value=3 for crosses.\n- We'll connect the crosses in the order of their rows (or sort by coordinates) to build a chain.\n- We'll draw segments connecting cross 1\u21922, then 2\u21923, etc.\n- If fewer than 3 crosses detected, connect all pairwise crosses.\n- Drawing lines horizontally, vertically or diagonally on an integer grid.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    height, width = grid.shape\n    output = grid.copy()\n\n    # Find centers of crosses (where cell==3 and at least in 4-neighborhood is a cross)\n    # Cross centers have cross shape: center + up/down/left/right == 3\n    centers = []\n    for r in range(1, height - 1):\n        for c in range(1, width - 1):\n            if grid[r, c] == 3:\n                if (grid[r-1, c] == 3 and grid[r+1, c] == 3 and\n                    grid[r, c-1] == 3 and grid[r, c+1] == 3):\n                    centers.append((r, c))\n\n    # If fewer than 2 centers found, just return output unchanged\n    if len(centers) < 2:\n        return output.tolist()\n\n    # Sort centers by row then col\n    centers = sorted(centers)\n\n    # Function to get points on a line between two points using Bresenham-like method (8-connected)\n    def points_on_line(r0, c0, r1, c1):\n        points = []\n        dr = r1 - r0\n        dc = c1 - c0\n        steps = max(abs(dr), abs(dc))\n        if steps == 0:\n            return [(r0, c0)]\n        for i in range(steps + 1):\n            rr = r0 + i * dr / steps\n            cc = c0 + i * dc / steps\n            rr_int = int(round(rr))\n            cc_int = int(round(cc))\n            if (rr_int, cc_int) not in points:\n                points.append((rr_int, cc_int))\n        return points\n\n    # Connect centers with value=2 cells\n    # We'll connect in order centers[0] -> centers[1] -> centers[2] (if exists)\n    n = len(centers)\n    max_connect = min(3, n)  # connect up to 3 centers if available\n    for i in range(max_connect - 1):\n        r0, c0 = centers[i]\n        r1, c1 = centers[i + 1]\n        line_pts = points_on_line(r0, c0, r1, c1)\n        for (rr, cc) in line_pts:\n            if output[rr, cc] == 0:\n                output[rr, cc] = 2  # mark connecting path with 2\n\n    return output.tolist()\n```\n"
