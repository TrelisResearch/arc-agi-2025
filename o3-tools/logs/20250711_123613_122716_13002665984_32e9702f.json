          "The training examples seem to exhibit certain patterns:\n\n1. The first example takes a 3x3 block with a specific number (4) at the top-left corner and produces a full grid filled with a higher number (5), replacing certain regions.\n2. The second example appears to identify a specific shape pattern (a horizontal bar of 3's in the middle) and transforms the entire grid to mostly 5, with the shape pattern remaining or adjusting slightly.\n3. The third example detects a shape (a cluster of 7s forming a pattern) and fills the entire 7x7 grid with 5s, while preserving the shape boundary somewhat, but filling around the shape with 5s.\n\nIn all examples, the output grid becomes filled predominantly with 5s, with some preservation of the shape within the grid. The shape seems to be a key element, either kept or emphasized, and the background is filled with 5s.\n\n**From the test input:**\n- The pattern appears to be a cluster of pink shapes (represented with number 6 in the training data, or in this case, possibly a different value). \n- It's surrounded by zeros, with some regions of a shape (possibly similar to the shape shape in example 2 or 3).\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n- The transformation might involve filling the entire grid with 5s, but preserving or emphasizing identified shape regions (like non-zero areas or specific shape masks).\n- The shape in the test input is a cluster of \"6\"s, similar to the training examples where shape regions (7s, 3s, 4s) remain or are highlighted.\n- My guess: The transformation fills the entire grid with 5s, but preserves the shape boundaries or shape area.\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Fill entire grid with 5.\n- Optional: preserve original shape regions if wanted.\n- Since the pattern isn't fully explicit, I will implement a simple strategy:\n  - For every non-zero cell, keep the original value (or set it to 5?), depending on what the pattern indicates.\n  - Based on examples, fill all cells with 5s, but if a shape is detected (non-zero cells), set those to 5s or keep them accordingly.\n\nHere, I will implement as:\n- Fill everything with 5\n- For cells originally non-zero, keep them as 6 (or 5, but since pattern tends toward full fill with 5, I will just fill all with 5).\n\n**Final code:**\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Fill the entire grid with 5s, as seen in the patterns and test case emphasizing the shape fill\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    transformed_grid = [[5 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
