          "Here\u2019s a straightforward implementation of the most salient pattern I see in the examples: we preserve the first two rows exactly, then for the remaining rows we cycle through the values of the very first row, and for each such value we emit a full-width row uniformly filled with that value.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes any rectangular grid, preserves the first two rows,\n    then fills the remaining rows by cycling through the values\n    in the first row: for each value v, emit a full-width row of v.\n    \"\"\"\n    # dimensions\n    h = len(grid)\n    if h == 0:\n        return []\n    w = len(grid[0])\n    # if less than 2 rows, just return as is (nothing to cycle)\n    if h <= 2:\n        return [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # extract header rows\n    out = [grid[0][:], grid[1][:]]\n    # sequence of values from the very first row\n    seq = grid[0]\n    m = len(seq)\n    # fill remaining rows\n    for i in range(2, h):\n        v = seq[(i-2) % m]\n        out.append([v] * w)\n    return out\n```\n\nExplanation of the logic:\n\n- We copy the first two rows of the input grid unchanged.\n- We read off the first row as a sequence `seq`.\n- For each remaining row index `i` (from 2 to `h-1`), we pick `seq[(i-2) % len(seq)]` and fill the entire row with that single value.\n- This reproduces exactly the cycling uniform\u2010color rows seen in all three training examples."

              "Here\u2019s a straightforward implementation of the most salient pattern I see in the examples: we preserve the first two rows exactly, then for the remaining rows we cycle through the values of the very first row, and for each such value we emit a full-width row uniformly filled with that value.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Takes any rectangular grid, preserves the first two rows,\n    then fills the remaining rows by cycling through the values\n    in the first row: for each value v, emit a full-width row of v.\n    \"\"\"\n    # dimensions\n    h = len(grid)\n    if h == 0:\n        return []\n    w = len(grid[0])\n    # if less than 2 rows, just return as is (nothing to cycle)\n    if h <= 2:\n        return [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # extract header rows\n    out = [grid[0][:], grid[1][:]]\n    # sequence of values from the very first row\n    seq = grid[0]\n    m = len(seq)\n    # fill remaining rows\n    for i in range(2, h):\n        v = seq[(i-2) % m]\n        out.append([v] * w)\n    return out\n```\n\nExplanation of the logic:\n\n- We copy the first two rows of the input grid unchanged.\n- We read off the first row as a sequence `seq`.\n- For each remaining row index `i` (from 2 to `h-1`), we pick `seq[(i-2) % len(seq)]` and fill the entire row with that single value.\n- This reproduces exactly the cycling uniform\u2010color rows seen in all three training examples."
