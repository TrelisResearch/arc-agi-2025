    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, I have three training examples, and I need to find out how the input grid transforms into the output grid. The output is always a 9x3 grid, but the input seems to be 6x3. Wait, looking at the examples:\n\nExample 1's input is 6 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 9 rows. Hmm, maybe the output is generated by expanding the input in some way. Let me check the examples more carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput rows:\n0 1 0\n1 1 0\n0 1 0\n0 1 1\n0 1 0\n1 1 0\n\nOutput rows:\n0 2 0\n2 2 0\n0 2 0\n0 2 2\n0 2 0\n2 2 0\n0 2 0\n0 2 2\n0 2 0\n\nSo the output has 9 rows. The input has 6 rows. Maybe each input row is being expanded into 1.5 rows? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that repeats or expands the input.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1: the first three rows of output are:\n\n0 2 0\n2 2 0\n0 2 0\n\nWhich seems to mirror the input's first three rows. Wait, the input's first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0\nRow 1: 1 1 0\nRow 2: 0 1 0\n\nThe output's first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0\nRow 1: 2 2 0\nRow 2: 0 2 0\n\nSo it looks like each 1 in the input is being replaced by 2, but also there's some pattern of adding 2s in between. For example, the first row of input is 0 1 0. The output's first row is 0 2 0. The second row of input is 1 1 0, which becomes 2 2 0. The third row of input is 0 1 0, which becomes 0 2 0. Then the fourth row of input is 0 1 1, which becomes 0 2 2. Then the fifth row is 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0. The sixth input row is 1 1 0 \u2192 2 2 0. Then the output has three more rows, which are 0 2 0, 0 2 2, 0 2 0. \n\nSo maybe the output is generated by taking each input row and expanding it into three rows? But that would make 6*3=18 rows, but the output is 9 rows. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that's based on the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and adding some lines in between. For example, in example 1, the input has 6 rows, and the output has 9 rows. So adding 3 rows. Maybe the output is generated by inserting lines between the input rows. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1: the first three rows are the input's first three rows transformed. Then the next three rows are the input's fourth, fifth, sixth rows transformed. But that's not matching. Wait, the output has 9 rows. Let me count:\n\nOriginal input has 6 rows. Output has 9 rows. So maybe each input row is being transformed into 1.5 rows? That's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that's based on the input's rows and columns.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for example 1. The output is 9 rows, each with 3 elements. The input is 6 rows, 3 elements. Let's think of the output as being generated by some kind of expansion. For example, maybe each input row is being split into three rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and adding some lines in between. For example, between each input row, there's an additional row. But that would be 6+5=11 rows, which is more than 9. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting a row between each pair of input rows. For example, if the input has 6 rows, inserting 3 rows would make 9. Let's see. For example, inserting a row between each pair of input rows. So between row 0 and 1, insert a row. Between row 1 and 2, insert a row. And so on. But that would add 5 rows, making 6+5=11. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting a row between each pair of input rows, but only for some rows. For example, maybe inserting a row after every two input rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each row into three rows. But that would be 6*3=18 rows, which is not 9. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, looking at the output for example 1, the first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0\nRow 1: 2 2 0\nRow 2: 0 2 0\n\nWhich seems to be the input's first three rows transformed. Then the next three rows are:\n\nRow 3: 0 2 2\nRow 4: 0 2 0\nRow 5: 2 2 0\n\nWhich is the input's fourth, fifth, sixth rows transformed. Then the output has three more rows: row 6, 7, 8. Which are 0 2 0, 0 2 2, 0 2 0. So that's similar to the first three rows. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting some rows in between. For example, the input has 6 rows. The output has 9 rows, which is 6 + 3. So maybe inserting three rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting a row after every two input rows. For example, the input has 6 rows. Inserting a row after every two rows would give 6 + 3 = 9 rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input rows: 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nInsert after row 2 (input row 2) \u2192 new row 3. Then after row 4 (input row 4) \u2192 new row 5. Then after row 5 (input row 5) \u2192 new row 6. But that would make 6 + 3 = 9 rows. But how does that fit with the example?\n\nIn example 1's output, the first three rows are the input's first three rows transformed. Then the next three rows are the input's fourth, fifth, sixth rows transformed. Then the next three rows are the same as the first three. But that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each row into three rows. But that would be 6*3=18 rows, which is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that depends on the input's rows. For example, each row in the output is generated based on the input's rows in a certain way. Let's look at the output for example 1:\n\nThe first three output rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 \u2192 input row 0: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0. So the middle value is 2, others are same.\n\nRow 1: 2 2 0 \u2192 input row 1: 1 1 0 \u2192 2 2 0. So all values are doubled? Or maybe the 1s are replaced by 2s.\n\nRow 2: 0 2 0 \u2192 input row 2: 0 1 0 \u2192 same as row 0.\n\nThen row 3: 0 2 2 \u2192 input row 3: 0 1 1 \u2192 middle and right are 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 2 0 \u2192 input row 4: 0 1 0 \u2192 same as row 0.\n\nRow 5: 2 2 0 \u2192 input row 5: 1 1 0 \u2192 same as row 1.\n\nThen rows 6-8 are:\n\nRow 6: 0 2 0 \u2192 same as row 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 2 2 \u2192 same as row 3.\n\nRow 8: 0 2 0 \u2192 same as row 0.\n\nSo the output seems to be a pattern where the input rows are transformed into three rows each, but that's not matching the count. Wait, the input has 6 rows. The output has 9 rows. So 6 rows in input, 9 in output. So maybe each input row is transformed into 1.5 rows? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input rows and inserting some rows between them. For example, the first three output rows are the first three input rows transformed, then the next three are the fourth, fifth, sixth transformed, and then the next three are the same as the first three. But that's not matching the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that's based on the input's structure. For example, in example 1, the input has a pattern where the first three rows are 0 1 0, 1 1 0, 0 1 0. The output for those rows is 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0. So the 1s in the input are replaced by 2s. But why?\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput rows:\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\nOutput rows:\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 0 2\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 0 2\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 0 2\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 0 2\n\n0 2 0\n\nSo the output here is similar to example 1 but with the 1s in different positions. For example, the first input row is 0 1 0 \u2192 output is 0 2 0. The second input row is 1 0 1 \u2192 output is 2 0 2. So it seems like the 1s in the input are being replaced by 2s, but the positions vary. So in example 2, the middle element is 0, but the output is 2 in the middle. Wait, no. The second input row is 1 0 1. The output row is 2 0 2. So the 1s are replaced by 2s, and the 0s remain as 0. So maybe the transformation is that any 1 in the input is replaced by 2, and 0s remain as 0. But why does the output have 9 rows? Because the input has 6 rows, and the output has 9 rows. So perhaps each input row is being expanded into 1.5 rows? That's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by inserting a row between each pair of input rows. For example, the input has 6 rows, so inserting 3 rows would give 6 + 3 = 9 rows. Let's see. For example, between row 0 and 1, insert a row. Between row 1 and 2, insert a row. Between row 2 and 3, insert a row. Between row 3 and 4, insert a row. Between row 4 and 5, insert a row. That would be 5 insertions, making 6+5=11 rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting a row after every two rows. For example, after row 2, insert a row. Then after row 4, insert a row. Then after row 5, insert a row. That would give 6 + 3 = 9 rows. Let's check.\n\nIn example 1, the output has 9 rows. So the input rows are 0-5. Insert after row 2 (input row 2) \u2192 new row 3. Insert after row 4 (input row 4) \u2192 new row 5. Insert after row 5 (input row 5) \u2192 new row 6. Then the output rows would be:\n\nOriginal rows 0,1,2 \u2192 transformed into rows 0,1,2.\n\nThen inserted row 3 (after row 2).\n\nOriginal row 3,4,5 \u2192 transformed into rows 4,5,6.\n\nThen inserted row 7 (after row 5?), but that's not matching. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows. But that would be 6*3=18 rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and adding some rows based on the input's structure. For example, in example 1, the output has 9 rows. The input has 6 rows. So maybe the output is the input rows, each transformed into three rows. But that would be 6*3=18. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating a certain number of rows. For example, in example 1, the first three input rows are transformed into three output rows, then the next three input rows are transformed into three output rows, and then the same three output rows again. But that would be 3+3+3=9 rows. But why?\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nThe first three output rows are the first three input rows transformed. Then the next three output rows are the fourth, fifth, sixth input rows transformed. Then the next three are the same as the first three. So that's 3+3+3=9 rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and adding some rows that mirror the first three rows. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows, but the first three input rows are transformed into three rows, then the next three input rows are transformed into three rows, and then the same three rows again. But that would be 3+3+3=9 rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting a row after every two input rows. For example, the input has 6 rows. So inserting a row after rows 0, 2, 4. That would give 6 + 3 = 9 rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nInsert after row 0 \u2192 new row 1.\n\nInsert after row 2 \u2192 new row 3.\n\nInsert after row 4 \u2192 new row 5.\n\nSo the output would have rows:\n\nOriginal 0, inserted 1, original 1, original 2, inserted 3, original 3, original 4, inserted 4, original 5.\n\nBut that's 9 rows. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nIn example 1, the first three output rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 (input row 0)\n\nRow 1: 2 2 0 (inserted after row 0?)\n\nRow 2: 0 2 0 (input row 1)\n\nRow 3: 2 2 0 (inserted after row 2?)\n\nRow 4: 0 2 2 (input row 3)\n\nRow 5: 0 2 0 (inserted after row 4?)\n\nRow 6: 2 2 0 (input row 5)\n\nHmm, but the output in example 1 has 9 rows. So this approach may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows. But that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first three output rows are the input's first three rows transformed. Then the next three are the fourth, fifth, sixth rows transformed. Then the next three are the same as the first three. So that's 3+3+3=9. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows, transforming them into three rows each, then repeating the first three rows again. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting a row between each pair of input rows. But that would be 6 + 5 = 11 rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating a certain number of rows based on some pattern. For example, the first three rows of the output are the first three input rows transformed, then the next three are the fourth, fifth, sixth rows transformed, then the next three are the same as the first three. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting some rows that are copies of the first three rows. But again, this is unclear.\n\nLooking at the output for example 2:\n\nInput rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0\n\nRow 1: 1 0 1\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0\n\nRow 5: 1 0 1\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0\n\nRow 1: 2 0 2\n\nRow 2: 0 2 0\n\nRow 3: 2 0 2\n\nRow 4: 0 2 0\n\nRow 5: 2 0 2\n\nRow 6: 0 2 0\n\nRow 7: 2 0 2\n\nRow 8: 0 2 0\n\nSo the output is the same as the input rows transformed, but with the 1s replaced by 2s. And the output has 9 rows, which is 6 input rows plus 3 more rows. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting a row after every two input rows. For example, the input has 6 rows, so inserting a row after row 2, row 4, and row 5. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows. But that would be 6*3=18 rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows, but the first three input rows are transformed into three rows, then the next three input rows are transformed into three rows, and then the same three rows again. So that's 3+3+3=9 rows. But why would that be the case?\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nThe first three output rows are the first three input rows transformed. The next three are the fourth, fifth, sixth transformed. Then the next three are the same as the first three. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows in groups of three, transforming each group into three rows, and then repeating the first group's transformed rows again.\n\nBut that would be 3 groups of 3 input rows, but the input has 6 rows. So groups of 3. Then each group is transformed into three output rows. Then the output has 3*3=9 rows.\n\nBut how does that fit with the examples?\n\nIn example 1, the first three input rows are transformed into three output rows. Then the next three input rows are transformed into three output rows. Then the same as the first three again. So that's 3+3+3=9 rows. But why would the third group be the same as the first?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows and expanding them into three rows each, but the first three input rows are transformed into three rows, then the next three are transformed into three rows, and then the first three again. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows, but the first three rows of the output are the first three input rows transformed, then the next three are the next three input rows transformed, then the next three are the same as the first three. But that's not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and adding some rows that are copies of the first three rows. But again, this is unclear.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for example 1, the first three output rows are the input's first three rows transformed. The fourth, fifth, sixth input rows are transformed into the next three output rows. Then the next three output rows are the same as the first three. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows, transforming each into three rows, and then repeating the first three transformed rows again. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows where each row is a transformation of the input's row. But that would be 6*3=18 rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows, but the first three rows of the output are the first three input rows transformed, then the next three are the next three input rows transformed, and then the last three are the same as the first three. But that would be 3+3+3=9 rows. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting three rows in between the input rows. For example, the input has 6 rows, and the output has 9 rows. So inserting three rows in between. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows. But that would be 6*3=18 rows. Not matching.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's think about the transformation for each row. For example, in example 1, the input row 0 is 0 1 0 \u2192 output row 0 is 0 2 0. So the 1 is replaced by 2. Similarly, input row 1 is 1 1 0 \u2192 output row 1 is 2 2 0. So the 1s are replaced by 2s. Input row 2 is 0 1 0 \u2192 output row 2 is 0 2 0. So the 1 is replaced by 2. Input row 3 is 0 1 1 \u2192 output row 3 is 0 2 2. So the 1s are replaced by 2s. Input row 4 is 0 1 0 \u2192 output row 4 is 0 2 0. Input row 5 is 1 1 0 \u2192 output row 5 is 2 2 0.\n\nSo it seems that the transformation for each input row is to replace all 1s with 2s. So the output is the input grid with all 1s replaced by 2s. But then why is the output grid 9 rows? The input grid is 6 rows. So this suggests that the output is generated by expanding the input in some way.\n\nBut in example 1, the output has 9 rows, which is 6 + 3. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input and adding three rows that are copies of the first three rows. Or maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting some rows between them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows. But that would be 6*3=18 rows, which is not matching.\n\nWait, the output is always 9 rows. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting three rows in between. For example, the input has 6 rows. The output has 9 rows. So inserting three rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows. But the input has 6 rows, so the output would have 6*3=18 rows. But the output is 9 rows. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting a row after every two input rows. For example, the input has 6 rows. Insert after row 0, row 2, and row 4. That would give 6 + 3 = 9 rows. So the output rows would be:\n\nOriginal row 0 \u2192 row 0.\n\nInserted row after 0 \u2192 row 1.\n\nOriginal row 1 \u2192 row 2.\n\nInserted row after 2 \u2192 row 3.\n\nOriginal row 2 \u2192 row 4.\n\nInserted row after 4 \u2192 row 5.\n\nOriginal row 3 \u2192 row 6.\n\nInserted row after 5 \u2192 row 7.\n\nOriginal row 4 \u2192 row 8.\n\nWait, but that would be 9 rows. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nIn example 1's output, the first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 (input row 0)\n\nRow 1: 2 2 0 (inserted after row 0)\n\nRow 2: 0 2 0 (input row 1)\n\nRow 3: 2 2 0 (inserted after row 2)\n\nRow 4: 0 2 2 (input row 3)\n\nRow 5: 0 2 0 (inserted after row 4)\n\nRow 6: 2 2 0 (input row 5)\n\nBut the output has 9 rows. So this approach is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting three rows between the input rows. For example, inserting three rows after each input row. But that would be 6 + 3*6 = 24 rows, which is not possible.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the output's structure. For example, the output is 9 rows. The input is 6 rows. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input and adding three rows that are copies of the first three rows. For example:\n\nOriginal input rows: 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nOutput rows: 0,1,2,3,4,5,0,1,2.\n\nSo the output has the first three rows, then the next three rows, then the first three again. That would be 9 rows. But why would that be the case?\n\nIn example 1, the output rows 6-8 are:\n\n0 2 0\n\n0 2 2\n\n0 2 0\n\nWhich is the same as the first three output rows. So that fits. But why?\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows. But that's not possible. Alternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows, but the first three input rows are transformed into three rows, then the next three are transformed into three rows, then the first three again.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows, but the first three rows of the output are the first three input rows transformed, then the next three rows are the next three input rows transformed, then the last three rows are the first three input rows transformed again.\n\nBut this would mean that the output is 3+3+3=9 rows. So for example, the input has 6 rows, divided into two groups of three. Each group is transformed into three rows. Then the first group is repeated again.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are in which group? For example, the first group is rows 0-2, then rows 3-5. Then the first group is repeated again. So the output is:\n\nGroup 1: rows 0-2 \u2192 transformed into 3 rows.\n\nGroup 2: rows 3-5 \u2192 transformed into 3 rows.\n\nGroup 1 again: rows 0-2 \u2192 transformed into 3 rows.\n\nSo total 9 rows.\n\nBut why would this be the case? It's possible that the output is generated by this pattern.\n\nLet's check example 1's output:\n\nGroup 1 (input rows 0-2):\n\nInput row 0: 0 1 0 \u2192 output row 0: 0 2 0.\n\nInput row 1: 1 1 0 \u2192 output row 1: 2 2 0.\n\nInput row 2: 0 1 0 \u2192 output row 2: 0 2 0.\n\nThen group 2 (input rows 3-5):\n\nInput row 3: 0 1 1 \u2192 output row 3: 0 2 2.\n\nInput row 4: 0 1 0 \u2192 output row 4: 0 2 0.\n\nInput row 5: 1 1 0 \u2192 output row 5: 2 2 0.\n\nThen group 1 again (input rows 0-2):\n\nOutput rows 6-8: 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nIn example 2's output, the input has 6 rows, divided into two groups of three. The first group is rows 0-2:\n\nInput rows 0-2: 0 1 0, 1 0 1, 0 1 0 \u2192 transformed into rows 0-2: 0 2 0, 2 0 2, 0 2 0.\n\nGroup 2: rows 3-5: 1 0 1, 0 1 0, 1 0 1 \u2192 transformed into rows 3-5: 2 0 2, 0 2 0, 2 0 2.\n\nThen group 1 again: rows 0-2 \u2192 rows 6-8: 0 2 0, 2 0 2, 0 2 0.\n\nWhich matches the example's output.\n\nSimilarly, example 3's input is:\n\nInput rows:\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 0\n\n0 1 0\n\nOutput rows:\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 2 0\n\n0 2 0\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 2 0\n\n0 2 0\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 2 0\n\n0 2 0\n\nSo group 1: rows 0-2: input rows 0-2 \u2192 transformed into rows 0-2: 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0.\n\nGroup 2: rows 3-5: input rows 3-5 \u2192 transformed into rows 3-5: 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0.\n\nThen group 1 again: rows 6-8: same as rows 0-2.\n\nSo this pattern seems to fit all three examples.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\n- The input has 6 rows, divided into two groups of three rows each. Each group is transformed into three rows. Then the first group is repeated again to form the output.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are in which group?\n\nThe first group is rows 0-2 of the input, the second group is rows 3-5. Then the first group is repeated again.\n\nSo for the output, the first three rows are the first three input rows transformed, then the next three are the next three input rows transformed, then the first three again.\n\nBut how to implement this? The output has 9 rows. So for the first three rows of the output, we take the first three input rows, transform them. Then the next three rows are the next three input rows transformed. Then the last three rows are the first three input rows transformed again.\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the output rows 6-8 are the same as rows 0-2. So the output is:\n\noutput_rows = [transformed_group1, transformed_group2, transformed_group1]\n\nWhere group1 is input rows 0-2, group2 is input rows 3-5.\n\nSo the transformation is to take the input rows, split into two groups of three, transform each group into three rows (each row in the group is transformed by replacing 1s with 2s), then output the transformed group1, then transformed group2, then transformed group1 again.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThe input is a list of 6 rows. The output is a list of 9 rows. So the first three rows of the output are the first three input rows transformed. The next three rows are the next three input rows transformed. The last three rows are the first three input rows transformed again.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\nFor each row in the input, replace 1s with 2s. Then, the output is:\n\n[transformed_row0, transformed_row1, transformed_row2, transformed_row3, transformed_row4, transformed_row5, transformed_row0, transformed_row1, transformed_row2]\n\nSo the output is the transformed input rows, followed by the first three transformed rows again.\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the output has 9 rows. The input has 6 rows. So the output is:\n\ntransformed_input_rows[0], transformed_input_rows[1], transformed_input_rows[2], transformed_input_rows[3], transformed_input_rows[4], transformed_input_rows[5], transformed_input_rows[0], transformed_input_rows[1], transformed_input_rows[2]\n\nSo the output is the transformed input rows, then the first three transformed rows again.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each row in the input, replace all 1s with 2s. This is the transformed rows.\n\n2. The output is the transformed rows, then the first three transformed rows again.\n\nSo for example, if the input is 6 rows, the transformed rows are 6 rows. Then, the output is 6 + 3 = 9 rows.\n\nYes, this seems to fit all examples.\n\nLet's check example 1:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0 \u2192 transformed to 0 2 0.\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 \u2192 transformed to 2 2 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 \u2192 transformed to 0 2 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 1 \u2192 transformed to 0 2 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 \u2192 transformed to 0 2 0.\n\nRow 5: 1 1 0 \u2192 transformed to 2 2 0.\n\nSo the transformed rows are:\n\n[0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0, 0 2 2, 0 2 0, 2 2 0]\n\nThen the output is these six rows, followed by the first three rows of the transformed rows:\n\n[0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0, 0 2 2, 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0]\n\nWhich matches the example's output.\n\nSimilarly, example 2:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0 \u2192 transformed to 0 2 0.\n\nRow 1: 1 0 1 \u2192 transformed to 2 0 2.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 \u2192 transformed to 0 2 0.\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1 \u2192 transformed to 2 0 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 \u2192 transformed to 0 2 0.\n\nRow 5: 1 0 1 \u2192 transformed to 2 0 2.\n\nTransformed rows:\n\n[0 2 0, 2 0 2, 0 2 0, 2 0 2, 0 2 0, 2 0 2]\n\nOutput is these six rows, then the first three rows:\n\n[0 2 0, 2 0 2, 0 2 0, 2 0 2, 0 2 0, 2 0 2, 0 2 0, 2 0 2, 0 2 0]\n\nWhich matches the example's output.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0.\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 \u2192 2 2 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0.\n\nRow 4: 1 1 0 \u2192 2 2 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0.\n\nTransformed rows:\n\n[0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0, 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0]\n\nOutput is these six rows, then first three:\n\n[0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0, 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0, 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0]\n\nWhich matches the example's output.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. So the transformation is:\n\n- For each row in the input, replace all 1s with 2s.\n\n- The output is the transformed rows, then the first three transformed rows again.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nTake the input grid, for each row, replace 1s with 2s. Then the output is the transformed rows, then the first three transformed rows again.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Transform each row by replacing 1s with 2s\n    transformed_rows = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = [2 if x == 1 else x for x in row]\n        transformed_rows.append(new_row)\n    # Output is transformed_rows + first three transformed rows\n    output = transformed_rows + transformed_rows[:3]\n    return output\n\nBut wait, the output must be a 9x3 grid. Let's check:\n\ntransformed_rows is 6 rows. Then adding the first three rows gives 6 + 3 = 9 rows. Each row is 3 elements. So that's correct.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach. Let's test this with the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n1 1 1\n\n0 1 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 1\n\n0 1 0\n\n0 1 0\n\nSo the input is 6 rows. Let's transform each row:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 \u2192 2 2 2.\n\nRow 1: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 1 \u2192 2 2 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0.\n\nTransformed_rows is:\n\n[ [2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0] ]\n\nThen output is transformed_rows + first three rows:\n\n[ [2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0] ]\n\nWhich is 9 rows, each 3 elements. So that's correct.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct transformation.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, I have three training examples, and I need to find out how the input grid transforms into the output grid. The output is always a 9x3 grid, but the input seems to be 6x3. Wait, looking at the examples:\n\nExample 1's input is 6 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 9 rows. Hmm, maybe the output is generated by expanding the input in some way. Let me check the examples more carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput rows:\n0 1 0\n1 1 0\n0 1 0\n0 1 1\n0 1 0\n1 1 0\n\nOutput rows:\n0 2 0\n2 2 0\n0 2 0\n0 2 2\n0 2 0\n2 2 0\n0 2 0\n0 2 2\n0 2 0\n\nSo the output has 9 rows. The input has 6 rows. Maybe each input row is being expanded into 1.5 rows? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that repeats or expands the input.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1: the first three rows of output are:\n\n0 2 0\n2 2 0\n0 2 0\n\nWhich seems to mirror the input's first three rows. Wait, the input's first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0\nRow 1: 1 1 0\nRow 2: 0 1 0\n\nThe output's first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0\nRow 1: 2 2 0\nRow 2: 0 2 0\n\nSo it looks like each 1 in the input is being replaced by 2, but also there's some pattern of adding 2s in between. For example, the first row of input is 0 1 0. The output's first row is 0 2 0. The second row of input is 1 1 0, which becomes 2 2 0. The third row of input is 0 1 0, which becomes 0 2 0. Then the fourth row of input is 0 1 1, which becomes 0 2 2. Then the fifth row is 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0. The sixth input row is 1 1 0 \u2192 2 2 0. Then the output has three more rows, which are 0 2 0, 0 2 2, 0 2 0. \n\nSo maybe the output is generated by taking each input row and expanding it into three rows? But that would make 6*3=18 rows, but the output is 9 rows. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that's based on the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and adding some lines in between. For example, in example 1, the input has 6 rows, and the output has 9 rows. So adding 3 rows. Maybe the output is generated by inserting lines between the input rows. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1: the first three rows are the input's first three rows transformed. Then the next three rows are the input's fourth, fifth, sixth rows transformed. But that's not matching. Wait, the output has 9 rows. Let me count:\n\nOriginal input has 6 rows. Output has 9 rows. So maybe each input row is being transformed into 1.5 rows? That's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that's based on the input's rows and columns.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for example 1. The output is 9 rows, each with 3 elements. The input is 6 rows, 3 elements. Let's think of the output as being generated by some kind of expansion. For example, maybe each input row is being split into three rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and adding some lines in between. For example, between each input row, there's an additional row. But that would be 6+5=11 rows, which is more than 9. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting a row between each pair of input rows. For example, if the input has 6 rows, inserting 3 rows would make 9. Let's see. For example, inserting a row between each pair of input rows. So between row 0 and 1, insert a row. Between row 1 and 2, insert a row. And so on. But that would add 5 rows, making 6+5=11. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting a row between each pair of input rows, but only for some rows. For example, maybe inserting a row after every two input rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each row into three rows. But that would be 6*3=18 rows, which is not 9. So that's not possible.\n\nWait, looking at the output for example 1, the first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0\nRow 1: 2 2 0\nRow 2: 0 2 0\n\nWhich seems to be the input's first three rows transformed. Then the next three rows are:\n\nRow 3: 0 2 2\nRow 4: 0 2 0\nRow 5: 2 2 0\n\nWhich is the input's fourth, fifth, sixth rows transformed. Then the output has three more rows: row 6, 7, 8. Which are 0 2 0, 0 2 2, 0 2 0. So that's similar to the first three rows. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting some rows in between. For example, the input has 6 rows. The output has 9 rows, which is 6 + 3. So maybe inserting three rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting a row after every two input rows. For example, the input has 6 rows. Inserting a row after every two rows would give 6 + 3 = 9 rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input rows: 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nInsert after row 2 (input row 2) \u2192 new row 3. Then after row 4 (input row 4) \u2192 new row 5. Then after row 5 (input row 5) \u2192 new row 6. But that would make 6 + 3 = 9 rows. But how does that fit with the example?\n\nIn example 1's output, the first three rows are the input's first three rows transformed. Then the next three rows are the input's fourth, fifth, sixth rows transformed. Then the next three rows are the same as the first three. But that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each row into three rows. But that would be 6*3=18 rows, which is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that depends on the input's rows. For example, each row in the output is generated based on the input's rows in a certain way. Let's look at the output for example 1:\n\nThe first three output rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 \u2192 input row 0: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0. So the middle value is 2, others are same.\n\nRow 1: 2 2 0 \u2192 input row 1: 1 1 0 \u2192 2 2 0. So all values are doubled? Or maybe the 1s are replaced by 2s.\n\nRow 2: 0 2 0 \u2192 input row 2: 0 1 0 \u2192 same as row 0.\n\nThen row 3: 0 2 2 \u2192 input row 3: 0 1 1 \u2192 middle and right are 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 2 0 \u2192 input row 4: 0 1 0 \u2192 same as row 0.\n\nRow 5: 2 2 0 \u2192 input row 5: 1 1 0 \u2192 same as row 1.\n\nThen rows 6-8 are:\n\nRow 6: 0 2 0 \u2192 same as row 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 2 2 \u2192 same as row 3.\n\nRow 8: 0 2 0 \u2192 same as row 0.\n\nSo the output seems to be a pattern where the input rows are transformed into three rows each, but that's not matching the count. Wait, the input has 6 rows. The output has 9 rows. So 6 rows in input, 9 in output. So maybe each input row is transformed into 1.5 rows? That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input rows and inserting some rows between them. For example, the first three output rows are the first three input rows transformed, then the next three are the fourth, fifth, sixth transformed, and then the next three are the same as the first three. But that's not matching the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that's based on the input's structure. For example, in example 1, the input has a pattern where the first three rows are 0 1 0, 1 1 0, 0 1 0. The output for those rows is 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0. So the 1s in the input are replaced by 2s. But why?\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput rows:\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\nOutput rows:\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 0 2\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 0 2\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 0 2\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 0 2\n\n0 2 0\n\nSo the output here is similar to example 1 but with the 1s in different positions. For example, the first input row is 0 1 0 \u2192 output is 0 2 0. The second input row is 1 0 1 \u2192 output is 2 0 2. So it seems like the 1s in the input are being replaced by 2s, but the positions vary. So in example 2, the middle element is 0, but the output is 2 in the middle. Wait, no. The second input row is 1 0 1. The output row is 2 0 2. So the 1s are replaced by 2s, and the 0s remain as 0. So maybe the transformation is that any 1 in the input is replaced by 2, and 0s remain as 0. But why does the output have 9 rows? Because the input has 6 rows, and the output has 9 rows. So perhaps each input row is being expanded into 1.5 rows? That's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by inserting a row between each pair of input rows. For example, the input has 6 rows, so inserting 3 rows would give 6 + 3 = 9 rows. Let's see. For example, between row 0 and 1, insert a row. Between row 1 and 2, insert a row. Between row 2 and 3, insert a row. Between row 3 and 4, insert a row. Between row 4 and 5, insert a row. That would be 5 insertions, making 6+5=11 rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting a row after every two rows. For example, after row 2, insert a row. Then after row 4, insert a row. Then after row 5, insert a row. That would give 6 + 3 = 9 rows. Let's check.\n\nIn example 1, the output has 9 rows. So the input rows are 0-5. Insert after row 2 (input row 2) \u2192 new row 3. Insert after row 4 (input row 4) \u2192 new row 5. Insert after row 5 (input row 5) \u2192 new row 6. Then the output rows would be:\n\nOriginal rows 0,1,2 \u2192 transformed into rows 0,1,2.\n\nThen inserted row 3 (after row 2).\n\nOriginal row 3,4,5 \u2192 transformed into rows 4,5,6.\n\nThen inserted row 7 (after row 5?), but that's not matching. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows. But that would be 6*3=18 rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and adding some rows based on the input's structure. For example, in example 1, the output has 9 rows. The input has 6 rows. So maybe the output is the input rows, each transformed into three rows. But that would be 6*3=18. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating a certain number of rows. For example, in example 1, the first three input rows are transformed into three output rows, then the next three input rows are transformed into three output rows, and then the same three output rows again. But that would be 3+3+3=9 rows. But why?\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nThe first three output rows are the first three input rows transformed. Then the next three output rows are the fourth, fifth, sixth input rows transformed. Then the next three are the same as the first three. So that's 3+3+3=9 rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and adding some rows that mirror the first three rows. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows, but the first three input rows are transformed into three rows, then the next three input rows are transformed into three rows, and then the same three rows again. But that would be 3+3+3=9 rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting a row after every two input rows. For example, the input has 6 rows. So inserting a row after rows 0, 2, 4. That would give 6 + 3 = 9 rows. Let's see:\n\nOriginal rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\nInsert after row 0 \u2192 new row 1.\n\nInsert after row 2 \u2192 new row 3.\n\nInsert after row 4 \u2192 new row 5.\n\nSo the output would have rows:\n\nOriginal 0, inserted 1, original 1, original 2, inserted 3, original 3, original 4, inserted 4, original 5.\n\nBut that's 9 rows. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nIn example 1, the first three output rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 (input row 0)\n\nRow 1: 2 2 0 (inserted after row 0?)\n\nRow 2: 0 2 0 (input row 1)\n\nRow 3: 2 2 0 (inserted after row 2?)\n\nRow 4: 0 2 2 (input row 3)\n\nRow 5: 0 2 0 (inserted after row 4?)\n\nRow 6: 2 2 0 (input row 5)\n\nHmm, but the output in example 1 has 9 rows. So this approach may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows. But that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first three output rows are the input's first three rows transformed. Then the next three are the fourth, fifth, sixth rows transformed. Then the next three are the same as the first three. So that's 3+3+3=9. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows, transforming them into three rows each, then repeating the first three rows again. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting a row between each pair of input rows. But that would be 6 + 5 = 11 rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating a certain number of rows based on some pattern. For example, the first three rows of the output are the first three input rows transformed, then the next three are the fourth, fifth, sixth rows transformed, then the next three are the same as the first three. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting some rows that are copies of the first three rows. But again, this is unclear.\n\nLooking at the output for example 2:\n\nInput rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0\n\nRow 1: 1 0 1\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0\n\nRow 5: 1 0 1\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0\n\nRow 1: 2 0 2\n\nRow 2: 0 2 0\n\nRow 3: 2 0 2\n\nRow 4: 0 2 0\n\nRow 5: 2 0 2\n\nRow 6: 0 2 0\n\nRow 7: 2 0 2\n\nRow 8: 0 2 0\n\nSo the output is the same as the input rows transformed, but with the 1s replaced by 2s. And the output has 9 rows, which is 6 input rows plus 3 more rows. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting a row after every two input rows. For example, the input has 6 rows, so inserting a row after row 2, row 4, and row 5. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows. But that would be 6*3=18 rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows, but the first three input rows are transformed into three rows, then the next three input rows are transformed into three rows, and then the same three rows again. So that's 3+3+3=9 rows. But why would that be the case?\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nThe first three output rows are the first three input rows transformed. The next three are the fourth, fifth, sixth transformed. Then the next three are the same as the first three. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows in groups of three, transforming each group into three rows, and then repeating the first group's transformed rows again.\n\nBut that would be 3 groups of 3 input rows, but the input has 6 rows. So groups of 3. Then each group is transformed into three output rows. Then the output has 3*3=9 rows.\n\nBut how does that fit with the examples?\n\nIn example 1, the first three input rows are transformed into three output rows. Then the next three input rows are transformed into three output rows. Then the same as the first three again. So that's 3+3+3=9 rows. But why would the third group be the same as the first?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows and expanding them into three rows each, but the first three input rows are transformed into three rows, then the next three are transformed into three rows, and then the first three again. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows, but the first three rows of the output are the first three input rows transformed, then the next three are the next three input rows transformed, then the next three are the same as the first three. But that's not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and adding some rows that are copies of the first three rows. But again, this is unclear.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for example 1, the first three output rows are the input's first three rows transformed. The fourth, fifth, sixth input rows are transformed into the next three output rows. Then the next three output rows are the same as the first three. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows, transforming each into three rows, and then repeating the first three transformed rows again. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows where each row is a transformation of the input's row. But that would be 6*3=18 rows. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows, but the first three rows of the output are the first three input rows transformed, then the next three are the next three input rows transformed, and then the last three are the same as the first three. But that would be 3+3+3=9 rows. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting three rows in between the input rows. For example, the input has 6 rows, and the output has 9 rows. So inserting three rows in between. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows. But that would be 6*3=18 rows. Not matching.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's think about the transformation for each row. For example, in example 1, the input row 0 is 0 1 0 \u2192 output row 0 is 0 2 0. So the 1 is replaced by 2. Similarly, input row 1 is 1 1 0 \u2192 output row 1 is 2 2 0. So the 1s are replaced by 2s. Input row 2 is 0 1 0 \u2192 output row 2 is 0 2 0. So the 1 is replaced by 2. Input row 3 is 0 1 1 \u2192 output row 3 is 0 2 2. So the 1s are replaced by 2s. Input row 4 is 0 1 0 \u2192 output row 4 is 0 2 0. Input row 5 is 1 1 0 \u2192 output row 5 is 2 2 0.\n\nSo it seems that the transformation for each input row is to replace all 1s with 2s. So the output is the input grid with all 1s replaced by 2s. But then why is the output grid 9 rows? The input grid is 6 rows. So this suggests that the output is generated by expanding the input in some way.\n\nBut in example 1, the output has 9 rows, which is 6 + 3. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input and adding three rows that are copies of the first three rows. Or maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting some rows between them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows. But that would be 6*3=18 rows, which is not matching.\n\nWait, the output is always 9 rows. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting three rows in between. For example, the input has 6 rows. The output has 9 rows. So inserting three rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows. But the input has 6 rows, so the output would have 6*3=18 rows. But the output is 9 rows. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting a row after every two input rows. For example, the input has 6 rows. Insert after row 0, row 2, and row 4. That would give 6 + 3 = 9 rows. So the output rows would be:\n\nOriginal row 0 \u2192 row 0.\n\nInserted row after 0 \u2192 row 1.\n\nOriginal row 1 \u2192 row 2.\n\nInserted row after 2 \u2192 row 3.\n\nOriginal row 2 \u2192 row 4.\n\nInserted row after 4 \u2192 row 5.\n\nOriginal row 3 \u2192 row 6.\n\nInserted row after 5 \u2192 row 7.\n\nOriginal row 4 \u2192 row 8.\n\nWait, but that would be 9 rows. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nIn example 1's output, the first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 (input row 0)\n\nRow 1: 2 2 0 (inserted after row 0)\n\nRow 2: 0 2 0 (input row 1)\n\nRow 3: 2 2 0 (inserted after row 2)\n\nRow 4: 0 2 2 (input row 3)\n\nRow 5: 0 2 0 (inserted after row 4)\n\nRow 6: 2 2 0 (input row 5)\n\nBut the output has 9 rows. So this approach is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and inserting three rows between the input rows. For example, inserting three rows after each input row. But that would be 6 + 3*6 = 24 rows, which is not possible.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the output's structure. For example, the output is 9 rows. The input is 6 rows. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input and adding three rows that are copies of the first three rows. For example:\n\nOriginal input rows: 0,1,2,3,4,5.\n\nOutput rows: 0,1,2,3,4,5,0,1,2.\n\nSo the output has the first three rows, then the next three rows, then the first three again. That would be 9 rows. But why would that be the case?\n\nIn example 1, the output rows 6-8 are:\n\n0 2 0\n\n0 2 2\n\n0 2 0\n\nWhich is the same as the first three output rows. So that fits. But why?\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows. But that's not possible. Alternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows, but the first three input rows are transformed into three rows, then the next three are transformed into three rows, then the first three again.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and for each row, generating three rows, but the first three rows of the output are the first three input rows transformed, then the next three rows are the next three input rows transformed, then the last three rows are the first three input rows transformed again.\n\nBut this would mean that the output is 3+3+3=9 rows. So for example, the input has 6 rows, divided into two groups of three. Each group is transformed into three rows. Then the first group is repeated again.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are in which group? For example, the first group is rows 0-2, then rows 3-5. Then the first group is repeated again. So the output is:\n\nGroup 1: rows 0-2 \u2192 transformed into 3 rows.\n\nGroup 2: rows 3-5 \u2192 transformed into 3 rows.\n\nGroup 1 again: rows 0-2 \u2192 transformed into 3 rows.\n\nSo total 9 rows.\n\nBut why would this be the case? It's possible that the output is generated by this pattern.\n\nLet's check example 1's output:\n\nGroup 1 (input rows 0-2):\n\nInput row 0: 0 1 0 \u2192 output row 0: 0 2 0.\n\nInput row 1: 1 1 0 \u2192 output row 1: 2 2 0.\n\nInput row 2: 0 1 0 \u2192 output row 2: 0 2 0.\n\nThen group 2 (input rows 3-5):\n\nInput row 3: 0 1 1 \u2192 output row 3: 0 2 2.\n\nInput row 4: 0 1 0 \u2192 output row 4: 0 2 0.\n\nInput row 5: 1 1 0 \u2192 output row 5: 2 2 0.\n\nThen group 1 again (input rows 0-2):\n\nOutput rows 6-8: 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nIn example 2's output, the input has 6 rows, divided into two groups of three. The first group is rows 0-2:\n\nInput rows 0-2: 0 1 0, 1 0 1, 0 1 0 \u2192 transformed into rows 0-2: 0 2 0, 2 0 2, 0 2 0.\n\nGroup 2: rows 3-5: 1 0 1, 0 1 0, 1 0 1 \u2192 transformed into rows 3-5: 2 0 2, 0 2 0, 2 0 2.\n\nThen group 1 again: rows 0-2 \u2192 rows 6-8: 0 2 0, 2 0 2, 0 2 0.\n\nWhich matches the example's output.\n\nSimilarly, example 3's input is:\n\nInput rows:\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 0\n\n0 1 0\n\nOutput rows:\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 2 0\n\n0 2 0\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 2 0\n\n0 2 0\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 2 0\n\n0 2 0\n\nSo group 1: rows 0-2: input rows 0-2 \u2192 transformed into rows 0-2: 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0.\n\nGroup 2: rows 3-5: input rows 3-5 \u2192 transformed into rows 3-5: 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0.\n\nThen group 1 again: rows 6-8: same as rows 0-2.\n\nSo this pattern seems to fit all three examples.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\n- The input has 6 rows, divided into two groups of three rows each. Each group is transformed into three rows. Then the first group is repeated again to form the output.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are in which group?\n\nThe first group is rows 0-2 of the input, the second group is rows 3-5. Then the first group is repeated again.\n\nSo for the output, the first three rows are the first three input rows transformed, then the next three are the next three input rows transformed, then the first three again.\n\nBut how to implement this? The output has 9 rows. So for the first three rows of the output, we take the first three input rows, transform them. Then the next three rows are the next three input rows transformed. Then the last three rows are the first three input rows transformed again.\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the output rows 6-8 are the same as rows 0-2. So the output is:\n\noutput_rows = [transformed_group1, transformed_group2, transformed_group1]\n\nWhere group1 is input rows 0-2, group2 is input rows 3-5.\n\nSo the transformation is to take the input rows, split into two groups of three, transform each group into three rows (each row in the group is transformed by replacing 1s with 2s), then output the transformed group1, then transformed group2, then transformed group1 again.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThe input is a list of 6 rows. The output is a list of 9 rows. So the first three rows of the output are the first three input rows transformed. The next three rows are the next three input rows transformed. The last three rows are the first three input rows transformed again.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\nFor each row in the input, replace 1s with 2s. Then, the output is:\n\n[transformed_row0, transformed_row1, transformed_row2, transformed_row3, transformed_row4, transformed_row5, transformed_row0, transformed_row1, transformed_row2]\n\nSo the output is the transformed input rows, followed by the first three transformed rows again.\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the output has 9 rows. The input has 6 rows. So the output is:\n\ntransformed_input_rows[0], transformed_input_rows[1], transformed_input_rows[2], transformed_input_rows[3], transformed_input_rows[4], transformed_input_rows[5], transformed_input_rows[0], transformed_input_rows[1], transformed_input_rows[2]\n\nSo the output is the transformed input rows, then the first three transformed rows again.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each row in the input, replace all 1s with 2s. This is the transformed rows.\n\n2. The output is the transformed rows, then the first three transformed rows again.\n\nSo for example, if the input is 6 rows, the transformed rows are 6 rows. Then, the output is 6 + 3 = 9 rows.\n\nYes, this seems to fit all examples.\n\nLet's check example 1:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0 \u2192 transformed to 0 2 0.\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 \u2192 transformed to 2 2 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 \u2192 transformed to 0 2 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 1 \u2192 transformed to 0 2 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 \u2192 transformed to 0 2 0.\n\nRow 5: 1 1 0 \u2192 transformed to 2 2 0.\n\nSo the transformed rows are:\n\n[0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0, 0 2 2, 0 2 0, 2 2 0]\n\nThen the output is these six rows, followed by the first three rows of the transformed rows:\n\n[0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0, 0 2 2, 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0]\n\nWhich matches the example's output.\n\nSimilarly, example 2:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0 \u2192 transformed to 0 2 0.\n\nRow 1: 1 0 1 \u2192 transformed to 2 0 2.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 \u2192 transformed to 0 2 0.\n\nRow 3: 1 0 1 \u2192 transformed to 2 0 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 \u2192 transformed to 0 2 0.\n\nRow 5: 1 0 1 \u2192 transformed to 2 0 2.\n\nTransformed rows:\n\n[0 2 0, 2 0 2, 0 2 0, 2 0 2, 0 2 0, 2 0 2]\n\nOutput is these six rows, then the first three rows:\n\n[0 2 0, 2 0 2, 0 2 0, 2 0 2, 0 2 0, 2 0 2, 0 2 0, 2 0 2, 0 2 0]\n\nWhich matches the example's output.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0.\n\nRow 1: 1 1 0 \u2192 2 2 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0.\n\nRow 4: 1 1 0 \u2192 2 2 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0.\n\nTransformed rows:\n\n[0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0, 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0]\n\nOutput is these six rows, then first three:\n\n[0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0, 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0, 0 2 0, 2 2 0, 0 2 0]\n\nWhich matches the example's output.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. So the transformation is:\n\n- For each row in the input, replace all 1s with 2s.\n\n- The output is the transformed rows, then the first three transformed rows again.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nTake the input grid, for each row, replace 1s with 2s. Then the output is the transformed rows, then the first three transformed rows again.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Transform each row by replacing 1s with 2s\n    transformed_rows = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = [2 if x == 1 else x for x in row]\n        transformed_rows.append(new_row)\n    # Output is transformed_rows + first three transformed rows\n    output = transformed_rows + transformed_rows[:3]\n    return output\n\nBut wait, the output must be a 9x3 grid. Let's check:\n\ntransformed_rows is 6 rows. Then adding the first three rows gives 6 + 3 = 9 rows. Each row is 3 elements. So that's correct.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach. Let's test this with the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n1 1 1\n\n0 1 0\n\n0 1 0\n\n1 1 1\n\n0 1 0\n\n0 1 0\n\nSo the input is 6 rows. Let's transform each row:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 \u2192 2 2 2.\n\nRow 1: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 1 \u2192 2 2 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 0 \u2192 0 2 0.\n\nTransformed_rows is:\n\n[ [2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0] ]\n\nThen output is transformed_rows + first three rows:\n\n[ [2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0], [2,2,2], [0,2,0], [0,2,0] ]\n\nWhich is 9 rows, each 3 elements. So that's correct.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct transformation.\n"
