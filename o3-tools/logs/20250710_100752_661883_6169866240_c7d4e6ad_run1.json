          "Let's analyze the pattern from both the numeric and visual information:\n\n**From the numeric examples:**\n\n- We have some colored vertical blocks on the left (values like 8 and 2 in example 1, 9, 6, 4 in example 2).\n- The right side has shape blocks mostly with color 5.\n- In the output, the shape blocks that were 5 in input get replaced by the vertical block's color from the same row.\n- The vertical block columns themselves remain unchanged.\n- So basically: The \"shape\" (color 5) is recolored to the vertical block color on the same row.\n\n**From the visual examples:**\n\n- In the training inputs, the left vertical stack has distinct colors.\n- The shape to the right is gray.\n- In the output, the shape is recolored with the same vertical left color but only on the rows where that color is.\n- So the shape morphology is the same, only the shape's color changes to match the vertical stack color at that row.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- For each position in the grid:\n  - If the cell value is 5 (the shape color), replace it by the color of the left vertical block at that row (the first nonzero cell on the left column, presumably index 0 or 1).\n  - Else keep original color.\n\n**Implementation notes:**\n\n- The left blocks occupy the first column (col=0) mostly, sometimes the second column maybe but usually first column.\n- From examples, the vertical color is in col=0.\n- If col=0 is 0, just keep 0.\n- So for each row, find the color in col=0 and replace all 5s in that row by that color.\n- If the color is 0, then don't recolor - let 5 stay as is or set to 0. But from examples, 5s are recolored only if there is a nonzero vertical color at same row.\n\n**Edge cases:**\n\n- Rows with vertical block color 0 => 5 remains unchanged? In examples, rows without vertical color 0 mostly have no 5s.\n- So reasonable to replace 5 by vertical color if vertical color > 0 else keep 5 as 5.\n\n**Apply to test input grid:**\n\n- The vertical colors on left column are 0,0,2,2,3,3,3,4,7,0\n- All 5s get recolored to these respective vertical colors per row.\n\n---\n\nNow I will implement this logic in the code:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Grid size is fixed 10x10 as per problem statement\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]  # deep copy\n    \n    for r in range(10):\n        vertical_color = grid[r][0]\n        if vertical_color > 0:\n            for c in range(10):\n                if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                    transformed[r][c] = vertical_color\n    return transformed\n```"

              "Let's analyze the pattern from both the numeric and visual information:\n\n**From the numeric examples:**\n\n- We have some colored vertical blocks on the left (values like 8 and 2 in example 1, 9, 6, 4 in example 2).\n- The right side has shape blocks mostly with color 5.\n- In the output, the shape blocks that were 5 in input get replaced by the vertical block's color from the same row.\n- The vertical block columns themselves remain unchanged.\n- So basically: The \"shape\" (color 5) is recolored to the vertical block color on the same row.\n\n**From the visual examples:**\n\n- In the training inputs, the left vertical stack has distinct colors.\n- The shape to the right is gray.\n- In the output, the shape is recolored with the same vertical left color but only on the rows where that color is.\n- So the shape morphology is the same, only the shape's color changes to match the vertical stack color at that row.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- For each position in the grid:\n  - If the cell value is 5 (the shape color), replace it by the color of the left vertical block at that row (the first nonzero cell on the left column, presumably index 0 or 1).\n  - Else keep original color.\n\n**Implementation notes:**\n\n- The left blocks occupy the first column (col=0) mostly, sometimes the second column maybe but usually first column.\n- From examples, the vertical color is in col=0.\n- If col=0 is 0, just keep 0.\n- So for each row, find the color in col=0 and replace all 5s in that row by that color.\n- If the color is 0, then don't recolor - let 5 stay as is or set to 0. But from examples, 5s are recolored only if there is a nonzero vertical color at same row.\n\n**Edge cases:**\n\n- Rows with vertical block color 0 => 5 remains unchanged? In examples, rows without vertical color 0 mostly have no 5s.\n- So reasonable to replace 5 by vertical color if vertical color > 0 else keep 5 as 5.\n\n**Apply to test input grid:**\n\n- The vertical colors on left column are 0,0,2,2,3,3,3,4,7,0\n- All 5s get recolored to these respective vertical colors per row.\n\n---\n\nNow I will implement this logic in the code:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Grid size is fixed 10x10 as per problem statement\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]  # deep copy\n    \n    for r in range(10):\n        vertical_color = grid[r][0]\n        if vertical_color > 0:\n            for c in range(10):\n                if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                    transformed[r][c] = vertical_color\n    return transformed\n```"
