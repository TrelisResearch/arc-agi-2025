          "Let's analyze the transformation:\n\nFrom both the textual and visual data:\n\n- Inputs contain vertical color stripes along the left side, and a gray shape (represented by the number 5 in text, or a medium gray in visuals) in the main area.\n- The outputs replace the gray (5) blocks with the color of the left-side vertical stripes at the relevant rows.\n- The vertical stripes on left are kept intact.\n- In the output, anywhere a 5 appeared in the input is replaced by the color in the left-side vertical stripe corresponding to that row.\n- The color on the left most column never changes.\n- Other cells that are not 5 remain unchanged.\n- The shape formed by the 5s becomes colored with the stripe color of that row.\n\nHence:\n\n**Core transformation:**\n- For each row, identify the color in the vertical stripe column(s) on the left.\n- For each cell in that row, if its value is 5, replace it with that left color.\n- Otherwise, keep it.\n\nFrom the visuals:\n- The left stripes are in the first column, with some multicolumn vertical stripes of different colors.\n- Each row has exactly one color on the left that remains the \"color of that row\".\n- The rest of the grid is converted by replacing 5 by that color.\n\nThis matches the textual data where the color on the left (numbers in col 0 or cols 0-1) is used to color the shape cells (5s).\n\n---\n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\n- For each row:\n  - Identify the color in the first non-zero cell(s) on the left \u2014 usually the first column (col 0) or first nonzero cell.\n  - For each cell in the row:\n    - If cell == 5, replace it with that identified color.\n    - Else keep it.\n\nNote: The left stripes may be in only col 0, so picking col 0 value if non-zero should be enough; else 0.\n\n---\n\nLet's implement the transformation in Python.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Copy grid to output\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for r in range(len(grid)):\n        # Identify the left stripe color: first nonzero in first column (col 0)\n        left_color = grid[r][0]\n        # If left_color is 0, leave as zero (no replacement)\n        if left_color == 0:\n            continue\n        for c in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with left stripe color\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = left_color\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

              "Let's analyze the transformation:\n\nFrom both the textual and visual data:\n\n- Inputs contain vertical color stripes along the left side, and a gray shape (represented by the number 5 in text, or a medium gray in visuals) in the main area.\n- The outputs replace the gray (5) blocks with the color of the left-side vertical stripes at the relevant rows.\n- The vertical stripes on left are kept intact.\n- In the output, anywhere a 5 appeared in the input is replaced by the color in the left-side vertical stripe corresponding to that row.\n- The color on the left most column never changes.\n- Other cells that are not 5 remain unchanged.\n- The shape formed by the 5s becomes colored with the stripe color of that row.\n\nHence:\n\n**Core transformation:**\n- For each row, identify the color in the vertical stripe column(s) on the left.\n- For each cell in that row, if its value is 5, replace it with that left color.\n- Otherwise, keep it.\n\nFrom the visuals:\n- The left stripes are in the first column, with some multicolumn vertical stripes of different colors.\n- Each row has exactly one color on the left that remains the \"color of that row\".\n- The rest of the grid is converted by replacing 5 by that color.\n\nThis matches the textual data where the color on the left (numbers in col 0 or cols 0-1) is used to color the shape cells (5s).\n\n---\n\nTherefore, the approach is:\n\n- For each row:\n  - Identify the color in the first non-zero cell(s) on the left \u2014 usually the first column (col 0) or first nonzero cell.\n  - For each cell in the row:\n    - If cell == 5, replace it with that identified color.\n    - Else keep it.\n\nNote: The left stripes may be in only col 0, so picking col 0 value if non-zero should be enough; else 0.\n\n---\n\nLet's implement the transformation in Python.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Copy grid to output\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for r in range(len(grid)):\n        # Identify the left stripe color: first nonzero in first column (col 0)\n        left_color = grid[r][0]\n        # If left_color is 0, leave as zero (no replacement)\n        if left_color == 0:\n            continue\n        for c in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with left stripe color\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = left_color\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"
