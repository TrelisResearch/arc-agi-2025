          "From the training examples and their transformations, a pattern emerges:\n\n- The non-zero colored cells tend to \"extend\" or \"fill\" the grid in the direction of the shape.\n- Specifically, the color and shape seem to move or extend from their original position to other parts of the grid, creating a reflective or directional pattern.\n- In particular:\n  - In Example 1, the vertical line of '2' in the top-right extends downward, forming a vertical bar, then fills horizontally at certain levels.\n  - In Example 2, the '6' in the middle extends downward along a column.\n  - In Example 3, the '8' extends downward, and the '5' at the bottom extends horizontally.\n  - In Example 4, '8' and '6' extend downward and outward, and '7' extends horizontally.\n- The common initial step: identify the non-zero shapes and extend them in a certain pattern (e.g., downward, horizontally, or both).\n- The transformation appears to involve extending the shape along the direction consistent with its initial placement or shape.\n\nIn the test input:\n- There is a '8', an '2', and a '9' (although '9' is not shown, the pattern hints at extending shapes)\n- Since the '8' in the top right is similar to previous '8's, and the '2' at bottom is similar to earlier '2's, I hypothesize the transformation involves extending existing shapes downward or horizontally to fill the grid.\n\n**My hypothesis:**\n**For each distinctive shape (non-zero value), extend it downward within the grid. If the shape is near the top, extend downward; if it appears on the side, extend horizontally.** \n\nGiven incomplete clarity, I will implement a solution where:\n- We detect non-zero shapes\n- For each shape, we try to extend it downward as much as possible\n- We do this for all shapes independently\n- Make sure the output grid is always 6\u00d76\n\nThis captures the pattern of extending shapes downward, noting the common extension in training examples.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n    new_grid = np.zeros_like(grid)\n\n    # For each unique non-zero value, extend downward\n    unique_vals = np.unique(grid)\n    for val in unique_vals:\n        if val == 0:\n            continue\n        # Find all positions with this value\n        positions = np.argwhere(grid == val)\n        for (r, c) in positions:\n            # Extend downward as long as within grid and cell is non-zero\n            for r2 in range(r+1, rows):\n                if grid[r2, c] == 0:\n                    break\n                # extend to this position\n                new_grid[r2, c] = val\n\n        # Keep original shape\n        for (r, c) in positions:\n            new_grid[r, c] = val\n\n        # Optionally, fill the rest of the column downward with the shape's value\n        for (r, c) in positions:\n            for r2 in range(r+1, rows):\n                if new_grid[r2, c] == 0:\n                    new_grid[r2, c] = val\n\n    # Fill in horizontal extensions if needed\n    # For simplicity, extend each row to the right where shape exists\n    for r in range(rows):\n        shape_vals = new_grid[r, :]\n        last_val = 0\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if shape_vals[c] != 0:\n                last_val = shape_vals[c]\n            elif last_val != 0:\n                new_grid[r, c] = last_val\n\n    return new_grid.tolist()\n```"
