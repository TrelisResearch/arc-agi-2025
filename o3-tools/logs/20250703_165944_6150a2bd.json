The last row in the sample output \"2 5 5\" may be an extra pattern in the data, but per the instructions, this is the best fit based on the pattern observed.\n\n- Example 2:\nInput:\n```python\n[\n    [3, 7, 0],\n    [5, 0, 0]\n]\n```\nRotated:\n```python\n[\n    [0, 0, 5],\n    [0, 7, 3]\n]\n```\nwhich matches the first two rows of output exactly.\n\n---\n\n**Given the above analysis, the core transformation is rotation by 180 degrees.** \n\n---\n\n### Final code:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    # Rotate the grid 180 degrees\n    rotated = np.rot90(arr, 2)\n    return rotated.tolist()\n```"
