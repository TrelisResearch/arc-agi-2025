          "Let's analyze the training examples to identify any patterns or transformations. The input grids show various arrangements of colored cells (values 0,1,2, etc.) on a black background. The outputs seem to focus on certain features:\n\n- In all examples, the output is a 1\u00d75 row vector.\n- The outputs tend to highlight some specific features in the input, primarily related to the position or presence of certain colors (particularly the \"2\"s).\n- In the first two examples, the output seems to indicate some kind of \"highlighting\" or \"summary\" of the features associated with the \"2\"s.\n- In the last example before the test, the pattern appears more consistent: the output is a sequence of 1s and 0s, which might encode presence or absence of certain patterns, or perhaps the number of \"2\"s in different regions.\n\nConsidering the test input at the bottom, it resembles the structure of previous data: multiple blue (1) and red (2) cells on a black background. \n\n### Hypotheses:\n- The output could be summarizing the presence or count of \"2\"s in specific regions or overall.\n- The sequence of 5 elements in the output might correspond to features like:\n  1. Are there \"2\"s in the top-left region?\n  2. Are there \"2\"s in the top-right region?\n  3. Are there \"2\"s in the bottom-left region?\n  4. Are there \"2\"s in the bottom-right region?\n  5. Are there \"2\"s in the entire grid?\n\nAnother possibility:\n- The 1s might correspond to certain patterns or counts, and 0s to their absence.\n\n### Simple heuristic based on the above:\n- Count the number of \"2\"s in specific quadrants or halves.\n- Generate a 5-element vector: each element indicates whether \"2\"s are present in a certain region (1 for present, 0 for absent).\n\n### Implementation:\nI'll implement a heuristic that counts \"2\"s in four quadrants + overall presence of \"2\"s.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    # Get dimensions\n    rows, cols = arr.shape\n    \n    # Define quadrants\n    half_row = rows // 2\n    half_col = cols // 2\n    \n    top_left = arr[:half_row, :half_col]\n    top_right = arr[:half_row, half_col:]\n    bottom_left = arr[half_row:, :half_col]\n    bottom_right = arr[half_row:, half_col:]\n    overall = arr\n    \n    def has_twos(region):\n        return 1 if 2 in region else 0\n    \n    # Build output as sequence of indicators\n    output = [\n        has_twos(top_left),\n        has_twos(top_right),\n        has_twos(bottom_left),\n        has_twos(bottom_right),\n        1 if 2 in overall else 0\n    ]\n    return output\n```\n\nThis heuristic should capture a key pattern: whether \"2\"s appear in different regions of the input grid, which aligns with the examples' focus on the presence and location of certain colors.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    # Get dimensions\n    rows, cols = arr.shape\n    \n    # Define quadrants\n    half_row = rows // 2\n    half_col = cols // 2\n    \n    top_left = arr[:half_row, :half_col]\n    top_right = arr[:half_row, half_col:]\n    bottom_left = arr[half_row:, :half_col]\n    bottom_right = arr[half_row:, half_col:]\n    overall = arr\n    \n    def has_twos(region):\n        return 1 if 2 in region else 0\n    \n    # Build output as sequence of indicators\n    output = [\n        has_twos(top_left),\n        has_twos top_right),\n        has_twos(bottom_left),\n        has_twos(bottom_right),\n        1 if 2 in overall else 0\n    ]\n    return output\n```"
