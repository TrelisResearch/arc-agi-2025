          "The previous approach that relied on the top-left pixel frequency didn't generalize well \u2014 only 1 of 4 examples matches, and accuracy drops significantly.\n\n---\n\n**Let's review and analyze the examples from scratch, focusing on the outputs relative to the input:**\n\nWe have 4 training examples, input is always 9x3, output is 3x3.\n\nInput divided into three 3x3 blocks:\n\nBlock 0 = rows 0-2  \nBlock 1 = rows 3-5  \nBlock 2 = rows 6-8\n\nOutputs per example:\n\n| Example | Output Block |\n|---------|--------------|\n| 1       | Block 2      |\n| 2       | Block 1      |\n| 3       | Block 2      |\n| 4       | Block 0      |\n\n---\n\n**Examining the outputs in detail:**\n\n- They always correspond exactly to one of the three blocks, no mixing or transformation.\n\n- That means the key is to identify which of the three input blocks is the output.\n\n---\n\n**Next, what characterizes the output block?**\n\nSome ideas to try:\n\n1. The output block contains the most frequent color overall in the grid.\n\n2. The output block contains the most occurrences of some \"special\" pixel value.\n\n3. The output block has the highest average or median color.\n\n4. The output block contains a \"special\" color from the bottom-right corner.\n\n5. The output block has certain color continuity or repetition.\n\n---\n\n**Testing hypothesis 1: The block that contains the most frequent color in entire grid**\n\n- For each example, find the most frequent color in the entire 9x3 input.\n\n- See in which block that color appears most.\n\n**Example 1**\n\nInput colors and frequencies (rough):\n\n- 8 appears frequently, many times in top two blocks and bottom block.\n\n- 4 appears mainly in block 2 (last block).\n\n- Most frequent color likely 8 or 4.\n\nCounting:\n\n- 8 frequency: rows 0-2 (6 times), 3-5 (few times?), 6-8 (6 times)\n\n- 4 frequency: only in block 2? yes - about 6\n\nSince output is block 2, the block with lots of 4s, maybe 4 is the most frequent color in the whole grid (or tied), so block 2 contains the most frequent color count.\n\n**Example 2**\n\nInput colors frequencies:\n\n- 3 is abundant in middle block.\n\n- 1 and 5 mostly in top block.\n\n- 7 and 2 mostly in bottom block.\n\nCount 3: dominates block 1.\n\nLikely 3 is the most frequent overall.\n\nOutput block 1 matches.\n\n**Example 3**\n\nColors 2,3 in top block, 5,7 in middle, 8,1 in bottom.\n\nCount 8s: appear many times in last block.\n\nOutput block 2 matches block with dominant color 8.\n\n**Example 4**\n\nColors:\n\n- Block 0: 8,4\n\n- Block 1: 1,3\n\n- Block 2: 6,2\n\nChecking frequencies, 4 and 8 seem frequent overall, block 0 contains both and it is output block.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion from hypothesis 1:**\n\nThe output block is the one that contains the **most frequent color overall** in the grid.\n\n---\n\n**Algorithm based on that:**\n\n- Count color frequencies in entire grid.\n\n- Find the color with maximum frequency.\n\n- For each block, count how many times that color appears inside.\n\n- Return the block with the highest count of that color.\n\n---\n\nLet's verify the example 2 corner case:\n\nIf multiple blocks have same count, pick the first (topmost) block.\n\n---\n\n**Implementing this logic:**\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Split into 3 blocks\n    blocks = [grid[i*3:(i+1)*3] for i in range(3)]\n    \n    # Flatten entire grid to count color occurrences\n    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]\n    \n    # Find most frequent color in entire grid\n    from collections import Counter\n    counts = Counter(flat)\n    max_color, max_count = counts.most_common(1)[0]\n    \n    # Find which block contains most occurrences of this color\n    block_color_counts = []\n    for b in blocks:\n        b_flat = [cell for row in b for cell in row]\n        block_color_counts.append(b_flat.count(max_color))\n    \n    max_block_idx = block_color_counts.index(max(block_color_counts))\n    \n    return blocks[max_block_idx]\n```\n"

Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n8 9 8\n9 8 8\n8 8 8\n2 2 1\n2 2 1\n1 1 2\n4 4 4\n4 4 3\n3 3 3\nOutput:\n4 4 4\n4 4 3\n3 3 3\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n1 5 5\n5 1 1\n5 1 1\n3 3 3\n3 6 3\n3 6 6\n7 7 7\n7 2 2\n7 2 2\nOutput:\n3 3 3\n3 6 3\n3 6 6\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n2 2 2\n2 2 3\n2 3 3\n5 7 7\n7 5 5\n7 5 5\n8 8 1\n1 8 1\n1 8 1\nOutput:\n8 8 1\n1 8 1\n1 8 1\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n8 8 4\n4 4 4\n4 4 8\n1 1 3\n1 3 3\n3 3 1\n6 2 2\n2 2 2\n2 2 6\nOutput:\n8 8 4\n4 4 4\n4 4 8\n\nTest Input:\n5 4 4\n4 5 4\n4 5 4\n3 3 2\n3 3 2\n2 2 3\n1 1 1\n1 8 8\n1 8 8\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

The output block contains the most frequent color overall in the grid.\n\n2. The output block contains the most occurrences of some \"special\" pixel value.\n\n3. The output block has the highest average or median color.\n\n4. The output block contains a \"special\" color from the bottom-right corner.\n\n5. The output block has certain color continuity or repetition.\n\n---\n\n**Testing hypothesis 1: The block that contains the most frequent color in entire grid**\n\n- For each example, find the most frequent color in the entire 9x3 input.\n\n- See in which block that color appears most.\n\n**Example 1**\n\nInput colors and frequencies (rough):\n\n- 8 appears frequently, many times in top two blocks and bottom block.\n\n- 4 appears mainly in block 2 (last block).\n\n- Most frequent color likely 8 or 4.\n\nCounting:\n\n- 8 frequency: rows 0-2 (6 times), 3-5 (few times?), 6-8 (6 times)\n\n- 4 frequency: only in block 2? yes - about 6\n\nSince output is block 2, the block with lots of 4s, maybe 4 is the most frequent color in the whole grid (or tied), so block 2 contains the most frequent color count.\n\n**Example 2**\n\nInput colors frequencies:\n\n- 3 is abundant in middle block.\n\n- 1 and 5 mostly in top block.\n\n- 7 and 2 mostly in bottom block.\n\nCount 3: dominates block 1.\n\nLikely 3 is the most frequent overall.\n\nOutput block 1 matches.\n\n**Example 3**\n\nColors 2,3 in top block, 5,7 in middle, 8,1 in bottom.\n\nCount 8s: appear many times in last block.\n\nOutput block 2 matches block with dominant color 8.\n\n**Example 4**\n\nColors:\n\n- Block 0: 8,4\n\n- Block 1: 1,3\n\n- Block 2: 6,2\n\nChecking frequencies, 4 and 8 seem frequent overall, block 0 contains both and it is output block.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion from hypothesis 1:**\n\nThe output block is the one that contains the **most frequent color overall** in the grid.\n\n---\n\n**Algorithm based on that:**\n\n- Count color frequencies in entire grid.\n\n- Find the color with maximum frequency.\n\n- For each block, count how many times that color appears inside.\n\n- Return the block with the highest count of that color.\n\n---\n\nLet's verify the example 2 corner case:\n\nIf multiple blocks have same count, pick the first (topmost) block.\n\n---\n\n**Implementing this logic:**\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Split into 3 blocks\n    blocks = [grid[i*3:(i+1)*3] for i in range(3)]\n    \n    # Flatten entire grid to count color occurrences\n    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]\n    \n    # Find most frequent color in entire grid\n    from collections import Counter\n    counts = Counter(flat)\n    max_color, max_count = counts.most_common(1)[0]\n    \n    # Find which block contains most occurrences of this color\n    block_color_counts = []\n    for b in blocks:\n        b_flat = [cell for row in b for cell in row]\n        block_color_counts.append(b_flat.count(max_color))\n    \n    max_block_idx = block_color_counts.index(max(block_color_counts))\n    \n    return blocks[max_block_idx]\n```\n"
