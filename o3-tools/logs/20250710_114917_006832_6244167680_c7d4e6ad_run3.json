          "Let's analyze the examples carefully:\n\nObservations:\n- The input grids have several vertical colored bars on the left; each bar is uniformly colored in a column segment.\n- There is a shape made of a constant color (usually gray) somewhere in the grid.\n- Output modifies the vertical bar colors on the left: for each colored vertical bar in the left columns of input, the same color \"paint\" is spread horizontally to some parts of the shape.\n- The shape's gray cells get recolored corresponding to the vertical bars adjacent horizontally to them.\n- For example 1 (colors 8 and 2):\n  - The 8 vertical bar cells remain 8 in the output.\n  - The shape parts that are next to these vertical bars are also converted to 8.\n  - Similarly for 2.\n- Example 2 is similar.\n- The pattern is to spread vertically the left colored bar's number horizontally to the connected shape's cell adjacency.\n\nVisual from examples:\n- Vertical bars on the left seem to \"paint\" the shape cells of the same row with the vertical bar's color.\n- The gray shapes are recolored in the output by replacing their gray value with the corresponding vertical bar color that is adjacent to them horizontally.\n- Non-shape black cells (0s) remain zero.\n\nHYPOTHESIS for transformation:\n- Identify vertical color bars on the left side columns (likely first column(s) that contain consistent colors in vertical segments).\n- The \"shape\" cells inside the grid (those with some color different from 0 and left bar colors) are modified:\n  - For each shape cell, find the color of the vertical bar at its row in the left area (within a few left columns).\n  - Replace the shape cell's color with that vertical bar color.\n- Cells that are zero or part of the vertical bar remain as is.\n\nThis also explains the test input:\n- We have vertical bars with several colors in the first column.\n- The grayish shape cells inside should be replaced by the vertical bar color for the same row.\n\nImplementation plan:\n- Identify distinct vertical bars in the first column (or possibly first few columns if vertical bars span multiple columns).\n- Create a mapping from row to vertical bar color, by scanning left column(s).\n- For each cell in the grid:\n  - If it's part of the shape (non-zero and not a color of the vertical bars column), replace it with the vertical bar color in that row.\n  - Else keep as is.\n\nWe need to be careful if shapes and vertical bars share colors (from examples, shape colors are different from vertical bar colors, or the shape is gray). So just replace cells different from 0 and not matching vertical bar color with the left vertical bar color in that row.\n\nAlso, since vertical bars can be multiple colored bars stacked vertically, the vertical bar for a row is just the color in the first column of that row.\n\nCode will:\n\n- Copy input grid to output grid\n- For each row:\n  - Find color of the vertical bar at col=0 (leftmost)\n  - For each col:\n    - If cell value != 0 and != vertical_bar_color_for_row:\n      - Replace with vertical_bar_color_for_row\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Copy grid to output with the same size 10x10\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for r in range(10):\n        vertical_bar_color = grid[r][0]\n        for c in range(10):\n            val = grid[r][c]\n            if val != 0 and val != vertical_bar_color:\n                # Replace shape with vertical bar color\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = vertical_bar_color\n            else:\n                # leave as is (including zeros)\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = val\n    return transformed_grid\n```"

              "Let's analyze the examples carefully:\n\nObservations:\n- The input grids have several vertical colored bars on the left; each bar is uniformly colored in a column segment.\n- There is a shape made of a constant color (usually gray) somewhere in the grid.\n- Output modifies the vertical bar colors on the left: for each colored vertical bar in the left columns of input, the same color \"paint\" is spread horizontally to some parts of the shape.\n- The shape's gray cells get recolored corresponding to the vertical bars adjacent horizontally to them.\n- For example 1 (colors 8 and 2):\n  - The 8 vertical bar cells remain 8 in the output.\n  - The shape parts that are next to these vertical bars are also converted to 8.\n  - Similarly for 2.\n- Example 2 is similar.\n- The pattern is to spread vertically the left colored bar's number horizontally to the connected shape's cell adjacency.\n\nVisual from examples:\n- Vertical bars on the left seem to \"paint\" the shape cells of the same row with the vertical bar's color.\n- The gray shapes are recolored in the output by replacing their gray value with the corresponding vertical bar color that is adjacent to them horizontally.\n- Non-shape black cells (0s) remain zero.\n\nHYPOTHESIS for transformation:\n- Identify vertical color bars on the left side columns (likely first column(s) that contain consistent colors in vertical segments).\n- The \"shape\" cells inside the grid (those with some color different from 0 and left bar colors) are modified:\n  - For each shape cell, find the color of the vertical bar at its row in the left area (within a few left columns).\n  - Replace the shape cell's color with that vertical bar color.\n- Cells that are zero or part of the vertical bar remain as is.\n\nThis also explains the test input:\n- We have vertical bars with several colors in the first column.\n- The grayish shape cells inside should be replaced by the vertical bar color for the same row.\n\nImplementation plan:\n- Identify distinct vertical bars in the first column (or possibly first few columns if vertical bars span multiple columns).\n- Create a mapping from row to vertical bar color, by scanning left column(s).\n- For each cell in the grid:\n  - If it's part of the shape (non-zero and not a color of the vertical bars column), replace it with the vertical bar color in that row.\n  - Else keep as is.\n\nWe need to be careful if shapes and vertical bars share colors (from examples, shape colors are different from vertical bar colors, or the shape is gray). So just replace cells different from 0 and not matching vertical bar color with the left vertical bar color in that row.\n\nAlso, since vertical bars can be multiple colored bars stacked vertically, the vertical bar for a row is just the color in the first column of that row.\n\nCode will:\n\n- Copy input grid to output grid\n- For each row:\n  - Find color of the vertical bar at col=0 (leftmost)\n  - For each col:\n    - If cell value != 0 and != vertical_bar_color_for_row:\n      - Replace with vertical_bar_color_for_row\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Copy grid to output with the same size 10x10\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for r in range(10):\n        vertical_bar_color = grid[r][0]\n        for c in range(10):\n            val = grid[r][c]\n            if val != 0 and val != vertical_bar_color:\n                # Replace shape with vertical bar color\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = vertical_bar_color\n            else:\n                # leave as is (including zeros)\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = val\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
