          "Analyzing the training examples and the transformations:\n\n- The inputs are grids consisting of various colors (values).\n- The outputs typically show a pattern where certain geometric shapes (like crosses or other motifs) are extracted or emphasized, while other parts become filled with distinct colors or patterns.\n- Many examples involve isolating a recognizable shape (like a cross) from the input and then filling or overlaying a large, uniform area (like a green or red rectangle).\n- Some examples differentiate the shapes numerically or with identified patterns, and then color the background accordingly.\n- The common theme appears to be acquiring a specific pattern (e.g., a shape or symmetry) at the center or prominent part of the grid, then filling the rest with a solid color.\n- The output always maintains a 30\u00d730 size grid.\n- The shapes are often composed of specific pixel arrangements.\n\nGiven the test input (yellow pattern on a black background) and the trend, a plausible transformation could involve:\n\n- Extracting or emphasizing the pattern (the yellow shapes).\n- Filling the background with a uniform color (likely black).\n- Possibly aligning the pattern centrally or to form a rectangular or symmetrical motif.\n- Since the previous examples involve overlaying large uniform areas (like green or red), the method might be to isolate the shapes and then create a contrasting background.\n\n**Best Hypothesis/Implementation:**\n\n- Detect the non-zero values (in this case, 4s or yellow).\n- Turn these pixels into a specific color or value (say 5 for consistency).\n- Fill the rest of the grid with black (0).\n\nThis aligns with the idea of extracting the shape and strengthening it against a black background.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert to numpy array for easier processing\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    # Initialize an empty 30x30 grid filled with black (0)\n    output = np.zeros((30,30), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Threshold to define the pattern: considering non-zero values as pattern pixels\n    pattern_mask = arr != 0\n    \n    # Assign a specific value (say 5) to pattern pixels\n    output[pattern_mask] = 5\n    \n    # The rest remains black (or background)\n    \n    # Return as list of lists\n    return output.tolist()\n```\n\nThis code captures the pattern extraction: it identifies non-zero pixels in the input, highlights them with a unique number (e.g., 5), and fills the rest with black (0). This approach resonates with the observed extraction and emphasis of shapes in training examples.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```"

              "Analyzing the training examples and the transformations:\n\n- The inputs are grids consisting of various colors (values).\n- The outputs typically show a pattern where certain geometric shapes (like crosses or other motifs) are extracted or emphasized, while other parts become filled with distinct colors or patterns.\n- Many examples involve isolating a recognizable shape (like a cross) from the input and then filling or overlaying a large, uniform area (like a green or red rectangle).\n- Some examples differentiate the shapes numerically or with identified patterns, and then color the background accordingly.\n- The common theme appears to be acquiring a specific pattern (e.g., a shape or symmetry) at the center or prominent part of the grid, then filling the rest with a solid color.\n- The output always maintains a 30\u00d730 size grid.\n- The shapes are often composed of specific pixel arrangements.\n\nGiven the test input (yellow pattern on a black background) and the trend, a plausible transformation could involve:\n\n- Extracting or emphasizing the pattern (the yellow shapes).\n- Filling the background with a uniform color (likely black).\n- Possibly aligning the pattern centrally or to form a rectangular or symmetrical motif.\n- Since the previous examples involve overlaying large uniform areas (like green or red), the method might be to isolate the shapes and then create a contrasting background.\n\n**Best Hypothesis/Implementation:**\n\n- Detect the non-zero values (in this case, 4s or yellow).\n- Turn these pixels into a specific color or value (say 5 for consistency).\n- Fill the rest of the grid with black (0).\n\nThis aligns with the idea of extracting the shape and strengthening it against a black background.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert to numpy array for easier processing\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    # Initialize an empty 30x30 grid filled with black (0)\n    output = np.zeros((30,30), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Threshold to define the pattern: considering non-zero values as pattern pixels\n    pattern_mask = arr != 0\n    \n    # Assign a specific value (say 5) to pattern pixels\n    output[pattern_mask] = 5\n    \n    # The rest remains black (or background)\n    \n    # Return as list of lists\n    return output.tolist()\n```\n\nThis code captures the pattern extraction: it identifies non-zero pixels in the input, highlights them with a unique number (e.g., 5), and fills the rest with black (0). This approach resonates with the observed extraction and emphasis of shapes in training examples.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
