We pick an input row via `r mod input_height` so that the color sequence repeats cyclically if the output is larger than the input.\n- For each recorded relative offset and color in that input row, we place the color at column `start_col + r + rel_off` in the output. This achieves the diagonal slope of +1 and repeats the pattern.\n- Any placements that would fall outside the 12\u00d712 boundary are skipped.\n- Finally, we return the constructed grid."

We pick an input row via `r mod input_height` so that the color sequence repeats cyclically if the output is larger than the input.\n- For each recorded relative offset and color in that input row, we place the color at column `start_col + r + rel_off` in the output. This achieves the diagonal slope of +1 and repeats the pattern.\n- Any placements that would fall outside the 12\u00d712 boundary are skipped.\n- Finally, we return the constructed grid."
