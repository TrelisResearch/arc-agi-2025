          "Let's analyze the training examples carefully:\n\nObservations from training examples and outputs:\n\n1. Each training input is a 10x10 grid with colored dots spread around.\n2. The output is also a 10x10 grid.\n3. The output grids show vertical stacks along the left columns:\n   - Column 0: Blue blocks, in increasing count top to bottom, starting from row 2 or 3 downwards to row 9\n   - Next columns are filled similarly with other colors in increasing count downward.\n4. The output stacks colors in columns in ascending order of their numeric color ID. For example:\n   - In example 1 output, column 0: 1's, column 1: 2's, column 2: 3's, column 3: 4's\n   - In example 2 output, same pattern: columns 0 to 3 contain colors 1 to 4 stacked vertically from near bottom upwards.\n5. The heights of stacks correspond roughly to the maximum count of each color in the input grid.\n6. The colors in 1-4 appear stacked vertically starting from the bottom rows upwards in the output.\n7. Other colors like 0 (background) are zero in output.\n8. The output forms a kind of vertical bar chart representing counts of colors 1,2,3,4:\n   - Count each color 1 to 4 in the input\n   - For each color c in (1,2,3,4), fill column c-1 with c's starting from bottom row upwards, count times\n9. The position of the stacks always starts from bottom row 9 upwards to row (9-count+1).\n\nHypothesis for transformation:\n\n- Count the number of occurrences of each color 1 to 4.\n- For each such color c, fill the output grid column (c-1) with that color repeated count times placed from bottom to up.\n- All other positions are zero.\n\nThis perfectly explains outputs.\n\nLet's implement this in Python.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize a 10x10 output grid filled with 0\n    output = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Count occurrences of colors 1 to 4\n    counts = [0,0,0,0]  # index 0 for color 1, etc.\n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            if 1 <= val <= 4:\n                counts[val-1] += 1\n    \n    # For each color 1 to 4, fill column c-1 from bottom up with c repeated count times\n    for c in range(1,5):\n        count = counts[c-1]\n        col = c-1\n        for i in range(count):\n            output[9 - i][col] = c\n\n    return output\n```\n"

              "Let's analyze the training examples carefully:\n\nObservations from training examples and outputs:\n\n1. Each training input is a 10x10 grid with colored dots spread around.\n2. The output is also a 10x10 grid.\n3. The output grids show vertical stacks along the left columns:\n   - Column 0: Blue blocks, in increasing count top to bottom, starting from row 2 or 3 downwards to row 9\n   - Next columns are filled similarly with other colors in increasing count downward.\n4. The output stacks colors in columns in ascending order of their numeric color ID. For example:\n   - In example 1 output, column 0: 1's, column 1: 2's, column 2: 3's, column 3: 4's\n   - In example 2 output, same pattern: columns 0 to 3 contain colors 1 to 4 stacked vertically from near bottom upwards.\n5. The heights of stacks correspond roughly to the maximum count of each color in the input grid.\n6. The colors in 1-4 appear stacked vertically starting from the bottom rows upwards in the output.\n7. Other colors like 0 (background) are zero in output.\n8. The output forms a kind of vertical bar chart representing counts of colors 1,2,3,4:\n   - Count each color 1 to 4 in the input\n   - For each color c in (1,2,3,4), fill column c-1 with c's starting from bottom row upwards, count times\n9. The position of the stacks always starts from bottom row 9 upwards to row (9-count+1).\n\nHypothesis for transformation:\n\n- Count the number of occurrences of each color 1 to 4.\n- For each such color c, fill the output grid column (c-1) with that color repeated count times placed from bottom to up.\n- All other positions are zero.\n\nThis perfectly explains outputs.\n\nLet's implement this in Python.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize a 10x10 output grid filled with 0\n    output = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Count occurrences of colors 1 to 4\n    counts = [0,0,0,0]  # index 0 for color 1, etc.\n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            if 1 <= val <= 4:\n                counts[val-1] += 1\n    \n    # For each color 1 to 4, fill column c-1 from bottom up with c repeated count times\n    for c in range(1,5):\n        count = counts[c-1]\n        col = c-1\n        for i in range(count):\n            output[9 - i][col] = c\n\n    return output\n```\n"
