          "Let's analyze the transformation step by step using both the visual and numerical grid representations:\n\n## Pattern Analysis\n\n### 1. The key observation\n- The *small colored region* at the bottom (example 1) or top-left (example 2) of the input is \"copied\" to all the *gray 5-block* regions in the main part of the grid (those are 3x3 blocks surrounded in gray). But not literally; the *colors within the block* are transferred based on which block of the mini-pattern corresponds to which block of the square grid.\n- *Gray 5's* in the big part of the grid become colored based on the small pattern region.\n\n### 2. How it works, step by step\n- The small (color) pattern is M x N in size. Each 3x3 'gray' block in the main field is assigned a corresponding cell from this small pattern. \n- The mapping: for each 3x3 block at (big_row, big_col), its color comes from (mini_row, mini_col) in the mini-pattern (wrap/clip/ignore if not exactly matching).\n- The color appears to be used as: every 5 in the 3x3 block becomes the mini-pattern's value; zeros remain zero.\n- The position of the \"mini\" pattern in the input is given by the only non-overlapping colored region. The rest of the grid is black/zeros, so we can find this region.\n\n### 3. What changes:\n- The main field's structure (positions of the 3x3 blocks) remains the same, but the 5's within those blocks are replaced with color values taken from the mini-pattern in some manner.\n\n### 4. Placement:\n- The mini-pattern stays in its original position in the output.\n\n## Algorithm steps\n\n1. Find the bounding box of the nonzero \"mini\" pattern (excluding repetitive grids).\n2. For the main field, for each 3x3 block, find the corresponding color in the mini pattern (using its block-index as row/col of mini-pattern).\n3. Replace the 5's in the 3x3 block with that color.\n4. All other cells (zeros) remain zero.\n5. Copy the mini-pattern block as is to its old place.\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- Identify the mini-pattern region (get bounds of non-black block that isn't one of the 3x3 repeated blocks).\n- Loop through all positions. For each 3x3 block, determine which cell in the mini-pattern to use, and fill in color wherever there was a 5.\n- Copy over the mini-pattern region from input to output.\n\n## Edge details\n\n- 3x3 blocks arrangement is regular, so we can find the top-most/left-most one and step by 3s.\n- The mini-pattern could be placed anywhere; we need to retain it.\n- Must always return a 23x23 grid.\n- From training, mini-pattern colors only fill corresponding blocks (e.g., mini[1,2] color is applied to all 5's in the matching 3x3 block).\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = arr.shape\n    \n    # Step 1: Identify the \"mini-pattern\" region = colored, not part of the main gray grid\n    # The mini-pattern: Find the bounding box of the largest nonzero region that is not a gray 3x3 block.\n    # Heuristic: gray squares are 5, mini-pattern never contains 5\n    \n    # Find all nonzero, non-5 cells to get the minipattern bounding box\n    non_gray = np.logical_and(arr != 0, arr != 5)\n    if not np.any(non_gray):\n        return arr.tolist()  # degenerate case\n    \n    rows, cols = np.where(non_gray)\n    min_r, max_r = rows.min(), rows.max()+1\n    min_c, max_c = cols.min(), cols.max()+1\n    mini_pattern = arr[min_r:max_r, min_c:max_c].copy()\n    mini_h, mini_w = mini_pattern.shape\n\n    # Step 2: Find the 3x3 grid blocks\n    # Approach: scan for top-left of each 3x3 block (block has shape: 3x3, with 5's framing the center, 0's at corners)\n    # The top-left of a 3x3 block is identified by the pattern:\n    # arr[r:r+3, c:c+3] with [5,5,5]\n    #                      [5,0,5]\n    #                      [5,5,5] or similar, but actually looking above: e.g. [5,5,5][5,0,5][5,5,5] \n    # Actually, in the training examples, the blocks are in a certain field; 0-padding outside.\n    \n    # for each 3x3 block top-left, assign it mini_pattern color at [block_row,block_col]\n    out = arr.copy()\n    \n    # Determine \"main grid\" start/end by where the uppermost/leftmost 3x3 blocks consisting of 5's start:\n    # Assume first set of blocks is at least 1 away from wall\n    block_topleft_rows = []\n    block_topleft_cols = []\n    for r in range(h-2):\n        for c in range(w-2):\n            block = arr[r:r+3, c:c+3]\n            # Check if this block is a (square) frame:\n            if ((block[1,1]==0 or block[1,1]!=5) and \n                np.all(block[[0,0,0,1,1,2,2,2],[0,1,2,0,2,0,1,2]] == 5)):\n                block_topleft_rows.append(r)\n                block_topleft_cols.append(c)\n    if not block_topleft_rows:\n        return out.tolist()  # no blocks found\n    # Group by rows and cols\n    block_topleft_rows = sorted(set(block_topleft_rows))\n    block_topleft_cols = sorted(set(block_topleft_cols))\n    \n    # Build mapping from block grid to mini-pattern\n    for idx_r, r in enumerate(block_topleft_rows):\n        for idx_c, c in enumerate(block_topleft_cols):\n            color_r = idx_r % mini_h\n            color_c = idx_c % mini_w\n            color = mini_pattern[color_r, color_c]\n            # Paint over this 3x3 block\n            for dr in range(3):\n                for dc in range(3):\n                    if arr[r+dr, c+dc] == 5:\n                        out[r+dr, c+dc] = color\n                        \n    # Step 3: restore the mini-pattern region as is (in case any blocks overlapped),\n    # copy all of arr[min_r:max_r, min_c:max_c] to those coords in out\n    out[min_r:max_r, min_c:max_c] = arr[min_r:max_r, min_c:max_c]\n    \n    return out.tolist()\n```"

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 23\u00d723 output grid.**\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 5

rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

          "Let's analyze the transformation step by step using both the visual and numerical grid representations:\n\n## Pattern Analysis\n\n### 1. The key observation\n- The *small colored region* at the bottom (example 1) or top-left (example 2) of the input is \"copied\" to all the *gray 5-block* regions in the main part of the grid (those are 3x3 blocks surrounded in gray). But not literally; the *colors within the block* are transferred based on which block of the mini-pattern corresponds to which block of the square grid.\n- *Gray 5's* in the big part of the grid become colored based on the small pattern region.\n\n### 2. How it works, step by step\n- The small (color) pattern is M x N in size. Each 3x3 'gray' block in the main field is assigned a corresponding cell from this small pattern. \n- The mapping: for each 3x3 block at (big_row, big_col), its color comes from (mini_row, mini_col) in the mini-pattern (wrap/clip/ignore if not exactly matching).\n- The color appears to be used as: every 5 in the 3x3 block becomes the mini-pattern's value; zeros remain zero.\n- The position of the \"mini\" pattern in the input is given by the only non-overlapping colored region. The rest of the grid is black/zeros, so we can find this region.\n\n### 3. What changes:\n- The main field's structure (positions of the 3x3 blocks) remains the same, but the 5's within those blocks are replaced with color values taken from the mini-pattern in some manner.\n\n### 4. Placement:\n- The mini-pattern stays in its original position in the output.\n\n## Algorithm steps\n\n1. Find the bounding box of the nonzero \"mini\" pattern (excluding repetitive grids).\n2. For the main field, for each 3x3 block, find the corresponding color in the mini pattern (using its block-index as row/col of mini-pattern).\n3. Replace the 5's in the 3x3 block with that color.\n4.

              "Let's analyze the transformation step by step using both the visual and numerical grid representations:\n\n## Pattern Analysis\n\n### 1. The key observation\n- The *small colored region* at the bottom (example 1) or top-left (example 2) of the input is \"copied\" to all the *gray 5-block* regions in the main part of the grid (those are 3x3 blocks surrounded in gray). But not literally; the *colors within the block* are transferred based on which block of the mini-pattern corresponds to which block of the square grid.\n- *Gray 5's* in the big part of the grid become colored based on the small pattern region.\n\n### 2. How it works, step by step\n- The small (color) pattern is M x N in size. Each 3x3 'gray' block in the main field is assigned a corresponding cell from this small pattern. \n- The mapping: for each 3x3 block at (big_row, big_col), its color comes from (mini_row, mini_col) in the mini-pattern (wrap/clip/ignore if not exactly matching).\n- The color appears to be used as: every 5 in the 3x3 block becomes the mini-pattern's value; zeros remain zero.\n- The position of the \"mini\" pattern in the input is given by the only non-overlapping colored region. The rest of the grid is black/zeros, so we can find this region.\n\n### 3. What changes:\n- The main field's structure (positions of the 3x3 blocks) remains the same, but the 5's within those blocks are replaced with color values taken from the mini-pattern in some manner.\n\n### 4. Placement:\n- The mini-pattern stays in its original position in the output.\n\n## Algorithm steps\n\n1. Find the bounding box of the nonzero \"mini\" pattern (excluding repetitive grids).\n2. For the main field, for each 3x3 block, find the corresponding color in the mini pattern (using its block-index as row/col of mini-pattern).\n3. Replace the 5's in the 3x3 block with that color.\n4. All other cells (zeros) remain zero.\n5. Copy the mini-pattern block as is to its old place.\n\n## Implementation plan\n\n- Identify the mini-pattern region (get bounds of non-black block that isn't one of the 3x3 repeated blocks).\n- Loop through all positions.
