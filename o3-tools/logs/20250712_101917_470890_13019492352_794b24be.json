The rest are always zeros.\n- For most outputs, the first row has values of 2. Sometimes only the first positions are filled in (e.g., [2,0,0]), sometimes [2,2,0], occasionally [2,2,2]. Occasionally, the second row, first column, is also a 2.\n- The color \u201c2\u201d replaces all blue (\"1\") input cells, but only in the top rows of the output.\n\n**How does the transformation happen?**\n\n- It appears that all \u201c1\u201ds (blue cells) in the input are mapped LEFT-TO-RIGHT onto the output's first row, one after the other. If there are more than 3, the 4th+ blue \"1\"s continue on the next row down, left-to-right (second row).\n  - Example 8 Input: `1 1 0 / 0 0 0 / 1 0 1` (four blue 1's in: (0,0), (0,1), (2,0), (2,2))\n      - Output: [2,2,2] / [0,2,0] / [0,0,0]\n      - First three \"1\"s go to row 0: (0,0), (0,1), (0,2) as \"2\"\n      - Next one to (1,1)\n- If there are only one or two blue 1's, only output [2,0,0] or [2,2,0]\n- The mapping is: for blue 1's in row-major order, write 2's in output in order: left-to-right in row 0, then row 1, etc.\n   - (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n   - But the examples never have more than four blue pixels.\n\n# So, the rule:\nTake all \u201c1\u201ds in input, in row-major order, and set the output\u2019s cells to 2 left-to-right top-down, filling across the first row, then the second, etc. All other cells are 0.\n\n# Implementation Plan\n\n- Locate all positions of 1's in input, in row-major order.\n- For k-th \"1\" (starting from k=0), set output cell at (k//3, k%3) = 2\n- All other cells = 0\n\n# Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Output is always 3x3\n    out = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    positions = []\n    # Collect positions of '1's in row-major order\n    for r in range(3):\n        for c in range(3):\n            if grid[r][c] == 1:\n                positions.append((r, c))\n    # Map each to output left-to-right, top-to-bottom\n    for k, _ in enumerate(positions):\n        out[k//3][k%3] = 2\n    return out\n```\n"
