We locate the single color-2 cell, starting from the bottom of the grid.\n2. We then draw a 45\u00b0 diagonal band from that cell upwards and to the right.\n   - At each step `i`, we place a 2 at `(r0-i, c0+i)` if in bounds.\n   - For `i>0`, we also place a 2 at `(r0-i, c0+i-1)` to create a two-pixel thick diagonal.\n   - The process stops once the row goes above the grid.\nThis matches the training examples\u2019 pattern of extending a \u201chypotenuse\u201d of thickness two (except at the initial point) from the input 2."

We locate the single color-2 cell, starting from the bottom of the grid.\n2. We then draw a 45\u00b0 diagonal band from that cell upwards and to the right.\n   - At each step `i`, we place a 2 at `(r0-i, c0+i)` if in bounds.\n   - For `i>0`, we also place a 2 at `(r0-i, c0+i-1)` to create a two-pixel thick diagonal.\n   - The process stops once the row goes above the grid.\nThis matches the training examples\u2019 pattern of extending a \u201chypotenuse\u201d of thickness two (except at the initial point) from the input 2."
