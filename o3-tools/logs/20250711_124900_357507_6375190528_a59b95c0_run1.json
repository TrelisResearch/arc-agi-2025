              "Let's analyze the training examples both from the textual data and the visual clues:\n\n**Observations:**\n\n1. **Output Sizes:**  \n   Every output is larger than the input, and dimensions vary, but the problem says output must always be 9\u00d79.  \n   The examples' outputs have been tiled or patterned expansions of the input grids, but sometimes with different repetition patterns.\n\n2. **Pattern of Expansion:**  \n   - Example 1: Input is 3\u00d73, output is 9\u00d79 \u2014 replicating the 3\u00d73 block in a 3x3 tile formation (repeated 3 times horizontally and vertically). This is like tiling the original input 3x3 times.\n   - Example 2 and 4: Outputs are 6\u00d76 \u2014 input blocks repeated twice horizontally and vertically.\n   - Example 3 and 5: Outputs have been repeated 4 or 3 times, producing larger outputs.\n\n   So the output size equals input size multiplied by the number of horizontal and vertical repeats.\n\n3. **Key insight:**  \n   The output grids appear to be formed by **tiling the input block several times horizontally and vertically**.\n\n4. **Number of repeats:**  \n   It varies:\n   - Sometimes it's 3x3 (Example 1 and 5)\n   - Sometimes 2x2 (Example 2 and 4)\n   - Sometimes 4x3 (Example 3, more complex)\n\n5. **Problem constraint:**  \n   We MUST produce a 9x9 output grid. So, given the inputs are always 3x3 (from the training examples and test input), the safe approach is to tile the input to fill 9x9 by replicating the 3x3 input block 3x3 times.\n\n6. **Given this and the problem instructions, the best generalization is:**\n\n   **Tile the input grid 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically to create the 9x9 output grid.**\n\nThis simple hypothesis fits:\n\n- The first example (3x3 input) produced a 9x9 output by tiling 3x3 times  \n- The fifth example also baically tiled the input 3x3 times for a 9x9 output  \n\nEven if other examples showed different scaling, the explicit problem requirement is to produce a 9x9 output grid.\n\nTherefore, the transformation is simply:\n\n**Take the input grid, tile it 3x3 times to get a 9x9 grid.**\n\n---\n\n### Implementation notes:\n\n- Input: 3x3 grid (list of lists of integers)\n- Use numpy tile or list comprehension to repeat rows and columns 3 times each.\n- Return as a standard python list of lists.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    # Tile the 3x3 input grid 3 times along each axis to get 9x9 output\n    repeated = np.tile(arr, (3, 3))\n    return repeated.tolist()\n```"

Example 1: 3x3 input, output is 9x9. The output is simply the input tiled 3 times horizontally and vertically.\n2. Example 5 (same output size as example 1) is also 3x3 input tiled 3x3 times => 9x9 output.\n\nExamples 2 and 4 have 3x3 input, but output is 6x6 (tiled 2x3 or 3x2 times). This violates the problem requirement for a 9x9 output. But since the instruction says always produce a 9x9 output, it means the examples are varied sizes in outputs but we must unify for 9x9.\n\nExample 3 is input 3x3 but output is 12x12 (4x4 times tiled) \u2014 bigger than 9x9. Also not 9x9.\n\nThus, the training example outputs differ in output size.\n\nBut the problem states the transformation **must always produce a 9x9 output**.\n\nGiven this, our best hypothesis is that the pattern is about tiling the input grid repeatedly to create a larger grid that repeats the input pattern multiple times until it fills a 9x9 grid.\n\nAlso, the visual confirms the outputs look like repeated tilings of the input matrix.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- We take the 3x3 input grid.\n- Tile it to fill a 9x9 output, i.e., repeat it 3x3 times.\n\nThis matches example 1 and example 5 exactly, both are perfectly tiled 3x3 to make 9x9.\n\nFor other examples, the outputs are tilings with different count (like 2x3 or 3x4), but since the problem states the final output must **always** be 9x9, we must uniformly tile the input 3x3 grid to 9x9 by repeating 3 times vertically and horizontally.\n\nHence, the best general solution is:\n\n- Given a 3x3 input grid `grid`\n- Create output by repeating the input grid 3x3 times to get a 9x9 output grid.\n\nWe'll implement this approach.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # grid is a 3x3 list of lists\n    # Repeat it 3 times horizontally and vertically to make a 9x9 grid\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for i in range(3):  # vertical tiles\n        for row in grid:\n            new_row = []\n            for j in range(3):  # horizontal tiles\n                new_row.extend(row)\n            transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```"

The tiling is by simple repetition of the input grid.\n- The output grid size is always a multiple of 3 either 6x6 or 9x9 or 12x12 in the examples (but task states final output must be 9x9).\n- The main pattern is **tessellating the input 3x3 grid** to a 9x9 grid by repeating it 3 times along rows and columns.\n- Examples 2 and 4 show 6x6 outputs, but still by repeating the 3x3 twice along rows and columns.\n- Examples 3 and 5 show 12x12 and 9x9 repetitions.\n- The puzzle explicitly requires producing a 9x9 output grid every time.
