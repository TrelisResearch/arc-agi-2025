          "Let's analyze the examples carefully:\n\n**Input grids are 3x3, output grids are always 6x6.**\n\n**Colors in output:**\n- Black (0)\n- Red (1)\n- Blue (2)\n\n---\n\n### Observations from the examples:\n\n- Inputs only have values 0 and 5.\n- Output has:\n  - Black for empty/background\n  - Red and Blue arranged in a checkerboard pattern (1 and 2)\n  \n- The output grids are larger and have areas colored red and blue in a diagonal or cross pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Pattern Hypothesis:\n\n1. The **5's in the input** mark \"positive\" points or positions of interest.\n2. The output grid seems to **expand** these points into a larger grid (6x6).\n3. For each input cell with value 5, a **2x2 or patterned block** of red and blue cells appears at some corresponding location on the 6x6 grid.\n4. The coloring of these blocks follow a checkerboard pattern of 1 (red), 2 (blue).\n5. If multiple 5's are on the same row or column, the output seems to show blocks arranged either diagonally or in some mirrored fashion.\n6. 0 values in input give black, empty spaces in output.\n\n---\n\n### Matching Input (3x3) to Output (6x6):\n\n- Each input cell roughly corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output (6x6 is 3*2 x 3*2).\n- For example, in the first sample, the center (1,1) input cell is 5, and output center blocks of red/blue appear. Same for other positions.\n- The pattern seems that each input cell with 5 generates a 2x2 block in output at positions `(2*row):(2*row+2)`, `(2*col):(2*col+2)`.\n- The 2x2 block is colored as:\n\n```\n1 2\n2 1\n```\n\n(i.e., red-blue-blue-red checkerboard)\n\n- If input cell is 0, 2x2 block is black (0's).\n- But the examples have some overlapping or shifted blocks - let's check that.\n\n---\n\n### Checking example 2 (diagonal 5's):\n\n- Input (3x3):\n\n  ```\n  5 0 0\n  0 5 0\n  0 0 5\n  ```\n- Output:\n\n  ```\n  1 2 0 0 0 0\n  2 1 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 1 2 0 0\n  0 0 2 1 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 1 2\n  0 0 0 0 2 1\n  ```\n\n- Here, the 2x2 block pattern appears at:\n  - top-left (input pos (0,0)) \u2192 output positions (0:2, 0:2)\n  - middle (input pos (1,1)) \u2192 output positions (2:4, 2:4)\n  - bottom-right (input pos (2,2)) \u2192 output positions (4:6, 4:6)\n\n---\n\n### Therefore, let's finalize:\n\n- For each input cell at `(r, c)`:\n  - If value == 5:\n    - place the 2x2 block\n  \n- Otherwise black.\n\n---\n\n### Now, check example 1 and 3 about offsets:\n\nExample 1 input:\n\n```\n0 5 0  \n5 5 5  \n0 5 0\n```\n\nOutput has red/blue blocks not only on these corresponded positions but also arranged in the middle. But looking carefully, it's like each 5 creates a block at the doubled position in output:\n\n- (0,1) \u2192 output rows 0:2, cols 2:4\n- (1,0) \u2192 output rows 2:4, cols 0:2\n- (1,1) \u2192 output rows 2:4, cols 2:4\n- (1,2) \u2192 output rows 2:4, cols 4:6\n- (2,1) \u2192 output rows 4:6, cols 2:4\n\nSo, the block's output position is `(2*row):(2*row+2), (2*col):(2*col+2)`\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The output 6x6 grid is built by splitting into 2x2 blocks mapping the 3x3 input cells.\n- Each 5 input cell creates a red-blue checker 2x2 block in the output at doubled row/col.\n- Each 0 input cell results in 2x2 black cells (0) in output.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation:\n\n- Create 6x6 grid filled with zeros.\n- For each cell in input:\n  - If 5, insert the 2x2 pattern at `2*r` to `2*r+2`, `2*c` to `2*c+2`.\n\n---\n\nThis fits all examples well.\n\nNow code it.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # 3x3 input to 6x6 output by expanding each cell to 2x2 block\n    # 5 maps to checker pattern:\n    # 1 2\n    # 2 1\n    # 0 maps to all zeros block\n    \n    # Initialize 6x6 output with zeros\n    output = [[0]*6 for _ in range(6)]\n    \n    # Define the 2x2 block pattern for 5\n    pattern = [[1,2],\n               [2,1]]\n    \n    for r in range(3):\n        for c in range(3):\n            val = grid[r][c]\n            top = r*2\n            left = c*2\n            if val == 5:\n                # set the 2x2 checker pattern\n                for i in range(2):\n                    for j in range(2):\n                        output[top+i][left+j] = pattern[i][j]\n            else:\n                # val == 0, leave as zeros (black)\n                pass\n    \n    return output\n```"

The coloring of these blocks follow a checkerboard pattern of 1 (red), 2 (blue).\n5. If multiple 5's are on the same row or column, the output seems to show blocks arranged either diagonally or in some mirrored fashion.\n6. 0 values in input give black, empty spaces in output.\n\n---\n\n### Matching Input (3x3) to Output (6x6):\n\n- Each input cell roughly corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output (6x6 is 3*2 x 3*2).\n- For example, in the first sample, the center (1,1) input cell is 5, and output center blocks of red/blue appear. Same for other positions.\n- The pattern seems that each input cell with 5 generates a 2x2 block in output at positions `(2*row):(2*row+2)`, `(2*col):(2*col+2)`.\n- The 2x2 block is colored as:\n\n```\n1 2\n2 1\n```\n\n(i.e., red-blue-blue-red checkerboard)\n\n- If input cell is 0, 2x2 block is black (0's).\n- But the examples have some overlapping or shifted blocks - let's check that.\n\n---\n\n### Checking example 2 (diagonal 5's):\n\n- Input (3x3):\n\n  ```\n  5 0 0\n  0 5 0\n  0 0 5\n  ```\n- Output:\n\n  ```\n  1 2 0 0 0 0\n  2 1 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 1 2 0 0\n  0 0 2 1 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 1 2\n  0 0 0 0 2 1\n  ```\n\n- Here, the 2x2 block pattern appears at:\n  - top-left (input pos (0,0)) \u2192 output positions (0:2, 0:2)\n  - middle (input pos (1,1)) \u2192 output positions (2:4, 2:4)\n  - bottom-right (input pos (2,2)) \u2192 output positions (4:6, 4:6)\n\n---\n\n### Therefore, let's finalize:\n\n- For each input cell at `(r, c)`:\n  - If value == 5:\n    - place the 2x2 block\n  \n- Otherwise black.\n\n---\n\n### Now, check example 1 and 3 about offsets:\n\nExample 1 input:\n\n```\n0 5 0  \n5 5 5  \n0 5 0\n```\n\nOutput has red/blue blocks not only on these corresponded positions but also arranged in the middle. But looking carefully, it's like each 5 creates a block at the doubled position in output:\n\n- (0,1) \u2192 output rows 0:2, cols 2:4\n- (1,0) \u2192 output rows 2:4, cols 0:2\n- (1,1) \u2192 output rows 2:4, cols 2:4\n- (1,2) \u2192 output rows 2:4, cols 4:6\n- (2,1) \u2192 output rows 4:6, cols 2:4\n\nSo, the block's output position is `(2*row):(2*row+2), (2*col):(2*col+2)`\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\n\n- The output 6x6 grid is built by splitting into 2x2 blocks mapping the 3x3 input cells.\n- Each 5 input cell creates a red-blue checker 2x2 block in the output at doubled row/col.\n- Each 0 input cell results in 2x2 black cells (0) in output.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation:\n\n- Create 6x6 grid filled with zeros.\n- For each cell in input:\n  - If 5, insert the 2x2 pattern at `2*r` to `2*r+2`, `2*c` to `2*c+2`.\n\n---\n\nThis fits all examples well.\n\nNow code it.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # 3x3 input to 6x6 output by expanding each cell to 2x2 block\n    # 5 maps to checker pattern:\n    # 1 2\n    # 2 1\n    # 0 maps to all zeros block\n    \n    # Initialize 6x6 output with zeros\n    output = [[0]*6 for _ in range(6)]\n    \n    # Define the 2x2 block pattern for 5\n    pattern = [[1,2],\n               [2,1]]\n    \n    for r in range(3):\n        for c in range(3):\n            val = grid[r][c]\n            top = r*2\n            left = c*2\n            if val == 5:\n                # set the 2x2 checker pattern\n                for i in range(2):\n                    for j in range(2):\n                        output[top+i][left+j] = pattern[i][j]\n            else:\n                # val == 0, leave as zeros (black)\n                pass\n    \n    return output\n```"
