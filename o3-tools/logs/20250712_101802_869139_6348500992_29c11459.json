But examples show only one row with colors.\n- In this task, from train examples, seems only one such row appears.\n- But test has two rows with such structure. To align with training examples, likely the same logic applies to each row, independently.\n\n# Implementation choice:\n\n- We'll process each row independently:\n  - Find positions of non-zero blocks on a row.\n  - If exactly two non-zero blocks found, apply the rule.\n  - Else output row zeros.\n\n# Edge Cases:\n\n- If no or one colored block in row: row remains zeros.\n- If the two colored blocks are at same position: fill that cell with color (though unlikely).\n\n# Code will implement the above in a clean way.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Ensure output grid is 5x11 of zeros initially\n    out = [[0]*11 for _ in range(5)]\n    \n    for r in range(5):\n        row = grid[r]\n        # Find positions of non-zero smallest colors in the row\n        colored_positions = [(c, val) for c,val in enumerate(row) if val != 0]\n        \n        # Proceed if exactly two colored cells in this row\n        if len(colored_positions) == 2:\n            (c1, val1), (c2, val2) = colored_positions\n            left_col, right_col = (c1, val1) if c1 < c2 else (c2, val2)\n            right_c, right_val = (c2, val2) if c1 < c2 else (c1, val1)\n\n            start = left_col\n            end = right_c\n            mid = (start + end) // 2\n            \n            # Fill from start to mid with left color\n            for col in range(start, mid+1):\n                out[r][col] = left_val\n            # Put 5 at mid position (overwrite)\n            out[r][mid] = 5\n            # Fill from mid+1 to end with right color\n            for col in range(mid+1, end+1):\n                out[r][col] = right_val\n        else:\n            # If number of colored blocks in row not 2, leave row as zeros\n            continue\n    return out\n```"
