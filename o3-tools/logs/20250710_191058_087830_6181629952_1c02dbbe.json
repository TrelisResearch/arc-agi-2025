          "Based on the training examples and the visual analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **All non-gray colored cells (non-5, non-0) are on the border** of the main gray (5) square \u2014 i.e., on the outer edge or touching the gray area.\n2. **Each color on the border except 5 and 0 (background) fills a large square or rectangle that grows inside the gray region**. Each colored marker in the border \"activates\" a certain region inside the gray, filled with its color in the output.\n3. **The filled region for each color is always a contiguous, square-shaped block** extending from the side/corner inwards, with a consistent size for each color in each example.\n4. **No change to the black border or 0-background.**\n\n#### Details from Examples:\n- Example 1: Red markers on top and left => Big red block in upper-left, size 7x7, starting (3,3).\n- Example 2: Green markers on left/top, yellow on bottom/right => green fills upper-left (6x6 starting (2,2)), yellow lower-right (6x6 starting (7,7)).\n- Example 3: Blue (upper-left), yellow (upper-right), magenta (lower-left) => colored blocks, each 5x5, filling corresponding corners.\n\nSo, the **rule seems to be that for each unique color present on the border (excluding 0, 5):**\n- Find the colored border cell.\n- From its closest (row, col) corner, fill a block of N x N (where N is determined by distance to next adjacent colored cell or edge/corner) inwards with that color.\n\nBut in all examples, **the filled square for a corner color is the largest square fitting inside the gray (5) square, not overlapping with other filled colored squares. If multiple markers of the same color are present on different edges, they induce one region.** The filled regions are always anchored to the border color: upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right.\n\nThe colored square sizes decrease as more squares are filled in \u2014 i.e., they do not overlap.\n\n### STRATEGY\n\n- For each border color (excluding 0 and 5), find **which corner or edge it represents** (from the border position), and fill in the biggest square possible from that corner/edge inwards until it would collide with another colored square or go out of the bounds of the gray (5) area.\n- The \"gray area\" is always surrounded by a 1-cell-thick black (0) border.\n- Colored squares should not overlap.\n\n#### Implementation Plan:\n1. Identify all filled colors (excluding 0, 5) and their border locations.\n2. For each color, determine which corner/edge it's associated with and fill in a block. The order should be: fill corners first, then any edge centers, avoiding overlap.\n3. Fill these colored blocks inwards as large as possible without colliding with another block or going outside the gray (5) area.\n\n#### Quick Method:\n- For each marker: select (row, col) start, then fill a square of determined size based on others so that squares do not overlap (partition the gray region).\n- In all examples, the result is that (if 2 colors) fill upper-left and lower-right, (if 3 colors) fill upper-left, lower-left, upper-right, each with the same block size, etc.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    H, W = arr.shape\n\n    # Find main gray area (5): find min/max rows/cols\n    gray_val = 5\n    \n    # To safely support possible sizes, mask 5s\n    gray_mask = (arr == gray_val)\n    nonzero = np.argwhere(gray_mask)\n    if len(nonzero) == 0:  # Fallback in case, should not happen\n        return arr.tolist()\n    minr, minc = nonzero.min(axis=0)\n    maxr, maxc = nonzero.max(axis=0)\n\n    # Find colored markers (exclude 0 and 5), on the border of the gray area\n    color_markers = []\n    for r in range(H):\n        for c in range(W):\n            v = arr[r, c]\n            if v not in [0, gray_val]:\n                # Check if it's on the immediate border of gray region\n                # vertical borders\n                if (r == minr - 1 or r == maxr + 1) and minc <= c <= maxc:\n                    color_markers.append((v, r, c))\n                # horizontal borders\n                if (c == minc - 1 or c == maxc + 1) and minr <= r <= maxr:\n                    color_markers.append((v, r, c))\n\n    # For each unique color, group its markers\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    color_positions = defaultdict(list)\n    for v, r, c in color_markers:\n        color_positions[v].append((r, c))\n    \n    # Prepare list of zones (corners)\n    # There can be at most 4, corresponding to corners\n    # Each marker is at (r, c), so find which region.\n    filled_rects = []\n    used = np.zeros((H, W), dtype=bool)\n\n    # Pre-mark the gray area as \"allowed\" for coloring, but not outside\n    can_fill = np.zeros_like(arr, dtype=bool)\n    can_fill[minr:maxr+1, minc:maxc+1] = True\n\n    # There will be up to 4 regions to fill: upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right\n    # We'll assign regions based on positions\n\n    # Assign each color to a corner:\n    regions = {\n        \"UL\": None,  # Upper left\n        \"UR\": None,  # Upper right\n        \"LL\": None,  # Lower left\n        \"LR\": None   # Lower right\n    }\n    for color, positions in color_positions.items():\n        for r, c in positions:\n            if r <= minr and c <= minc:\n                regions[\"UL\"] = color\n            elif r <= minr and c >= maxc:\n                regions[\"UR\"] = color\n            elif r >= maxr and c <= minc:\n                regions[\"LL\"] = color\n            elif r >= maxr and c >= maxc:\n                regions[\"LR\"] = color\n\n    # Next, fill (in order: UL, LL, UR, LR) the biggest possible square for each present color\n    # The filled squares never overlap, so if all 4 are present, grid is split into 4 quadrants\n\n    # Count how many regions (corners) are filled\n    present_regions = [k for k, v in regions.items() if v is not None]\n    count = len(present_regions)\n    size = (maxr - minr + 1) // (2 if count >= 2 else 1)\n    # In examples: 7x7 (1 region), 6x6 (2), 5x5 (3) -- that is, decrease as regions increase\n\n    # For 4 corners divide in half (each 6x6? or 7x7?

Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 3 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 1 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4\n0 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 0\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 4 4 4 4 0\n0 0 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 6 6 6 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 1 0\n0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 1\n0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n6 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 3\n0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 7 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 3 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

          "Based on the training examples and the visual analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **All non-gray colored cells (non-5, non-0) are on the border** of the main gray (5) square \u2014 i.e., on the outer edge or touching the gray area.\n2. **Each color on the border except 5 and 0 (background) fills a large square or rectangle that grows inside the gray region**. Each colored marker in the border \"activates\" a certain region inside the gray, filled with its color in the output.\n3. **The filled region for each color is always a contiguous, square-shaped block** extending from the side/corner inwards, with a consistent size for each color in each example.\n4. **No change to the black border or 0-background.**\n\n#### Details from Examples:\n- Example 1: Red markers on top and left => Big red block in upper-left, size 7x7, starting (3,3).\n- Example 2: Green markers on left/top, yellow on bottom/right => green fills upper-left (6x6 starting (2,2)), yellow lower-right (6x6 starting (7,7)).\n- Example 3: Blue (upper-left), yellow (upper-right), magenta (lower-left) => colored blocks, each 5x5, filling corresponding corners.\n\nSo, the **rule seems to be that for each unique color present on the border (excluding 0, 5):**\n- Find the colored border cell.\n- From its closest (row, col) corner, fill a block of N x N (where N is determined by distance to next adjacent colored cell or edge/corner) inwards with that color.\n\nBut in all examples, **the filled square for a corner color is the largest square fitting inside the gray (5) square, not overlapping with other filled colored squares. If multiple markers of the same color are present on different edges, they induce one region.** The filled regions are always anchored to the border color: upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right.\n\nThe colored square sizes decrease as more squares are filled in \u2014 i.e., they do not overlap.\n\n### STRATEGY\n\n- For each border color (excluding 0 and 5), find **which corner or edge it represents** (from the border position), and fill in the biggest square possible from that corner/edge inwards until it would collide with another colored square or go out of the bounds of the gray (5) area.\n- The \"gray area\" is always surrounded by a 1-cell-thick black (0) border.\n- Colored squares should not overlap.\n\n#### Implementation Plan:\n1. Identify all filled colors (excluding 0, 5) and their border locations.\n2. For each color, determine which corner/edge it's associated with and fill in a block.

Fill these colored blocks inwards as large as possible without colliding with another block or going outside the gray (5) area.\n\n#### Quick Method:\n- For each marker: select (row, col) start, then fill a square of determined size based on others so that squares do not overlap (partition the gray region).\n- In all examples, the result is that (if 2 colors) fill upper-left and lower-right, (if 3 colors) fill upper-left, lower-left, upper-right, each with the same block size, etc.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    H, W = arr.shape\n\n    # Find main gray area (5): find min/max rows/cols\n    gray_val = 5\n    \n    # To safely support possible sizes, mask 5s\n    gray_mask = (arr == gray_val)\n    nonzero = np.argwhere(gray_mask)\n    if len(nonzero) == 0:  # Fallback in case, should not happen\n        return arr.tolist()\n    minr, minc = nonzero.min(axis=0)\n    maxr, maxc = nonzero.max(axis=0)\n\n    # Find colored markers (exclude 0 and 5), on the border of the gray area\n    color_markers = []\n    for r in range(H):\n        for c in range(W):\n            v = arr[r, c]\n            if v not in [0, gray_val]:\n                # Check if it's on the immediate border of gray region\n                # vertical borders\n                if (r == minr - 1 or r == maxr + 1) and minc <= c <= maxc:\n                    color_markers.append((v, r, c))\n                # horizontal borders\n                if (c == minc - 1 or c == maxc + 1) and minr <= r <= maxr:\n                    color_markers.append((v, r, c))\n\n    # For each unique color, group its markers\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    color_positions = defaultdict(list)\n    for v, r, c in color_markers:\n        color_positions[v].append((r, c))\n    \n    # Prepare list of zones (corners)\n    # There can be at most 4, corresponding to corners\n    # Each marker is at (r, c), so find which region.\n    filled_rects = []\n    used = np.zeros((H, W), dtype=bool)\n\n    # Pre-mark the gray area as \"allowed\" for coloring, but not outside\n    can_fill = np.zeros_like(arr, dtype=bool)\n    can_fill[minr:maxr+1, minc:maxc+1] = True\n\n    # There will be up to 4 regions to fill: upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right\n    # We'll assign regions based on positions\n\n    # Assign each color to a corner:\n    regions = {\n        \"UL\": None,  # Upper left\n        \"UR\": None,  # Upper right\n        \"LL\": None,  # Lower left\n        \"LR\": None   # Lower right\n    }\n    for color, positions in color_positions.items():\n        for r, c in positions:\n            if r <= minr and c <= minc:\n                regions[\"UL\"] = color\n            elif r <= minr and c >= maxc:\n                regions[\"UR\"] = color\n            elif r >= maxr and c <= minc:\n                regions[\"LL\"] = color\n            elif r >= maxr and c >= maxc:\n                regions[\"LR\"] = color\n\n    # Next, fill (in order: UL, LL, UR, LR) the biggest possible square for each present color\n    # The filled squares never overlap, so if all 4 are present, grid is split into 4 quadrants\n\n    # Count how many regions (corners) are filled\n    present_regions = [k for k, v in regions.items() if v is not None]\n    count = len(present_regions)\n    size = (maxr - minr + 1) // (2 if count >= 2 else 1)\n    # In examples: 7x7 (1 region), 6x6 (2), 5x5 (3) -- that is, decrease as regions increase\n\n    # For 4 corners divide in half (each 6x6? or 7x7?

              "Based on the training examples and the visual analysis:\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **All non-gray colored cells (non-5, non-0) are on the border** of the main gray (5) square \u2014 i.e., on the outer edge or touching the gray area.\n2. **Each color on the border except 5 and 0 (background) fills a large square or rectangle that grows inside the gray region**. Each colored marker in the border \"activates\" a certain region inside the gray, filled with its color in the output.\n3. **The filled region for each color is always a contiguous, square-shaped block** extending from the side/corner inwards, with a consistent size for each color in each example.\n4. **No change to the black border or 0-background.**\n\n#### Details from Examples:\n- Example 1: Red markers on top and left => Big red block in upper-left, size 7x7, starting (3,3).\n- Example 2: Green markers on left/top, yellow on bottom/right => green fills upper-left (6x6 starting (2,2)), yellow lower-right (6x6 starting (7,7)).\n- Example 3: Blue (upper-left), yellow (upper-right), magenta (lower-left) => colored blocks, each 5x5, filling corresponding corners.\n\nSo, the **rule seems to be that for each unique color present on the border (excluding 0, 5):**\n- Find the colored border cell.\n- From its closest (row, col) corner, fill a block of N x N (where N is determined by distance to next adjacent colored cell or edge/corner) inwards with that color.\n\nBut in all examples, **the filled square for a corner color is the largest square fitting inside the gray (5) square, not overlapping with other filled colored squares. If multiple markers of the same color are present on different edges, they induce one region.** The filled regions are always anchored to the border color: upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right.\n\nThe colored square sizes decrease as more squares are filled in \u2014 i.e., they do not overlap.\n\n### STRATEGY\n\n- For each border color (excluding 0 and 5), find **which corner or edge it represents** (from the border position), and fill in the biggest square possible from that corner/edge inwards until it would collide with another colored square or go out of the bounds of the gray (5) area.\n- The \"gray area\" is always surrounded by a 1-cell-thick black (0) border.\n- Colored squares should not overlap.\n\n#### Implementation Plan:\n1. Identify all filled colors (excluding 0, 5) and their border locations.\n2. For each color, determine which corner/edge it's associated with and fill in a block. The order should be: fill corners first, then any edge centers, avoiding overlap.\n3. Fill these colored blocks inwards as large as possible without colliding with another block or going outside the gray (5) area.\n\n#### Quick Method:\n- For each marker: select (row, col) start, then fill a square of determined size based on others so that squares do not overlap (partition the gray region).\n- In all examples, the result is that (if 2 colors) fill upper-left and lower-right, (if 3 colors) fill upper-left, lower-left, upper-right, each with the same block size, etc.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    H, W = arr.shape\n\n    # Find main gray area (5): find min/max rows/cols\n    gray_val = 5\n    \n    # To safely support possible sizes, mask 5s\n    gray_mask = (arr == gray_val)\n    nonzero = np.argwhere(gray_mask)\n    if len(nonzero) == 0:  # Fallback in case, should not happen\n        return arr.tolist()\n    minr, minc = nonzero.min(axis=0)\n    maxr, maxc = nonzero.max(axis=0)\n\n    # Find colored markers (exclude 0 and 5), on the border of the gray area\n    color_markers = []\n    for r in range(H):\n        for c in range(W):\n            v = arr[r, c]\n            if v not in [0, gray_val]:\n                # Check if it's on the immediate border of gray region\n                # vertical borders\n                if (r == minr - 1 or r == maxr + 1) and minc <= c <= maxc:\n                    color_markers.append((v, r, c))\n                # horizontal borders\n                if (c == minc - 1 or c == maxc + 1) and minr <= r <= maxr:\n                    color_markers.append((v, r, c))\n\n    # For each unique color, group its markers\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    color_positions = defaultdict(list)\n    for v, r, c in color_markers:\n        color_positions[v].append((r, c))\n    \n    # Prepare list of zones (corners)\n    # There can be at most 4, corresponding to corners\n    # Each marker is at (r, c), so find which region.\n    filled_rects = []\n    used = np.zeros((H, W), dtype=bool)\n\n    # Pre-mark the gray area as \"allowed\" for coloring, but not outside\n    can_fill = np.zeros_like(arr, dtype=bool)\n    can_fill[minr:maxr+1, minc:maxc+1] = True\n\n    # There will be up to 4 regions to fill: upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right\n    # We'll assign regions based on positions\n\n    # Assign each color to a corner:\n    regions = {\n        \"UL\": None,  # Upper left\n        \"UR\": None,  # Upper right\n        \"LL\": None,  # Lower left\n        \"LR\": None   # Lower right\n    }\n    for color, positions in color_positions.items():\n        for r, c in positions:\n            if r <= minr and c <= minc:\n                regions[\"UL\"] = color\n            elif r <= minr and c >= maxc:\n                regions[\"UR\"] = color\n            elif r >= maxr and c <= minc:\n                regions[\"LL\"] = color\n            elif r >= maxr and c >= maxc:\n                regions[\"LR\"] = color\n\n    # Next, fill (in order: UL, LL, UR, LR) the biggest possible square for each present color\n    # The filled squares never overlap, so if all 4 are present, grid is split into 4 quadrants\n\n    # Count how many regions (corners) are filled\n    present_regions = [k for k, v in regions.items() if v is not None]\n    count = len(present_regions)\n    size = (maxr - minr + 1) // (2 if count >= 2 else 1)\n    # In examples: 7x7 (1 region), 6x6 (2), 5x5 (3) -- that is, decrease as regions increase\n\n    # For 4 corners divide in half (each 6x6? or 7x7?
