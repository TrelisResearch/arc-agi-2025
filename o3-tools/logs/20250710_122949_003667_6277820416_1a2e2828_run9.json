          "From the training examples, the transformation maps an input grid to a single output value (a 1x1 grid). The output corresponds to a specific color (integer) value found in the input.\n\nLooking closely at the textual examples:\n\n- In Example 1, the output is `6`, which is the color of the thick horizontal band near the bottom of the input.\n- In Example 2, the output is `8`, corresponding to the vertical line of color `8` on the right side of the input.\n- In Example 3, output `6` again corresponds to a distinct horizontal band near the middle to bottom.\n- In Example 4, output is `1` which is a mostly horizontal band through the middle of the grid.\n- In Example 5, output `3` corresponds to the most frequent color in the input (a middle horizontal band).\n\nFrom these observations and the visual images:\n\n- The output color always comes from either a prominent horizontal or vertical band of uniform color that crosses the grid.\n- The color often corresponds to a line (horizontal or vertical) that divides the grid or is a major band, can be vertical or horizontal.\n- When there are multiple colored bands, the output color is the one that appears solidly across the entire grid in a row or column.\n\nThe puzzle seems to want:\n\n**Output the color of the line (horizontal or vertical) that runs fully across the grid (across all columns or across all rows).**\n\nThis matches all examples:\n\n- Example 1: horizontal line of `6`\n- Example 2: vertical line of `8`\n- Example 3: horizontal line of `6`\n- Example 4: horizontal line of `1`\n- Example 5: horizontal `3`\n\nSo the core logic:\n\n1. Identify unique colors that fill an entire row or an entire column.\n2. Return that color.\n\nIf multiple lines satisfy this condition, the examples show only one line color (unique). In case of multiple, just pick one.\n\nIn the test input, there\u2019s a vertical band of `7` at column 9 (0-based), going through all rows, and a thick horizontal line of `6` at row 6. So the code would identify these bands, pick a band color, and output that as a 1x1 grid.\n\n---\n\nNow implement this logic in code:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find color that fills entire row or entire column\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    \n    # Check rows\n    for r in range(rows):\n        row_set = set(grid[r])\n        if len(row_set) == 1:\n            # uniform row color\n            return [[grid[r][0]]]\n    \n    # Check columns\n    for c in range(cols):\n        col_colors = set(grid[r][c] for r in range(rows))\n        if len(col_colors) == 1:\n            # uniform column color\n            return [[grid[0][c]]]\n    \n    # If none found, fallback:\n    # Return most common color in grid\n    from collections import Counter\n    all_colors = [color for row in grid for color in row]\n    most_common_color = Counter(all_colors).most_common(1)[0][0]\n    return [[most_common_color]]\n```\n"
