          "To solve this ARC task, let's analyze the transformations:\n\n## Pattern Analysis\n\n### Observations:\n- All grids are rectangular, but **outputs are always 13\u00d712** regardless of input size.\n- Only certain regions of each grid have been changed: they are filled with the value `8` in outputs.\n- The transformation affects areas surrounded by `3` values (green in the image), specifically regions that form shapes (like a \"hill\" or \"wedge\") bounded by the lines of `3`s on both sides.\n- The \"filling\" (change to `8`) seems to:\n    - Start from regions between two or more `3`s, horizontally and/or vertically.\n    - Run in a connected sequence, filling out an area between these boundaries.\n- **Any existing `1` or `0` within this region is replaced by `8`. `3` cells are not replaced, but their neighbors may be if inside the bounded region.**\n- The pattern is approximately: For every contiguous region (bounded on at least two sides by `3`s in a row/column), fill the interior (including the boundary for complex polygonal regions) with `8`.\n\n### Additional details:\n- **Dimensions**: The output grid is always cropped/padded to 13\u00d712 (not always matching input).\n- In input 3 (15\u00d716) \u2192 output (15\u00d716) visually, but in the actual examples and as per requirement, the output should always be 13\u00d712. So our function must *crop the center 13\u00d712* of the transformed version if necessary.\n- The \"filled\" areas always start at `3` and expand to left/right/up/down until a boundary of `3`/edge is reached.\n\n### Implementation Plan:\n1. **Flood fill algorithm** starting at every `3` pixel, but only filling inside an area bounded by `3`s, marking all affected inner pixels as `8`.\n2. After replacement, **crop or pad** the result to exactly 13\u00d712, using top-left as (0,0) (since training outputs always seem to extract starting from top-left).\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = grid.shape\n\n    # Create a mask to mark filled regions\n    result = grid.copy()\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n\n    # Directions: up, down, left, right\n    dirs = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]\n\n    def valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < h and 0 <= c < w\n\n    # For each cell with 3, flood-fill in all directions, but only on 0 or 1 or 8\n    # Only fill inside areas that are between at least two 3s\n    for r in range(h):\n        for c in range(w):\n            if grid[r][c] == 3 and not visited[r,c]:\n                # Mark this as a seed point\n                q = deque()\n                q.append((r, c))\n                visited[r, c] = True\n\n                # Collect the boundary and flood-fill\n                region = set()\n                region.add((r,c))\n                boundaries = set()\n\n                while q:\n                    cr, cc = q.popleft()\n                    for dr, dc in dirs:\n                        nr, nc = cr+dr, cc+dc\n                        if valid(nr, nc):\n                            if not visited[nr, nc]:\n                                if grid[nr, nc] == 3:\n                                    q.append((nr, nc))\n                                    visited[nr, nc] = True\n                                    region.add((nr, nc))\n                                elif grid[nr, nc] in (0,1,8):\n                                    # Move as long as don't hit a 3\n                                    # Try to extend in direction until hit a 3 boundary\n                                    boundary_found = False\n                                    tr, tc = nr, nc\n                                    path = []\n                                    while valid(tr, tc) and grid[tr, tc] in (0,1,8) and not visited[tr, tc]:\n                                        path.append((tr, tc))\n                                        for pr, pc in dirs:\n                                            nnr, nnc = tr+pr, tc+pc\n                                            # If we neighbor a 3, it's a valid region\n                                            if valid(nnr, nnc) and grid[nnr, nnc] == 3:\n                                                boundary_found = True\n                                        tr += dr\n                                        tc += dc\n                                    if boundary_found:\n                                        # fill the whole path\n                                        for fr, fc in path:\n                                            if not visited[fr, fc]:\n                                                region.add((fr, fc))\n                                                visited[fr, fc] = True\n\n                # Fill all region cells that are not 3 as 8\n                for fr, fc in region:\n                    if grid[fr, fc] != 3:\n                        result[fr, fc] = 8\n\n    # Crop or pad to 13x12\n    out_h, out_w = 13, 12\n    # If too large, crop from top-left (like examples).

Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 3 1 1 1 3 0 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 3 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0\n1 0 3 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1\nOutput:\n0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1\n1 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 3 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 3 8 8 8 3 0 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 8 3 0 1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 3 8 8 8 8 0 0 1 0\n1 0 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0 3 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 3 1 0 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 3 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 3 1 0 0 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 0 0 1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0\n1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0 3 8 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 3 8 8 0 1 0 1 1\n0 1 1 3 8 8 8 1 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 3 8 8 0 1 0 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 3 8 0 1 0 0 1\n0 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 1 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0\n0 1 0 0 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 1\n0 1 0 8 8 8 1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 3 8 8 8 3 0 0 1 1 1\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 0 3 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 3 1 3 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 3 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 3 0 0 0 3 1 1 0\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 3 1 1 1 0 0 3 1 3\n1 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 3 0\n0 0 1 0 1 3 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1 1 1 3 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 3 1 0 1 0 1 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0 0 3 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 3 8 3 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 3 8 8 8 8 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0\n1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1\n0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 3 0 0 0 3 8 8 8\n0 1 0 1 1 0 1 3 8 1 1 0 0 3 8 3\n1 0 0 0 0 1 3 8 8 0 0 1 0 0 3 0\n0 0 1 0 1 3 8 8 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 0 1 1 1 3 8 8 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1 1 8 8 0 0 0 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 3 1 0 1 0 1 1 1\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 3 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0\n0 3 0 1 0 3 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 3 1 0 0 3\n0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 3 0 3 0\n0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 3 1 0\n0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n1 3 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 3 0 0 0 1 1 3 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 3 0 1 1 3 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0\n0 0 3 1 1 0 3 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 0 1 1 3 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

          "To solve this ARC task, let's analyze the transformations:\n\n## Pattern Analysis\n\n### Observations:\n- All grids are rectangular, but **outputs are always 13\u00d712** regardless of input size.\n- Only certain regions of each grid have been changed: they are filled with the value `8` in outputs.\n- The transformation affects areas surrounded by `3` values (green in the image), specifically regions that form shapes (like a \"hill\" or \"wedge\") bounded by the lines of `3`s on both sides.\n- The \"filling\" (change to `8`) seems to:\n    - Start from regions between two or more `3`s, horizontally and/or vertically.\n    - Run in a connected sequence, filling out an area between these boundaries.\n- **Any existing `1` or `0` within this region is replaced by `8`. `3` cells are not replaced, but their neighbors may be if inside the bounded region.**\n- The pattern is approximately: For every contiguous region (bounded on at least two sides by `3`s in a row/column), fill the interior (including the boundary for complex polygonal regions) with `8`.\n\n### Additional details:\n- **Dimensions**: The output grid is always cropped/padded to 13\u00d712 (not always matching input).\n- In input 3 (15\u00d716) \u2192 output (15\u00d716) visually, but in the actual examples and as per requirement, the output should always be 13\u00d712. So our function must *crop the center 13\u00d712* of the transformed version if necessary.\n- The \"filled\" areas always start at `3` and expand to left/right/up/down until a boundary of `3`/edge is reached.\n\n### Implementation Plan:\n1. **Flood fill algorithm** starting at every `3` pixel, but only filling inside an area bounded by `3`s, marking all affected inner pixels as `8`.\n2.
