    "content": "Let's analyze the training examples carefully:\n\n### Training Examples Recap:\n\n**Example 1:**\nInput:\n```\n0 7 0\n0 0 7\n0 7 7\n```\nOutput:\n```\n0 7 0 0 7 0\n0 0 7 7 0 0\n0 7 7 7 7 0\n```\n\n**Example 2:**\nInput:\n```\n0 0 0\n0 7 7\n0 0 0\n```\nOutput:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 7 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n**Example 3:**\nInput:\n```\n0 0 0\n7 0 0\n0 0 0\n```\nOutput:\n```\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n```\n\n---\n\n### Observations:\n\n- The input grid is 3x3.\n- The output grid is always 3x6 \u2014 i.e., the input is expanded to twice the width.\n- The transformation appears to involve **mirroring or reflecting certain features** across the new width.\n  \n### Noticing Patterns:\n\n1. When the input contains a '7' in a certain position:\n   - The output seems to place these '7's in symmetrical positions in the extended width.\n\n2. In Example 1 (with multiple '7's):\n   - The '7's are mirrored across the width. For instance, the '7' at position (0,1) results in placement at (0,1) and its mirror at (0,4).\n\n3. When the '7' appears alone or in particular arrangements:\n   - The pattern is to mirror the presence of '7's across the width, with some consistent placement to the left and right.\n\n---\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe transformation could be **mirror the original grid horizontally**, placing the original data in the left half and its mirror in the right half.\n\n- For each position in the original grid, its mirrored position is at `width - 1 - col + original_width` (since the extension is 3 \u2192 6 columns).\n- Values of 0 remain zeros; the '7's or other values get mirrored accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation strategy:\n- Expand the 3x3 grid to a 3x6 grid.\n- Copy the original grid to the **left half**.\n- Mirror the left half horizontally into the **right half**.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Convert input to numpy array for convenience\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Input is 3x3, output must be 3x6\n    transformed = np.zeros((3,6), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Copy original grid to the left half\n    transformed[:, :3] = arr\n    \n    # Mirror the left half horizontally into the right half\n    transformed[:, 3:] = arr[:, ::-1]\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed.tolist()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Convert input to numpy array for convenience\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Input is 3x3, output must be 3x6\n    transformed = np.zeros((3,6), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Copy original grid to the left half\n    transformed[:, :3] = arr\n    \n    # Mirror the left half horizontally into the right half\n    transformed[:, 3:] = arr[:, ::-1]\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed.tolist()\n```"

When the input contains a '7' in a certain position:\n   - The output seems to place these '7's in symmetrical positions in the extended width.\n\n2. In Example 1 (with multiple '7's):\n   - The '7's are mirrored across the width. For instance, the '7' at position (0,1) results in placement at (0,1) and its mirror at (0,4).\n\n3. When the '7' appears alone or in particular arrangements:\n   - The pattern is to mirror the presence of '7's across the width, with some consistent placement to the left and right.\n\n---\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe transformation could be **mirror the original grid horizontally**, placing the original data in the left half and its mirror in the right half.\n\n- For each position in the original grid, its mirrored position is at `width - 1 - col + original_width` (since the extension is 3 \u2192 6 columns).\n- Values of 0 remain zeros; the '7's or other values get mirrored accordingly.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation strategy:\n- Expand the 3x3 grid to a 3x6 grid.\n- Copy the original grid to the **left half**.\n- Mirror the left half horizontally into the **right half**.\n\n---\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Convert input to numpy array for convenience\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Input is 3x3, output must be 3x6\n    transformed = np.zeros((3,6), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Copy original grid to the left half\n    transformed[:, :3] = arr\n    \n    # Mirror the left half horizontally into the right half\n    transformed[:, 3:] = arr[:, ::-1]\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed.tolist()\n```\n\n---\n\n### Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Convert input to numpy array for convenience\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Input is 3x3, output must be 3x6\n    transformed = np.zeros((3,6), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Copy original grid to the left half\n    transformed[:, :3] = arr\n    \n    # Mirror the left half horizontally into the right half\n    transformed[:, 3:] = arr[:, ::-1]\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed.tolist()\n```"
