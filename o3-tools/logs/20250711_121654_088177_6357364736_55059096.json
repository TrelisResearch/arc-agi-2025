It excludes\n# the endpoints themselves, leaving the original green crosses intact.\n```\n\nExplanation of the main steps:\n1. We scan the grid for \"cross centers\": cells whose value is non-zero and which have matching non-zero neighbors directly above, below, left, and right.  \n2. For each pair of centers, we check if they lie exactly on a 45\u00b0 diagonal (i.e., the absolute row difference equals the absolute column difference and is greater than 1 cell apart).  \n3. When such a pair is found, we draw red (`2`) on every intermediate cell along that diagonal path, leaving the original crosses untouched.  \n4. The output grid is returned with the added red connectors."

We scan the grid for \"cross centers\": cells whose value is non-zero and which have matching non-zero neighbors directly above, below, left, and right.  \n2. For each pair of centers, we check if they lie exactly on a 45\u00b0 diagonal (i.e., the absolute row difference equals the absolute column difference and is greater than 1 cell apart).  \n3. When such a pair is found, we draw red (`2`) on every intermediate cell along that diagonal path, leaving the original crosses untouched.  \n4. The output grid is returned with the added red connectors."
