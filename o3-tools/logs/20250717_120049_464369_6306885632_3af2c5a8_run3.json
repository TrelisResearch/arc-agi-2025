          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid is always 6 rows by 8 columns.\n2. The input grid is 3 rows by 4 columns.\n3. The output grid seems to be a vertical repetition of the input grid, but with some transformations:\n   - The input grid is repeated 2 times vertically (3 rows \u00d7 2 = 6 rows)\n   - The input grid is repeated 2 times horizontally (4 columns \u00d7 2 = 8 columns)\n   - However, there are some transformations applied to the input grid before repetition:\n     - In Example 1, the input grid is mirrored horizontally and then repeated\n     - In Example 2, the input grid is transformed in a more complex way before repetition\n     - In Example 3, the input grid is expanded with additional 3s around it before repetition\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n1. Mirrors the input grid horizontally\n2. Repeats the mirrored grid vertically twice\n3. Repeats the mirrored grid horizontally twice\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Mirror the input grid horizontally\n    mirrored = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Repeat the mirrored grid vertically twice\n    repeated = [row for row in mirrored for _ in range(2)]\n    \n    # Repeat the repeated grid horizontally twice\n    transformed = []\n    for row in repeated:\n        transformed_row = row * 2\n        transformed.append(transformed_row)\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Mirror the input grid horizontally\n    mirrored = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Repeat the mirrored grid vertically twice\n    repeated = [row for row in mirrored for _ in range(2)]\n    \n    # Repeat the repeated grid horizontally twice\n    transformed = []\n    for row in repeated:\n        transformed_row = row * 2\n        transformed.append(transformed_row)\n    \n    return transformed\n```",
