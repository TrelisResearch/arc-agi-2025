    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are two training examples given, and I need to find out what transformation is happening from the input to the output. Let me look at them carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput grid:\n3 3 8\n3 7 0\n5 0 0\n\nOutput grid:\n0 0 5\n0 7 3\n8 3 3\n\nHmm. Let me write them as matrices. The input is a 3x3 grid. The output is also 3x3. Let me see if there's a rotation or reflection. For example, maybe the output is a rotation of the input. Let me check.\n\nIf I rotate the input 90 degrees clockwise, what would happen? Let's see. The original first row is 3,3,8. Rotating 90 degrees clockwise would make the first column of the output be 5,3,3. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. Rotating a matrix 90 degrees clockwise involves transposing and then reversing each row. Let me try that.\n\nOriginal input:\nRow 0: 3 3 8\nRow 1: 3 7 0\nRow 2: 5 0 0\n\nTransposing would make columns into rows. So transpose is:\n\n3 3 5\n3 7 0\n8 0 0\n\nThen reversing each row to get 90-degree rotation:\n\nRow 0 becomes 5 3 3\nRow 1 becomes 0 7 3\nRow 2 becomes 0 0 8\n\nSo the rotated matrix would be:\n\n5 3 3\n0 7 3\n0 0 8\n\nBut the output in example 1 is:\n\n0 0 5\n0 7 3\n8 3 3\n\nHmm, that's not matching. But maybe it's a different rotation. What if it's a 180-degree rotation? Let's see. Rotating 180 degrees would be rotating 90 twice. Let's try that. Original input rotated 90 once gives the matrix above. Rotating again would take that matrix and rotate 90 again. Let's do that.\n\nTake the first rotated matrix (after 90 degrees):\n\n5 3 3\n0 7 3\n0 0 8\n\nTranspose this matrix:\n\n5 0 0\n3 7 0\n3 3 8\n\nThen reverse each row:\n\n0 0 5\n0 7 3\n8 3 3\n\nWhich is exactly the output of example 1! So the output is the input rotated 180 degrees. Wait, but how? Because rotating 180 degrees can also be done by reversing each row and then reversing the entire matrix. Let me check.\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 8 \u2192 reversed row is 8 3 3\nRow 1: 3 7 0 \u2192 reversed row is 0 7 3\nRow 2: 5 0 0 \u2192 reversed row is 0 0 5\n\nThen, reversing the order of the rows. So the original rows are [row0, row1, row2]. After reversing the rows, it would be [row2, row1, row0]. So combining these steps:\n\nOriginal rows reversed: row0 reversed is 8 3 3, row1 reversed is 0 7 3, row2 reversed is 0 0 5. Then the rows are ordered as row2 reversed, row1 reversed, row0 reversed. So the matrix becomes:\n\n0 0 5\n0 7 3\n8 3 3\n\nWhich matches the output of example 1. So that's a 180-degree rotation. So the transformation for example 1 is rotating the input 180 degrees.\n\nLet me check example 2.\n\nExample 2 input:\n\n5 5 2\n1 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n0 0 0\n0 0 1\n2 5 5\n\nLet me apply the same transformation. Let's reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow0: 5 5 2 \u2192 reversed \u2192 2 5 5\nRow1: 1 0 0 \u2192 reversed \u2192 0 0 1\nRow2: 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed \u2192 0 0 0\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows. So the new rows are row2 reversed, row1 reversed, row0 reversed.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n0 0 0 \u2192 row2 reversed\n0 0 1 \u2192 row1 reversed\n2 5 5 \u2192 row0 reversed\n\nWhich is exactly the output of example 2. So that's the same transformation. So the pattern seems to be rotating the grid 180 degrees, which can be achieved by reversing each row and then reversing the order of the rows.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each row in the original grid, reverse it, then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nSo for example, the input grid is:\n\n[ [a, b, c],\n  [d, e, f],\n  [g, h, i] ]\n\nAfter reversing each row, we get:\n\n[ [c, b, a],\n  [f, e, d],\n  [i, h, g] ]\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows, so the final grid is:\n\n[ [i, h, g],\n  [f, e, d],\n  [c, b, a] ]\n\nSo the output is the original grid rotated 180 degrees.\n\nSo the code needs to perform this transformation.\n\nSo, how to implement this in Python.\n\nGiven a grid (a list of lists), for each row, reverse it. Then reverse the entire list.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse each row\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    # Reverse the order of the rows\n    transformed = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return transformed\n\nWait, let me test this with example 1.\n\nOriginal input grid:\n\n[\n [3,3,8],\n [3,7,0],\n [5,0,0]\n]\n\nReversed rows:\n\n[8,3,3], [0,7,3], [0,0,5]\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows: [ [0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3] ] which matches the output of example 1.\n\nYes. For example 2:\n\nOriginal input:\n\n[\n [5,5,2],\n [1,0,0],\n [0,0,0]\n]\n\nReversed rows:\n\n[2,5,5], [0,0,1], [0,0,0]\n\nReverse the rows: [ [0,0,0], [0,0,1], [2,5,5] ] which matches the output.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut wait, the test input is:\n\n6 3 5\n6 8 0\n4 0 0\n\nSo applying the same transformation. Let's see.\n\nOriginal grid:\n\nRow0: 6,3,5 \u2192 reversed \u2192 5,3,6\n\nRow1: 6,8,0 \u2192 reversed \u2192 0,8,6\n\nRow2:4,0,0 \u2192 reversed \u2192 0,0,4\n\nThen reverse the rows: [ [0,0,4], [0,8,6], [5,3,6] ]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n0 0 4\n\n0 8 6\n\n5 3 6\n\nBut I don't know if that's correct. But according to the pattern, this is the transformation.\n\nSo the code is as described.\n\nSo the Python function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    transformed = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in Python, list comprehensions can be used. Let me check.\n\nYes. So for each row in grid, reverse it (row[::-1]), then reverse the list of rows.\n\nSo that's the code.\n\nI think this should work for the training examples. Let me check again.\n\nYes. So this is the solution.\n"
