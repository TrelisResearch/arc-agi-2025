          "Analysis:\n- Training examples show grids with a central ring or path of gray color (value 5).\n- Inside this ring is a shape made of another color (e.g. 9/4 in example 1, 6/8 in example 2, 3/2 in example 3).\n- The transformation swaps some colors inside the ring in a symmetrical or pattern-based way.\n- Specifically, within the gray-ring enclosed region, two dominant colors inside seem to swap roles or switch certain positions. The bordering gray ring stays unchanged.\n- The outside region remains unchanged.\n- The transformation doesn't alter the ring, only changes colors inside the ring.\n- The pattern for each example is: inside the ring, if color A and color B are the main interior colors, swap occurrences of A with B partially or fully, often reflecting a sort of mirroring or pattern-based swap.\n- The ring color is consistently 5 in examples, unchanged.\n- This can be boiled down to:\n  1. Detect ring cells (color 5).\n  2. Find inside region enclosed by ring.\n  3. Identify two prominent colors inside the ring (excluding ring color 5 and background).\n  4. Swap these two colors inside the ring region according to some local pattern or global swap.\n- The swap is not total. Some cells with color A remain as A and some of color B remain as B. The swap tends to be symmetrical or related to a color adjacency map.\n- Given the abstract complexity and the training, a reasonable hypothesis is just to swap the two most frequent interior colors inside the ring enclosed region to get the output.\n\nImplementation plan:\n- Identify ring cells (color 5).\n- Identify inside ring cells: those reachable from center without crossing ring walls; or simply cells inside bounding box of ring with ring cells on border.\n- Count colors inside ring (excluding ring color 5).\n- Find top two colors inside ring.\n- Swap these two colors in the inside region; ring and outside remain the same.\n- Return the transformed grid.\n\nThis won't be exact for all examples but should capture the core observed transformation.\n\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    n = 10\n    \n    ring_color = 5\n    \n    # Find ring cells (color == ring_color)\n    ring_mask = (grid == ring_color)\n    \n    # We need to find inside region enclosed by ring.\n    # Strategy:\n    # - We consider ring cells form a closed loop.\n    # - Inside cells are those reachable from center (5,5) by moving only through non-ring (non-5) cells OR\n    #   alternatively, those not connected to outside (edges) without crossing ring.\n    \n    # Flood fill from edges to find outside background\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    visited = np.zeros((n,n),bool)\n    queue = deque()\n    # Enqueue all edge cells that are not ring color (outside)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in [0,n-1]:\n            if grid[i,j] != ring_color:\n                queue.append((i,j))\n                visited[i,j] = True\n    for j in range(n):\n        for i in [0,n-1]:\n            if grid[i,j] != ring_color:\n                queue.append((i,j))\n                visited[i,j] = True\n    \n    directions = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]\n    while queue:\n        r,c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr,dc in directions:\n            nr,nc = r+dr, c+dc\n            if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n:\n                if not visited[nr,nc] and grid[nr,nc] != ring_color:\n                    visited[nr,nc] = True\n                    queue.append((nr,nc))\n    \n    # visited == True on outside background (non-ring reachable from edges)\n    # inside region = non-ring cells not reachable from outside = inside enclosed by ring\n    inside_mask = (~ring_mask) & (~visited)\n    \n    # Count colors inside ring (excluding ring color)\n    inside_colors, counts = np.unique(grid[inside_mask], return_counts=True)\n    \n    if len(inside_colors) < 2:\n        # can't swap if less than two colors; return input unchanged\n        return grid.tolist()\n    \n    # find top two colors inside ring by frequency\n    sorted_indices = np.argsort(-counts)\n    c1 = inside_colors[sorted_indices[0]]\n    c2 = inside_colors[sorted_indices[1]]\n    \n    transformed = grid.copy()\n    \n    # Swap c1 and c2 inside the inside region\n    # Note: ring and outside remain unchanged\n    for r in range(n):\n        for c in range(n):\n            if inside_mask[r,c]:\n                if transformed[r,c] == c1:\n                    transformed[r,c] = c2\n                elif transformed[r,c] == c2:\n                    transformed[r,c] = c1\n    return transformed.tolist()\n```\n"

              "Analysis:\n- Training examples show grids with a central ring or path of gray color (value 5).\n- Inside this ring is a shape made of another color (e.g. 9/4 in example 1, 6/8 in example 2, 3/2 in example 3).\n- The transformation swaps some colors inside the ring in a symmetrical or pattern-based way.\n- Specifically, within the gray-ring enclosed region, two dominant colors inside seem to swap roles or switch certain positions. The bordering gray ring stays unchanged.\n- The outside region remains unchanged.\n- The transformation doesn't alter the ring, only changes colors inside the ring.\n- The pattern for each example is: inside the ring, if color A and color B are the main interior colors, swap occurrences of A with B partially or fully, often reflecting a sort of mirroring or pattern-based swap.\n- The ring color is consistently 5 in examples, unchanged.\n- This can be boiled down to:\n  1. Detect ring cells (color 5).\n  2. Find inside region enclosed by ring.\n  3. Identify two prominent colors inside the ring (excluding ring color 5 and background).\n  4. Swap these two colors inside the ring region according to some local pattern or global swap.\n- The swap is not total. Some cells with color A remain as A and some of color B remain as B. The swap tends to be symmetrical or related to a color adjacency map.\n- Given the abstract complexity and the training, a reasonable hypothesis is just to swap the two most frequent interior colors inside the ring enclosed region to get the output.\n\nImplementation plan:\n- Identify ring cells (color 5).\n- Identify inside ring cells: those reachable from center without crossing ring walls; or simply cells inside bounding box of ring with ring cells on border.\n- Count colors inside ring (excluding ring color 5).\n- Find top two colors inside ring.\n- Swap these two colors in the inside region; ring and outside remain the same.\n- Return the transformed grid.\n\nThis won't be exact for all examples but should capture the core observed transformation.\n\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    n = 10\n    \n    ring_color = 5\n    \n    # Find ring cells (color == ring_color)\n    ring_mask = (grid == ring_color)\n    \n    # We need to find inside region enclosed by ring.\n    # Strategy:\n    # - We consider ring cells form a closed loop.\n    # - Inside cells are those reachable from center (5,5) by moving only through non-ring (non-5) cells OR\n    #   alternatively, those not connected to outside (edges) without crossing ring.\n    \n    # Flood fill from edges to find outside background\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    visited = np.zeros((n,n),bool)\n    queue = deque()\n    # Enqueue all edge cells that are not ring color (outside)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in [0,n-1]:\n            if grid[i,j] != ring_color:\n                queue.append((i,j))\n                visited[i,j] = True\n    for j in range(n):\n        for i in [0,n-1]:\n            if grid[i,j] != ring_color:\n                queue.append((i,j))\n                visited[i,j] = True\n    \n    directions = [(-1,0),(1,0),(0,-1),(0,1)]\n    while queue:\n        r,c = queue.popleft()\n        for dr,dc in directions:\n            nr,nc = r+dr, c+dc\n            if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n:\n                if not visited[nr,nc] and grid[nr,nc] != ring_color:\n                    visited[nr,nc] = True\n                    queue.append((nr,nc))\n    \n    # visited == True on outside background (non-ring reachable from edges)\n    # inside region = non-ring cells not reachable from outside = inside enclosed by ring\n    inside_mask = (~ring_mask) & (~visited)\n    \n    # Count colors inside ring (excluding ring color)\n    inside_colors, counts = np.unique(grid[inside_mask], return_counts=True)\n    \n    if len(inside_colors) < 2:\n        # can't swap if less than two colors; return input unchanged\n        return grid.tolist()\n    \n    # find top two colors inside ring by frequency\n    sorted_indices = np.argsort(-counts)\n    c1 = inside_colors[sorted_indices[0]]\n    c2 = inside_colors[sorted_indices[1]]\n    \n    transformed = grid.copy()\n    \n    # Swap c1 and c2 inside the inside region\n    # Note: ring and outside remain unchanged\n    for r in range(n):\n        for c in range(n):\n            if inside_mask[r,c]:\n                if transformed[r,c] == c1:\n                    transformed[r,c] = c2\n                elif transformed[r,c] == c2:\n                    transformed[r,c] = c1\n    return transformed.tolist()\n```\n"
