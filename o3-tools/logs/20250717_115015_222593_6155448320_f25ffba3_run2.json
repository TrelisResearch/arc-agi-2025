Specifically, the output grid appears to be a reversed version of the input grid, but with the last row moved to the front.\n\nFor example, in Example 1:\nInput rows (from top to bottom):\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n2 0 3 9\n2 4 3 9\n\nOutput rows (from top to bottom):\n2 4 3 9\n2 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n2 0 3 9\n2 4 3 9\n\nThis looks like the input rows are reversed, but with the last row moved to the front.\n\nFor Example 2:\nInput rows (from top to bottom):\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n0 8 0 2\n0 3 8 2\n3 3 8 2\n\nOutput rows (from top to bottom):\n3 3 8 2\n0 3 8 2\n0 8 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n0 8 0 2\n0 3 8 2\n3 3 8 2\n\nThis also looks like the input rows are reversed, but with the last row moved to the front.\n\nBased on this pattern, I'll implement a transformation that reverses the input grid and moves the last row to the front.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse the grid and move the last row to the front\n    reversed_grid = grid[::-1]\n    transformed_grid = [reversed_grid[-1]] + reversed_grid[:-1]\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
