          "Let's analyze the training examples:\n\n1. **All inputs and outputs are 23\u00d723.**\n2. The grids have a \"board\" structure: yellow (4) cells making a grid, with colored regions (cyan/blue in Ex1, magenta in Ex2, green in Ex3, orange in Test!) in the \"tiles\" between.\n3. **Transformation observation:**  \n    - In each example, one of the \"tile\" blocks (the area surrounded by the yellow grid lines) is moved to the upper left corner of the board (upper left tile position).\n    - The color of the special block changes:\n      - The leftmost block in the input changes color in the output (cyan\u2192light blue in Ex1, blue\u2192magenta in Ex2, green\u2192darker green in Ex3), but always lands in the top left tile.\n      - The special color in the output matches the exotic color blocks found on the right/bottom in the input (i.e., the rare/new color is moved to the upper left in the output).\n      - The tile from the bottom right or bottom-most special \"exotic\" block is moved to the upper left in the output.\n    - The tile in the source position (original location) is replaced in the output with what was in the (input) upper left tile.\n\n4. **Blocks/tile definition:**  \n    - The yellow grid (color 4) forms a grid of 4\u00d74 blocks, each of size roughly 5\u00d75 (plus the yellow lines), so maybe 5\u00d75 blocks minus the grid lines.\n\n5. **Details:**  \n    - Any tile that has a non-standard color (8, 6, 3, 7, etc) is notable and probably the \"special\" tile.\n    - The rest of the board remains the same, just the two tiles (tile at input position of the special color and at upper left) are swapped, but possibly recolored.\n\n**General Rule Hypothesis:**  \n- Find the tile containing the \"exotic\" color (the one that only occurs in that tile, and not the general blue/black/white/yellow palette).  \n- Swap that entire tile with the tile in the upper left.  \n- In addition, possibly recolor the \"special\" color to another value that fits the new color palette (i.e., the \"special\" color in the new upper left tile becomes regular, and the upper left tile's prior color palette becomes the \"special\" color in the destination tile).\n\nBut in the training, for each input, the \"special\" colored block is moved to the top left and recolored to that tile's color, while the upper left's original tile moves to the source position, recolored to the special color.\n\nWait: On checking visually, the \"special\" block color stays in its block: it's not recolored, only swapped.\n\n**Upon closer inspection:**\n- The exotic block is swapped with the top left block, but the contents are not recolored, just swapped.\n- All other blocks remain unchanged.\n- Therefore, the only transformation in each example is swapping the contents (including the colors) of the upper left tile and the special tile containing an exotic color.\n\n**Block size:**  \n- The block size (excluding grid lines) is 5\u00d75.\n- Yellow grid lines are between tiles: so tile (block) at row 0-4, col 0-4 is top left, next tile starts at col=6, etc.\n\n**Grid positions:**\n- Grid lines are at rows/cols 5, 11, 17.\n- Tiles go:\n  - Block (r, c): starts at (6*r, 6*c) and covers block [row: 6*r to 6*r+4, col: 6*c to 6*c+4], as every block is separated by a single yellow line.\n- For a 23x23 grid:\n    - Tile (0, 0): rows 0-4, cols 0-4\n    - Tile (0, 1): rows 0-4, cols 6-10 (since col 5 is a yellow grid line)\n    - Tile (1, 0): rows 6-10, cols 0-4, etc.\n\nCheck:  \nBlock starts at (i*6, j*6) and covers 5x5 block.\n\nSo, in summary:\n- **Step 1:** identify the \"special\" (exotic color) block location (block containing a color only present in that block).\n- **Step 2:** swap entire top-left block and special block.\n- All else unchanged.\n\n**Edge/Color handling:**  \n- The color isn't mapped. The blocks' contents are swapped as-is.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    # Board is 23x23, made up of 4x4 tiles (5x5 each), with grid lines (yellow, value 4) between\n    tile_size = 5\n    num_tiles = 4  # 4x4 blocks\n    board_size = 23\n    separator = 1  # yellow grid line width\n\n    # Compute top left coordinate for each block\n    tile_coords = []\n    for row_block in range(num_tiles):\n        for col_block in range(num_tiles):\n            row0 = row_block * (tile_size + separator)\n            col0 = col_block * (tile_size + separator)\n            tile_coords.append( (row_block, col_block, row0, col0) )\n\n    # Find the exotic color(s): color(s) that only exist in one block\n    # First, build for each block: a set of its unique non-yellow colors\n    block_colors = []\n    for row_block in range(num_tiles):\n        for col_block in range(num_tiles):\n            row0 = row_block * (tile_size + separator)\n            col0 = col_block * (tile_size + separator)\n            block = grid[row0:row0+tile_size, col0:col0+tile_size]\n            colors = set(np.unique(block))\n            block_colors.append(((row_block, col_block), colors))\n    \n    # Count all non-yellow 'special' colors, collect the one that is only in a single block\n    all_colors = []\n    for (_, colors) in block_colors:\n        all_colors.extend([c for c in colors if c != 4])\n    all_colors = np.array(all_colors)\n    # The 'special' color is not 0 (black), 1 (blue), or 4 (yellow), but like 8, 6, 3, 7, etc.\n    # So, let's consider colors >= 3 and < 10, but not in most blocks\n    # To be robust, the \"special\" color appears in exactly one block and not others\n    special_color = None\n    color_counts = {c: np.sum(all_colors == c) for c in np.unique(all_colors)}\n    for color, count in color_counts.items():\n        if color not in [0, 1, 4] and count == 1:\n            special_color = color\n            break\n    # Find the block index having this special color\n    special_block = None\n    for (rc, colors) in block_colors:\n        if special_color is not None and special_color in colors:\n            special_block = rc\n            break\n    # Top left tile is always at (0,0)\n    top_left = (0, 0)\n    # If special block is None, just return grid unchanged\n    if special_block is None or special_block == top_left:\n        return grid.tolist()\n\n    # Swap contents of (0,0) and (special_block)\n    out = grid.copy()\n    # Block slices\n    r0a, c0a = top_left[0]*(tile_size+separator), top_left[1]*(tile_size+separator)\n    r0b, c0b = special_block[0]*(tile_size+separator), special_block[1]*(tile_size+separator)\n    block_a = grid[r0a:r0a+tile_size, c0a:c0a+tile_size].copy()\n    block_b = grid[r0b:r0b+tile_size, c0b:c0b+tile_size].copy()\n    out[r0a:r0a+tile_size, c0a:c0a+tile_size] = block_b\n    out[r0b:r0b+tile_size, c0b:c0b+tile_size] = block_a\n\n    return out.tolist()\n```"

the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

          "Let's analyze the training examples:\n\n1. **All inputs and outputs are 23\u00d723.**\n2. The grids have a \"board\" structure: yellow (4) cells making a grid, with colored regions (cyan/blue in Ex1, magenta in Ex2, green in Ex3, orange in Test!) in the \"tiles\" between.\n3. **Transformation observation:**  \n    - In each example, one of the \"tile\" blocks (the area surrounded by the yellow grid lines) is moved to the upper left corner of the board (upper left tile position).\n    - The color of the special block changes:\n      - The leftmost block in the input changes color in the output (cyan\u2192light blue in Ex1, blue\u2192magenta in Ex2, green\u2192darker green in Ex3), but always lands in the top left tile.\n      - The special color in the output matches the exotic color blocks found on the right/bottom in the input (i.e., the rare/new color is moved to the upper left in the output).\n      - The tile from the bottom right or bottom-most special \"exotic\" block is moved to the upper left in the output.\n    - The tile in the source position (original location) is replaced in the output with what was in the (input) upper left tile.\n\n4. **Blocks/tile definition:**  \n    - The yellow grid (color 4) forms a grid of 4\u00d74 blocks, each of size roughly 5\u00d75 (plus the yellow lines), so maybe 5\u00d75 blocks minus the grid lines.\n\n5. **Details:**  \n    - Any tile that has a non-standard color (8, 6, 3, 7, etc) is notable and probably the \"special\" tile.\n    - The rest of the board remains the same, just the two tiles (tile at input position of the special color and at upper left) are swapped, but possibly recolored.\n\n**General Rule Hypothesis:**  \n- Find the tile containing the \"exotic\" color (the one that only occurs in that tile, and not the general blue/black/white/yellow palette).  \n- Swap that entire tile with the tile in the upper left.  \n- In addition, possibly recolor the \"special\" color to another value that fits the new color palette (i.e., the \"special\" color in the new upper left tile becomes regular, and the upper left tile's prior color palette becomes the \"special\" color in the destination tile).\n\nBut in the training, for each input, the \"special\" colored block is moved to the top left and recolored to that tile's color, while the upper left's original tile moves to the source position, recolored to the special color.\n\nWait: On checking visually, the \"special\" block color stays in its block: it's not recolored, only swapped.\n\n**Upon closer inspection:**\n- The exotic block is swapped with the top left block, but the contents are not recolored, just swapped.\n- All other blocks remain unchanged.\n- Therefore, the only transformation in each example is swapping the contents (including the colors) of the upper left tile and the special tile containing an exotic color.\n\n**Block size:**  \n- The block size (excluding grid lines) is 5\u00d75.\n- Yellow grid lines are between tiles: so tile (block) at row 0-4, col 0-4 is top left, next tile starts at col=6, etc.\n\n**Grid positions:**\n- Grid lines are at rows/cols 5, 11, 17.\n- Tiles go:\n  - Block (r, c): starts at (6*r, 6*c) and covers block [row: 6*r to 6*r+4, col: 6*c to 6*c+4], as every block is separated by a single yellow line.\n- For a 23x23 grid:\n    - Tile (0, 0): rows 0-4, cols 0-4\n    - Tile (0, 1): rows 0-4, cols 6-10 (since col 5 is a yellow grid line)\n    - Tile (1, 0): rows 6-10, cols 0-4, etc.\n\nCheck:  \nBlock starts at (i*6, j*6) and covers 5x5 block.\n\nSo, in summary:\n- **Step 1:** identify the \"special\" (exotic color) block location (block containing a color only present in that block).\n- **Step 2:** swap entire top-left block and special block.\n- All else unchanged.\n\n**Edge/Color handling:**  \n- The color isn't mapped. The blocks' contents are swapped as-is.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    # Board is 23x23, made up of 4x4 tiles (5x5 each), with grid lines (yellow, value 4) between\n    tile_size = 5\n    num_tiles = 4  # 4x4 blocks\n    board_size = 23\n    separator = 1  # yellow grid line width\n\n    # Compute top left coordinate for each block\n    tile_coords = []\n    for row_block in range(num_tiles):\n        for col_block in range(num_tiles):\n            row0 = row_block * (tile_size + separator)\n            col0 = col_block * (tile_size + separator)\n            tile_coords.append( (row_block, col_block, row0, col0) )\n\n    # Find the exotic color(s): color(s) that only exist in one block\n    # First, build for each block: a set of its unique non-yellow colors\n    block_colors = []\n    for row_block in range(num_tiles):\n        for col_block in range(num_tiles):\n            row0 = row_block * (tile_size + separator)\n            col0 = col_block * (tile_size + separator)\n            block = grid[row0:row0+tile_size, col0:col0+tile_size]\n            colors = set(np.unique(block))\n            block_colors.append(((row_block, col_block), colors))\n    \n    # Count all non-yellow 'special' colors, collect the one that is only in a single block\n    all_colors = []\n    for (_, colors) in block_colors:\n        all_colors.extend([c for c in colors if c != 4])\n    all_colors = np.array(all_colors)\n    # The 'special' color is not 0 (black), 1 (blue), or 4 (yellow), but like 8, 6, 3, 7, etc.\n    # So, let's consider colors >= 3 and < 10, but not in most blocks\n    # To be robust, the \"special\" color appears in exactly one block and not others\n    special_color = None\n    color_counts = {c: np.sum(all_colors == c) for c in np.unique(all_colors)}\n    for color, count in color_counts.items():\n        if color not in [0, 1, 4] and count == 1:\n            special_color = color\n            break\n    # Find the block index having this special color\n    special_block = None\n    for (rc, colors) in block_colors:\n        if special_color is not None and special_color in colors:\n            special_block = rc\n            break\n    # Top left tile is always at (0,0)\n    top_left = (0, 0)\n    # If special block is None, just return grid unchanged\n    if special_block is None or special_block == top_left:\n        return grid.tolist()\n\n    # Swap contents of (0,0) and (special_block)\n    out = grid.copy()\n    # Block slices\n    r0a, c0a = top_left[0]*(tile_size+separator), top_left[1]*(tile_size+separator)\n    r0b, c0b = special_block[0]*(tile_size+separator), special_block[1]*(tile_size+separator)\n    block_a = grid[r0a:r0a+tile_size, c0a:c0a+tile_size].copy()\n    block_b = grid[r0b:r0b+tile_size, c0b:c0b+tile_size].copy()\n    out[r0a:r0a+tile_size, c0a:c0a+tile_size] = block_b\n    out[r0b:r0b+tile_size, c0b:c0b+tile_size] = block_a\n\n    return out.tolist()\n```"
