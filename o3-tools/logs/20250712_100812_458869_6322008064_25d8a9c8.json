Let's check in more detail:\n\n**What is special about the filled output row(s)?**\nLet's check if the output row with 5s has something in common in the input:\n\n- Example 1: Top row of input = [4,4,4]\n- Example 2: Middle row of input = [6,6,6]\n- Example 3: Middle row = [4,4,4], Bottom row = [9,9,9]\n- Example 4: Bottom row = [1,1,1]\n\nThat is, the output seems to mark any row that is *constant* (all cells have the same value) with 5s, otherwise, 0s.\n\nDoes this match Example 3's double-row? Input has [4,4,4] and [9,9,9] as middle/bottom rows, so both get output \"5\".\nExample 4: only the bottom row is constant, so only that row gets \"5\".\n\nTherefore, the rule seems to be:\n\n**For each row, if all elements are the same, output a row of 5s. Otherwise, mark with 0s.**\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # For each row, check if all elements are the same\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        if all(x == row[0] for x in row):\n            transformed_grid.append([5,5,5])\n        else:\n            transformed_grid.append([0,0,0])\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
