          "Let's analyze the transformation:\n\n### Observations\n\n- **Input grids** have several non-overlapping green boxes/rectangles.\n- **Output grids** preserve the shapes, but now connect them with \"corridors\" of green between the boxes.\n- The connections are always along the borders (never diagonally) and always join at corners or midpoints of the box edges.\n- The output grid is always 30x30 (same size as input).\n- **Connections** create a \"pathway\" between the boxes: \n    - Most notably, boxes are connected via orthogonal lines that avoid overlapping with the boxes' filled areas (paths travel just along the box perimeters).\n\n#### Connection Rules (from the examples):\n\n1. Collect all the green pixels. For each \"object\" (box), identify its \"center\" or a useful connect point (often the midpoint of a box's edge).\n2. Draw green \"corridor\" lines between connection points of boxes.\n    - In the examples, this is always one-pixel wide and aligns with the grid (no diagonals).\n\n#### Detailed Procedure\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify all green boxes (connected components with 3s).\n- **Step 2:** For each box, select a connection point:\n    - Usually, this is the center of one of the sides or (for odd-width/height) the exact midpoint.\n- **Step 3:** Determine a spanning tree (or just connect the boxes as per the sample: left-to-right, top-to-bottom, etc).\n    - The actual sequence from the examples: \n        - Connect horizontally aligned boxes first,\n        - then vertically aligned,\n        - and connect all of them together via paths that never pass inside a box.\n- **Step 4:** Draw the orthogonal path between connection points.\n\n#### Let's implement:\n- Find all boxes (connected components of '3').\n- For each, determine its min/max row/col (bounding box).\n- For each box, choose a connection point (e.g. center of top/bottom/left/right sides).\n- Greedily connect nearest neighbor boxes using orthogonal (Manhattan) paths.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.ndimage import label\n\ndef get_boxes(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find all bounding boxes of '3' connected regions.\n    Returns: list of dicts with keys 'minr', 'maxr', 'minc', 'maxc'\n    \"\"\"\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    bool_arr = (arr == 3)\n    lbl, n = label(bool_arr)\n    boxes = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        pts = np.argwhere(lbl == i)\n        if len(pts) == 0:\n            continue\n        minr, minc = pts.min(axis=0)\n        maxr, maxc = pts.max(axis=0)\n        boxes.append({\n            'minr': minr,\n            'maxr': maxr,\n            'minc': minc,\n            'maxc': maxc,\n            'pts': pts,\n            'label': i,\n        })\n    return boxes\n\ndef get_connection_points(box):\n    \"\"\"\n    For a given box, return a set of candidate connection points\n    (the center point of each of the four edges).\n    \"\"\"\n    minr, maxr, minc, maxc = box['minr'], box['maxr'], box['minc'], box['maxc']\n    midr = (minr + maxr) // 2\n    midc = (minc + maxc) // 2\n    candidates = [\n        (minr, midc),       # top edge center\n        (maxr, midc),       # bottom edge center\n        (midr, minc),       # left edge center\n        (midr, maxc),       # right edge center\n    ]\n    return candidates\n\ndef find_nearest_box(box_idx, all_points, used):\n    # Return idx of the nearest non-used box to box_idx, and the two points to connect\n    # all_points: list of connection points for each box\n    # used: set of box indices already linked\n    src_points = all_points[box_idx]\n    min_dist = float('inf')\n    closest_j = -1\n    best_pair = None\n    for j, points in enumerate(all_points):\n        if j in used or j == box_idx:\n            continue\n        for p0 in src_points:\n            for p1 in points:\n                d = abs(p0[0]-p1[0]) + abs(p0[1]-p1[1])\n                if d < min_dist:\n                    min_dist = d\n                    closest_j = j\n                    best_pair = (p0, p1)\n    return closest_j, best_pair\n\ndef draw_path(arr, p0, p1):\n    # Draw orthogonal path (Manhattan) from p0 to p1 in arr (set to 3)\n    r0,c0 = p0\n    r1,c1 = p1\n    # Decide path: first vertical then horizontal (could alternate, but that's enough for this pattern)\n    rr, cc = r0, c0\n    arr[rr, cc] = 3\n    while rr != r1:\n        rr += 1 if r1 > rr else -1\n        arr[rr, cc] = 3\n    while cc != c1:\n        cc += 1 if c1 > cc else -1\n        arr[rr, cc] = 3\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = arr.shape\n    out = np.copy(arr)\n\n    # 1.

rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Collect all the green pixels. For each \"object\" (box), identify its \"center\" or a useful connect point (often the midpoint of a box's edge).\n2. Draw green \"corridor\" lines between connection points of boxes.\n    - In the examples, this is always one-pixel wide and aligns with the grid (no diagonals).\n\n#### Detailed Procedure\n\n- **Step 1:** Identify all green boxes (connected components with 3s).\n- **Step 2:** For each box, select a connection point:\n    - Usually, this is the center of one of the sides or (for odd-width/height) the exact midpoint.\n- **Step 3:** Determine a spanning tree (or just connect the boxes as per the sample: left-to-right, top-to-bottom, etc).\n    - The actual sequence from the examples: \n        - Connect horizontally aligned boxes first,\n        - then vertically aligned,\n        - and connect all of them together via paths that never pass inside a box.\n- **Step 4:** Draw the orthogonal path between connection points.\n\n#### Let's implement:\n- Find all boxes (connected components of '3').\n- For each, determine its min/max row/col (bounding box).\n- For each box, choose a connection point (e.g. center of top/bottom/left/right sides).\n- Greedily connect nearest neighbor boxes using orthogonal (Manhattan) paths.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.ndimage import label\n\ndef get_boxes(grid):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find all bounding boxes of '3' connected regions.\n    Returns: list of dicts with keys 'minr', 'maxr', 'minc', 'maxc'\n    \"\"\"\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    bool_arr = (arr == 3)\n    lbl, n = label(bool_arr)\n    boxes = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        pts = np.argwhere(lbl == i)\n        if len(pts) == 0:\n            continue\n        minr, minc = pts.min(axis=0)\n        maxr, maxc = pts.max(axis=0)\n        boxes.append({\n            'minr': minr,\n            'maxr': maxr,\n            'minc': minc,\n            'maxc': maxc,\n            'pts': pts,\n            'label': i,\n        })\n    return boxes\n\ndef get_connection_points(box):\n    \"\"\"\n    For a given box, return a set of candidate connection points\n    (the center point of each of the four edges).\n    \"\"\"\n    minr, maxr, minc, maxc = box['minr'], box['maxr'], box['minc'], box['maxc']\n    midr = (minr + maxr) // 2\n    midc = (minc + maxc) // 2\n    candidates = [\n        (minr, midc),       # top edge center\n        (maxr, midc),       # bottom edge center\n        (midr, minc),       # left edge center\n        (midr, maxc),       # right edge center\n    ]\n    return candidates\n\ndef find_nearest_box(box_idx, all_points, used):\n    # Return idx of the nearest non-used box to box_idx, and the two points to connect\n    # all_points: list of connection points for each box\n    # used: set of box indices already linked\n    src_points = all_points[box_idx]\n    min_dist = float('inf')\n    closest_j = -1\n    best_pair = None\n    for j, points in enumerate(all_points):\n        if j in used or j == box_idx:\n            continue\n        for p0 in src_points:\n            for p1 in points:\n                d = abs(p0[0]-p1[0]) + abs(p0[1]-p1[1])\n                if d < min_dist:\n                    min_dist = d\n                    closest_j = j\n                    best_pair = (p0, p1)\n    return closest_j, best_pair\n\ndef draw_path(arr, p0, p1):\n    # Draw orthogonal path (Manhattan) from p0 to p1 in arr (set to 3)\n    r0,c0 = p0\n    r1,c1 = p1\n    # Decide path: first vertical then horizontal (could alternate, but that's enough for this pattern)\n    rr, cc = r0, c0\n    arr[rr, cc] = 3\n    while rr != r1:\n        rr += 1 if r1 > rr else -1\n        arr[rr, cc] = 3\n    while cc != c1:\n        cc += 1 if c1 > cc else -1\n        arr[rr, cc] = 3\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = arr.shape\n    out = np.copy(arr)\n\n    # 1.
