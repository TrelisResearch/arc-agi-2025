          "content": "Looking at the training examples, I observe a pattern where the last row of the input grid is being rotated in a specific way to form the output grid.\n\nIn Example 1, the last row is [1 0], and the output is a sequence of alternating 0 and 1 values starting with 0. This suggests a rotation or shifting pattern.\n\nIn Example 2, the last row is [1 0 0], and the output is a sequence of alternating 0 and 1 values with a 1 in the third position. This suggests a more complex pattern involving rotation and shifting.\n\nIn Example 3, the last row is [1 0 0 0], and the output is a sequence of alternating 0 and 1 values with a 1 in the fourth position. This suggests a pattern where the last row is being rotated in a specific way to form the output grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves rotating the last row of the input grid in a specific way to form the output grid.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the last row of the input grid\n    last_row = grid[-1]\n    \n    # Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(len(row))] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Rotate the last row in a specific way to form the output grid\n    # This is a hypothesis based on the observed patterns\n    # The last row is rotated in a way that creates a pattern of alternating 0 and 1 values\n    # Starting with 0 and alternating\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[i])):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0 if j % 2 == 0 else 1\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if j % 2 == 0 else 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the last row of the input grid\n    last_row = grid[-1]\n    \n    # Create a new grid with the same dimensions as the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(len(row))] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Rotate the last row in a specific way to form the output grid\n    # This is a hypothesis based on the observed patterns\n    # The last row is rotated in a way that creates a pattern of alternating 0 and 1 values\n    # Starting with 0 and alternating\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[i])):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0 if j % 2 == 0 else 1\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if j % 2 == 0 else 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
