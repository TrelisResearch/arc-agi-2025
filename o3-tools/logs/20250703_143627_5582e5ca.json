If there is a tie in frequency, perhaps choose the maximum among these.\n\nLet's verify this idea:\n\n- Example 2: \n  - Input contains 4 three times, making 4 the most frequent.\n  - Output is 4.\n\n- Example 3:\n  - Counts:\n    - 4: once\n    - 6: 3 times\n    - 8: twice\n    - 1, 3, 0: once each\n  - The most frequent is 6 (appears 3 times).\n  - Output is all 6s.\n\n- Example 1:\n  - Highest value is 9, only one 9.\n  - Instead of most frequent, the output is max value.\n\nThe patterns seem to differ across examples.\n\nBut considering the last two examples, a clear pattern emerges: the output is the most frequent value in the input.\n\nIn the first example:\n- The only 9's; maximum value is 9, so output is all 9s\n- Would also be consistent if the output is the max value, provided all values are the same?\n\nActually, the first example is all 9s, which matches the maximum value of input: 9.\n\nSecond example: most frequent is 4, which is the first value of the top row.\n\nThird example: most frequent is 6, which is the most common value.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The likely pattern: **The output grid is filled with the most frequent value in the input grid.**\n\nIn case of a tie, the highest value among the tied values.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation plan:**\n\n1. Count the frequency of each value in the input grid.\n2. Find the value(s) with the highest frequency.\n3. If there's a tie, use the maximum value among them.\n4. Create a grid of the same size filled with this value.\n\nLet's implement this.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    from collections import Counter\n\n    # Flatten the grid to count frequencies\n    flattened = [val for row in grid for val in row]\n    counts = Counter(flattened)\n\n    # Find the maximum frequency\n    max_freq = max(counts.values())\n\n    # Find all values with the max frequency\n    candidates = [val for val, freq in counts.items() if freq == max_freq]\n\n    # Choose the largest value among the candidates\n    target_value = max(candidates)\n\n    # Create the output grid filled with target_value\n    transformed_grid = [[target_value for _ in row] for row in grid]\n\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
