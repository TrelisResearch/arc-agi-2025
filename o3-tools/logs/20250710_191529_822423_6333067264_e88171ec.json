          "Let's study the pattern from the training examples:\n\n## Observations\n\n1. **All outputs are same size as the input (19x19)**.\n2. **In each example, a rectangular area of 0's surrounded by the main color (4/yellow, 2/red, 3/green)** is filled/inpainted with a new color (8, light blue).\n   - In Example 1, a 5x5 square of zeros in the upper left is replaced with 8.\n   - In Example 2, a 3x3 square of zeros in lower right is replaced with 8.\n   - In Example 3, a 4x2 rectangle of zeros near bottom center is replaced with 8.\n3. The filled rectangle is always the **largest rectangle of zeros fully surrounded by the main color**.\n   - Not \"touching\" the edge\n   - Always a filled rectangle\n   - Filled with '8' regardless of input color\n\n### Approach\n\nThe transformation is:\n\n- Find the **largest (or one of the largest, if tied) contiguous rectangular region of 0's**, fully surrounded by the nonzero background (main color).\n    - Not allowed to touch any edge (must be internal).\n- Change those 0's to 8.\n\nThere can be several rectangles, but in all examples, only a single region is filled, always the largest.\n\nWe need:\n\n- To identify all rectangles of 0's fully surrounded by non-0's, not touching the edge.\n- Among these, pick the largest (by area).\n- Fill it with 8.\n- Leave all else unchanged.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. For each group of connected 0's, if every cell is at least 1 away from the grid edge, and all neighbors around the rectangle are not 0:\n    - Check if the group forms a rectangle.\n    - (Alternatively: For each possible rectangle, check if all are 0, all edges surrounded by nonzero)\n2. Among such rectangles, pick the largest one. Fill with 8.\n3. Return the modified grid.\n\nSince the ARC grids are moderate (<=19x19), we can check all possible rectangles easily.\n\n## Steps\n\n- For all possible top-left and bottom-right pairs that define a rectangle not touching the edge, check if the area is all zero and is surrounded by nonzero.\n- Track the largest such rectangle.\n- Fill its area with 8.\n\nLet's proceed!\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = grid.shape\n    best_area = 0\n    best_rect = None\n\n    # Only consider rectangles fully inside the border (not touching edge)\n    for top in range(1, h-1):\n        for left in range(1, w-1):\n            # Only look for possible 0 top-lefts\n            if grid[top, left] != 0:\n                continue\n            # Try all possible bottoms\n            for bottom in range(top, h-1):\n                # All cells in this row must be 0 from left to right\n                if not np.all(grid[bottom, left] == 0):\n                    break\n                for right in range(left, w-1):\n                    sub = grid[top:bottom+1, left:right+1]\n                    # Must be all zero\n                    if not np.all(sub == 0):\n                        break\n                    # Rectangle must be nonzero on all sides (above, below, left, right)\n                    # Sides: Assume rectangle is from [top:bottom+1, left:right+1]\n                    # Check border above\n                    if not np.all(grid[top-1, left:right+1] != 0):\n                        continue\n                    # Check border below\n                    if not np.all(grid[bottom+1, left:right+1] != 0):\n                        continue\n                    # Check left border\n                    if not np.all(grid[top:bottom+1, left-1] != 0):\n                        continue\n                    # Check right border\n                    if not np.all(grid[top:bottom+1, right+1] != 0):\n                        continue\n                    # Check area\n                    area = (bottom-top+1) * (right-left+1)\n                    if area > best_area:\n                        best_area = area\n                        best_rect = (top, left, bottom, right)\n\n    # Create output grid\n    result = np.array(grid)\n    if best_rect is not None:\n        t, l, b, r = best_rect\n        result[t:b+1, l:r+1] = 8\n\n    return result.tolist()\n```\n"

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 19\u00d719 output grid.**\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process.

the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

The filled rectangle is always the **largest rectangle of zeros fully surrounded by the main color**.\n   - Not \"touching\" the edge\n   - Always a filled rectangle\n   - Filled with '8' regardless of input color\n\n### Approach\n\nThe transformation is:\n\n- Find the **largest (or one of the largest, if tied) contiguous rectangular region of 0's**, fully surrounded by the nonzero background (main color).\n    - Not allowed to touch any edge (must be internal).\n- Change those 0's to 8.\n\nThere can be several rectangles, but in all examples, only a single region is filled, always the largest.\n\nWe need:\n\n- To identify all rectangles of 0's fully surrounded by non-0's, not touching the edge.\n- Among these, pick the largest (by area).\n- Fill it with 8.\n- Leave all else unchanged.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. For each group of connected 0's, if every cell is at least 1 away from the grid edge, and all neighbors around the rectangle are not 0:\n    - Check if the group forms a rectangle.\n    - (Alternatively: For each possible rectangle, check if all are 0, all edges surrounded by nonzero)\n2. Among such rectangles, pick the largest one. Fill with 8.\n3.

The filled rectangle is always the **largest rectangle of zeros fully surrounded by the main color**.\n   - Not \"touching\" the edge\n   - Always a filled rectangle\n   - Filled with '8' regardless of input color\n\n### Approach\n\nThe transformation is:\n\n- Find the **largest (or one of the largest, if tied) contiguous rectangular region of 0's**, fully surrounded by the nonzero background (main color).\n    - Not allowed to touch any edge (must be internal).\n- Change those 0's to 8.\n\nThere can be several rectangles, but in all examples, only a single region is filled, always the largest.\n\nWe need:\n\n- To identify all rectangles of 0's fully surrounded by non-0's, not touching the edge.\n- Among these, pick the largest (by area).\n- Fill it with 8.\n- Leave all else unchanged.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. For each group of connected 0's, if every cell is at least 1 away from the grid edge, and all neighbors around the rectangle are not 0:\n    - Check if the group forms a rectangle.\n    - (Alternatively: For each possible rectangle, check if all are 0, all edges surrounded by nonzero)\n2.
