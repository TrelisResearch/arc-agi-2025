          "Let's analyze the task carefully:\n\nFrom the textual grids and images, we see:\n\n- Inputs are 10x10 grids with scattered colored cells (non-zero value).\n- Outputs are 10x10 grids, mostly empty except the left columns.\n\nLooking closely at the outputs:\n\n- The first four columns (indices 0,1,2,3) are populated in outputs.\n- The colors 1,2,3,4 appear in order in columns 0,1,2,3 forming vertical stacks from bottom upwards.\n- Sometimes initial colors like 1 start near bottom left and extend upward.\n- Additional same numbers appear stacked vertically, cluster by number and by column.\n- The output grid looks like a kind of histogram or a sorted \"stacking\" of colored cells by specific numbers along the four left columns.\n\nLooking more deeply at training example 1:\n\nInput colors of interest in [1,2,3,4], are located scattered anywhere.\n\nOutput forms vertical \"bars\" in columns 0-3 where:\n\n- Column 0 has all 1s stacked from bottom row upward\n- Column 1 has all 2s\n- Column 2 has all 3s\n- Column 3 has all 4s\n\nWithin each column, the number is stacked starting from bottom most available row upwards, so the count of that color determines height.\n\nAlso note sometimes some other color occurs (like 4 appearing in other columns in example 1) \u2014 but the output only puts those four colors in columns 0 to 3, stacking counts; the rest is 0.\n\nTraining example 2 and 3 confirm this pattern:\n\n- They count number of each color (1 to 4)\n- Fill vertical columns 0 to 3 with each color repeated as many times as it appears, stacked bottom up.\n\nThe extra detail: in example 2 output, there are some scattered other colored cells (like a '3' at (2,2)) outside the four bars. Possibly some \"isolated\" colored cells in the input for colors 1..4 that appear up top.\n\nBut the bulk is the vertical stacked color bars.\n\nIn the image of training examples, colors 1-4 appear on left columns arranged from bottom up.\n\nHypothesis for transformation:\n\n- For colors 1,2,3,4, count the total number of occurrences in input.\n- For each color c in [1..4], fill column c-1 with that color repeated in the bottom rows up to count.\n- Leave other positions zero.\n\n- Ignore all other colors.\n\nChecking if there is any subtlety:\n\n- Sometimes a vertical bar appears with counts more than number of occurrences of that color? No, counts match.\n\n- Some scattered same colored cells above or outside bars in output? For example 1 and 2, yes, some appear, but those look like scattered cells from input repeated if matched at bottom left area.\n\nIn the interest of a clean solution, the minimal viable pattern is to count colors 1..4 and build vertical bars accordingly:\n\n- column 0: all 1's, starting from bottom row upwards, count times\n- column 1: all 2's\n- column 2: all 3's\n- column 3: all 4's\n- rest zero\n\nThis matches the output patterns well and is the strongest observed pattern.\n\nHence, let's implement this straightforward solution.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation details:**\n\n- Create an empty 10x10 grid with zeros.\n- For color in [1..4]:\n  - Count appearances in input\n  - Fill column (color-1) from bottom row up to the count with that color.\n- Return resulting grid.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    height, width = 10, 10\n    output = [[0]*width for _ in range(height)]\n    \n    # Count occurrences of colors 1 to 4 in input grid\n    counts = [0]*5  # index 0 unused, colors 1-4 used\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            val = grid[r][c]\n            if 1 <= val <= 4:\n                counts[val] += 1\n                \n    # For each color 1 to 4, fill column color-1 bottom up with that color count times\n    for color in range(1, 5):\n        count = counts[color]\n        col = color - 1\n        for i in range(count):\n            output[height - 1 - i][col] = color\n            \n    return output\n```"

              "Let's analyze the task carefully:\n\nFrom the textual grids and images, we see:\n\n- Inputs are 10x10 grids with scattered colored cells (non-zero value).\n- Outputs are 10x10 grids, mostly empty except the left columns.\n\nLooking closely at the outputs:\n\n- The first four columns (indices 0,1,2,3) are populated in outputs.\n- The colors 1,2,3,4 appear in order in columns 0,1,2,3 forming vertical stacks from bottom upwards.\n- Sometimes initial colors like 1 start near bottom left and extend upward.\n- Additional same numbers appear stacked vertically, cluster by number and by column.\n- The output grid looks like a kind of histogram or a sorted \"stacking\" of colored cells by specific numbers along the four left columns.\n\nLooking more deeply at training example 1:\n\nInput colors of interest in [1,2,3,4], are located scattered anywhere.\n\nOutput forms vertical \"bars\" in columns 0-3 where:\n\n- Column 0 has all 1s stacked from bottom row upward\n- Column 1 has all 2s\n- Column 2 has all 3s\n- Column 3 has all 4s\n\nWithin each column, the number is stacked starting from bottom most available row upwards, so the count of that color determines height.\n\nAlso note sometimes some other color occurs (like 4 appearing in other columns in example 1) \u2014 but the output only puts those four colors in columns 0 to 3, stacking counts; the rest is 0.\n\nTraining example 2 and 3 confirm this pattern:\n\n- They count number of each color (1 to 4)\n- Fill vertical columns 0 to 3 with each color repeated as many times as it appears, stacked bottom up.\n\nThe extra detail: in example 2 output, there are some scattered other colored cells (like a '3' at (2,2)) outside the four bars. Possibly some \"isolated\" colored cells in the input for colors 1..4 that appear up top.\n\nBut the bulk is the vertical stacked color bars.\n\nIn the image of training examples, colors 1-4 appear on left columns arranged from bottom up.\n\nHypothesis for transformation:\n\n- For colors 1,2,3,4, count the total number of occurrences in input.\n- For each color c in [1..4], fill column c-1 with that color repeated in the bottom rows up to count.\n- Leave other positions zero.\n\n- Ignore all other colors.\n\nChecking if there is any subtlety:\n\n- Sometimes a vertical bar appears with counts more than number of occurrences of that color? No, counts match.\n\n- Some scattered same colored cells above or outside bars in output? For example 1 and 2, yes, some appear, but those look like scattered cells from input repeated if matched at bottom left area.\n\nIn the interest of a clean solution, the minimal viable pattern is to count colors 1..4 and build vertical bars accordingly:\n\n- column 0: all 1's, starting from bottom row upwards, count times\n- column 1: all 2's\n- column 2: all 3's\n- column 3: all 4's\n- rest zero\n\nThis matches the output patterns well and is the strongest observed pattern.\n\nHence, let's implement this straightforward solution.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation details:**\n\n- Create an empty 10x10 grid with zeros.\n- For color in [1..4]:\n  - Count appearances in input\n  - Fill column (color-1) from bottom row up to the count with that color.\n- Return resulting grid.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    height, width = 10, 10\n    output = [[0]*width for _ in range(height)]\n    \n    # Count occurrences of colors 1 to 4 in input grid\n    counts = [0]*5  # index 0 unused, colors 1-4 used\n    for r in range(height):\n        for c in range(width):\n            val = grid[r][c]\n            if 1 <= val <= 4:\n                counts[val] += 1\n                \n    # For each color 1 to 4, fill column color-1 bottom up with that color count times\n    for color in range(1, 5):\n        count = counts[color]\n        col = color - 1\n        for i in range(count):\n            output[height - 1 - i][col] = color\n            \n    return output\n```"
