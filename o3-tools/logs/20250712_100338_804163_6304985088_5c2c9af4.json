          "The key observations from the training examples are:\n\n- Each input grid contains a few cells with a single color (non-zero integer) forming a sparse diagonal pattern.\n- The output grid is always 23\u00d723 regardless of input size.\n- The output shows nested rectangles (or spirals) centered at the location of these input colored points.\n- The color of the output rectangles matches the color of the input points.\n- Rectangles are drawn around the point location, decreasing in size inward to the point.\n- The \"thickness\" of the rectangles is 1.\n- Multiple points of same color create multiple rectangles, sometimes overlapping or connected.\n- The rectangle(s) extent almost to the grid edge (full bounding box with minimal padding).\n- The test input similarly has a diagonal pattern of points with a color (value 4 shown visually as yellow).\n\nHypothesis for transformation:\n\n- For each distinct non-zero color in input:\n    - Find all coordinates of that color.\n    - For the minimal bounding rectangle containing all these points, draw concentric rectangles inside this bounding box on the output grid.\n    - Use the color value to fill those rectangles (value of the lines).\n- The output grid is always 23\u00d723 sized.\n- Points in input appear near the center within bounding box, output lines form concentric rectangles around the points.\n\nThis explains the nested colored rectangles in outputs.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    # Output grid is always 23x23 initialized with zeros\n    height, width = 23, 23\n    output = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=int)\n\n    input = np.array(grid)\n    # Find all colors > 0 in input\n    colors = set(input[input > 0])\n\n    # For each color, find all points and draw nested rectangles\n    for color in colors:\n        positions = np.argwhere(input == color)\n        # Find bounding box of these points\n        rmin, cmin = positions.min(axis=0)\n        rmax, cmax = positions.max(axis=0)\n\n        # To fit the bounding box into 23x23 output:\n        # We'll scale bounding box to full output size if it is smaller.\n        # However, training inputs are already 23x23.\n        # So assume points are within 23x23 and bounding box fits.\n\n        # Draw nested rectangles from outer to inner rectangles\n        # Outer rectangle: (rmin, cmin) to (rmax, cmax)\n        # Decrease coords inward, drawing rectangles until close\n        top, left = rmin, cmin\n        bottom, right = rmax, cmax\n\n        # To avoid too tight rectangle if rmin==rmax etc:\n        # We draw rectangles inward until top > bottom or left > right\n        while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n            # Draw top row\n            output[top, left:right+1] = color\n            # Draw bottom row\n            output[bottom, left:right+1] = color\n            # Draw left column\n            output[top:bottom+1, left] = color\n            # Draw right column\n            output[top:bottom+1, right] = color\n\n            top += 1\n            left += 1\n            bottom -= 1\n            right -= 1\n\n    # Convert numpy array back to list of lists\n    return output.tolist()\n```"

              "The key observations from the training examples are:\n\n- Each input grid contains a few cells with a single color (non-zero integer) forming a sparse diagonal pattern.\n- The output grid is always 23\u00d723 regardless of input size.\n- The output shows nested rectangles (or spirals) centered at the location of these input colored points.\n- The color of the output rectangles matches the color of the input points.\n- Rectangles are drawn around the point location, decreasing in size inward to the point.\n- The \"thickness\" of the rectangles is 1.\n- Multiple points of same color create multiple rectangles, sometimes overlapping or connected.\n- The rectangle(s) extent almost to the grid edge (full bounding box with minimal padding).\n- The test input similarly has a diagonal pattern of points with a color (value 4 shown visually as yellow).\n\nHypothesis for transformation:\n\n- For each distinct non-zero color in input:\n    - Find all coordinates of that color.\n    - For the minimal bounding rectangle containing all these points, draw concentric rectangles inside this bounding box on the output grid.\n    - Use the color value to fill those rectangles (value of the lines).\n- The output grid is always 23\u00d723 sized.\n- Points in input appear near the center within bounding box, output lines form concentric rectangles around the points.\n\nThis explains the nested colored rectangles in outputs.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    # Output grid is always 23x23 initialized with zeros\n    height, width = 23, 23\n    output = np.zeros((height, width), dtype=int)\n\n    input = np.array(grid)\n    # Find all colors > 0 in input\n    colors = set(input[input > 0])\n\n    # For each color, find all points and draw nested rectangles\n    for color in colors:\n        positions = np.argwhere(input == color)\n        # Find bounding box of these points\n        rmin, cmin = positions.min(axis=0)\n        rmax, cmax = positions.max(axis=0)\n\n        # To fit the bounding box into 23x23 output:\n        # We'll scale bounding box to full output size if it is smaller.\n        # However, training inputs are already 23x23.\n        # So assume points are within 23x23 and bounding box fits.\n\n        # Draw nested rectangles from outer to inner rectangles\n        # Outer rectangle: (rmin, cmin) to (rmax, cmax)\n        # Decrease coords inward, drawing rectangles until close\n        top, left = rmin, cmin\n        bottom, right = rmax, cmax\n\n        # To avoid too tight rectangle if rmin==rmax etc:\n        # We draw rectangles inward until top > bottom or left > right\n        while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n            # Draw top row\n            output[top, left:right+1] = color\n            # Draw bottom row\n            output[bottom, left:right+1] = color\n            # Draw left column\n            output[top:bottom+1, left] = color\n            # Draw right column\n            output[top:bottom+1, right] = color\n\n            top += 1\n            left += 1\n            bottom -= 1\n            right -= 1\n\n    # Convert numpy array back to list of lists\n    return output.tolist()\n```"
