          "Let's analyze the patterns carefully:\n\n### Observations from the textual description and image:\n\n#### Training examples:\n- The **left columns** of the input grids have vertical bars of distinct colors (e.g. digits 8 and 2 in example 1, digits 9, 6, 4 in example 2).\n- These vertical bars on the left maintain their positions and colors in the output.\n- On the **right part of the grid**, there is a gray shape (digit 5 in example 1 & 2) in input that transforms (in output) into the color of the vertical bar on the left in the same row.\n\nFor example, in example 1:\n- The vertical left bar digits are 8 (top rows) and 2 (bottom rows).\n- The gray color digit 5 in the input transforms into either 8 or 2 in the output depending on the vertical bar on the left in the corresponding row.\n\nSimilarly, in example 2:\n- Vertical bar digits are 9, 6, 4 on the left.\n- Gray 5's on the right transform into the corresponding digit of the vertical bar in their row.\n\n#### From the images and the test input:\n- The grayscale shape in the input is replaced by the vertically adjacent distinct color on the left.\n- The vertical bar colors remain unchanged.\n- Background (0) remains as 0.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- The **color of the vertical bar on the left determines the color that replaces '5' on that row in the output.**\n- The shape of the gray region remains the same but recolored.\n- All non-5 colors except the vertical bar are reset to 0.\n- The vertical bar remains unchanged.\n\n### Steps to implement the solution:\n1. Identify the vertical bars on the left (the contiguous colored cells from top to bottom in column 0).\n2. For each row, get the color in column 0 (the vertical bar value).\n3. Create output grid initialized to 0.\n4. Copy vertical bar column to output as is.\n5. For other columns:\n   - If input color == 5, replace with the vertical bar color of that row.\n   - Else, map to 0.\n\nThis matches both textual description and observed behavior from training examples.\n\n---\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Size is always 10x10 as per problem statement\n    n_rows, n_cols = 10, 10\n\n    # Initialize output with zeros\n    output = [[0]*n_cols for _ in range(n_rows)]\n\n    # Extract the vertical bar values from column 0 for each row\n    vertical_bar_colors = [grid[r][0] for r in range(n_rows)]\n\n    for r in range(n_rows):\n        # Copy vertical bar (col=0)\n        output[r][0] = vertical_bar_colors[r]\n        for c in range(1, n_cols):\n            val = grid[r][c]\n            if val == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with vertical bar color\n                output[r][c] = vertical_bar_colors[r]\n            else:\n                # Else 0 (background or other colors removed)\n                output[r][c] = 0\n    return output\n```"

              "Let's analyze the patterns carefully:\n\n### Observations from the textual description and image:\n\n#### Training examples:\n- The **left columns** of the input grids have vertical bars of distinct colors (e.g. digits 8 and 2 in example 1, digits 9, 6, 4 in example 2).\n- These vertical bars on the left maintain their positions and colors in the output.\n- On the **right part of the grid**, there is a gray shape (digit 5 in example 1 & 2) in input that transforms (in output) into the color of the vertical bar on the left in the same row.\n\nFor example, in example 1:\n- The vertical left bar digits are 8 (top rows) and 2 (bottom rows).\n- The gray color digit 5 in the input transforms into either 8 or 2 in the output depending on the vertical bar on the left in the corresponding row.\n\nSimilarly, in example 2:\n- Vertical bar digits are 9, 6, 4 on the left.\n- Gray 5's on the right transform into the corresponding digit of the vertical bar in their row.\n\n#### From the images and the test input:\n- The grayscale shape in the input is replaced by the vertically adjacent distinct color on the left.\n- The vertical bar colors remain unchanged.\n- Background (0) remains as 0.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- The **color of the vertical bar on the left determines the color that replaces '5' on that row in the output.**\n- The shape of the gray region remains the same but recolored.\n- All non-5 colors except the vertical bar are reset to 0.\n- The vertical bar remains unchanged.\n\n### Steps to implement the solution:\n1. Identify the vertical bars on the left (the contiguous colored cells from top to bottom in column 0).\n2. For each row, get the color in column 0 (the vertical bar value).\n3. Create output grid initialized to 0.\n4. Copy vertical bar column to output as is.\n5. For other columns:\n   - If input color == 5, replace with the vertical bar color of that row.\n   - Else, map to 0.\n\nThis matches both textual description and observed behavior from training examples.\n\n---\n\n### Code Implementation:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Size is always 10x10 as per problem statement\n    n_rows, n_cols = 10, 10\n\n    # Initialize output with zeros\n    output = [[0]*n_cols for _ in range(n_rows)]\n\n    # Extract the vertical bar values from column 0 for each row\n    vertical_bar_colors = [grid[r][0] for r in range(n_rows)]\n\n    for r in range(n_rows):\n        # Copy vertical bar (col=0)\n        output[r][0] = vertical_bar_colors[r]\n        for c in range(1, n_cols):\n            val = grid[r][c]\n            if val == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with vertical bar color\n                output[r][c] = vertical_bar_colors[r]\n            else:\n                # Else 0 (background or other colors removed)\n                output[r][c] = 0\n    return output\n```"
