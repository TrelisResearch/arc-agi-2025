    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput has rows like 0 0 0 0, and then some rows with numbers. The output seems to have the same numbers but in a different order. Let me check the input and output rows.\n\nInput rows 6 to 10 are:\n0 0 0 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n2 0 3 9\n2 4 3 9\n\nOutput rows 0 to 4 (since output is 10 rows) are:\n2 4 3 9\n2 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 0 9\n\nWait, the output starts with the last row of the input? Let me see. The input's last row is 2 4 3 9. The output's first row is 2 4 3 9. Then the next output row is 2 0 3 9, which was the fourth input row. Then 0 0 3 9 (third input row?), then 0 0 3 9 again (third input row?), then 0 0 0 9 (second input row?).\n\nHmm, maybe the output is the input rows reversed? Let's check. The input has 10 rows. The output has 10 rows. Let me check the input rows in order and see if the output is reversed.\n\nOriginal input rows (example 1):\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nOutput rows (example 1):\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9 (input row 9)\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9 (input row 8)\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9 (input row 7)\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9 (input row 6)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 (input row 5)\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9 (input row 5 again? Or maybe row 5 is input row 5, then row 6 is input row 6? Wait, the output has 10 rows. Let me check:\n\nThe output has 10 rows. Let me list them:\n\nOutput rows 0-4 are input rows 9, 8, 7, 6, 5. Then rows 5-9?\n\nWait, the output for example 1 has 10 rows. Let me check:\n\nThe output given is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nSo the output rows 0-4 are input rows 9, 8, 7, 6, 5. Then rows 5-9 are input rows 5, 5, 6, 7, 8? Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the output is a reversed version of the input rows, but with some duplicates?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, but with some rows duplicated. Let me check.\n\nOriginal input rows 5-9 are:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nThe output rows 0-4 are 9, 8, 7, 6, 5. Then rows 5-9 are 5, 5, 6, 7, 8?\n\nWait, output row 5 is 0 0 0 9 (input row 5). Then row 6 is same as row 5? Or maybe there's a pattern where the first few rows are reversed, then some duplication?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, but with some rows repeated. For example, in example 1, the output starts with the last row of input, then the previous rows, but then maybe some rows are duplicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, but with the first few rows being reversed and then some rows are duplicated. Let me check the output for example 1:\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9 (input row 9)\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9 (input row 8)\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9 (input row 7)\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9 (input row 6)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 (input row 5)\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9 (input row 5 again)\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9 (input row 6 again?)\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9 (input row 7 again)\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9 (input row 8 again)\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9 (input row 9 again)\n\nHmm, that seems like the first five rows are the input rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then rows 5-9 are 5,6,7,8,9? Or maybe the output is the input rows reversed, but then the first five rows are reversed, and then the next five are the same as the first five?\n\nWait, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, but then the first five rows are reversed, and then the next five are the same as the first five? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, but with some rows duplicated. For example, in example 1, the output rows 0-4 are the input rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then rows 5-9 are the same as rows 0-4 again? But that would make the output rows 5-9 same as rows 0-4. But in the example, row 5 is 0 0 0 9 (input row 5), which is the same as row 4 of the output. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, but then some rows are duplicated. Let's check example 2.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2\nRow 6: 0 0 0 2\nRow 7: 0 8 0 2\nRow 8: 0 3 8 2\nRow 9: 3 3 8 2\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 8 2 (input row 9)\nRow 1: 0 3 8 2 (input row 8)\nRow 2: 0 8 0 2 (input row 7)\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 (input row 6)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 (input row 5)\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2 (input row 5)\nRow 6: 0 0 0 2 (input row 5)\nRow 7: 0 8 0 2 (input row 7)\nRow 8: 0 3 8 2 (input row 8)\nRow 9: 3 3 8 2 (input row 9)\n\nSo the output rows 0-4 are input rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then rows 5-9 are 5,5,5,7,8? Or maybe rows 5-9 are input rows 5,5,5,7,8? That doesn't seem to fit. Alternatively, the output rows 5-9 are the same as rows 0-4 again. But in example 2, row 5 is 0 0 0 2 (input row 5), row 6 is same as row 5, row 7 is input row 7, row 8 is input row 8, row 9 is input row 9. So the output for example 2 is:\n\nFirst 5 rows are input rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then rows 5-9 are input rows 5,5,5,7,8? Or perhaps the output is the input rows reversed, then the first five rows are reversed, then the next five are the same as the first five? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, and then the first five rows are reversed, and then the next five rows are the same as the first five. But that's not matching the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, but then the first five rows are reversed, and then the next five rows are the same as the first five. But in example 1, the output rows 5-9 are 5,5,6,7,8. Wait, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows reversed, but with the first five rows being reversed, and then the next five rows being the same as the first five. But in example 1, the output rows 0-4 are input rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then rows 5-9 are 5,6,7,8,9. So that would be the same as the first five rows reversed again. But that would make the output for example 1 as:\n\nrows 0-4: 9,8,7,6,5\n\nrows 5-9: 5,6,7,8,9\n\nBut that's not the case. Because in example 1, row 5 is 0 0 0 9 (input row 5). Then row 6 is 0 0 3 9 (input row 6), row 7 is 0 0 3 9 (input row 7?), row 8 is 2 0 3 9 (input row 8), row 9 is 2 4 3 9 (input row 9). So rows 5-9 are input rows 5,6,7,8,9. So the output is the first five rows reversed (input rows 9,8,7,6,5), then the next five rows are input rows 5,6,7,8,9. So the output is the input rows reversed, then the input rows again? But that's not possible. Wait, but the output is 10 rows. So for example 1, the output is the input rows 9,8,7,6,5, then 5,6,7,8,9. So the output is the first five rows reversed, then the next five rows are the same as the original input rows 5-9. But that doesn't fit with the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, then the first five rows are reversed, and the next five are the same as the first five. But that's not matching the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, and then some rows are duplicated. For example, in example 1, the output is the input rows 9,8,7,6,5, then 5,6,7,8,9. But that would be the input rows reversed, then the same as the original input rows 5-9. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, but then for the first five rows, they are reversed, and then the next five rows are the same as the original input rows. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, and then the first five rows are reversed again. But that would be the same as the original input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows reversed, but with some rows duplicated. For example, in example 1, the output is the input rows 9,8,7,6,5, then 5,6,7,8,9. So the first five rows are the input rows 9,8,7,6,5 (reversed input rows 5-9), and the next five rows are the input rows 5,6,7,8,9 (original input rows 5-9). But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, then the first five rows are reversed again. But that would be the same as the original input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, then the first five rows are the same as the original input rows.

But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, and then the first five rows are reversed again. But that would be the same as the original input.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's think about the positions of numbers. For example, in example 1, the input has some rows with 9, 3, 2, etc. The output seems to have the same numbers but arranged in a different order. Maybe the output is the input rows reversed, but then the first five rows are the same as the input rows 5-9, and then the next five rows are the same as the input rows 5-9 again. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, and then the first five rows are reversed again. For example, in example 1, the input rows are 0-9. The output is the input rows reversed (rows 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0), but then the first five rows are reversed again. But that would not fit the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, and then the first five rows are the same as the original input rows 5-9. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, but then the first five rows are reversed again. For example, the input rows 9,8,7,6,5 (reversed input rows 5-9), then the next five rows are 5,6,7,8,9 (original input rows 5-9). So the output is the input rows reversed, then the first five rows are reversed again. But that's not making sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, but then the first five rows are the same as the original input rows 5-9. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, and then the first five rows are reversed again. So for example, the input rows reversed are 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0. Then the first five rows are reversed again, so 5,6,7,8,9. Then the next five rows are 4,3,2,1,0. But that would not match the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, and then the first five rows are the same as the input rows 5-9. So for example, input rows 5-9 are 5,6,7,8,9. Then the output is 9,8,7,6,5, followed by 5,6,7,8,9. That would make the output for example 1 as:\n\nRows 0-4: 9,8,7,6,5\n\nRows 5-9: 5,6,7,8,9\n\nWhich is what I see in example 1's output. Let me check example 1's output again. The output rows 0-4 are 9,8,7,6,5. Then rows 5-9 are 5,6,7,8,9. So that's the same as the input rows 5-9. So the output is the input rows reversed (rows 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0), but then the first five rows are the input rows 9,8,7,6,5, and then the next five rows are the input rows 5,6,7,8,9. But that doesn't fit. Wait, no. The input rows 5-9 are 5,6,7,8,9. So the output is the input rows 9,8,7,6,5 (rows 9,8,7,6,5), then 5,6,7,8,9 (rows 5,6,7,8,9). So the output is the first five rows of the input reversed (rows 9,8,7,6,5) and then the next five rows are the input rows 5-9. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, and then the first five rows are the same as the original input rows 5-9. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows reversed, and then the first five rows are the same as the original input rows 5-9. But that would make the output rows 0-4 as 9,8,7,6,5, and rows 5-9 as 5,6,7,8,9. Which is what I see in example 1.\n\nBut how does that fit with example 2?\n\nIn example 2, the input rows 5-9 are:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 2\n\nRow 7: 0 8 0 2\n\nRow 8: 0 3 8 2\n\nRow 9: 3 3 8 2\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\nRows 0-4: 9,8,7,6,5 (input rows 9,8,7,6,5)\n\nRows 5-9: 5,6,7,8,9 (input rows 5,6,7,8,9)\n\nSo the output for example 2 is the same as example 1. So the output is the input rows reversed, then the first five rows are the input rows 9,8,7,6,5 (which is the reversed input rows 5-9), and the next five rows are the input rows 5-9. So the output is the input rows reversed, then the first five rows are the reversed input rows 5-9, and the next five rows are the input rows 5-9. But that's not making sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, but then the first five rows are the input rows 5-9. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, then the first five rows are the same as the input rows 5-9. So for example, the input rows 5-9 are 5,6,7,8,9. Then the output is 9,8,7,6,5, then 5,6,7,8,9. So the output is the input rows reversed (rows 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0), but then the first five rows are the input rows 9,8,7,6,5, and the next five rows are input rows 5,6,7,8,9. But how is that possible?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, then the first five rows are the same as the input rows 5-9. But that would mean that the output is:\n\nrows 0-4: input rows 9,8,7,6,5\n\nrows 5-9: input rows 5,6,7,8,9\n\nWhich is what I see in both examples. So the output is taking the input rows 9,8,7,6,5 (reversed input rows 5-9), then the input rows 5-9 again. So the output is the first five rows of the input reversed (rows 9,8,7,6,5), then the next five rows are the input rows 5-9. But that would mean that the output is the input rows reversed, then the first five rows are the reversed input rows 5-9, and then the next five rows are the input rows 5-9.\n\nBut how does that fit with the test input? Let me check the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n7 1 0 0\n7 1 3 0\n7 1 3 3\n7 1 4 4\n\nSo input rows 0-4 are all zeros. Then row 5 is [0,1,0,0], row 6 is [7,1,0,0], row 7 is [7,1,3,0], row 8 is [7,1,3,3], row 9 is [7,1,4,4].\n\nIf the output is the first five rows reversed (rows 9,8,7,6,5) and then the next five rows as input rows 5-9, then the output would be:\n\nrows 0-4: [7,1,4,4], [7,1,3,3], [7,1,3,0], [7,1,0,0], [0,1,0,0]\n\nrows 5-9: [0,1,0,0], [7,1,0,0], [7,1,3,0], [7,1,3,3], [7,1,4,4]\n\nBut the output must be 10 rows. So the output for the test input would be:\n\nrows 0-4: rows 9,8,7,6,5 of input\n\nrows 5-9: rows 5,6,7,8,9 of input\n\nBut that's what the pattern seems to be. So the transformation is to take the input rows, reverse the first 5 rows (rows 5-9?), then take the next five rows as the original rows 5-9.\n\nWait, but in example 1, the input has 10 rows. The output is the first five rows (rows 9,8,7,6,5) and then the next five rows (rows 5,6,7,8,9). So the output is the first five rows of the input (rows 5-9) reversed, then the next five rows are the original rows 5-9.\n\nSo the pattern is: the output is the input rows reversed for the first five rows (rows 5-9), then the next five rows are the original rows 5-9.\n\nBut how does that work? Let me think again.\n\nIn example 1, the input has 10 rows. The output is:\n\nrows 0-4: input rows 9,8,7,6,5 (reversed rows 5-9)\n\nrows 5-9: input rows 5,6,7,8,9 (original rows 5-9)\n\nSo the output is:\n\noutput_rows[0-4] = input_rows[9], input_rows[8], input_rows[7], input_rows[6], input_rows[5]\n\noutput_rows[5-9] = input_rows[5], input_rows[6], input_rows[7], input_rows[8], input_rows[9]\n\nSo the output is the first five rows of the input (rows 5-9) reversed, then the next five rows are the original rows 5-9.\n\nBut how to implement that?\n\nThe input has 10 rows. The output is 10 rows. The first five rows of the output are the input rows 9,8,7,6,5. The next five rows are the input rows 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo the output is:\n\noutput = [input[9], input[8], input[7], input[6], input[5]] + [input[5], input[6], input[7], input[8], input[9]]\n\nWait, but that would make the output for example 1 as:\n\nrows 0-4: input rows 9,8,7,6,5\n\nrows 5-9: input rows 5,6,7,8,9\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nSimilarly for example 2, the output is:\n\nrows 0-4: input rows 9,8,7,6,5\n\nrows 5-9: input rows 5,6,7,8,9\n\nSo the pattern is that the output is the input rows 9,8,7,6,5 followed by input rows 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo the transformation is to take the input rows 5-9, reverse them, then append them again in original order.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nTake the input grid, which is 10 rows. The output is:\n\noutput_rows = [input_rows[9], input_rows[8], input_rows[7], input_rows[6], input_rows[5]] + [input_rows[5], input_rows[6], input_rows[7], input_rows[8], input_rows[9]]\n\nBut wait, the input rows are 0-9. So rows 5-9 are the 6th to 10th rows (assuming 0-based). So the first five rows of the output are the input rows 9,8,7,6,5 (rows 9,8,7,6,5), then the next five rows are input rows 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo in code, for a grid with 10 rows, the output is:\n\noutput = []\nfor i in range(5):\n    output.append(grid[9 - i])\nfor i in range(5):\n    output.append(grid[5 + i])\n\nWait, but the first part is for i in 0-4: grid[9 - i] is grid[9], grid[8], grid[7], grid[6], grid[5]. Then for the next part, i ranges from 0-4: grid[5 + i] is grid[5], grid[6], grid[7], grid[8], grid[9].\n\nYes. So the output is the first five rows being the input rows 9,8,7,6,5, then the next five rows being input rows 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern.\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the input rows 5-9 are:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\n\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\n\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\n\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\n\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nSo the first five rows of the output are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9 (row 9)\n\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9 (row 8)\n\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9 (row 7)\n\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9 (row 6)\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 (row 5)\n\nThen rows 5-9 are:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9 (row 5)\n\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9 (row 6)\n\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9 (row 7)\n\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9 (row 8)\n\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9 (row 9)\n\nWhich matches the example. So this seems to be the correct pattern.\n\nSo the code needs to take the input grid, and for the output, take the last five rows (rows 5-9) in reverse order, then the same rows again in original order.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take the input grid, which is 10 rows\n    # Output is 10 rows\n    # First five rows are grid[9], grid[8], grid[7], grid[6], grid[5]\n    # Next five rows are grid[5], grid[6], grid[7], grid[8], grid[9]\n    output = []\n    # First part: reverse the rows 5-9\n    for i in range(5):\n        output.append(grid[9 - i])\n    # Second part: original rows 5-9\n    for i in range(5):\n        output.append(grid[5 + i])\n    return output\n\nWait, but grid is a list of lists. So for example, grid is a list of 10 rows, each row is a list of 4 elements.\n\nSo this code would take the first five rows as the reversed rows 5-9, then the next five as the original rows 5-9.\n\nSo for the test input, the output would be:\n\nThe first five rows are the input rows 9,8,7,6,5.\n\nThe input rows 5-9 are:\n\nRow 5: [0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nRow 6: [7, 1, 0, 0]\n\nRow 7: [7, 1, 3, 0]\n\nRow 8: [7, 1, 3, 3]\n\nRow 9: [7, 1, 4, 4]\n\nSo the first five rows of output are:\n\n[7,1,4,4], [7,1,3,3], [7,1,3,0], [7,1,0,0], [0,1,0,0]\n\nThen the next five rows are:\n\n[0,1,0,0], [7,1,0,0], [7,1,3,0], [7,1,3,3], [7,1,4,4]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[\n[7,1,4,4],\n[7,1,3,3],\n[7,1,3,0],\n[7,1,0,0],\n[0,1,0,0],\n[0,1,0,0],\n[7,1,0,0],\n[7,1,3,0],\n[7,1,3,3],\n[7,1,4,4]\n]\n\nBut the test input's output is not given, but according to the pattern, this is the expected output.\n\nSo the code seems to be correct based on the examples.\n\nSo the code is to take the input grid's rows 5-9, reverse them, then append them again in original order.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in Python. The function should take a 2D list (grid) and return a new 2D list of 10 rows, each with 4 elements.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = []\n    # First part: reverse the rows 5-9\n    for i in range(5):\n        output.append(grid[9 - i])\n    # Second part: original rows 5-9\n    for i in range(5):\n        output.append(grid[5 + i])\n    return output\n\nWait, but grid is a list of 10 rows. So grid[5] is row 5, grid[9] is row 9.\n\nYes. So this code would generate the correct output.\n\nTesting this code with example 1:\n\nInput grid rows 5-9 are:\n\nrow 5: [0,0,0,9]\n\nrow 6: [0,0,3,9]\n\nrow 7: [0,0,3,9]\n\nrow 8: [2,0,3,9]\n\nrow 9: [2,4,3,9]\n\nThe first part of the output is:\n\nrow 9, row 8, row 7, row 6, row 5 \u2192 which is the rows in the example's output rows 0-4.\n\nThe second part is rows 5,6,7,8,9 \u2192 which are the rows in the example's output rows 5-9.\n\nYes, so this code would work for the examples.\n\nSo the code is as written.\n"

Let me look at the input and output rows.\n\nInput rows (from example 1):\n\nRow 0: all 0s\nRow 1: all 0s\n...\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nHmm, the output seems to have the rows from the input starting from row 8 and 9, then row 6 and 7, then row 2 and 3, then row 4 and 5, and then the original rows 0-1?

The output rows 0-4 are:\n\nRow0: 2 4 3 9 (original row9)\nRow1: 2 0 3 9 (original row8)\nRow2: 0 0 3 9 (original row6)\nRow3: 0 0 3 9 (original row7)\nRow4: 0 0 0 9 (original row5)\nRow5: 0 0 0 9 (original row5 again? Or maybe row4? Wait, original input has row5 as 0 0 0 9. Then row4 in input is 0 0 0 0. So in output row5 is 0 0 0 9. So maybe the output is taking some rows from the input and reordering them. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a reversed version of some part of the input. Let me check the output rows. The output seems to have rows that are in the same order as the input, but starting from the bottom and moving up. For example, in example 1, the output starts with row9, then row8, then row6, row7, row5, then row4, etc. Wait, maybe the output is taking the rows from the input, but in reverse order, but not all. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is a transformation where certain rows are moved to the top. For example, in example 1, the rows that have 2 4 3 9 (row9) and 2 0 3 9 (row8) are moved to the top. Then rows 6 and 7 (0 0 3 9) are next. Then row5 (0 0 0 9) and row4 (0 0 0 0?), but in the output, row4 is 0 0 0 9. Wait, maybe the rows are being reordered such that the rows with higher values are moved up. Or maybe the output is the input rows in reverse order, but with some changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but the rows that have certain values are moved to the top. For example, in example 1, the output starts with the rows that have 2 4 3 9 and 2 0 3 9, then the rows with 0 0 3 9, then 0 0 0 9, etc. Maybe the output is taking the rows that have the highest values first, but that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 2\nRow6: 0 0 0 2\nRow7: 0 8 0 2\nRow8: 0 3 8 2\nRow9: 3 3 8 2\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: 3 3 8 2 (original row9)\nRow1: 0 3 8 2 (original row8)\nRow2: 0 8 0 2 (original row7)\nRow3: 0 0 0 2 (original row5)\nRow4: 0 0 0 2 (original row6)\nRow5: 0 0 0 2 (original row5 again?)\nRow6: 0 0 0 2 (original row6 again?)\nRow7: 0 8 0 2 (original row7)\nRow8: 0 3 8 2 (original row8)\nRow9: 3 3 8 2 (original row9)\n\nSo the output seems to have the rows from the input in a certain order. For example, the output starts with row9, then row8, then row7, then row5, row6, then row5 again, row6 again, then row7 again, row8 again, row9 again. That seems odd. Maybe the output is taking some rows and reversing them, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but with some rows duplicated or moved. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is the input rows, but the rows are reversed in some way. For example, in example 1, the output starts with row9, then row8, then row6, row7, then row5, then row4 (original row4?), but in the output, row4 is 0 0 0 9. But original row5 is 0 0 0 9. So maybe the output is taking the rows from the input, but starting from the bottom and moving up, but only certain rows. For example, in example 1, the output starts with the last two rows (row9 and row8), then the next two rows (row6 and 7), then row5, then row4 (but original row4 is 0 0 0 0?), but in the output, row4 is 0 0 0 9. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but with the rows that have a 9 in the fourth column moved to the top. Let's check. In example 1, the input rows with 9 in the fourth column are row5, row6, row7, row8, row9. The output starts with row9, row8, row6, row7, row5, etc. So maybe the output is taking the rows that have 9 in the fourth column and moving them to the top, then the rest. But in example 1, the output has rows 0-4 as row9, row8, row6, row7, row5. Then row5 is 0 0 0 9, which is the same as the input row5. Then row6 is 0 0 3 9, which is the same as input row6. Then row7 is 0 0 3 9 (input row7). Then row8 is 2 0 3 9 (input row8). Then row9 is 2 4 3 9 (input row9). So maybe the output is taking the rows that have 9 in the fourth column, and then the rest. But in example 1, the output has rows 0-4 as row9, row8, row6, row7, row5. Then rows 5-9 are row5, row6, row7, row8, row9 again? That seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but reversed. Let me check. The input for example 1 has 10 rows. The output is also 10 rows. If we reverse the input rows, the first row would be row9, then row8, then row7, row6, row5, row4, row3, row2, row1, row0. But the output for example1 is:\n\nRow0: 2 4 3 9 (input row9)\nRow1: 2 0 3 9 (input row8)\nRow2: 0 0 3 9 (input row6)\nRow3: 0 0 3 9 (input row7)\nRow4: 0 0 0 9 (input row5)\nRow5: 0 0 0 9 (input row5 again?)\nRow6: 0 0 3 9 (input row6 again?)\nRow7: 0 0 3 9 (input row7 again?)\nRow8: 2 0 3 9 (input row8 again?)\nRow9: 2 4 3 9 (input row9 again?)\n\nSo this doesn't match the reversed input. Because the reversed input would have row5 (original input row5) as the 6th row. But in the output, row4 is input row5, and row5 is input row5 again. So that's not reversed.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is the input rows, but with some rows duplicated. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example2:\n\nInput rows 5-9 are:\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 2\nRow6: 0 0 0 2\nRow7: 0 8 0 2\nRow8: 0 3 8 2\nRow9: 3 3 8 2\n\nOutput rows 0-9:\n\nRow0: 3 3 8 2 (row9)\nRow1: 0 3 8 2 (row8)\nRow2: 0 8 0 2 (row7)\nRow3: 0 0 0 2 (row5)\nRow4: 0 0 0 2 (row6)\nRow5: 0 0 0 2 (row5 again?)\nRow6: 0 0 0 2 (row6 again?)\nRow7: 0 8 0 2 (row7 again?)\nRow8: 0 3 8 2 (row8 again?)\nRow9: 3 3 8 2 (row9 again?)\n\nSo the output seems to have the rows in the order of row9, row8, row7, row5, row6, then row5 again, row6 again, row7 again, row8 again, row9 again. That's not a clear pattern. But maybe the output is taking the rows in the order of row9, row8, row7, then row5, row6, then row5 again, row6 again, then row7 again, row8 again, row9 again. That seems like the rows are being duplicated and reordered. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but with some rows moved to the top. For example, in example1, the output starts with the rows that have the highest values. For instance, row9 has 2 4 3 9, which is higher than others. Then row8 has 2 0 3 9, then row6 and 7, then row5, then row4 (but row4 is 0 0 0 0 in input, but in output row4 is 0 0 0 9. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but with the rows that have a 9 in the fourth column moved to the top, and then the rest. But in example1, the input rows with 9 in the fourth column are rows5,6,7,8,9. The output starts with row9, row8, row6, row7, row5. Then the rest of the rows. But the output has rows 5-9 as row5, row6, row7, row8, row9. So that's the same as the original rows. So maybe the output is the input rows, but with the rows that have 9 in the fourth column moved to the top, but in reverse order. So rows with 9 in the fourth column are ordered from row9 to row5. Then the rest of the rows are in their original order. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but with the rows that have 9 in the fourth column moved to the top, and the rest of the rows are kept in their original order. But in example1, the output has the rows with 9 in the fourth column first, then the rows without. But in example1, the output has rows with 9 in the fourth column first, then the rest. But in the output, the rows with 9 are in the first five rows (rows0-4), then rows5-9 are the original rows (rows5-9). But that's not the case. Because in the output, rows5-9 are row5 (original row5), row6 (original row6), row7 (original row7), row8 (original row8), row9 (original row9). So that's the same as the original order. So maybe the output is the input rows, but the rows that have 9 in the fourth column are moved to the top in reverse order. For example, in example1, the input rows with 9 in the fourth column are row5,6,7,8,9. The output starts with row9, then row8, then row6, row7, row5. Then the rest of the rows are in the original order. But why row6 and row7 are in that order? Because in the input, row6 is before row7. But in the output, row6 comes before row7. So that's the same as the original order. So maybe the output is the rows with 9 in the fourth column, sorted in reverse order (from row9 to row5), followed by the other rows in their original order. But then in example1, the output has those rows in reverse order, then the other rows. But the other rows are rows 0-4, which are all 0s. So the output is the rows with 9 in the fourth column in reverse order, then the rest.\n\nBut in example2, the input rows with 9 in the fourth column are rows5-9. Wait, no. In example2, the input rows with 9 in the fourth column? Let me check:\n\nIn example2, the input rows are:\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 2\nRow6: 0 0 0 2\nRow7: 0 8 0 2\nRow8: 0 3 8 2\nRow9: 3 3 8 2\n\nSo the fourth column is 2 for all of these. So maybe the 9 in the fourth column is not present. Wait, but the output for example2 has rows that have 2 in the fourth column. So maybe the pattern is not about the fourth column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but the rows are reversed in some way. For example, in example1, the output is the input rows reversed, but with some changes. Let me check:\n\nInput for example1 has rows 0-9. Reversed input would be row9, row8, row7, row6, row5, row4, row3, row2, row1, row0. The output for example1 is:\n\nRow0: 2 4 3 9 (row9)\nRow1: 2 0 3 9 (row8)\nRow2: 0 0 3 9 (row6)\nRow3: 0 0 3 9 (row7)\nRow4: 0 0 0 9 (row5)\nRow5: 0 0 0 9 (row5 again?)\nRow6: 0 0 3 9 (row6 again?)\nRow7: 0 0 3 9 (row7 again?)\nRow8: 2 0 3 9 (row8 again?)\nRow9: 2 4 3 9 (row9 again?)\n\nSo this doesn't match the reversed input. Because in the reversed input, row5 would be the sixth row (original row5), but in the output, row4 is original row5, row5 is original row5 again, etc. So this is not the case.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is the input rows, but the rows are grouped in a certain way. For example, in example1, the output starts with the rows that have 2 in the first column, then the rows with 0 in the first column. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but with the rows that have certain values moved to the top. For example, in example1, the rows with 2 in the first column are moved to the top. Let's see:\n\nIn the input, rows with 2 in the first column are row8 (2 0 3 9) and row9 (2 4 3 9). These are moved to the top in the output. Then the rows with 0 in the first column are moved next. But in the output, after row9 and row8, there are rows with 0 in the first column (row6, row7, row5, row4, etc). So maybe the output is the rows sorted by the first column in descending order, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows, but with the rows that have 9 in the fourth column moved to the top in reverse order, and then the rest of the rows are kept in their original order. For example, in example1, the rows with 9 in the fourth column are row5,6,7,8,9. The output starts with row9, row8, row6, row7, row5. Then the rest of the rows (rows0-4) are kept in their original order. But in the output, rows5-9 are row5, row6, row7, row8, row9. So that's the same as the original order. So maybe the output is the rows with 9 in the fourth column, in reverse order, followed by the other rows in their original order.\n\nBut how does this fit with example2? Let's check example2. The output for example2 has rows0-9 as:\n\nRow0: 3 3 8 2 (row9)\nRow1: 0 3 8 2 (row8)\nRow2: 0 8 0 2 (row7)\nRow3: 0 0 0 2 (row5)\nRow4: 0 0 0 2 (row6)\nRow5: 0 0 0 2 (row5)\nRow6: 0 0 0 2 (row6)\nRow7: 0 8 0 2 (row7)\nRow8: 0 3 8 2 (row8)\nRow9: 3 3 8 2 (row9)\n\nSo the rows with 2 in the fourth column are all the rows in the input (since all rows in the input have 2 in the fourth column). So maybe the pattern is not based on the fourth column. Alternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows, but with the rows ordered in a certain way.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the test input. The test input has:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 0\nRow5: 0 1 0 0\nRow6: 7 1 0 0\nRow7: 7 1 3 0\nRow8: 7 1 3 3\nRow9: 7 1 4 4\n\nThe output should be a 10x4 grid. So what's the pattern here? Maybe the output is the input rows, but with some transformation. For example, in the test input, the rows with 7 in the first column are rows6-9. Maybe those are moved to the top. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but the rows are reversed. Let's check:\n\nIf we reverse the input rows, then the first row would be row9, then row8, row7, row6, row5, row4, row3, row2, row1, row0. But the test input's output is not known, but the user hasn't provided it. So I can't check that.\n\nBut based on the training examples, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the order of the rows, but with some modification. For example, in example1, the output starts with row9, row8, then row6, row7, row5, then row4, row3, row2, row1, row0. But that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but the rows are grouped by the fourth column's value, and then ordered in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but the rows are reversed in some way. For example, in example1, the output has the rows from the input in reverse order, but with some rows duplicated. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for example1, the first two rows are row9 and row8. Then row6 and row7. Then row5. Then row4, row3, row2, row1, row0. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but with the last few rows moved to the top. For example, in example1, the last two rows (row8 and row9) are moved to the top, then the rows before that. But that doesn't explain the rest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but the rows are sorted based on the fourth column's value in descending order. But in example1, the fourth column is 9 for rows5-9, and 0 for rows0-4. So the output would have rows5-9 first, then rows0-4. But in the output, rows0-4 are row9, row8, row6, row7, row5. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm, this is challenging. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the output is the input rows, but with the rows that have a certain pattern moved to the top. For example, in example1, the rows that have 2 in the first column are moved to the top. Then the rows with 0 in the first column are moved next. But how?\n\nIn example1, the rows with 2 in the first column are row8 and row9. These are moved to the top. Then the rows with 0 in the first column are row6, row7, row5, row4, etc. But how are they ordered?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but the rows are grouped by the value in the first column, sorted in descending order. For example, in example1, rows with 2 in the first column are first, then rows with 0. But in the output, rows with 2 are first (row9 and row8), then rows with 0 (row6, row7, row5, row4, etc). But row6 and row7 have 0 in the first column, and row5 has 0. So that's possible.\n\nIn example2, the rows with 3 in the first column are row9. Then rows with 0, then 0 again, etc. So maybe the output is the input rows sorted by the first column in descending order. Let's check example1:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0-4: 0s in first column.\n\nRow5: 0\n\nRow6: 0\n\nRow7: 0\n\nRow8: 2\n\nRow9: 2\n\nSo sorted by first column descending, the order would be row9, row8, row6, row7, row5, row4, row3, row2, row1, row0. But the output for example1 is:\n\nrow0: row9\n\nrow1: row8\n\nrow2: row6\n\nrow3: row7\n\nrow4: row5\n\nrow5: row5 (original row5)\n\nrow6: row6 (original row6)\n\nrow7: row7 (original row7)\n\nrow8: row8 (original row8)\n\nrow9: row9 (original row9)\n\nSo that doesn't match. Because the output for example1 has rows0-4 as row9, row8, row6, row7, row5. Then rows5-9 are row5, row6, row7, row8, row9. Which is the same as the original order. So that's not matching the sorted order.\n\nHmm. Another thought: perhaps the output is the input rows, but with the last few rows moved to the top. For example, in example1, the last two rows (row8 and row9) are moved to the top, then the next two (row6 and row7), then row5, then the rest. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but with the rows that have a certain value in the third column moved to the top. For example, in example1, row6 and row7 have 3 in the third column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but with the rows that have 9 in the fourth column moved to the top, and then the rows that have 2 in the fourth column. But in example1, the fourth column is 9 for rows5-9, and 0 for others. So the output would have rows5-9 first, then others. But in the output, rows5-9 are row5, row6, row7, row8, row9. Which is the same as the original order. So that's not helpful.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. Let's look for other patterns. For example, in example1, the output rows 0-4 are row9, row8, row6, row7, row5. These are the rows with 9 in the fourth column, but ordered in reverse order (row9, row8, row6, row7, row5). Wait, row6 is before row7 in the input. But in the output, row6 comes before row7. So that's the same as the input order. So maybe the output is taking the rows with 9 in the fourth column, and then the rest of the rows in their original order. But how?\n\nIn example1, the rows with 9 in the fourth column are rows5,6,7,8,9. The output starts with row9, row8, row6, row7, row5. So that's in reverse order. Then the rest of the rows are in their original order. So the output is the rows with 9 in the fourth column in reverse order, followed by the rows without 9 in the fourth column in their original order.\n\nBut in example2, the fourth column is 2 for all rows. So that would not apply. But the output for example2 is:\n\nRow0: row9 (3 3 8 2)\n\nRow1: row8 (0 3 8 2)\n\nRow2: row7 (0 8 0 2)\n\nRow3: row5 (0 0 0 2)\n\nRow4: row6 (0 0 0 2)\n\nRow5: row5 (0 0 0 2)\n\nRow6: row6 (0 0 0 2)\n\nRow7: row7 (0 8 0 2)\n\nRow8: row8 (0 3 8 2)\n\nRow9: row9 (3 3 8 2)\n\nSo the output seems to be the rows ordered as row9, row8, row7, row5, row6, row5, row6, row7, row8, row9. That's not clear. But maybe the pattern is to take the rows that have a certain value in the fourth column and move them to the top. But in example2, the fourth column is 2 for all rows. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but the rows are grouped by the fourth column's value, and then ordered in a certain way. For example, in example1, the fourth column is 9 for some rows and 0 for others. The output has the rows with 9 in the fourth column first, in reverse order, then the others. In example2, the fourth column is 2 for all rows. So maybe the output is the input rows, but sorted in a certain way.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is the input rows, but with the rows that have the same value in the third column grouped together. For example, in example1, row6 and row7 have 3 in the third column, and are moved to the top. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows, but with the rows that have a certain value in the first column moved to the top. For example, in example1, rows with 2 in the first column are moved to the top. Then the rows with 0 in the first column are ordered in a certain way.\n\nIn example1, the output starts with row9 (first column 2), row8 (first column 2), then row6 (first column 0), row7 (first column 0), row5 (first column 0), etc. So maybe the output is the rows sorted by the first column in descending order, and within the same first column, sorted by the fourth column in descending order.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis. For example1:\n\nRows with first column 2 are row8 and row9. Their fourth column is 9 and 9. So they are ordered as row9, row8.\n\nRows with first column 0 are rows0-4, 5, 6,7, etc. But in the output, these are ordered as row6, row7, row5, row4, etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nIn example2, the first column for rows5-9 are 0, 0, 0, 0, 3. So the rows with first column 3 are row9, which is moved to the top. Then the rows with first column 0 are ordered as row7, row8, row5, row6, etc. But the output for example2 is:\n\nrow0: row9 (first column 3)\n\nrow1: row8 (first column 0)\n\nrow2: row7 (first column 0)\n\nrow3: row5 (first column 0)\n\nrow4: row6 (first column 0)\n\nrow5: row5 (first column 0)\n\nrow6: row6 (first column 0)\n\nrow7: row7 (first column 0)\n\nrow8: row8 (first column 0)\n\nrow9: row9 (first column 3)\n\nSo this seems to be sorted by first column in descending order. So rows with first column 3 come first, then rows with first column 0. Within the first column 0, the rows are ordered in a certain way. For example, row7 (0 8 0 2) comes before row8 (0 3 8 2), which has a higher value in the second column. But I'm not sure.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation is to sort the rows in descending order of the first column, and within the same first column, sort by other criteria. For example, in example1, the rows are sorted by first column descending, then by fourth column descending, then by third column, etc.\n\nBut how to implement this in code? The code would need to sort the rows based on certain criteria.\n\nBut how to determine the criteria based on the examples?\n\nLet me try to see what the sorting criteria could be.\n\nIn example1, the rows are sorted by first column descending. Within the same first column, perhaps the fourth column is sorted descending. For example, rows with first column 2 are row9 (fourth column 9) and row8 (fourth column 9). So they are ordered as row9, row8.\n\nFor rows with first column 0, the fourth column is 9 for rows5-9, but in the output, they are ordered as row6, row7, row5. Wait, row6 has third column 3, row7 has third column 3, row5 has third column 0. So perhaps within the same first column, the rows are sorted by the third column in descending order, then fourth column, then second column, etc.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. However, if this is the case, then the transformation would involve sorting the rows based on the first column, then third column, then fourth column, etc.\n\nBut how to verify this with the examples?\n\nIn example2, the rows with first column 0 are rows5-8, and row7. Let's look at their third column:\n\nRow5: third column is 0.\n\nRow6: third column is 0.\n\nRow7: third column is 8.\n\nRow8: third column is 3.\n\nRow9: third column is 3.\n\nIn the output for example2, the rows with first column 0 are ordered as row7 (third column 8), row8 (third column 3), row5 (third column 0), row6 (third column 0), then row5 again, row6 again, etc. So this seems to be sorted by third column descending, then fourth column, then second column.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nSo the transformation might be to sort the rows in descending order of the first column, then third column, then fourth column, and so on.\n\nIf this is the case, then the code would sort the rows based on these criteria.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nThe code would need to sort the rows in the grid based on the first column, then third column, then fourth column, etc.\n\nBut how to determine the exact sorting criteria based on the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are sorted in such a way that the first column is sorted in descending order, and within the same first column, the rows are sorted by the fourth column in descending order.\n\nLet me test this with example1:\n\nRows with first column 2: row8 and row9. Both have fourth column 9. So they are ordered as row9, row8.\n\nRows with first column 0: row5 has fourth column 9, row6 has third column 3, row7 has third column 3, row8 has first column 2. Wait, no. For rows with first column 0, the fourth column is 9 for row5, row6, row7, row8, row9? No. In example1, row5 has fourth column 9, row6 has fourth column 9, row7 has fourth column 9, row8 has fourth column 9, row9 has fourth column 9. So all rows with first column 0 have fourth column 9. So in this case, the order of these rows is not clear. But in the output, they are ordered as row6, row7, row5, row4, etc. So maybe the order is based on the third column.\n\nIn example1, row6 has third column 3, row7 has third column 3, row5 has third column 0. So they are ordered as row6, row7, row5. So within the same first column and fourth column, the third column is used.\n\nSo the sorting criteria could be:\n\n- First column descending.\n\n- Then third column descending.\n\n- Then fourth column descending.\n\n- Then second column descending.\n\n- And so on.\n\nIf that's the case, then the code would sort the rows in this order.\n\nLet's check example2.\n\nIn example2, the rows with first column 0 are rows5,6,7,8. Their third column is 0, 0, 8, 3. So sorted by third column descending, they would be row7 (third column 8), row8 (third column 3), row5 (third column 0), row6 (third column 0). So in the output, the first three rows with first column 0 are row7, row8, row5, row6. But in the output for example2, the first three rows are row7, row8, row5, row6. So that fits.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern.\n\nSo the transformation is to sort the rows in descending order of the first column, then third column, then fourth column, then second column, and so on.\n\nSo the code would need to sort the rows of the input grid based on this criteria.\n\nNow, how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe function transform(grid) would take the input grid, which is a list of lists. We need to sort the rows of the grid based on the criteria.\n\nThe key for sorting would be a tuple that represents the criteria. For example, for each row, the key would be (-row[0], -row[2], -row[3], -row[1], ...), but since the fourth column is the last one in the row, but the other columns may vary.\n\nBut what about the other columns? For example, in the case where the first column is the same, third column is the same, fourth column is the same, then the second column is used.\n\nBut how to determine the exact order. For example, in the test input, the rows are:\n\nRow5: 0 1 0 0\n\nRow6: 7 1 0 0\n\nRow7: 7 1 3 0\n\nRow8: 7 1 3 3\n\nRow9: 7 1 4 4\n\nSo the first column is 0,7,7,7,7.\n\nSo rows with first column 7 are rows6-9. These would be sorted by third column descending, then fourth column, then second column.\n\nRow6: third column 0, fourth 0, second 1.\n\nRow7: third 3, fourth 0, second 1.\n\nRow8: third 3, fourth 3, second 1.\n\nRow9: third 4, fourth 4, second 1.\n\nSo sorted by third column descending, then fourth, then second, the order would be row9 (third 4), row8 (third 3, fourth 3), row7 (third 3, fourth 0), row6 (third 0, fourth 0). So the rows6-9 would be ordered as row9, row8, row7, row6.\n\nBut in the test input, the output would be the rows sorted in this way.\n\nSo the code would sort the rows based on the first column descending, then third column descending, then fourth column descending, then second column descending.\n\nBut how to implement this in Python.\n\nThe key for sorting each row would be a tuple that starts with -row[0], then -row[2], then -row[3], then -row[1], etc. Because we want to sort in descending order.\n\nSo for each row, the key is (-row[0], -row[2], -row[3], -row[1]).\n\nBut what about other columns? For example, if the first column is the same, third column is the same, fourth column is the same, then the second column is used. So the key would be (-row[0], -row[2], -row[3], -row[1]).\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nsorted_grid = sorted(grid, key=lambda row: (-row[0], -row[2], -row[3], -row[1]))\n\nWait, but the fourth column is the last element in the row. So for the key, we have:\n\n- row[0] (first column)\n\n- row[2] (third column)\n\n- row[3] (fourth column)\n\n- row[1] (second column)\n\nSo the key is (-row[0], -row[2], -row[3], -row[1]).\n\nBut what if there are more columns? Well, the grid is 4 columns wide, so each row has four elements.\n\nSo the code would sort the rows based on this key.\n\nLet's test this with example1.\n\nExample1 input rows:\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 9 \u2192 row[0] = 0, row[2] = 0, row[3] = 9, row[1] = 0 \u2192 key (-0, -0, -9, -0) \u2192 (0, 0, -9, 0).\n\nRow6: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 key (-0, -3, -9, -0) \u2192 (0, -3, -9, 0).\n\nRow7: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 same as row6.\n\nRow8: 2 0 3 9 \u2192 key (-2, -3, -9, -0) \u2192 (-2, -3, -9, 0).\n\nRow9: 2 4 3 9 \u2192 key (-2, -3, -9, -4) \u2192 (-2, -3, -9, -4).\n\nSo when sorted, the rows with first column 2 would come first. For row9 and row8, their keys are (-2, -3, -9, -4) and (-2, -3, -9, 0). Comparing these, the second part is -3 vs -3, then -9 vs -9, then -4 vs 0. So row9's key is smaller than row8's key? Wait, no. Because when you sort in ascending order, the key with smaller values comes first. So for the rows with first column 2, the key for row9 is (-2, -3, -9, -4), and row8 is (-2, -3, -9, 0). Since -4 < 0, row9's key is smaller, so it comes first. So row9 comes before row8.\n\nThen, for rows with first column 0, their keys are (0, -row[2], -row[3], -row[1]).\n\nRow5: (0, -0, -9, -0) \u2192 (0, 0, -9, 0).\n\nRow6: (0, -3, -9, 0).\n\nRow7: (0, -3, -9, 0).\n\nRow4: (0, -0, -0, -0) \u2192 (0, 0, 0, 0).\n\nRow3: same as row4.\n\nRow2: same as row4.\n\nRow1: same as row4.\n\nRow0: same as row4.\n\nSo when sorted, the rows with first column 0 would be ordered by their key. For example, row6 and row7 have key (0, -3, -9, 0). But row5 has key (0, 0, -9, 0). So row5's key is (0, 0, -9, 0), which is larger than row6's key (0, -3, -9, 0). Wait, no. Because when comparing tuples, the first element is compared first. For row5's key, the second element is 0, while for row6's key, the second element is -3. Since -3 < 0, row6's key is smaller, so it comes before row5. So row6 comes before row7, which comes before row5.\n\nSo the sorted order for rows with first column 0 would be row6, row7, row5, row4, etc.\n\nWhich matches the output of example1. So this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nTesting this with example2:\n\nIn example2, the rows with first column 0 are rows5,6,7,8.\n\nRow5: [0, 0, 0, 2] \u2192 key (-0, -0, -2, -0) \u2192 (0, 0, -2, 0).\n\nRow6: [0, 0, 0, 2] \u2192 same as row5.\n\nRow7: [0, 8, 0, 2] \u2192 key (0, -0, -2, -8) \u2192 (0, 0, -2, -8).\n\nRow8: [0, 3, 8, 2] \u2192 key (0, -8, -2, -3) \u2192 (0, -8, -2, -3).\n\nSo when sorted, the keys are compared. For row7, the second element is 0, row8's second element is -8. So row7's key is (0, 0, -2, -8), and row8's key is (0, -8, -2, -3). Since the first element is 0 for both, the second element is 0 vs -8. Since -8 is less than 0, row8's key is smaller, so it comes before row7. Wait, but this would place row8 before row7, but in the output for example2, row7 comes before row8. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nWait, in example2's output, row0 is row9 (3 3 8 2), row1 is row8 (0 3 8 2), row2 is row7 (0 8 0 2), row3 is row5 (0 0 0 2), row4 is row6 (0 0 0 2), etc.\n\nSo row7 (0 8 0 2) comes before row8 (0 3 8 2) in the output. But according to the key, row7's key is (0, 0, -2, -8), and row8's key is (0, -8, -2, -3). Comparing these two keys:\n\nThe first element is 0 for both. The second element for row7 is 0, for row8 is -8. Since -8 < 0, row8's key is smaller. So row8 should come before row7 in the sorted list. But in the output, row7 comes before row8. This contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So what's wrong here?\n\nIn example2, row7 is [0, 8, 0, 2], and row8 is [0, 3, 8, 2].\n\nThe key for row7 is (-0, -row[2], -row[3], -row[1]) \u2192 (0, -0, -2, -8) \u2192 (0, 0, -2, -8).\n\nFor row8, it's (0, -8, -2, -3).\n\nComparing these two keys, the first element is 0 for both. The second element is 0 for row7 and -8 for row8. Since -8 < 0, row8's key is smaller. So in the sorted list, row8 would come before row7. But in the output, row7 comes before row8. This suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nSo what's the correct sorting criteria?\n\nMaybe the key is not based on the third column, but on the second column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the sorting is based on the first column descending, then the second column descending, then third column descending, then fourth column descending.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFor row7: [0, 8, 0, 2]. Key would be (-0, -8, -0, -2) \u2192 (0, -8, 0, -2).\n\nFor row8: [0, 3, 8, 2]. Key would be (-0, -3, -8, -2) \u2192 (0, -3, -8, -2).\n\nComparing these two keys: first element is 0 for both. Second element is -8 vs -3. Since -8 < -3, row7's key is smaller, so it comes before row8. Which matches the output.\n\nSo in this case, the sorting criteria would be first column descending, then second column descending, then third column descending, then fourth column descending.\n\nSo the key is (-row[0], -row[1], -row[2], -row[3]).\n\nLet's test this with example1.\n\nFor example1, row9 is [2,4,3,9], key is (-2, -4, -3, -9).\n\nRow8 is [2,0,3,9], key is (-2, -0, -3, -9).\n\nComparing these two keys: first element is -2 for both. Second element: -4 < -0 \u2192 row9's key is smaller, so row9 comes before row8. Which matches the output.\n\nFor row6: [0,0,3,9], key is (0, 0, -3, -9).\n\nRow7: [0,0,3,9], key is (0, 0, -3, -9). Same as row6. So they are ordered as they appear in the input.\n\nRow5: [0,0,0,9], key is (0, 0, 0, -9).\n\nSo when sorted, rows with first column 0 would be sorted by second column descending, then third column, then fourth.\n\nFor row5: second column is 0.\n\nRow6: second column is 0.\n\nRow7: second column is 0.\n\nRow4: second column is 0.\n\nSo for these rows, the key would be (0, -0, -row[2], -row[3]).\n\nSo for row6: third column is 3, fourth is 9.\n\nRow7: third column is 3, fourth is 9.\n\nRow5: third column is 0, fourth is 9.\n\nSo when sorted by third column descending, row6 and row7 come before row5.\n\nSo the order would be row6, row7, row5, then other rows.\n\nWhich matches the output of example1.\n\nIn example2, row7 has key (0, -8, -0, -2), row8 has key (0, -3, -8, -2). Comparing these keys:\n\nThe first element is 0 for both. Second element: -8 < -3 \u2192 row7's key is smaller, so it comes before row8. Which matches the output.\n\nSo this suggests that the correct sorting criteria is to sort the rows by first column descending, then second column descending, then third column descending, then fourth column descending.\n\nThus, the key for sorting is (-row[0], -row[1], -row[2], -row[3]).\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Sort the grid rows based on the criteria\n    sorted_grid = sorted(grid, key=lambda row: (-row[0], -row[1], -row[2], -row[3]))\n    return sorted_grid\n\nBut wait, the output must be a 10x4 grid. The input is 10 rows, so the sorted grid should also have 10 rows. This should be handled by the sorted function.\n\nLet's test this with example1:\n\nThe input has 10 rows. After sorting, the output should be 10 rows, which matches the example1 output.\n\nFor example2, the input has 10 rows. After sorting, the output should be 10 rows, which matches the example2 output.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nNow, let's test this with the test input.\n\nTest input rows:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0 0\n\nRow1: 0 0 0 0\n\nRow2: 0 0 0 0\n\nRow3: 0 0 0 0\n\nRow4: 0 0 0 0\n\nRow5: 0 1 0 0\n\nRow6: 7 1 0 0\n\nRow7: 7 1 3 0\n\nRow8: 7 1 3 3\n\nRow9: 7 1 4 4\n\nAfter sorting, the rows are sorted by first column descending, then second column, then third, then fourth.\n\nRows with first column 7 are rows6-9.\n\nFor these rows:\n\nRow6: [7,1,0,0] \u2192 key (-7, -1, -0, -0) = (-7, -1, 0, 0).\n\nRow7: [7,1,3,0] \u2192 key (-7, -1, -3, 0).\n\nRow8: [7,1,3,3] \u2192 key (-7, -1, -3, -3).\n\nRow9: [7,1,4,4] \u2192 key (-7, -1, -4, -4).\n\nComparing these keys:\n\nFor rows6-9, the first element is -7 for all. The second element is -1 for all. The third element is 0 (row6), -3 (row7), -3 (row8), -4 (row9). So comparing the third element:\n\nrow9's third element is -4, which is smaller than row7 and row8's -3. So row9 comes before row7 and row8.\n\nThen, row7 and row8 have third elements -3. For row7, the fourth element is 0; for row8, it's -3. So row8's fourth element is -3, which is smaller than 0. So row8 comes before row7.\n\nSo the order for rows6-9 is row9, row8, row7, row6.\n\nThen the rows with first column 0 are rows0-4, row5.\n\nThese rows have first column 0, so their keys are (0, -row[1], -row[2], -row[3]).\n\nFor row5: [0,1,0,0] \u2192 key (0, -1, 0, 0).\n\nFor row0-4: [0,0,0,0] \u2192 key (0, 0, 0, 0).\n\nSo row0-4 have keys (0, 0, 0, 0), which is smaller than row5's key (0, -1, 0, 0). Wait, no. Because for row5, the second element is -1, which is less than 0. So row5's key is (0, -1, 0, 0), which is smaller than row0's key (0, 0, 0, 0). So row5 comes before row0-4.\n\nBut this would mean that in the sorted grid, the rows with first column 0 are ordered as row5, then row0-4.\n\nBut this would be the case.\n\nBut in the test input, what would the output be?\n\nThe output would be:\n\nrow0: row9 (7 1 4 4)\n\nrow1: row8 (7 1 3 3)\n\nrow2: row7 (7 1 3 0)\n\nrow3: row6 (7 1 0 0)\n\nrow4: row5 (0 1 0 0)\n\nrow5: row0 (0 0 0 0)\n\nrow6: row1 (0 0 0 0)\n\nrow7: row2 (0 0 0 0)\n\nrow8: row3 (0 0 0 0)\n\nrow9: row4 (0 0 0 0)\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. The actual output would depend on the sorting.\n\nBut the code would sort the rows according to the key.\n\nSo the code seems to be correct.\n\nTherefore, the transformation is to sort the rows of the input grid in descending order of the first column, then second column, then third column, then fourth column.\n\nThus, the Python function would be as described.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a bunch of zeros except for some rows with 9, 3, 2, etc. The output seems to have the same numbers but arranged in a different order. Let me compare the input and output rows.\n\nOriginal input for Example 1:\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nOutput starts with row 0: 2 4 3 9, then row 1: 2 0 3 9, then row 2: 0 0 3 9, row 3: 0 0 3 9, then rows 4-5: 0 0 0 9, etc. Wait, the output seems to reverse the order of some rows. Let me check the input and output rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 10 rows. The output also has 10 rows. Let's look at the input rows from the bottom up. The input rows 5-9 are:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nThe output starts with row 0: 2 4 3 9 (which is row 9 of input), then row 1: 2 0 3 9 (row 8), then row 2: 0 0 3 9 (row 6?), then row 3: 0 0 3 9 (row 7?), then rows 4-5: 0 0 0 9 (row 5?), and then rows 6-9: 0 0 0 9, 0 0 3 9, 0 0 3 9, 2 0 3 9, 2 4 3 9. Wait, maybe the output is taking the rows from the input and reversing their order? But the output's first few rows are the input's last few rows. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input rows 5-9 (assuming rows are 0-indexed? Or maybe 1-indexed? Let me check the example again. The input for example 1 has 10 rows. The input is given as:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n2 0 3 9\n2 4 3 9\n\nSo rows 0-9 (assuming 0-based). The output is:\n\n2 4 3 9\n2 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n2 0 3 9\n2 4 3 9\n\nLooking at the output, the first row is the last row of input (row 9). Then the second row is row 8. Then row 2 is row 6? Wait, the third row in output is 0 0 3 9, which is row 6 of input. Then row 3 is row 7. Then row 4 is row 5. Then row 5 is row 5 again? Wait, maybe the output is taking the rows from the input, but in reverse order, but not all. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input rows 5-9 (rows 5 to 9):\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nThe output starts with row 9, then 8, then 6, then 7, then 5, then 5 again? Wait, the output rows 0-4 are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9 (row 9)\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9 (row 8)\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9 (row 6)\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9 (row 7)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 (row 5)\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9 (row 5 again?)\nThen rows 6-9 of output are:\n\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9 (row 6?)\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9 (row 7)\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9 (row 8)\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9 (row 9)\n\nHmm, this seems a bit confusing. Maybe the output is taking the rows from the input, but reversing the order of some parts. Alternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows from the input, but in reverse order, but with some rows being duplicated or shifted. Alternatively, maybe the output is the input reversed, but with some rows moved.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first five rows of the output are the last five rows of the input, but in reverse order? Wait:\n\nOriginal input rows 5-9 are rows 5,6,7,8,9. The output rows 0-4 are 9,8,6,7,5. That's not a straightforward reverse. Alternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows from the input, but in reverse order, but with some rows being moved. For example, rows 5-9 in input are:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nThe output's first five rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9 (row 9)\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9 (row 8)\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9 (row 6)\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9 (row 7)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 (row 5)\n\nSo the order is 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. That's not a simple reverse. But maybe the rows are being reversed in some way. For example, rows 5-9 are being reversed, but with some rows moved. Alternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows from the input, but starting from row 9, then 8, then 6, then 7, then 5, then 5 again. That's a bit confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows from the input, but for rows that have a certain value, they are moved to the top. For example, in example 1, the output starts with the rows that have 2 4 3 9, which is the last row of input. Then the next rows are the ones that have 2 0 3 9 (row 8), then 0 0 3 9 (row 6), then 0 0 3 9 (row 7), then 0 0 0 9 (row 5). Then the next rows are the same as before. Maybe the rows are being reordered based on some criteria, like the presence of certain numbers.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2\nRow 6: 0 0 0 2\nRow 7: 0 8 0 2\nRow 8: 0 3 8 2\nRow 9: 3 3 8 2\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 8 2 (row 9)\nRow 1: 0 3 8 2 (row 8)\nRow 2: 0 8 0 2 (row 7)\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 (row 6)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 (row 5)\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2 (row 5)\nRow 6: 0 0 0 2 (row 5)\nRow 7: 0 8 0 2 (row 7)\nRow 8: 0 3 8 2 (row 8)\nRow 9: 3 3 8 2 (row 9)\n\nSo the output starts with row 9, then 8, then 7, then 6, then 5, then 5 again. Wait, the output rows 0-4 are 9,8,7,6,5. Then rows 5-9 are 5,5,5,7,8,9? Or maybe the output is taking the rows from the input, but in reverse order, but with some rows duplicated. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the rows from the input, but in reverse order, but for the rows that have certain values, they are moved to the top. For example, in example 1, the output starts with the rows that have the highest numbers, then the rest. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1 and 2, perhaps the output is the input reversed, but with some rows duplicated. For example, in example 1, the input has rows 5-9. The output starts with row 9, then 8, then 6, then 7, then 5. Then the next rows are 5 again, then 6, 7, 8, 9. That's not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but with the rows that have a 9 in the last column moved to the top. But in example 1, the input rows 5-9 have 9 in the last column. The output starts with the rows that have 9 in the last column. But in example 1, the output's first row is row 9 (which has 9 in the last column), then row 8 (same), then row 6, 7, 5. But row 5 has 9 in the last column. So maybe the output is taking the rows that have 9 in the last column, and arranging them in some order. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows from the input, but in reverse order, but with some rows being moved. For example, in example 1, the output rows 0-4 are the input rows 9,8,6,7,5. Then rows 5-9 are 5,6,7,8,9. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the output is taking the rows from the input, but reversing the order of the rows that have certain values. For example, rows with 2 in the first column are moved to the top. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input reversed, but with some rows duplicated. For example, in example 1, the input has 10 rows. The output is also 10 rows. Let me check the input and output for example 1. The input rows 0-4 are all zeros, and rows 5-9 have varying numbers. The output for example 1 has rows 0-4 as the input's rows 9,8,6,7,5. Then rows 5-9 are 5,6,7,8,9. So the output is taking the input's rows 5-9, but in a certain order, then the rest. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but with the rows that have a 9 in the last column moved to the top, and the rest arranged in reverse. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows, but the rows are reversed in some way. For example, in example 1, the input rows 5-9 are:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nThe output rows 0-4 are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9 (row 9)\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9 (row 8)\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9 (row 6)\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9 (row 7)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 (row 5)\n\nSo the order is row 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. Then the output rows 5-9 are:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9 (row 5)\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9 (row 6)\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9 (row 7)\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9 (row 8)\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9 (row 9)\n\nSo rows 5-9 in output are the same as rows 5-9 in input, but in the same order. Wait, no. Because in the input, row 5 is 0 0 0 9, which is row 4 in output. So maybe the output is taking the rows from the input, but for the rows that have 9 in the last column, they are moved to the top, and the rest are arranged in reverse order. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 9 in the last column, and then the rest of the rows in reverse order. But in example 1, the rows with 9 in the last column are rows 5,6,7,8,9. The output starts with row 9, then 8, then 6, then 7, then 5. Then the rest of the rows are the same as the input's rows 0-4 (all zeros), but in the output, they are rows 5-9? No, the output for example 1 has rows 0-4 as the rows 9,8,6,7,5. Then rows 5-9 are 5,6,7,8,9. So that's the same as the input rows 5-9, but in reverse order? Wait, no. The input rows 5-9 are 5,6,7,8,9. The output rows 5-9 are 5,6,7,8,9. So that's the same as the input. But that can't be right. Because the output rows 0-4 are 9,8,6,7,5, which is the input rows 9,8,6,7,5. So maybe the output is taking the rows that have 9 in the last column, but in a certain order, and then the rest of the rows in reverse order. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput rows 5-9:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2\nRow 6: 0 0 0 2\nRow 7: 0 8 0 2\nRow 8: 0 3 8 2\nRow 9: 3 3 8 2\n\nOutput rows 0-4:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 8 2 (row 9)\nRow 1: 0 3 8 2 (row 8)\nRow 2: 0 8 0 2 (row 7)\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 (row 6)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 (row 5)\n\nThen rows 5-9 of output are:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2 (row 5)\nRow 6: 0 0 0 2 (row 5)\nRow 7: 0 8 0 2 (row 7)\nRow 8: 0 3 8 2 (row 8)\nRow 9: 3 3 8 2 (row 9)\n\nSo the output rows 0-4 are the input rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then rows 5-9 are 5,5,7,8,9. So the output is taking the input rows 5-9 in reverse order (9,8,7,6,5) for the first five rows, then for the remaining rows, it's 5,5,7,8,9. Hmm, that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input reversed, but with some rows duplicated. For example, in example 1, the input has 10 rows. The output is the same as the input, but the rows 5-9 are reversed and then duplicated. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for example 1, the first five rows of the output are the input's rows 9,8,6,7,5. Then the next five rows are 5,6,7,8,9. So maybe the output is taking the rows that have 9 in the last column, and then the rest of the rows in reverse order. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have a non-zero value in the first column, and arranging them in a certain way. For example, in example 1, the rows with non-zero first column are rows 5-9. The output starts with those rows, but in a certain order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input reversed, but with the rows that have certain values moved to the top. For example, in example 1, the output is the input reversed, but with the rows that have 2 in the first column moved to the top. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input rows 5-9 are:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nReversed order would be row 9, 8, 7, 6, 5. But the output starts with row 9, then 8, then 6, then 7, then 5. So that's not the reversed order. But if we reverse the order of rows 5-9, we get row 9, 8, 7, 6, 5. But the output has row 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. So that's not the same. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the rows from the input, but the rows that have a certain value in the first column are moved to the top. For example, in example 1, the rows that have 2 in the first column are rows 8 and 9. These are moved to the top. Then the rows with 0 in the first column are arranged in some order. But in the output, the rows with 2 in the first column are rows 0 and 1 (row 9 and 8). Then the next rows are rows 6 and 7 (which have 0 in the first column). Then row 5 (which has 0 in first column). Then rows 5 again, then 6, 7, 8, 9. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think about the transformation as a reversal of the rows, but with some rows moved. Alternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but the rows are reversed, and then some rows are duplicated. \n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for example 1, the first five rows are the rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. Then the next five rows are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first five rows are the input rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, which is rows 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5. Then the next five rows are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So maybe the output is taking the input rows, but for the rows that have 9 in the last column, they are arranged in a certain order, and then the rest are arranged in reverse order. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have a 9 in the last column, and then the rest of the rows in reverse order. But in example 1, the rows with 9 in the last column are rows 5-9. The output starts with these rows, but in a certain order. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but with the rows that have a 9 in the last column moved to the top, and then the rest of the rows are in reverse order. For example, in example 1, the rows with 9 in the last column are rows 5-9. The output starts with these rows, but in reverse order. But in example 1, the output's first five rows are 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. Which is not the reverse order. Because the reverse of rows 5-9 would be 9, 8, 7, 6, 5. But the output has 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. So it's not exactly that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 9 in the last column, and then the rest of the rows are arranged in reverse order. But how?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a reversal of the rows, but with some rows duplicated. For example, in example 1, the output's first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. Then the next five rows are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. Then the next five rows are the same as the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values in the first column, and arranging them in reverse order, then the rest of the rows. For example, in example 1, the rows with non-zero first column are rows 8, 9, 6, 7. Wait, no, row 6 has 0 in the first column. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. Then the next five rows are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, and then the next five rows are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. The next five rows are the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So it's like the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, and the next five rows are the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first part is taking some rows and then the next part is the same rows in reverse order.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. Maybe the transformation is to reverse the order of the rows, but with some rows moved. For example, in example 1, the input has rows 5-9. The output's first five rows are 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. Then the next five rows are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, and then the next five rows are the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This seems like the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, which is the input's rows 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5. Then the next five rows are the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. Then the next five rows are the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, and the second part is the same as the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. \n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe there's a pattern that the output is the input reversed, but with some rows duplicated. For example, in example 1, the input is reversed, but the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and then the next five rows are the same as the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but the rows are reversed, and then for some rows, they are duplicated. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for example 1, the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. Then the next five rows are the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, and the second part is the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5. The second part is the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. Which is the same as the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. Then the second part is the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This seems like the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, and then the second part is the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. \n\nBut how to find a pattern for this. Maybe the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, which is the rows from the input's rows 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5. This seems like the rows are being taken in reverse order, but skipping some rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input reversed, but with some rows duplicated. For example, in example 1, the input has 10 rows. The output is also 10 rows. The first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. Then the next five rows are the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, and the next five rows are the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This suggests that the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, and the second part is the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, which is the rows 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5. Then the second part is the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. \n\nThis seems like the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5, and the second part is the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. This could be the input's rows 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5. \n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe the output is the input reversed, but with the rows that have certain values moved to the top. For example, in example 1, the rows with 2 in the first column are moved to the top. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 9 in the last column, and then the rest of the rows in reverse order. But how?\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the test input. The test input is:\n\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n7 1 0 0\n7 1 3 0\n7 1 3 3\n7 1 4 4\n\nThe output should be a 10x4 grid. So the test input has 10 rows. The output is also 10 rows. The transformation needs to be applied to this input.\n\nLooking at the test input, the first five rows are all zeros. Rows 5-9 have varying values. The output for this test input would be transformed based on the same pattern as the examples.\n\nIf the pattern is that the rows with non-zero values are moved to the top, then the test input's rows 5-9 would be moved to the top, and the rest of the rows would be arranged in reverse order. For example, in example 1, the rows with non-zero values are rows 5-9. The output starts with these rows, but in a certain order.\n\nBut how to determine the order. In example 1, the output starts with row 9, then 8, then 6, then 7, then 5. So the order is row 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5. This seems like the rows with 2 in the first column are moved to the top. In example 1, rows 8 and 9 have 2 in the first column. So those are moved to the top. Then the other rows with 0 in the first column are arranged in some order.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is to take all the rows that have a non-zero value in the first column, and arrange them in reverse order, then take the rest of the rows (which have zero in the first column) and arrange them in reverse order.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with example 1. \n\nIn example 1, the rows with non-zero first column are rows 8, 9, 6, 7. Wait, row 6 has 0 in the first column. So maybe not. Let me check:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9 \u2192 first column is 0.\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 first column is 0.\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 first column is 0.\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9 \u2192 first column is 2.\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9 \u2192 first column is 2.\n\nSo rows with non-zero first column are 8 and 9. So according to this hypothesis, these rows would be moved to the top in reverse order. So row 9, then 8. Then the other rows (rows 5,6,7) would be arranged in reverse order. So rows 7, 6, 5. But in the output, the first five rows are 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. So this doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are sorted based on the value in the first column, but in descending order. For example, in example 1, the rows with non-zero first column are 8 and 9, which have 2. Then the rows with 0 in first column are 5,6,7. So the output would be rows 9, 8, then 7, 6, 5. But the output for example 1 has rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are sorted based on the value in the first column, but in descending order, and for rows with the same value, sorted by the value in the second column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input reversed, but with some rows duplicated. For example, in example 1, the input is reversed, and then the first part is taken as the reversed rows, and then the next part is the same as the reversed rows. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. Then the next five rows are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. The second part is the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This suggests that the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5. The second part is the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, and the second part is the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. \n\nThis seems like the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5. Then the second part is the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. This could be the input's rows 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5. So the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5. This seems like the rows are being taken in reverse order, but skipping some rows.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe the first part is the input's rows from the bottom up, but skipping some rows. For example, in example 1, the first part is rows 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5. This could be rows 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5. So it's like taking the input's rows 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5. This seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input reversed, but with the rows that have 9 in the last column moved to the top. For example, in example 1, the rows with 9 in the last column are rows 5-9. The output starts with these rows, but in reverse order. But in the output, the first five rows are 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. Which is not the reverse of 5-9. \n\nThis is very challenging. Maybe I should think of the output as the input reversed, but with some rows duplicated. For example, in example 1, the input has 10 rows. The output is the input reversed, but with the first five rows being the input's rows 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and then the next five rows being 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and the next five rows are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. This would mean that the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 (reversed order of rows 5-9), and then the next five rows are the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. \n\nBut in the output of example 1, the first five rows are 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. So this doesn't match. \n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is the input reversed, but with some rows duplicated. For example, in example 1, the output is the input reversed, but with the first five rows being the input's rows 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and then the next five rows are the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. But this is not what the output shows.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. But given the examples, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the order of the rows, and then duplicate the first part of the reversed rows. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows, but the rows are reversed, and then the first part is taken as the first five rows of the reversed input, and the rest are the same as the reversed input. \n\nBut this is just a guess. Given that the test input has 10 rows, and the output must be 10 rows, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the input rows and then take the first five rows as the reversed input, and the next five rows as the same as the reversed input. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAnother idea: looking at example 2, the input rows 5-9 are:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2\nRow 6: 0 0 0 2\nRow 7: 0 8 0 2\nRow 8: 0 3 8 2\nRow 9: 3 3 8 2\n\nThe output rows 0-4 are 9, 8, 7, 6, 5. Then rows 5-9 are 5, 5, 7, 8, 9. So the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 (reversed order of rows 5-9), and the next part is 5, 5, 7, 8, 9. So this is not clear.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to reverse the input rows, and then for the first part, take the first five rows, and then for the second part, take the same rows again. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that works for both examples. \n\nIn example 1, the output is the input reversed, but with some rows duplicated. For example, the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. Then the next five rows are 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. This could be the input's rows 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5. \n\nIn example 2, the output is the input's rows 9, 8, 7, 6, 5 for the first five rows, then 5, 5, 7, 8, 9 for the next five rows. \n\nThis suggests that the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and the second part is 5, 5, 7, 8, 9. \n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, and the second part is the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. \n\nBut this would mean that the output is the input reversed, but with the first five rows being the reversed input's rows 5-9, and the next five rows being the input's rows 5-9. \n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to take the input, reverse the rows, then take the first five rows of the reversed input, and then take the next five rows as the reversed input again. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nLet's try to implement this for example 1:\n\nInput rows are 0-9. Reversed input would be rows 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. \n\nThe first five rows of reversed input are 9, 8, 7, 6, 5. Then the next five rows are 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. But the output for example 1 is 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, then 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So this doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the input reversed, but with the first five rows of the reversed input, and then the next five rows are the input's rows 5-9. \n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the transformation is to take the input rows, reverse them, and then take the first five rows of the reversed input, and then take the next five rows as the input's rows 5-9. \n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rows, but the rows are reversed, and then the first five rows are kept as is, and the next five rows are the same as the first five rows. \n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in both examples, the output starts with the rows that have 2 in the first column. In example 1, rows 8 and 9 have 2 in the first column. In example 2, row 9 has 3 in the first column, row 8 has 0, row 7 has 0, row 6 has 0, row 5 has 0. So the output for example 2 starts with row 9, which has 3 in the first column. \n\nSo perhaps the transformation is to take the rows with non-zero first column, sorted in descending order of the first column, and then the rows with zero in the first column, sorted in some way. \n\nFor example, in example 1, the rows with non-zero first column are 8 and 9. They are sorted in descending order of the first column (2, 2). So they are ordered as 9, 8. Then the rows with zero in the first column are 5, 6, 7. These are sorted in some way. In the output, these rows are 6, 7, 5. \n\nBut in the output, the rows with zero in the first column are 6, 7, 5. So this could be sorted in descending order of the second column. Let's see:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9 \u2192 second column is 0.\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 second column is 0.\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 second column is 0.\nSo they are all 0. So this doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows with zero in the first column are sorted in descending order of the third column. \n\nRow 5: third column is 0.\nRow 6: third column is 3.\nRow 7: third column is 3.\nSo sorted in descending order would be 7, 6, 5. But in the output, the rows with zero in the first column are 6, 7, 5. So this doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the transformation is to reverse the input rows, but with some rows duplicated. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll try to implement a transformation that reverses the input rows, and then for the first five rows, it's the reversed input, and the next five rows are the same as the reversed input. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input reversed, and then the first five rows are taken as is, and the next five rows are the same as the first five rows. \n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input reversed, and then the first five rows are taken, and the next five rows are the same as the first five rows. \n\nFor example, in example 1, the input reversed is rows 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. The first five rows are 9, 8, 7, 6, 5. The next five rows are 4, 3, 2, 1, 0. But the output is 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So this doesn't match.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. The output for example 1 starts with the rows that have 2 in the first column, then the rows with 0 in the first column, but in a certain order. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to reverse the input rows, and then for each row in the output, if it's in the first five rows, it's the reversed input, and for the next five rows, it's the same as the reversed input. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write a function that reverses the input rows and then returns the reversed rows. Let's see if that works for the examples.\n\nFor example 1, the input has 10 rows. Reversing the input rows would give the rows in reverse order. The output of example 1 is not the reversed input. For example, the reversed input would have row 9 as first, then 8, then 7, then 6, then 5, then 4, etc. But the output of example 1 has rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, then 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. So this is not the reversed input. \n\nBut if I reverse the input rows and then take the first five rows, and then the next five rows as the same as the first five rows, that would give the output for example 1. \n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but the first five rows are the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, and the next five rows are the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. \n\nSo the transformation is to take the input rows, and for the first five rows, it's the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, and for the next five rows, it's the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. \n\nThis seems like the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, and the second part is the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nMaybe the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, 6, 7, 5, and the second part is the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. \n\nThis suggests that the first part is the input's rows 9, 8, then 6, 7, then 5. \n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to take the input rows, and for the first five rows, take the last five rows of the input in reverse order, and for the next five rows, take the first five rows of the input in reverse order. \n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed to implement a function that reverses the input rows and returns the reversed rows. This is a possible transformation, even if it doesn't match the examples perfectly. \n\nBut in example 1, the output is not the reversed input. So this is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but the rows are reversed, and then the first five rows are taken as is, and the next five rows are the same as the first five rows. \n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows, but the rows are reversed, and then the first five rows are taken as is, and the next five rows are the input's rows 5-9. \n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output for example 1 and 2. In both examples, the output starts with the rows that have 9 in the last column, in reverse order. For example, in example 1, the rows with 9 in the last column are rows 5-9. The output starts with row 9, 8, 6, 7, 5. This suggests that the rows are taken in reverse order, but with some rows skipped. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to take the rows that have 9 in the last column, and then the rest of the rows in reverse order. \n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the rows with 9 in the last column are rows 5-9. The output starts with these rows in reverse order, but with some rows skipped. \n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to write a function that reverses the input rows and returns the reversed rows. Even if it doesn't match the examples, it's a possible transformation. \n\nBut in example 1, the output is not the reversed input. So this is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the input rows, and for each row, if it has a non-zero value in the first column, it is moved to the top in reverse order. \n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write a function that reverses the input rows and returns them. \n\nBut this is not correct for the examples. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to take the input rows, and for each row, if it has a 9 in the last column, it is moved to the top in reverse order. \n\nBut this is also a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that takes the input rows and reverses them, and then returns the reversed rows. \n\nBut this is not correct for the examples, but it's the best I can do.\n"

So the output is the input rows reversed, then the first five rows are the input rows 9,8,7,6,5 (which is the reversed input rows 5-9), and the next five rows are the input rows 5-9. So the output is the input rows reversed, then the first five rows are the reversed input rows 5-9, and the next five rows are the input rows 5-9. But that's not making sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, but then the first five rows are the input rows 5-9. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, then the first five rows are the same as the input rows 5-9. So for example, the input rows 5-9 are 5,6,7,8,9. Then the output is 9,8,7,6,5, then 5,6,7,8,9. So the output is the input rows reversed (rows 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0), but then the first five rows are the input rows 9,8,7,6,5, and the next five rows are input rows 5,6,7,8,9. But how is that possible?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input rows reversed, then the first five rows are the same as the input rows 5-9. But that would mean that the output is:\n\nrows 0-4: input rows 9,8,7,6,5\n\nrows 5-9: input rows 5,6,7,8,9\n\nWhich is what I see in both examples. So the output is taking the input rows 9,8,7,6,5 (reversed input rows 5-9), then the input rows 5-9 again. So the output is the first five rows of the input reversed (rows 9,8,7,6,5), then the next five rows are the input rows 5-9. But that would mean that the output is the input rows reversed, then the first five rows are the reversed input rows 5-9, and then the next five rows are the input rows 5-9.\n\nBut how does that fit with the test input? Let me check the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n7 1 0 0\n7 1 3 0\n7 1 3 3\n7 1 4 4\n\nSo input rows 0-4 are all zeros. Then row 5 is [0,1,0,0], row 6 is [7,1,0,0], row 7 is [7,1,3,0], row 8 is [7,1,3,3], row 9 is [7,1,4,4].\n\nIf the output is the first five rows reversed (rows 9,8,7,6,5) and then the next five rows as input rows 5-9, then the output would be:\n\nrows 0-4: [7,1,4,4], [7,1,3,3], [7,1,3,0], [7,1,0,0], [0,1,0,0]\n\nrows 5-9: [0,1,0,0], [7,1,0,0], [7,1,3,0], [7,1,3,3], [7,1,4,4]\n\nBut the output must be 10 rows. So the output for the test input would be:\n\nrows 0-4: rows 9,8,7,6,5 of input\n\nrows 5-9: rows 5,6,7,8,9 of input\n\nBut that's what the pattern seems to be. So the transformation is to take the input rows, reverse the first 5 rows (rows 5-9?), then take the next five rows as the original rows 5-9.\n\nWait, but in example 1, the input has 10 rows. The output is the first five rows (rows 9,8,7,6,5) and then the next five rows (rows 5,6,7,8,9). So the output is the first five rows of the input (rows 5-9) reversed, then the next five rows are the original rows 5-9.\n\nSo the pattern is: the output is the input rows reversed for the first five rows (rows 5-9), then the next five rows are the original rows 5-9.\n\nBut how does that work? Let me think again.\n\nIn example 1, the input has 10 rows. The output is:\n\nrows 0-4: input rows 9,8,7,6,5 (reversed rows 5-9)\n\nrows 5-9: input rows 5,6,7,8,9 (original rows 5-9)\n\nSo the output is:\n\noutput_rows[0-4] = input_rows[9], input_rows[8], input_rows[7], input_rows[6], input_rows[5]\n\noutput_rows[5-9] = input_rows[5], input_rows[6], input_rows[7], input_rows[8], input_rows[9]\n\nSo the output is the first five rows of the input (rows 5-9) reversed, then the next five rows are the original rows 5-9.\n\nBut how to implement that?\n\nThe input has 10 rows. The output is 10 rows. The first five rows of the output are the input rows 9,8,7,6,5. The next five rows are the input rows 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo the output is:\n\noutput = [input[9], input[8], input[7], input[6], input[5]] + [input[5], input[6], input[7], input[8], input[9]]\n\nWait, but that would make the output for example 1 as:\n\nrows 0-4: input rows 9,8,7,6,5\n\nrows 5-9: input rows 5,6,7,8,9\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nSimilarly for example 2, the output is:\n\nrows 0-4: input rows 9,8,7,6,5\n\nrows 5-9: input rows 5,6,7,8,9\n\nSo the pattern is that the output is the input rows 9,8,7,6,5 followed by input rows 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo the transformation is to take the input rows 5-9, reverse them, then append them again in original order.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nTake the input grid, which is 10 rows. The output is:\n\noutput_rows = [input_rows[9], input_rows[8], input_rows[7], input_rows[6], input_rows[5]] + [input_rows[5], input_rows[6], input_rows[7], input_rows[8], input_rows[9]]\n\nBut wait, the input rows are 0-9. So rows 5-9 are the 6th to 10th rows (assuming 0-based). So the first five rows of the output are the input rows 9,8,7,6,5 (rows 9,8,7,6,5), then the next five rows are input rows 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo in code, for a grid with 10 rows, the output is:\n\noutput = []\nfor i in range(5):\n    output.append(grid[9 - i])\nfor i in range(5):\n    output.append(grid[5 + i])\n\nWait, but the first part is for i in 0-4: grid[9 - i] is grid[9], grid[8], grid[7], grid[6], grid[5]. Then for the next part, i ranges from 0-4: grid[5 + i] is grid[5], grid[6], grid[7], grid[8], grid[9].\n\nYes. So the output is the first five rows being the input rows 9,8,7,6,5, then the next five rows being input rows 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern.\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the input rows 5-9 are:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\n\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\n\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\n\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\n\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nSo the first five rows of the output are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9 (row 9)\n\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9 (row 8)\n\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9 (row 7)\n\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9 (row 6)\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 (row 5)\n\nThen rows 5-9 are:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9 (row 5)\n\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9 (row 6)\n\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9 (row 7)\n\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9 (row 8)\n\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9 (row 9)\n\nWhich matches the example. So this seems to be the correct pattern.\n\nSo the code needs to take the input grid, and for the output, take the last five rows (rows 5-9) in reverse order, then the same rows again in original order.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take the input grid, which is 10 rows\n    # Output is 10 rows\n    # First five rows are grid[9], grid[8], grid[7], grid[6], grid[5]\n    # Next five rows are grid[5], grid[6], grid[7], grid[8], grid[9]\n    output = []\n    # First part: reverse the rows 5-9\n    for i in range(5):\n        output.append(grid[9 - i])\n    # Second part: original rows 5-9\n    for i in range(5):\n        output.append(grid[5 + i])\n    return output\n\nWait, but grid is a list of lists. So for example, grid is a list of 10 rows, each row is a list of 4 elements.\n\nSo this code would take the first five rows as the reversed rows 5-9, then the next five as the original rows 5-9.\n\nSo for the test input, the output would be:\n\nThe first five rows are the input rows 9,8,7,6,5.\n\nThe input rows 5-9 are:\n\nRow 5: [0, 1, 0, 0]\n\nRow 6: [7, 1, 0, 0]\n\nRow 7: [7, 1, 3, 0]\n\nRow 8: [7, 1, 3, 3]\n\nRow 9: [7, 1, 4, 4]\n\nSo the first five rows of output are:\n\n[7,1,4,4], [7,1,3,3], [7,1,3,0], [7,1,0,0], [0,1,0,0]\n\nThen the next five rows are:\n\n[0,1,0,0], [7,1,0,0], [7,1,3,0], [7,1,3,3], [7,1,4,4]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[\n[7,1,4,4],\n[7,1,3,3],\n[7,1,3,0],\n[7,1,0,0],\n[0,1,0,0],\n[0,1,0,0],\n[7,1,0,0],\n[7,1,3,0],\n[7,1,3,3],\n[7,1,4,4]\n]\n\nBut the test input's output is not given, but according to the pattern, this is the expected output.\n\nSo the code seems to be correct based on the examples.\n\nSo the code is to take the input grid's rows 5-9, reverse them, then append them again in original order.\n\nNow, I need to implement this in Python. The function should take a 2D list (grid) and return a new 2D list of 10 rows, each with 4 elements.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = []\n    # First part: reverse the rows 5-9\n    for i in range(5):\n        output.append(grid[9 - i])\n    # Second part: original rows 5-9\n    for i in range(5):\n        output.append(grid[5 + i])\n    return output\n\nWait, but grid is a list of 10 rows. So grid[5] is row 5, grid[9] is row 9.\n\nYes. So this code would generate the correct output.\n\nTesting this code with example 1:\n\nInput grid rows 5-9 are:\n\nrow 5: [0,0,0,9]\n\nrow 6: [0,0,3,9]\n\nrow 7: [0,0,3,9]\n\nrow 8: [2,0,3,9]\n\nrow 9: [2,4,3,9]\n\nThe first part of the output is:\n\nrow 9, row 8, row 7, row 6, row 5 \u2192 which is the rows in the example's output rows 0-4.\n\nThe second part is rows 5,6,7,8,9 \u2192 which are the rows in the example's output rows 5-9.\n\nYes, so this code would work for the examples.\n\nSo the code is as written.\n"
