          "Input grids and output grids are of fixed size 5x11.\n\n**Observations from training examples:**\n\n- Inputs contain exactly two nonzero colored points on one row, spaced apart.\n- In each output, the row containing the two input colors is filled with mostly those two colors plus a 5 in the middle.\n- For example 1:\n  - Input row 1: colors 1 at col0 and 2 at col10.\n  - Output row 1: from col0 to col4: 1, col5: 5, col6 to col10: 2.\n- For example 2:\n  - Input row 3: colors 3 at col0, 7 at col10.\n  - Output row 3: from col0-4: 3, col5: 5, col6-10: 7.\n- The row with the two colors is identified.\n- The two colors fill left and right sides respectively, with a 5 in the center column (col 5).\n- The rest of the rows remain zeros.\n\n**Test input:**\n\n- Three rows with colors: row1 has 4 and 8, row4 has 6 and 9.\n- Presumably, if transformed, rows 1 and 4 will get the fill pattern as above.\n\n**Goal:**\n\n- Write input generator returning the two training input grids and the test input grid.\n- Write output generator returning the two training output grids.\n- Write transform() that identifies the row(s) with two colors, fill the left 5 columns with left color, col5 with 5, right 5 columns with right color. Keep other rows zero.\n- Since training only shows one row with two colors, transform will handle the first such row found or all such rows to be safe.\n- Output grid size always 5x11.\n\n---\n\nInput Grid Generator:\n```python\ndef generate_input_grids():\n    #

Keep other rows zero.\n- Since training only shows one row with two colors, transform will handle the first such row found or all such rows to be safe.\n- Output grid size always 5x11.\n\n---\n\nInput Grid Generator:\n```python\ndef generate_input_grids():\n    #
