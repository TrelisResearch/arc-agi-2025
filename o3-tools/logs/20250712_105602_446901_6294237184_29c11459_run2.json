          "Analyzing the training examples:\n\n- Each input grid is 5x11.\n- In the inputs, two nonzero numbers appear in the same row, located at the two ends of that row.\n- The output replicates the row having the two non-zero numbers as follows:\n  - The leftmost color value is repeated across the first five columns.\n  - The rightmost color value is repeated across the last five columns.\n  - The middle (6th) column is filled with a new color \"5\" (gray).\n- The rest of the grid is unchanged.\n\n- This transformation is applied to the row where the two non-zero colors appear at the edges.\n- In the first training example, top row non-zero colors are 1 (col 0) and 2 (col 10) \u2192 output row becomes: [1,1,1,1,1,5,2,2,2,2,2]\n- In the second example, the row with edge colors is the 4th row with values 3 and 7 at ends, similarly transformed with 5 in the middle.\n- The rest lines remain zero.\n\n- So the pattern is:\n  - Detect the row where the two ends have non-zero color values.\n  - Fill that entire row with left repeated 5 times, middle column=5, right repeated 5 times.\n\n- The rest of the grid remains zeros.\n\nThis perfectly fits both training examples.\n\nFor the test input, there are two rows with edge non-zero colors (row 1: 4 and 8, row 4: 6 and 9). The training pattern implies that only one row is highlighted (either the first row with non-zero edges, or maybe more). Given the previous examples have only one row filled, our code will fill every such row found (since the instructions don't forbid that and test input has two such rows). Or we could only fill the first such row. But the problem says to capture the best understanding, so filling all matching rows seems reasonable.\n\nNote:\n- The output grid must always be 5x11.\n- We will create a new grid initialized with zeros and modify accordingly.\n\nLet's implement this logic now.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    # Initialize output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0]*cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    for r in range(rows):\n        left_color = grid[r][0]\n        right_color = grid[r][cols-1]\n        if left_color != 0 and right_color != 0:\n            # Fill first 5 columns with left_color\n            for c in range(5):\n                output[r][c] = left_color\n            # Middle column with 5\n            output[r][5] = 5\n            # Last 5 columns with right_color\n            for c in range(6, cols):\n                output[r][c] = right_color\n        else:\n            # keep line as zeros\n            pass\n    return output\n```"

Given the previous examples have only one row filled, our code will fill every such row found (since the instructions don't forbid that and test input has two such rows). Or we could only fill the first such row. But the problem says to capture the best understanding, so filling all matching rows seems reasonable.\n\nNote:\n- The output grid must always be 5x11.\n- We will create a new grid initialized with zeros and modify accordingly.\n\nLet's implement this logic now.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    # Initialize output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0]*cols for _ in range(rows)]\n    for r in range(rows):\n        left_color = grid[r][0]\n        right_color = grid[r][cols-1]\n        if left_color != 0 and right_color != 0:\n            # Fill first 5 columns with left_color\n            for c in range(5):\n                output[r][c] = left_color\n            # Middle column with 5\n            output[r][5] = 5\n            # Last 5 columns with right_color\n            for c in range(6, cols):\n                output[r][c] = right_color\n        else:\n            # keep line as zeros\n            pass\n    return output\n```"
