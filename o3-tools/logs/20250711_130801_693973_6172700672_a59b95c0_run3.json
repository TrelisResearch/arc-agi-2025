But requirement is always output 9x9.\n\nExample 3:\n- Input 3x3\n- Output is 12x12.\n- Output is input repeated 4x4 times.\n\nExample 4:\n- Input 3x3.\n- Output 6x6.\n- Output is input repeated 2x2.\n\nExample 5:\n- Input 3x3.\n- Output 9x9.\n- Output is input repeated 3x3.\n\nFrom the problem instruction:  \n- The output must always be 9x9 regardless of input.\n- For example1 and example5, the result is a 3x3 tiling of input (3 * 3 = 9).\n- For example2 and example4, outputs are 6x6 (2x tiling).\n- example3 output is 12x12 (4x tiling).\n\nBecause the requirement is **always produce 9x9**, the best general approach consistent with training example 1 & 5 is to tile the input 3x3 times in both directions.\n\nFor inputs giving outputs smaller than 9x9, those examples do not meet the requirement; so based on problem statement, we will always do the 3x3 tiling (which matches examples 1 and 5 exactly).\n\nIf input is 3x3, tiling 3x3 times creates a 9x9 output.\n\nTo implement:\n\n- expand input grid by tiling it 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically\n- input grid shape is always 3x3 (confirmed from examples)\n- output 9x9 with repetition of input values.\n\nWe do not see any rotation, reflection, or color change from examples. Just repetition.\n\nThis transformation is consistent and guaranteed output 9x9.\n\n---\n\nImplementation details:\n\n- Input is a list of lists grid: grid[row][col]\n- Create output grid by repeating each row 3 times horizontally and repeating rows 3 times vertically\n- The output is 9x9 list of lists.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Tile the 3x3 grid 3 times horizontally and vertically to produce a 9x9 grid\n    output = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Repeat each row 3 times horizontally\n        new_row = []\n        for _ in range(3):\n            new_row.extend(row)\n        # Do this for each row 3 times vertically\n        for _ in range(3):\n            output.append(new_row.copy())\n    return output\n```"

Outputs are larger grids, mostly 9x9 or 6x6 or 12x12 depending on the example, but the problem states the output **must always be 9x9**.\n3. The output grids always look like repeated tiling of the input grid.\n4. In examples 1, 3, and 5, the output is an exact repetition of the input 3x3 tiled 3x3 times, resulting in a 9x9 grid.\n5. In examples 2 and 4, the output grid is 6x6, with tiled repetition of input 3x3 twice in both directions, but since the required output size is always 9x9, and the best (?) generalization is to always tile input 3x3 grid 3x3 times (nine times total).\n6. The visual example reinforces it: for example 3, the structure is the 3x3 input repeated 4x3=12x12 times, but per problem instructions, we must produce 9x9 output.\n7. The problem says to produce a 9x9 output grid **always**.\n\nTherefore, the best hypothesis is:\n\n**Transformation Hypothesis:**\n\n- Repeat the 3x3 input grid in a tiled pattern to fill a 9x9 output grid.\n- The input should be repeated 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically.\n- That matches exactly examples 1, 3, and 5 and seems consistent with the problem general requirement.\n- For examples 2 and 4, they output smaller 6x6, but we still produce 9x9 (since problem demands that).\n\nThis is the simplest pattern consistent with all examples and problem constraints.\n\n**Implementation plan:**\n\n- Given input as a 2D list (3x3).\n- Create a 9x9 output grid by repeating input in blocks.\n- The output grid's element at (i,j) = input[i % 3][j % 3]\n\nThis satisfies the requirement and is consistent with examples, especially since the problem explicitly asks for 9x9 output always.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The input grid is 3x3\n    # Output grid is 9x9 formed by repeating input 3 times in both directions\n    size_in = 3\n    size_out = 9\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for i in range(size_out):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(size_out):\n            row.append(grid[i % size_in][j % size_in])\n        transformed_grid.append(row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```"

The output grids seem to be formed by repeating and interleaving the input 3x3 blocks multiple times.\n3. The output grids always maintain the same pattern as the input but repeated as a tiled pattern in both rows and columns.\n4. The size of the output grid seems to be a square tiled repetition of the input grid, typically 3x3 blocks of the input repeated, resulting in 9x9 output, or 2x2 or 3x4 copies in some cases.\n5. Where the output size is ambiguous in examples (like 12x12 or 6x6), we must produce a 9x9 output anyway.\n6. The simplest, consistent solution matching most examples is to tile the input 3x3 grid into a 9x9 grid by repeating it 3 times in both row and column directions.\n\nGiven the strict requirement for always a 9x9 output, the best hypothesis is:\n\n- The output grid is a 3x3 tiling of the input grid (each cell repeated in block form).\n\nTo match the given outputs exactly, the examples show repeating the input grid cells exactly (no changes or rotations), tiled to fill the output grid.\n\n**Thus the approach**:\n\n- Create a 9x9 grid by repeating the 3x3 input grid along rows and columns 3 times each.\n\nImplementation details:\n\n- Input: 3x3 grid (list of lists)\n- Output: 9x9 grid (list of lists), composed by repeating each input cell 3 times horizontally and vertically\n\nCheck examples:\n\n- Example 1 outputs a 9x9 grid consisting of the input tiled 3x3\n- Example 3 outputs a 12x12 grid repeated 4x4 times \u2014 but per instructions, output must be 9x9.\n- So in ambiguous or larger example cases, just tile 3x3 and crop or fit to 9x9.\n- For consistent solutions, tile 3x3 into 9x9 by repetition. That matches all 3x3 tiled outputs seen (Examples 1 and 5).\n\nFinal implementation: tile input 3x3 grid 3 times horizontally and 3 times vertically to get a 9x9 output.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # grid is 3x3\n    # produce a 9x9 grid by repeating the 3x3 grid 3 times in rows and columns\n    \n    transformed_grid = []\n    for i in range(3):  # repeat each row 3 times vertically\n        for _ in range(3):\n            row = []\n            for j in range(3):\n                # repeat each cell 3 times horizontally\n                row.extend([grid[i][j]] * 3)\n            transformed_grid.append(row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
