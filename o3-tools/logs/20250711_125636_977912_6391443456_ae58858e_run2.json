              "Observations:\n\n- The input grids contain some colored shapes with color 2 (red in images).\n- The output grids replace some of these red shapes with color 6 (magenta/purple in images), but keep other red areas as is.\n- From visual examples:\n  - Some connected regions of color 2 in the input become color 6 in the output.\n  - Smaller or isolated pixel groups of 2 remain unchanged.\n- The pattern appears to:\n  - Find connected components (shapes) formed by the color 2.\n  - If the component size (number of pixels) is larger than a certain threshold, change that entire component's color to 6.\n  - Otherwise, keep it as 2.\n- This is consistent across the examples.\n- Output size is always equal to input size.\n- All non-2 pixels remain unchanged.\n\nThreshold (heuristic from examples): Components that are larger than ~3 or 4 pixels become 6.\n\nSolution approach:\n\n- Use BFS/DFS or scipy.ndimage.label to find connected components of pixels with value 2.\n- For each connected component:\n  - If the component size > 3 pixels, replace all those pixels with 6.\n  - Else keep unchanged.\n- Leave all other pixels intact.\n- Return the transformed grid with same dimensions.\n\nThis fits well what is seen and is easy to implement.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = grid.shape\n    output = grid.copy()\n    \n    visited = np.zeros((h, w), dtype=bool)\n    \n    # Directions for 4-connectivity\n    directions = [(1,0), (-1,0), (0,1), (0,-1)]\n    \n    for r in range(h):\n        for c in range(w):\n            if grid[r, c] == 2 and not visited[r, c]:\n                # BFS to find connected component of 2's\n                queue = deque()\n                queue.append((r,c))\n                component = []\n                visited[r, c] = True\n                \n                while queue:\n                    rr, cc = queue.popleft()\n                    component.append((rr, cc))\n                    for dr, dc in directions:\n                        nr, nc = rr+dr, cc+dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < h and 0 <= nc < w:\n                            if grid[nr, nc] == 2 and not visited[nr, nc]:\n                                visited[nr, nc] = True\n                                queue.append((nr, nc))\n                \n                # If component size > 3, change color to 6\n                if len(component) > 3:\n                    for rr, cc in component:\n                        output[rr, cc] = 6\n                # else keep as 2 (no change)\n    \n    return output.tolist()\n```"
