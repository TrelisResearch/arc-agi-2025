          "From the textual and visual patterns given:\n\n- Left vertical bar: holds multiple colored cells, each a single-cell column of distinct colors.\n- Right shape: a gray shape connected to the left bar.\n- The output replicates the left bar's color values into the gray pixels of the shape.\n- Each gray pixel on the right shape is replaced by the color from the left bar that corresponds to its row index. That is, for each gray pixel at (r, c), pick the color at (r, 0) (left bar) and fill the gray pixel with that color.\n\nThis explains all examples:\n\n- Gray pixels become colored with the row-wise color from the left bar.\n- The left bar colors remain the same.\n- The black pixels (0) remain untouched.\n\n---\n\nImplementation details:\n\n- Create a copy of the input grid\n- For each cell:\n  - If cell value is gray color (4 in example; or a fixed value?), replace it by the left-bar color from the same row.\n  \nFrom visual info and examples, gray seems to be value 5.\n\nIn our text example:\n- Gray shape pixels = 5\n- Left bar pixels vary (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 7 in test input)\n- So, replace any cell == 5 by grid[row][0]\n\n---\n\nNote: We don't modify left bar or background (0). Only transform gray shape (5) into left bar color on the same row.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Input is a 10x10 grid of integers (0-9)\n    # Gray shape parts are value 5\n    # Left vertical bar is column 0\n    n = 10\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]  # deep copy\n    \n    for r in range(n):\n        left_color = grid[r][0]\n        for c in range(n):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = left_color\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

              "From the textual and visual patterns given:\n\n- Left vertical bar: holds multiple colored cells, each a single-cell column of distinct colors.\n- Right shape: a gray shape connected to the left bar.\n- The output replicates the left bar's color values into the gray pixels of the shape.\n- Each gray pixel on the right shape is replaced by the color from the left bar that corresponds to its row index. That is, for each gray pixel at (r, c), pick the color at (r, 0) (left bar) and fill the gray pixel with that color.\n\nThis explains all examples:\n\n- Gray pixels become colored with the row-wise color from the left bar.\n- The left bar colors remain the same.\n- The black pixels (0) remain untouched.\n\n---\n\nImplementation details:\n\n- Create a copy of the input grid\n- For each cell:\n  - If cell value is gray color (4 in example; or a fixed value?), replace it by the left-bar color from the same row.\n  \nFrom visual info and examples, gray seems to be value 5.\n\nIn our text example:\n- Gray shape pixels = 5\n- Left bar pixels vary (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 7 in test input)\n- So, replace any cell == 5 by grid[row][0]\n\n---\n\nNote: We don't modify left bar or background (0). Only transform gray shape (5) into left bar color on the same row.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Input is a 10x10 grid of integers (0-9)\n    # Gray shape parts are value 5\n    # Left vertical bar is column 0\n    n = 10\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]  # deep copy\n    \n    for r in range(n):\n        left_color = grid[r][0]\n        for c in range(n):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = left_color\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"
