      "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformation details**\n\nI need to infer the transformation by examining examples. For Input 1, the matrix shows a vertical column of 1s at specific positions. The output appears to change some of these 1s into 3s, except for a center value that remains the same. Notably, the 3 at (4,5) remains constant. For Input 2, there are two horizontal bars of 7 at the first and sixth rows. I'm piecing together these transformations!**Identifying transformation patterns**\n\nI see there's a single 2 at (4,4) in the center. In Output 2, the top bar remains 7s, while the bottom bar changes to 2s, matching the center's color. It looks like there are two identical bars, one remains the same, and the other changes to mirror the center cell. The bottom bar is closer to the single cell, making it the one that changes color. Similarly, for Input 1, the single 3 at (4,5) is near the right bar, which changes to 3.**Defining the recoloring rule**\n\nI've established a rule: identify two identical multi-cell shapes of the same color and one singleton cell with a different color. The shape closer to the singleton gets recolored to match the singleton's color, while the other remains unchanged. In the test Input, there's a 12x12 grid with two 2x2 squares of color 5 in opposite corners and a single 6 at (6,6). The bottom-right square is closer to (6,6), so it will be changed to color 6 in the final grid.**Implementing the shape detection**\n\nI need to create a general algorithm for detecting shapes of the same color that are repeated exactly twice, along with a singleton of a different color. The steps should include identifying non-zero colors while excluding the background color. I\u2019ll find connected components by looking at orthogonal neighbors, then gather color, size, and cell information for each. \n\nNext, I'll focus on singleton components, ensuring that the two components of the same color have identical shapes, maybe just translations of each other. Finally, the one closer to the singleton, based on Manhattan distance, will be identified.**Finalizing the recoloring process**\n\nNow, I need to recolor the cells in the identified component to match the singleton's color. I'll handle edge cases, like if sizes differ, by choosing two components with the same color and size. Next, I\u2019ll implement a function to compute the normalized shape by creating a sorted list of coordinates relative to the minimum row and column. I\u2019ll ensure I have the right imports for the pure function and handle cases where there may not be a singleton. \n\nLastly, I\u2019ll produce the code and make sure to use a deep copy of the grid to avoid modifications. Let's go ahead and write this up!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid transformations**\n\nI'm deducing a transformation based on training pairs. In Input1, there's a small grid with a green 3 at (4,5) and multiple 1s forming a vertical line in column 2 at rows 3 to 5. I\u2019m identifying coordinates, and it looks like the vertical line at column 7 also has a transformation. The 3 at (4,5) remains, but the 1s at (3,7), (4,7), and (5,7) change to 3s, while the left vertical remains unchanged with 1s. So the rule seems to be to identify the color appearing uniquely.**Establishing color transformation rules**\n\nI'm examining a rule: if there's a unique colored cell, I should replace the nearest vertical line of a different color with that unique color. The 3 at (4,5) is closer to the right line in column 7 than the left in column 2\u20142 columns away from the right and 3 from the left. Looking at Input2, there are horizontal bars of 7s in rows 1 and 6, and a single 2 at (4,4). In Output2, the bottom bar is replaced by 2s, indicating the unique color replaces the closer horizontal bar.**Defining color replacement logic**\n\nI'm figuring out how to determine which colored bars to replace. For instance, the bottom bar is closer than the top by 2 rows, so I replace that. In Input1, the 3 at (4,5) has a distance of 2 columns to the right line and 3 to the left, so I replace the nearer right vertical. The rule is to identify a unique colored cell, then find the nearest connected multi-cell object and recolor it to that unique color. I also need to consider cases with ties carefully.**Identifying color components for recoloring**\n\nI'm focusing on connected components of cells with the same non-zero color and considering only those with counts greater than one, excluding the unique color. For each component, I need to compute the minimum Manhattan distance between the unique cell and any cell within that component. In Input1, I notice the left and right verticals both have color 1. By calculating distances, the right component is closer to the unique 3 at (4,5), so I'll recolor that to 3. Moving on to Input2, I've noted the top and bottom bars.**Planning the transformation function**\n\nI\u2019m calculating distances for the unique color in Input1, which is 3. It\u2019s found only once, so it remains unique. The next step is to implement a function that detects connected components while ignoring the background color (0) and the unique color if it appears more than once. If there are ties in minimal distance for multiple components, I\u2019ll handle it by picking the smallest bounding box or the first encountered. I\u2019ll proceed with BFS for scanning unique colors and components, recoloring as needed, and returning the modified grid. Alright, let\u2019s write that code!",

      "reasoning": "**Evaluating column changes**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that in the input data, the value in row 3 at column 7 was 1, but it changed to 3 in the output. Similar changes occurred in rows 4 and 5. This suggests a rule about vertical symmetry and object identification. Looking at another example with horizontal bars, I see the first row and the sixth row started with 7. The lower bar changed to 2s, prompting me to think about how distance affects shape transformation depending on pixel color proximity.**Analyzing color conversion**\n\nI'm concluding that the closer column was converted to the color of the single pixel, which is 3. When looking at input2, there's a 2 at (4,4), with two horizontal bars spanning columns 2-6 in rows 1 and 6. The vertical distance to row 1 is 3, while to row 6 it's 2, making the lower bar closer, hence its color converting to 2. The algorithm involves identifying singleton colors, like the 3 in input1 and the 2 in input2. However, the output shows the whole lower bar changed to 2, creating multiple instances.**Defining connected components**\n\nTo improve the approach, I need to find all connected components of non-zero colors while excluding zeros. Among these, I\u2019ll look for shapes that appear multiple times. If I find two identical shapes of the same color, I should pick the one closer to the singleton color and change it accordingly. \n\nThe steps include parsing the grid, identifying the singleton color (the non-zero color that occurs once), and finding connected components with 4-neighbor adjacency. I want to record their properties and then identify groups with the same color and shape pattern, ensuring they occur at least twice.**Implementing distance-based selection**\n\nFor this task, the group size is set to 2. I need to compute the Manhattan distance from each component in the group to the singleton cell, defining the distance as the minimum Manhattan distance between any part of the component and the singleton. \n\nNext, I\u2019ll choose the component with the smallest distance to replace its cells with the singleton color. The new grid will be returned after testing with the provided training data. I have to handle edge cases, ensuring I don\u2019t modify the component containing the singleton if they overlap. I\u2019ll implement this by gathering counts and identifying the singleton color with certain conditions.**Refining component selection**\n\nWhen using BFS, I want to gather only adjacent cells of the same color. I'll save the component ID and compute a normalized shape signature by sorting the relative positions. This can be done using tuples based on minimum row and column values. \n\nThen, I\u2019ll group components by their color and shape signature, preferring groups with at least two components. I\u2019ll compute distances to the singleton position and identify the minimum distance across its cells. Finally, I will replace the chosen component's color, while keeping in mind the possibility that the shape group may already have the singleton color. I\u2019ll work to ensure the grid is returned correctly.",

      "reasoning": "**Considering output differences**\n\nI'm analyzing the change in output2, which occurs in row 13. I'll compare the relevant rows in input2 and output2. They listed 15 rows, but they seem to display 15 rows of length 12, meaning a height of 15 and a width of 12. I need to find specific differences \u2014 for instance, in row 6, the input shows a change in the seventh column, which was altered from 7 to 6. I should also check row 4 for any modifications.**Analyzing row differences**\n\nI\u2019m scanning for rows where the output doesn\u2019t match the input. In row 6, for example, the input has [0 7 7 6 6 6 6 7 7 7 0 0], while the output shows [0 7 7 6 6 6 6 6 7 7 0 0]. Here, the value in the seventh column changed from 7 to 6. I'll also check row 10 and row 12 for any further changes. \n\nTwo of the sequences differ significantly, especially in specific columns.**Examining changes in rows**\n\nLooking more closely, the original input for row 13 is \u201c[0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7],\u201d while the output shows \u201c[0 0 0 0 7 7 6 6 6 7 7 7].\u201d Here, the three 7s in the middle changed to 6s, specifically in columns 6 through 8. It seems like the operation may toggle color pixels between 6 and 7 to create a contiguous region. My hypothesis suggests that the smaller color fills gaps in the larger surrounding color to shape a more unified interior.**Investigating pixel changes**\n\nIt looks like they changed some 5s to 7s to make the inner 7 region more symmetrical or to eliminate holes. I want to take a closer look at training2. There\u2019s a large 7 ring surrounding a center of 6s, which seems to form a triangular shape. In the output, some inner 7s changed to 6s, potentially to create symmetry. \n\nIn row 6, I see that the 7 at column 7 changed to a 6 because it had 6 neighbors on certain sides. I need to check the neighbors around that pixel to confirm this.**Formulating color update rules**\n\nI\u2019m noticing some pixel changes and forming rules for updating colors based on neighbors. For a cell to change to a new color, it must have at least two orthogonal neighbors of a different color. The method involves replacing colors iteratively until stability is reached; I want to be cautious about not changing any background pixels.\n\nThis approach indicates that when multiple colors satisfy the neighbor condition, I should select the one with the highest count, and in the case of a tie, the smaller color ID is preferred. I\u2019ll write the code to implement this logic.",

The singleton at (6,6) is closer to the bottom-right block, so that block should change to 6. The output will reflect that change from 5 to 6. I\u2019ll focus on detecting shapes for 2x2 blocks and using BFS for component labeling. If we can't find a singleton or pair, I'll return the original input unchanged. Time to put everything in code and define the function!**Clarifying color selection**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to choose components from my grid. It might be better to select the component with size equal to one when there are multiple singletons. I\u2019ll build a shape signature as a tuple of sorted offsets based on the minimum row and column to keep the orientation. It\u2019s essential to group components by both color and shape to ensure accurate matches with duplicates. If I can\u2019t find the right pairs, I\u2019ll consider grouping by shape alone. Let\u2019s keep refining this logic!**Calculating distances**\n\nI need to compute the minimum Manhattan distance from the starting position to each component\u2019s cells. The closest component will be the one I choose to recolor. If there\u2019s a tie in distances, I\u2019ll go with the one with the lower index. I\u2019ll implement BFS for 4-neighbor adjacency, making sure to handle type conversions properly.

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing color components**\n\nI'm thinking about how to handle shapes composed mostly of one color with a few isolated colors. The idea is to replace those isolated colors with the surrounding color by finding the majority color in connected components. I realize I need to determine which color is the majority in cases like the shapes with central borders showing different colors. For instance, in one component, I see that 7 is more frequent than 5 or 9, so it seems to be the majority. It's crucial to check each component while excluding the background.**Computing color majority**\n\nI'm quickly thinking about the shape that looks like a ring, focusing on the pixel positions with 5 at the corners, which seem to form a 3x3 cross. It looks like 7 is likely the majority color here. My rule is to replace any color that's not the most frequent in a connected region with the most frequent color. In one example, there seems to be some confusion because the left block had both 4 and 7, but it looks like 7 is the majority. However, leaving the 4s unchanged seems incorrect if they're not actually the minority.**Inspecting input blocks**\n\nI'm inspecting the left block of Input1, looking closely at the rows. In row 1, I see [0, 4, 4, 4], in row 2, there's [0, 7, 7, 7], and row 3 has [0, 4, 4, 8]. I notice some confusion, particularly with the 8 in row 3. To clarify, I'm mapping the coordinates by indexing columns and rows. In the left block, columns 1-3 in rows 1 and 3 mostly contain 4s, while row 2 has 7s. After counting, it seems the majority in the left block is actually 4.**Examining color replacement**\n\nI'm noticing that in the left block's output, the 8 at column 3, row 3 was changed to a 4, confirming that 4 is the majority color. Now, in the right block, there's an 8 at row 1, column 5 among the 4s, and it makes sense that the majority is also 4 there. Thus, the rule of replacing minority colors with the majority fits well. \n\nHowever, I see some confusion with the component in example 2. The left component includes 5, 7, and 9, with 7 likely being the majority. So, it's only minority colors that get replaced, not all colors turning into a single one. I'm questioning if the 5s are indeed a minority compared to the 7s because they appear several times too.**Building a pixel replacement algorithm**\n\nI'm diving into the left component, where it looks like there's a donut pattern with many 7s inside and 5s outlining the shape. It seems that there are more 7s than 5s, but interestingly, the output retains the 5s, which contradicts the initial rule of replacing minority colors with the majority. So, I\u2019m considering a different rule where I only replace isolated anomalous pixels that differ from their neighbors.\n\nIn the left block of input2, for example, I see the 9 surrounded by 7s, which is a single pixel differing from its immediate vertical neighbors. The pattern appears to be replacing these odd-colored pixels based on their neighboring colors. I think the algorithm should change for each non-zero pixel whose neighbors are mostly a single color to match that color.\n\nI must ensure this logic holds as I implement the code following the steps to transform the grid, creating a stable output by identifying and replacing only those singleton colors.

      "reasoning": "**Deducing transformation rule**\n\nI need to figure out the transformation rule by examining the examples. In Input1 with a 10x10 grid, there's a vertical column of 1s at index 2 and also at index 7 for rows 3, 4, and 5. It looks like the 1s at column 7 turn into 3s in the output, while the original 3 at (4,5) stays the same. So, the main change here is that the 1s in column 7 become 3s.**Analyzing transformation rules**\n\nI think the rule might be that for each pair of identical vertical bars, one gets transformed into the color of the single colored cell between them. For Input1, there are two vertical bars of 1 at columns 2 and 7, and a unique 3 at (4,5) between them. Following the rule, I\u2019d fill the cells in the column of the right bar with the color of the 3. In Input2, there are horizontal bars of 7 at rows 1 and 6, and a single 2 at (4,4) between them.**Finalizing the transformation rule**\n\nI\u2019m seeing a pattern: in the output, the horizontal bar at row 6 changes from 7 to 2, while the upper one remains 7. This suggests that we change the bar that is further away from the colored cell. In this case, the lower bar is closer to the colored cell at (4,4), which makes sense since it turned into 2. In Input1, the colored 3 at (4,5) makes the closer bar at column 7 change as well. So I think the rule is to recolor the nearer shape based on Manhattan distance.**Defining the transformation algorithm**\n\nIn both examples, it seems I should choose the bar that's closer to the colored single cell and recolor all its non-zero cells to match that color. It\u2019s also important to note the orientation of the bars, whether vertical or horizontal. I need to create an algorithm that detects the colored single cell that's distinct from the background (0) and the repeated shapes. In Input2, the single cell is 2, while the other colored pixels are 7, forming two identical bars. \n\nSo my general steps are: 1) Identify the background as 0. 2) Find all connected non-background components by color using 4-neighbor connectivity.",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing blocks and patterns**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how both blocks turn identical with 4s at all non-7 positions. It seems the right block was adjusted to change its 8 into a 4, and the same happened with the left block. So, the rule may involve replacing any distinct color with the majority color within each 3x3 pattern. However, I noticed 7 as a separate color in the middle row, complicating things. In examining Input2, I see two identical 5x5 donut shapes forming from the pattern.**Examining block patterns**\n\nIn the left block, I see an outer ring of 5s with interior 7s and a center 9. I\u2019m focused on the area from columns 2 to 4 and rows 3 to 10, which forms an 8x3 structure \u2014 could this represent a thick cross? Looking closely, in those rows and columns, I find numerous 5s and 7s with the central 9. I've outlined the grid for that section, showing that this configuration is indeed 8 rows by 3 columns. The right block also appears similar, but with a slight adjustment in its numbers.**Reassessing block details**\n\nI'm noticing that in the right block, the rows contain several 5s and 7s, with a slight difference in row 8 having a 9. So, I need to properly align my observations with the original Input2. I see that from rows 3 to 10, the columns 10 to 12 confirm the same patterns with 5s and 7s, but the key is that each block features a single anomalous 9 in different positions \u2014 one in the upper left at row 5 and another in the lower right at row 9.**Identifying symmetry in blocks**\n\nIn Output2, both blocks now have 7 in positions where there were anomalies. Specifically, the left block at row 5, column 3 changed from a 9 to a 7, and the right block at row 9, column 11 did the same. This means the majority color for the inner positions is consistent. The new pattern suggests ensuring symmetric pairs of blocks match by replacing any different colors in the inner area with 7s. I also notice two repeated shapes between the left and right blocks.**Designing shape consensus algorithm**\n\nI need to develop an algorithm that determines the modal color for each position across connected shapes and sets them to that color. This means I'll identify non-zero components by locating connected 4-neighbors, determine their bounding boxes, and align the shapes. I\u2019ll collect colors from each shape for each coordinate and find the most common color while ignoring background zeros. \n\nIt's essential to manage edge cases, like internal zeros, while ensuring I don\u2019t override other colors outside the components. I plan to implement this using Python lists and connected components through BFS, while ensuring the output grid reflects these adjustments accurately. Let\u2019s get coding!",

      "reasoning": "**Evaluating pattern filling**\n\nI'm analyzing Row5, which is [5,5,5,5,5,5,0,0,0,0]. Here, column 2 has a value of 5, so it isn't fully enclosed by 7. I wonder if I could fill it to create a continuous rectangle of 7s. The pattern seems symmetric, with a 5-filled border and an internal 7 pattern, which should be vertically symmetric. \n\nRow4's column 2 had changed from 5 to 7, suggesting a 3x3 block of 7s at the top left. It looks like the rule involves finding the connected components of color 7 and filling any holes with color 7.**Analyzing pattern changes**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how certain cells changed from Input2 to Output2, focusing on row 6. The input grid has 15 columns and 12 rows, creating a shape of 12 by 15. When comparing the two rows, I find that in row 6, column 7 changed from 7 to 6, indicating that a 7 turned into a 6. \n\nI also notice that in row 4, several 7s converted to 6, which appears to fill out a triangular shape. Now, I need to examine row 10 for further changes.**Examining changes in row 13**\n\nI noticed some changes in the last rows, particularly in row 13. In the output, that row shows [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7], while the input was [0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7, 7]. Here, column 6 changed from 7 to 6, and column 7 also changed from 7 to 6. It seems they expanded the 6 region outward, possibly to make it symmetric or fill in concavities.\n\nThere are two colors: the majority color 7 forms a ring, while the inner secondary color 6 fills any missing cells to become a coherent shape, creating a convex blob.**Exploring color patterns**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the pattern in Input2, noting that the 6 region appears to be one connected component but has 7 holes inside it. The outputs changed some of those 7s to 6s to eliminate the holes. For example, in row 6, column 7, there was a 7 surrounded by 6s, which made it a hole that got turned into a 6 in the output.\n\nIn other symmetrical spots, they also swapped 7 for 6 to fill these gaps. This leads to a rule: identify the largest color region enclosed by another color. In Input1, they changed some 5s to 7s, filling holes in the 7 region.I'm analyzing how to fill holes in a region of color 6 in Input2, where 7s turn into 6s. The rule here is to identify two non-background colors, find the one that forms a connected component with holes of the other color inside, and fill those holes to make the entire region convex.\n\nI recognize that in Input1, the outer color is 5 and the inner color is 7 since the area of 7 is smaller. The algorithm involves determining the non-background colors, creating a binary mask, and using breadth-first search to mark reachable cells. Any unvisited cells not marked as inner will be considered enclosed and should be transformed to the inner color. I'll ensure to handle edge cases and then implement the code as lists of lists.**Finalizing the implementation**\n\nI'll perform a breadth-first search (BFS) from border cells that aren\u2019t part of the inner color, marking the visited ones. For any cell that\u2019s neither inner nor visited, I\u2019ll consider it enclosed and change it to the inner color. I'm planning to use collections.deque for an efficient implementation and ensure I copy the grid before making changes.\n\nI'll also compute the counts for colors greater than zero at the beginning. If there's only one color besides zero, there\u2019s nothing to adjust. I\u2019m aware of edge cases, like when the inner color touches the border, which means no holes to fill.

      "reasoning": "**Clarifying matrix transformations**\n\nIt looks like output row 3 has a 1 in column 2 and a 3 in column 7. That means the left bar stays with 1s, but the right bar changes from 1 to 3. The center 3 at (4,5) remains, alongside another 3 at (4,7) that has been replaced. The rule involves finding two vertical bars of color A (1) around a single cell of color B (3). In Input2, there are horizontal bars of 7s in rows 1 and 6, spanning columns 2-6. The bottom bar changes to 2s, and the top bar stays as 7. So I need to determine the orientation based on the \"special\" cell's placement. In Input1, those vertical bars flank the 3, so I\u2019ll change the right bar to color 3.**Determining bar changes**\n\nIn Input2, there's a 2 located vertically between the top and bottom horizontal bars, specifically at row 4, column 4. The original top bar is at row 1 and the bottom bar at row 6. The bottom bar changed to 2s, so I\u2019m thinking about which bar actually changed. In both examples, it seems to depend on the direction from the center and the bar's distance from the grid edge. In Input1, both bars are equidistant from the edge, but I might choose the right one since it's positioned on the right side. In Input2, the top bar is closer to the top edge, while the bottom bar is farther from the edge, making it the one that changed. Overall, I need to consider how these placements impact my choices.**Implementing bar replacement algorithm**\n\nI realized the singleton 3 is at column 5, making it closer to the right bar (distance to column 7 is 2 vs. 3 to column 2). So, that right bar is the one changed. In Input2, the 2 at row 4 is closer to the bottom bar (distance to row 6 is 2 vs. 3 to row 1), so I changed that bottom bar to 2s. The rule seems to involve having two identical bars of color X, symmetric orientation, with a singleton of another color between them. The closer bar is replaced with the singleton color, while the other bar stays unchanged. I also need to implement the algorithm by first determining the colors without the background color (0).**Identifying unique and bar colors**\n\nI need to find the color that appears only once among the nonzero colors to identify the singleton. For instance, if color B occurs just once, it becomes my center color and its position is noted. Next, I\u2019ll look for other color values that have counts greater than one, as these represent the bars. I should focus on unique colors, excluding the singleton and background. I'll check for a single color A that shows up in multiple cells and detect two contiguous bar components, either horizontal or vertical, which are shaped as straight lines.**Producing the final code block**\n\nIn my examples, I\u2019m working with shapes that are either lines or squares, and they have the same orientation. I need to check if these shapes are equal or mirrored, but that doesn\u2019t seem necessary right now. I just want to return a mutated copy. So, let\u2019s focus on creating that final code block directly to encapsulate the results of my work without overcomplicating things. I\u2019ll keep it simple and straightforward!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing input-output rules**\n\nI think I need to infer a rule from the examples based on colored lines or rows. Looking at Input1, which is 10x10, I see blue 1s forming a vertical line at column 2 in rows 3, 4, and 5. Column 7 also has blue 1s in rows 3 through 5. However, I noticed that row 4 includes a green 3 at column 5, which modifies the output. This mapping is crucial for understanding the changes.**Mapping indices for color rules**\n\nI\u2019m trying to map indices, using zero-indexing for columns 0 to 9. In row 3, there are 1s at column 2 and column 7; row 4 has 1s at col2, a 3 at col5, and another 1 at col7; row 5 mirrors this. So, columns 2 and 7 have vertical triplets of 1s, while there's a solitary 3 in the middle. In the output, it looks like the columns with 1s are replaced by 3s. This suggests a potential rule involving symmetry and recoloring.**Inferring color change rules**\n\nI\u2019m considering a rule where a central colored pixel, like 3, leads to changing the nearest symmetrical blue pillars to that color. For Input2, which is 9x9, I see two horizontal bars of 7s in rows 1 and 6, with a central 2 in row 4. The bottom bar, closer to the 2, gets recolored to 2, whereas the top remains unchanged. This suggests the closer vertical bar gets changed to the central color, too!**Establishing color change rules**\n\nThe rule seems to be about finding two identical shapes, like bars, and recoloring the one closer to a differently colored singleton pixel. More broadly, if there are two identical multi-cell objects of the same color and a singleton pixel nearby, the object closer to the singleton should take on its color. In both examples, the shapes are symmetrical lines of varying lengths. I need to identify unique non-background colors, detect singletons, and analyze connected components of other colors!**Defining component recoloring logic**\n\nI think I need to find pairs of congruent components with the same shape and bounding box size. The next step is to calculate their distances from a singleton color cell. The examples show the correct component is chosen based on which centroid is closer to the singleton. I\u2019ll use the Manhattan distance for that. For the implementation, I need to identify colors, find connected components excluding the background, and establish the target color, followed by grouping components to find pairs of identical shapes or sizes. It seems like there\u2019s a lot to do, but overall, it\u2019s structured!**Finalizing the selection logic**\n\nI want to choose the first group of components if there are multiple, or maybe just take the largest one if sizes are mixed. If I can\u2019t find such a group, I might consider grouping by color if all components are the same size. Next, I\u2019ll compute the centroids of the components and select the one with the smallest Manhattan distance to the target position. After that, I\u2019ll recolor its positions to the target color and return the modified grid. It\u2019s important to create a deep copy of the grid to avoid altering the original!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformations**\n\nI need to compare Input1 and Output1. I\u2019m seeing a colored blob that might be filling holes in the output. It looks like some 5s are changed to 7s in specific positions. \n\nI should check if Input1 is a grid of 10x20, which might display as 20 rows and 10 columns. It seems like there are many zeros after row 12. The colored region appears mainly in the upper-left area.\n\nLet\u2019s also examine each row for clarity.**Examining row transformations**\n\nIn row 4, I see that the input has [5, 7, 5, 7, 5, 5...], while the output changes the second column value from 5 to 7. Row 5 has a similar pattern. When looking at row 8, the input is [0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 5...], and for row 9, [0, 0, 5, 7, 5, 7, 5...] stays the same except for column 4, which changes from 5 to 7. \n\nIt seems like the transformation is filling in certain 5 cells inside a block of 7s, creating a pattern of a 5 border around a shape of 7s.**Analyzing color fill patterns**\n\nIt seems I'm assessing how color 5 is filled in areas enclosed by 7s. For row 4, column 2 changes from 5 to 7. Checking the neighbors: above it, row 3, column 2 is 7; below it, row 5, column 2 is 5; left column 1 is 7; and right column 3 is also 7. So, this 5 is partly surrounded but not entirely enclosed. \n\nLooking at row 9, column 4, this one has all neighbors as 7, so it's fully enclosed, which explains why it gets filled.**Exploring symmetrical filling**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to fill any 5 that\u2019s within a bounding rectangle of 7s or to focus on filling 5s inside a central 7-connected region using morphological closing. \n\nLooking at Input2, I notice there are regions with 6s and 7s. In row 6, the input was [0, 7, 7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7...], but the output changed column 7 from 7 to 6. This suggests they filled a 6 into a hole or expanded the 6 region. \n\nI should check row 4 for more differences.**Determining filling algorithm**\n\nIn examining row changes, I see row 5 remains the same, while row 6 has a change in column 7. For row 12, the output shows a change from 6 to 7 in column 9. \n\nIt seems the overall transformation aims to fill holes in the inner color that are surrounded by an outer color ring, creating a solid effect. In Input1, the boundary color is 5, and the inner color is 7. Meanwhile, in Input2, the outer color is 7, and the inner is 6. \n\nThe rule could involve filling pixels of the outer color that are fully surrounded by the inner color. To detect enclosure, I need to distinguish the colors touching the grid border and determine which color forms a closed loop.**Implementing color filling algorithm**\n\nI'm laying out the implementation steps for the color transformation. First, I\u2019ll identify unique non-zero colors and check which of these colors touch the grid's border. The inner color will be the one that doesn\u2019t touch the border; if both do, I\u2019ll choose the one with fewer pixels.\n\nThen, I\u2019ll flood-fill from all border cells, treating the inner color as a barrier. Any cells that aren't reachable and aren\u2019t the inner color will be deemed enclosed and converted to the inner color. \n\nI'll start coding this up, ensuring to handle edge cases and iterating through the grid to apply the necessary transformations!",

      "reasoning": "**Considering color filling rules**\n\nI'm thinking about filling a shape defined by two colors: the outer border color (5) and the inner color (7). The goal is to convert any 5s that are inside the region bounded by the 7s to 7s, making the inner region fully filled. This means I need to identify which 5s are part of the interior and which are part of the outer border. Using connected components of zeros that aren't touching the border might help in determining the interior pixels.**Filling inner color regions**\n\nI'm considering how to fully fill an inner color region by converting border color pixels that are surrounded by inner color into that inner color. In this case, for Input2, it seems like the outer color (7) forms a ring, and the inner color (6) is mostly present. When I find connected regions where A contains B with holes, I need to replace those A pixels surrounded by B. The goal is to ensure the inner region is contiguous.**Exploring color filling techniques**\n\nI'm contemplating an alternative approach for filling regions defined by colors. For each color C that acts as a frame with color D inside, I want to identify enclosed areas by treating cells not equal to D as walls. I\u2019ll find the largest connected component of D and fill enclosed cells to match that color. To simplify it further, I could calculate the bounding box for each closed loop shape and flood-fill from the bounding box border where necessary. This way, I can more effectively fill any gaps in D.**Designing a robust algorithm**\n\nI'm working on a plan to convert cells of color A inside a bounding box to color D, but only if they're completely surrounded by D. For Input1, the bounding box for the 7 region could be rows 1 to 11 and columns 1 to 5. The 5 at row 4, column 2 seems to be eligible for conversion. I\u2019ll identify non-background colors, focusing on cases with exactly two colors. The approach here is to determine which color is the border by comparing their areas and contact with the bounding box.**Refining the color filling algorithm**\n\nI'm working on an algorithm to fill cells of outer color A that are enclosed by inner color B. In Input1, it appears that color 7 is smaller and will be the encloser. To determine the regions, I need to compute connected components of color B. The strategy is to flood-fill from the grid boundary through non-B cells and mark the outside region, identifying which non-B cells can't reach the boundary. These will be converted to B since they're enclosed. I'll test the method with various inputs to ensure it behaves correctly.**Clarifying the flooding algorithm**\n\nI'm refining my approach to identify non-B cells that are enclosed by B cells, where B is the encloser color. In Input1, for instance, the outer ring is formed by color 5 while 7 is the inner color that encases the holes of 5. So in this scenario, B would be 7, the minority color. In Input2, it seems like B should be 6. I\u2019ll implement a breadth-first search (BFS) from the grid's boundaries to mark reachable cells before converting the non-B cells that are enclosed to B. I'll write the code accordingly!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformation details**\n\nI need to deduce the transformation from Input1 to Output1. It seems like we're dealing with a grid shape of 10 by 20, which means the width is 10 and the height is 20. But, wait\u2014are they representing rows as columns? I need to read the matrix correctly as 20 rows of length 10. I\u2019ll compare the input and output for differences row-wise, particularly focusing on row 4 to see what changes occur there.**Examining input rows**\n\nI\u2019m going through the input rows to understand their structure. From rows 0 to 11, I see a pattern, with some rows filled with specific numbers, like 5s and 7s, while others are entirely zeros. Specifically, rows 12 to 19 are all zeros. It seems like there's a clear structure here, and I need to keep this in mind when I analyze how these rows might relate to my output or any transformation that's taking place.**Identifying output differences**\n\nI\u2019m noticing some differences in Output1, particularly at row 4, where the values changed from [5 7 5 7 5 5...] to [5 7 7 7 5 5...]. This means the cell at (row 4, col 2) changed from 5 to 7. Similarly, row 9 changed from [0 0 5 7 5 7 5...] to [0 0 5 7 7 7 5...], altering col 4 from 5 to 7. I should pay attention to how the 5s fill gaps in the 7-cluster to maintain a solid shape. \n\nNow, I want to look at the new shape given for Input2, which specifies a structure of 12 by 15.**Examining Input2 to Output2 differences**\n\nOkay, it looks like the shape for Input2 is 12 columns and 15 rows. I need to compare Input2 and Output2 closely to identify differences, possibly where some cells change from 7 to 6 or vice versa. \n\nI'll annotate the rows from 0 to 14. Rows 0 to 2 are all identical zeros, while Row 3 is also unchanged: [0 7 7 7...]. In Row 4, I see it remains the same.\n\nRow 5 is still consistent, but in Row 6, there's a change: the input has a 7 at col 7, while the output replaces it with a 6. I\u2019ll keep digging!**Exploring color transformation rules**\n\nI'm analyzing how colors are transformed between Input and Output. For instance, in row 6, within Input2, col 7 changed from 7 to 6, filling an interior area. As I check rows 7 to 11, they all remain the same. However, in row 13, columns 6 to 8 changed, which shows some alteration in the 7 region. \n\nI need to summarize the overarching rule: apply changes to inner colors if they're surrounded by an outer color. This means filling gaps to create a complete area with no holes. In Input1, I see some 5s surrounded by 7s. In Input2, we're filling 6s as the inner color, originally surrounded by 7s. The goal is to ensure regions are filled symmetrically, leading to smooth transformations for connected components. This will involve using bounding boxes and detecting enclosed regions for consistent coloring.**Developing a filling algorithm**\n\nI'm looking at a grid where I need to fill in colors based on connections to the border. Specifically, non-color cells that are enclosed need to turn into the color border that surrounds them. \n\nI'll start by checking each color, marking non-connected cells from the border through breadth-first search (BFS) techniques. After identifying the holes, I'll replace those with the selected color. The key is to examine which colors are forming closed loops and to identify their enclosed colors accurately\u2013my algorithm will adjust colors accordingly, ensuring that if there are multiple colors with holes, all must be filled without disrupting others.**Designing the BFS algorithm**\n\nI need to check if the color 7 connects to the border, but it seems likely they do. However, I\u2019ll consider the order of colors when filling, as changing one may affect others. It might be wise to create a copy of the grid for processing each color sequentially. For Input1, only color 7 has holes to fill, while Input2 has holes for color 6. \n\nDuring implementation, I\u2019ll use BFS with a deque, creating a visited matrix. Starting from the border cells that aren\u2019t the target color, I\u2019ll proceed to find and fill any holes. Finally, I\u2019ll return the updated grid. \n\nTime to finalize the code!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing block transformations**\n\nI'm checking the input left block, which has an 8 in the top row at column 5. The coordinates tell me the left block starts at (col1, row1) and the right block starts at col5. The right block's top row has an 8 at col5, but in the output, that 8 changes to a 4. It seems the rule for symmetric mirrored blocks is to replace any non-dominant color with the dominant color to unify the appearance. I'm also looking at a 15x15 structure with two symmetric objects and a ring of 5\u2019s and 7's.**Examining input shapes**\n\nI see a 5-outline with 7s creating a plus sign, possibly featuring a 9 or a 7 at the center. In Input2, there are two similar 7x5 shapes, particularly noticeable in rows 3-10 and columns 2-4. The left block has a 9 at (row5, col3). Looking more closely, the left block's center at row6, col3 is a 9 while the output changes this to a 7. The right block also has a 9 at row9, col11 in the input, so I'm double-checking these details.**Analyzing positions of colors**\n\nIn row 9, I've noted that there are various positions for the 9s. The left block has a 9 at row6, col3, while the right block has one at row9, col11. Both centers are changed to 7 in the output, so the rule emerges: in symmetric shapes, the central pixel should match the majority color around it (which seems to be 7). If there are anomalies, they should be replaced with the modal color inside that block. I'll explore connected components of non-zero colors, focusing on duplicates across the grid while being cautious around borders.**Identifying shape rules**\n\nI'm looking at the left shape, which has a mix of 5s and 7s. It seems the majority might be 5, but the center should actually be 7. Replacing anomalies with the modal color would incorrectly change the center to 5 instead. I need a more specific rule: the border is 5, with the inner cross made up of 7s and occasional 9s, which should also become 7. I should identify structured objects, like a donut shape, and determine the dominant interior color, likely 7, while excluding the borders in my analysis.**Developing transformation rules**\n\nI'm inspecting each bounding box (bbox) to differentiate border cells from inner cells. The majority inner color seems to be 7, which means I need to replace any anomalies, like 9s, with 7. The border is set at 5, and for the left block in Input1, the bbox centers around both 4 and 7. It looks like the 4s are the majority, but I need to ensure that the center 7 remains unchanged for the output. \n\nThere are two layers: a border and a center; I need to maintain symmetry across mirrored components by standardizing colors. When dealing with pairs, I'll copy the more common color while ensuring no important center colors are altered. By identifying connected components and grouping similar shapes, I can standardize these patterns while keeping anomalies accounted for, especially in cases where 9s or 6s appear. The algorithm will focus on connected non-zero cells.**Planning component connection and transformations**\n\nI'm defining the connectivity as 4-neighbors because diagonals don't count as connected. This means that I'm working with small groups, possibly forming vertical or horizontal lines. I suspect there are repeated shapes, and I\u2019ll need to group them by their bounding box (bbox) shape.\n\nThe plan is to compute components of non-zero cells using 4-connectivity since the shapes in my training data are contiguous. I\u2019ll group similar masks across the grid, focusing only on shapes that appear more than once. For these groups, I\u2019ll calculate the consensus color for each mask position and update accordingly. \n\nI'll implement functions to find connected components using BFS/DFS, ensuring each component's bbox and mask positions are identified. I want to use a tuple to represent the masks and gather colors to determine the mode for each position. Then I\u2019ll apply this to the output grid, taking care of any edge cases. Let's craft the code now!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid transformation**\n\nI need to figure out the transformation from Input1 to Output1 based on the grid shapes. The grids are 10 columns by 20 rows, but they seem to be presented as 20 rows of 10 entries. I notice a pattern of 5s and some 7s in the input. So, I\u2019ll visually compare the rows. For instance, in Row4, the value at (row4, col2) changed from 5 to 7, which fills in a missing 7 in a 3x3 block. Let's keep exploring these differences!**Examining grid row changes**\n\nI'm checking Row9 of Input1, which shows a change from a 5 to a 7 at col4, and Row10 remains unchanged. It seems like Row4 and Row9 are filling gaps in a ring shape made of 5s and 7s, creating a sort of donut shape. The aim might be to fill in 5s surrounded by 7s to form larger contiguous blocks of 7s. I should also look into Input2 and Output2 to see where changes happen, especially in rows near the bottom, starting with Row12.**Parsing dataset differences**\n\nI see that the shape is 12 columns, but there are many more rows to consider. I\u2019m focusing on differences, starting with row6 in Input2. I should compare the last two rows of Input2 and Output2. In the second-to-last row, both are unchanged, but the last row has some changes: Input shows all 7s in columns 4-11 while Output changes some of those 7s to 6s in the bottom-right section. I\u2019ll need to look closer at any changes in row6 as well. It\u2019s a bit messy, but I\u2019ll figure it out!**Inferring color propagation rules**\n\nI\u2019m trying to infer a rule about how color 7 propagates outward along a boundary and replaces color 5. In Input2, the colors are 7 for the border and 6 for the inner area. There\u2019s a ring of 7 with some clusters of 6 inside, which may have some 7s that should actually be 6s, or vice versa. I\u2019ll check row6 closely. In this case, Input2 and Output2 differ slightly, but it seems the pattern holds throughout rows 3-8 in the top ring. This is a bit complicated, but I\u2019ll sort it out!**Defining color conversion rules**\n\nI've identified that there's a change from 7 to 6 at row6, column7, along with some other changes to 6 in the bottom area. The rule seems to be filling inner cavities of the 7-shaped border with 6, turning enclosed 7s into 6s. This leads to the general guideline of converting miscolored pixels within the enclosed area to the designated interior color. \n\nTo achieve this, I need to analyze connected components and ensure I accurately distinguish between border and interior colors based on their counts. It\u2019s a bit complex, but I\u2019m getting there!**Clarifying color conversion logic**\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking through the contradictions in my approach to the color mapping, particularly with 5s that appear inside a ring of 5 barriers. It seems those 5s should actually be treated as anomalies and converted to the interior color, but since they match the border color, detecting them is tricky. \n\nThe general rule involves identifying the minority color (the smaller group) and filling any holes that are surrounded by this color, converting them to match the interior. I feel like I\u2019m getting closer to a robust algorithm for this!**Finalizing the interior color algorithm**\n\nI need to be careful in choosing the correct interior color, which should be the non-zero color with the smallest count, while excluding the background zeros. If there's a tie, I\u2019ll stick with the smallest count. The plan is to input the grid, determine unique non-zero colors, and compute a mask for non-interior components.\n\nI\u2019ll check connected components to identify if they touch the border, and if not, those will be filled with the interior color. It\u2019s crucial to ensure I\u2019m implementing this correctly and efficiently with a standard BFS approach. Let\u2019s get coding!",

      "reasoning": "**Assessing symmetrically matching blocks**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how to make two mismatched blocks identical by transforming their values. If I set both differing cells to 4, the rows become uniform: [4 4 4], [7 7 7], and [4 4 4]. The idea is to align blocks by ensuring cell values match across a central vertical axis. For each pair of corresponding cells, I'll switch any differing colors to the more common one. For Input2, it\u2019s a 15x15 grid with specific shapes and patterns to examine.**Analyzing shape differences**\n\nI'm examining the shapes in Input2, noting they are mirrored but differ in columns. The left 5x5 includes columns 2-4, while the right consists of columns 10-12. The left side has a pattern, such as row 3 being [5 5 5] and subsequently involving 5s and a 9. The right side has similar rows, with differences in values. My goal is to replace the unique color, which is 9, with 7, ensuring both shapes match by converting the minority color in corresponding positions to the majority.**Transforming symmetrical positions**\n\nI'm identifying symmetrical positions, specifically noting that at (5,3) the left has 9, and at (5,11) the right has 7. To make them consistent, I\u2019ll set both to 7. I find another pair at (9,11) has a 9 while (9,3) has 7; I'll also change both to 7 here. The general rule is to find mirrored objects, and for each pair of corresponding positions, replace differing values with the most common non-background color between them. I\u2019ll focus on connected color components while ignoring the background zero.**Identifying similar components**\n\nI'm focusing on finding the two largest components that share the same shape. First, I'll compare their bounding boxes to confirm they are horizontally mirrored. For each cell within the bounding box, if the values differ, I\u2019ll change both to the more common value. If they match, that simplifies things! I need to find symmetric positions across the vertical axis, specifically looking for non-zero values separated by columns of zero. I'll determine the left and right regions containing non-zero pixels and locate their mirrored counterparts.",

      "reasoning": "**Clarifying color algorithm**\n\nI\u2019ve changed the 5s inside the inner area of the 7 to match the inner color of 7, while keeping the boundary at 5. Now, for finding the largest contiguous region of non-background colors, I'm identifying the color that forms a closed loop or ring to fill the holes within it. Specifically, I'm looking for color C that encloses cells of another color D and filling those with C. It seems that I need to ensure these filling processes consider other colors within the enclosures.**Evaluating color transformation**\n\nIn Input2, color 7 forms a complex shape with many 6s inside, yet some 7s seem to have been changed to 6s. For example, looking at row 6, the input shows [0 7 7 6 6 6 6 7 7 7 0 0] while the output shows [0 7 7 6 6 6 6 6 7 7 0 0]. It looks like the 7 in column 7 was changed to 6, indicating that maybe they filled a hole. This points to the idea that in each closed loop, we should fill the inside with the inner color, especially the minority color.**Identifying color boundaries**\n\nI'm looking to identify a two-color ring by finding a contiguous closed boundary that doesn't touch the background. The idea is to determine the majority color inside this boundary and fill the interior with that color. In Input1, the outer ring is color 5, surrounding the inner ring of color 7, which has a 5 pixel hole. So, the closed loop is formed by 7, and I need to fill holes within that region with 7. In Input2, the large 7 ring has an interior of 6s, and I\u2019m curious if there might be some holes of 7 inside. Let's visually scan Input2 for clarity.**Analyzing color filling strategy**\n\nI suspect there are 7 pixels inside that should actually be converted to 6. So, I\u2019m considering if I should fill the holes within the region of 6. I think the region of 6 is a contiguous cluster inside the 7 ring, and some of the 7 pixels in that area are holes that need to be changed to 6. The general rule would be to fill any enclosed region with its surrounding color. Alternatively, for each color that isn\u2019t the background, I could identify connected components and fill any closed loops with that component\u2019s color. It\u2019s all about detecting those simple boundaries forming a ring.**Detecting interior regions**\n\nTo identify enclosed areas, I\u2019ll use a flood fill from the grid border for the background and other colors. The goal is to find cells not equal to a color C that are entirely surrounded by C. I think I should calculate connected components, and determine which colors are enclosed by specific colors. For each color that forms a contiguous ring, I need to fill the inner holes with the boundary color, while being careful about processing order to avoid incorrect conversions. This means I should focus on colors enclosing others and ensure that any changes preserve the intended regions.**Filling nested colors**\n\nIf two colors are nested, like the outer 5 and inner 7, I need to be careful with my algorithm. For color 7, I would fill the inner 5 with 7. However, using color 5 could undo that since it might fill the 7 region instead. My focus should be on processing colors that form closed loops. For example, if both 5 and 7 in Input1 form loops, filling the inner 7 with 5 becomes undesirable. \n\nI think a good strategy would be to choose the minority color in the loop to perform the fill. Observing the examples, it seems the process involves filling isolated cells surrounded by the majority color. This means using the local majority rule for adjacent cells, where if a cell's neighbors are mostly a different color, it gets changed to that color. \n\nTo implement this, I should compute the neighbor counts for each non-zero cell and apply a threshold for filling. I\u2019ll consider surrounding colors not equal to the current cell\u2019s color, ensuring I only change when the neighbor count reaches a certain threshold, which I am deciding to set at 5 or more. This way I can ensure the changes reflect the local majority and maintain the integrity of the intended colors.**Implementing neighbor counting**\n\nI\u2019ve noticed that only small holes were being converted in previous examples, so now I'm planning to implement a function that counts neighboring colors with a threshold of 5. I need to ensure that edges are safe during this process, and then return a new grid. \n\nI'll set up my Python function, `transform(grid)`, which takes a list of lists of integers. Using neighbor offsets of [-1, 0, 1], I\u2019ll skip the (0, 0) position. For each cell, I\u2019ll count its non-zero neighbors. If a neighbor's count reaches the threshold of 5 and differs from the current cell\u2019s color, I\u2019ll set it in the new grid. I need to think about whether to include zeros \u2014 but generally, only non-zero replacements will be considered. Let's get coding!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing shape transformation**\n\nI'm trying to understand a 6x6 block made of 5's and 7's, which looks like a donut shape. In a specific spot at row 4 and column 2, I see a 5 surrounded by 7's, where it seems a 7 should be. Looking at rows 9 and 10, I note changes where a 5 in row 9 is transformed into a 7 in the output. It looks like the transformation fills internal 5's enclosed by a ring of 7's. I wonder if a similar process is happening in another case where some 7's change to 6's.**Examining color filling process**\n\nI'm looking at input row 6, where I see [0 7 7 6 6 6 6 7 7 7 0 0]. The output changes column 7 from 7 to 6, suggesting it's creating a contiguous area of 6's. It seems like some neighboring 7's are changing to 6 to fill a region. My hypothesis is that we have a shape with two colors\u2014a background (0) and two others, where the border forms a ring around the interior. We need to change any 7 that\u2019s completely surrounded by 6 to make the interior solid.**Understanding color filling algorithm**\n\nIn Input2, 7 serves as the outer color forming a large region, while 6 is the interior cluster. The output seems to convert some adjacent 7's to 6, filling the enclosed area entirely with 6. Examining the input reveals a ring of 7 around the perimeter, and the output fills the interior region with 6 up to the boundary. The algorithm identifies a connected component of the border color and fills all non-border, non-background cells with the interior color. To compute the interior, I'll use the outer border as a contour and perform a flood fill from the outside background to mark the exterior. Any cell not reachable from the outside should then be colored accordingly.**Defining interior and exterior colors**\n\nI'm considering the typical method of treating the background (0) as the exterior and performing a BFS from it to mark reachable cells. Cells that aren't reachable, like 6 and certain 7's, would be considered interior. In Input2, I need to change all interior cells to the most frequent non-background color. In Input1, the outer ring might be composed of 5's, with the interior being mostly 7's. Any interior color not reachable from the exterior should be changed to 7, which aligns with Input1's transformations. Thus, the algorithm should focus on marking the exterior without needing to determine the border color explicitly, simply using flood fill through the background.**Clarifying interior and ring color**\n\nTo determine which cells are interior, I can perform a BFS from the background (0) to mark reachable cells, treating the ring cells as barriers like walls. It seems we're looking for an enclosed region by a connected color ring\u2014either 5 or 7\u2014depending on the input. For Input2, the ring is 7, while the interior is 6. The idea is to change the interior colors accordingly once identified.\n\nI should focus on checking if colors touch the background; those that don't are considered interior colors. This approach ensures we're identifying the true interior, even when the color can also act as a ring elsewhere, like in Input1. By treating ring colors as barriers and using flood fill from accessible background cells, I can accurately calculate which cells remain unreachable and should be converted to the interior color.**Planning the algorithm for color conversion**\n\nI\u2019m recognizing that while 7 is open inside, it may not be reachable due to the barrier color 5 enclosing it. Thus, those 7's will be marked as interior. Any 5 that is classified as an interior color won't be reachable since it's a barrier. My method needs to account for this discrepancy.\n\nTo identify barrier cells that are internal, I can consider only those connected to accessible regions and treat non-background colors\u2014in this case, mostly as barriers. I'll flood fill from the edges to determine reachable open cells, ensuring that I calculate the interior correctly. This involves detecting barrier cells that do not touch the border by checking their connected components. By confirming which components have adjacency to open paths, I can then accurately convert interior cells to the appropriate color. From there, I\u2019ll adjust the algorithm to fill in the appropriate interior colors based on this analysis.**Refining the color conversion process**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that the interior open cells will be the 7s inside, and since my interior color is the most common among them, it remains 7\u2014no change needed there. The barrier components are primarily 5, forming a large ring connected to reachable open cells. However, smaller barrier components, particularly the 5s inside, may be isolated. For those, I\u2019ll convert them to the interior color 7 if they don't connect to the outer barrier.\n\nIn Input2, the barrier color is 7, and the open cells will be defined as anything not 7, which includes both 0 and 6. Following the flood fill, I\u2019ll mark reachable cells and see that the enclosed 6 cells are indeed interior, which means no conversion is required. Just confirming that any isolated 7s within the ring need to be converted to 6.\n\nNow for the new test grid, it seems the arrangement could cause issues since the barrier is clearly the most frequent color, which is 8. With all cells of value not equal to 8 being potential open cells, the flood fill might not mark any, meaning my interior would be entirely comprised of 3s. Since there are no enclosed barriers, it looks like the transformation will end up being a no-op, returning the same grid. \n\nI\u2019ve determined that I need a robust BFS implementation to gather those details accurately, counting frequencies well and excluding 0 (background). I\u2019ll also ensure I keep track of visited cells so that I can accurately identify interior components. It feels like a lot, but I can see a clear path to implementing this now!**Finalizing the color conversion logic**\n\nI\u2019m focused on checking each component to see if any of its cells are adjacent to reachable open cells. If they are, I\u2019ll classify them as exterior; if not, they\u2019ll be considered enclosed and will need to be converted to the interior color. \n\nI need a plan for edge cases, especially if the interior color happens to be None while there are enclosed barrier components. In that case, I could fallback to another non-barrier color that\u2019s present in the grid. If things get tricky, I might choose the most frequent non-zero color excluding the barrier, or I could settle on the border color. \n\nOnce that logic is solid, I\u2019ll make sure the function returns the modified grid. Now it\u2019s time to code this! The mental tests seem promising so far!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing input patterns**\n\nI need to deduce rules from examples provided. In Input1, the small pattern is 9x5, and there are two 3x3 squares. Visualizing the grid with columns and rows helps. The left block (columns 1-3) has 4s in row 1, while row 2 has 7s, and row 3 shows a mix of 4s and an 8. The right block shows a different pattern. It feels like both blocks may need confirmation to become symmetrical.**Examining pattern adjustments**\n\nIn Output1, row 1 shows a change where the right block's 8 was replaced with a 4. For row 3, the left block's 8 also turned into a 4, indicating a rule: if a majority color appears in a 3x3 block, replace the minority color with it. Looking at Input2, which is a 15x15 grid with two 5x5 squares, I see a 9 at row 5, column 3 in the left block. However, this 9 changed to a 7 in Output2, as did another 9 in the right block.**Refining color matching rules**\n\nI'm noticing that the interior pixel in the block changes to match the surrounding color, which is often a 7. In the left block, the border values are mostly 5s with some 7s. Checking the arrangement for rows 3 to 10 in columns 2 to 4, I see a pattern. \n\nThe center column is actually the third column (col3). There are many 7s in that center column, with 5s in rows 3 and 10. The rule seems to be that if a pixel differs from the dominant color in the block, it should be replaced to match the dominant color.**Determining block patterns**\n\nI\u2019m trying to define the blocks by detecting rectangular subgrids with non-zero colors that form mirrored, symmetric patterns. A simpler approach might be to find connected components of non-zero color. For each component, I could identify the majority color and recolor all pixels to that color. \n\nIn Input1, the left block has both 4s and 7s. The counts reveal that 4 appears six times, making it the majority. However, output keeps row 2 as all 7s. They only corrected an odd 8 into a 4, indicating not all pixels were recolored to the majority.**Clarifying color adjustment rules**\n\nIt seems the rules for adjustment aren't applied to the whole 3x3 block but rather each row within that block. In the left block, rows 1 and 2 remained unchanged because they had consistent colors (4s and 7s). In row 3, an 8 was turned into a 4. \n\nHowever, in Input2's left block, I see a 9 should have been turned to a 5 due to a majority of 5s, but it was changed to a 7 instead. It looks like the goal was to make the center column consistent (mostly 7s). They seemed to keep the edge pixels (5s) as part of the frame since they matched their row's border. The takeaway might be to replace isolated pixels with the majority within the immediate neighborhood, focusing on symmetry across blocks to ensure uniformity in color.**Analyzing color matching rules**\n\nI'm comparing pixel values across blocks to find mismatches. For example, in row 5 of Input2, the left center has a 9 while the right has a 7, which creates a tie. The general approach seems to be choosing the most frequent color present in corresponding positions across both blocks.\n\nLooking at the center columns across rows 3 to 10, the majority appears to favor 7, as it occurs more often than both 5 and 9. The goal seems to be matching colors between symmetric blocks, keeping ties resolved by checking neighboring pixels, ensuring overall harmony.**Designing algorithm for pixel components**\n\nI'm developing an algorithm to find connected components of non-zero pixels, focusing on shapes that are duplicates. The idea is to group components by their shape and relative coordinates. For each group with more than one component, I\u2019ll align bounding boxes and collect colors at each relative coordinate. \n\nHere\u2019s the plan: choose the majority color, breaking ties based on global frequency. This should work well with both Input1 and Input2. I\u2019ll also ensure to manage zeros properly and write the code robustly to handle edge cases, like the presence of holes in components.",

      "reasoning": "**Deducing transformation rules**\n\nI need to figure out transformation based on examples. It seems like the transformation replaces distinct non-background colors with the color of a specific pixel located near the top. For instance, in the input, there's a long horizontal line, smaller shapes, and a single pixel. The output shows those shapes changed to color 2, suggesting a 'target color' that spreads to similarly-shaped blocks. Perhaps the rule is to identify colors that occur exactly once in the input.**Refining recoloring rules**\n\nThe color 2 in Input1 seems important for transformation. I recall that colors such as 3 and 8 change to 2, while background and the long color 7 remain unchanged. It looks like I should identify singleton colors that occur exactly once and then recolor all 2x2 blocks to that singleton color. Now looking at Input2, color 4 forms a 4x2 rectangle, and color 6 makes an L-shape with missing parts. I need to consider how these patterns fit the rules.**Understanding recoloring dynamics**\n\nIn Output2, the singleton color 9 recolors a 4-block while the 6 block remains unchanged. This suggests a possible rule for recoloring rectangular and contiguous blocks. The 4-block is indeed a 4-high by 2-wide rectangle, while the 6 block appears larger and more complex, forming a hollow 3x4 shape. I realize I need to check the grid shape; it's 12 by 10 with 12 columns, and the 6 cluster at row 7 spans multiple columns. The pattern shows that while the 4 block changes, the shape of 6 stays the same.**Identifying block characteristics**\n\nI'm noticing a common property among the blocks: they tend to be smaller, specifically 2x2 or multi-row configurations. My idea is to find colors that occur exactly once and then recolor all smaller blocks. In Input1, colors 3 and 8 changed from 2x2 blocks, while the 4 block in Input2 is larger, at size 8. It's clear I can't stick to a fixed size. Perhaps a different rule could involve replacing blocks not connected to the border, but some examples don't touch the border at all.**Finalizing recoloring algorithm**\n\nI'm figuring out how to handle border touches, especially with colors like 6 and 9 in the grid. The proposed rule involves recoloring non-background components that don\u2019t touch the border to the color of the singleton pixel. In my tests, I'm noticing the grid sizes and their dimensions. I need to determine which colors occur exactly once to use for recoloring. \n\nThe key steps are identifying connected components of non-zero colors, checking for border touching, and applying the singleton color as a replacement while leaving border-adjacent components unchanged. This approach seems consistent with the examples I've analyzed. Finally, I'll use BFS or DFS to implement the algorithm effectively.**Defining edge cases**\n\nI think the time complexity of the algorithm looks good, but I need to address edge cases. If there's no singleton non-zero color, I might want to use the smallest color by count as a fallback. It\u2019s important to ensure robustness; if there\u2019s no singleton, I\u2019ll choose the color with the minimum count that isn\u2019t zero. However, since the examples likely contain a singleton, that should help avoid these edge cases. Now, I\u2019ll focus on producing a code block only.",

      "reasoning": "**Reviewing color replacement rules**\n\nAlright, I'm considering the rule about replacing non-majority colors within blocks to match the majority color. In the input, the left block has a majority color of 4, except for one 8, and the right block also seems to have a majority of 4. The 8s should be replaced with 4s since it's the majority. I\u2019ll also look at Input2, which has a 15x15 structure with two symmetric 5x5 shapes. I see a repeating pattern that needs to be addressed.**Analyzing column data**\n\nI\u2019m examining the reported columns for row 3. It shows values like [0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0]. The left block seems to have 5s in columns 2 to 4, with a 0 in column 5. Moving to row 4 and row 5, there's a pattern of 5s forming a ring. I see that the left block center shifted to 9 at row 5, while the right block center remains 7, except for row 9.**Clarifying block adjustments**\n\nIn output2, the center of the left block was adjusted from 9 to 7, making both blocks match. For row 5, it shows [0, 0, 5, 7, 5...] now, confirming that change. For row 9, the right block originally had 5, 9, 5 but that 9 was also changed to 7. I\u2019m noticing a ring of 5s in the top-left area, suggesting a hollow square with varying centers. The general rule seems to be replacing odd colors with the majority center color to ensure symmetry.**Testing block symmetry**\n\nI\u2019m checking the mirroring in input1, where the left block had an 8 at the bottom-right, while the right block mirrored that with an 8 at the top-left. The key mismatch is between matched positions with 4 vs. 8. I need to identify which side should be authoritative. In the output, both sides showed 4, but the left block's bottom-right starts with 8. Mapping across the center column, I see that the left block maps from columns 1-3 to the right block\u2019s columns 5-7. I confirm that the left block\u2019s corresponding cell at (row3, col3) mirrors to the right block (row3, col5), which is indeed 4.**Developing replacement rules**\n\nIn looking at the right block\u2019s setup, with an 8 at (row1, col5) mirrored to a 4 at (row1, col3) in the left, I see mismatches. The output adjusted both blocks to 4. I\u2019m considering a general rule to handle differences in mirrored cells by using the majority color. In output2, the left center was set to 7. I\u2019ll need to establish an approach for aligning colors based on the most frequent occurrences across the mirrored blocks. \n\nTo simplify, for symmetric blocks, I want to unify colors by taking the most common color at each coordinate across both blocks. If colors at corresponding coordinates differ, I might prefer the one found in the majority of non-center cells, ensuring internal consistency and addressing any anomalies. This involves checking for the appropriate majority color in their neighborhoods while maintaining symmetry.**Formulating color rules**\n\nI\u2019m considering anomalies in the rows of the blocks. For the top row of the right block and the bottom row of the left block, changing 8s to 4s aligns with the row majority. Yet, I need a more general approach. In Input2, the left block\u2019s middle row showed varying results. When I checked by column, I saw the center column\u2019s majority should set values correctly.\n\nThere's a thought about computing the majority color for both rows and columns within each block to unify their colors. While this approach has complexity, overall it seems best to analyze symmetric blocks and identify the canonical color based on the majority appearing in both contexts. I plan to read the grid, find components with non-zero values, and unify colors based on surrounding contexts.**Developing a symmetrization algorithm**\n\nI\u2019m thinking we expect to find multiple symmetric components, but the test inputs have a mix of sizes and patterns, like small diamond shapes. The first step is to identify regions of non-zero pixels and match shapes mirrored horizontally.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll outline an algorithm: first, find connected components, then compute bounding boxes. Next, I\u2019ll get mirrored coordinates of each pair. For every position in bounding boxes, I\u2019ll gather colors from both components and their neighbors to set a canonical color. \n\nThis requires careful handling to ensure each shape is unified without affecting others. I\u2019ll implement these steps in code!**Designing the transformation algorithm**\n\nI\u2019m outlining a pseudo-code for the transformation of a grid of colors. First, I\u2019ll convert it to a list of lists and create a visited boolean map. I need to find connected components using BFS for non-zero cells. From these components, I\u2019ll create a mirrored set of coordinates and attempt to find pairs. \n\nFor each pair, I need to compute a bounding box and analyze values within this box, considering neighbors in both components. Most common values will be selected, and I\u2019ll handle ties by choosing the smaller color. Finally, I\u2019ll return the modified grid. Now it\u2019s time to implement the code!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing color replacement rules**\n\nI'm thinking about a rule regarding what to do with a \"seed\" color that stands out against the background and how it might occur just once in a shape. I wonder if the replacement involves matching another color to the shape's orientation. For instance, in Input1, the seed color is blue, and there might be some confusion with identifying patterns. I need to check how often the original shape appears in the input to clarify.**Identifying matching sub-blocks**\n\nI need to locate sub-blocks of color 1 that fit the bounding box of color 2, which is a 3x2 shape. I noticed there are indeed two 3x2 blocks of color 1 in Input1, one at cols 5-6 and another at cols 8-9 in rows 2-4. However, there's a partial match at cols 3-4, since two rows have 0s. That means two blocks get recolored to 2, while the others remain color 1. The rule is to find and recolor matching shapes!**Analyzing seed structure in Input2**\n\nIn Input2, I'm trying to determine the shape and bounds of seed color 6, which seems to create a cluster occupying specific positions in the matrix. The bounding box appears to cover rows 1-4, and I see rows with 6 in clusters that look like a thick plus shape. It seems only three clusters of color 2 got recolored to 6, but some 2s remain, particularly in the center. I should detect and categorize shapes to identify the target colors.**Developing a recoloring algorithm**\n\nI'm trying to figure out how color 6 behaves in Input2, but I noticed it only appears in two areas despite several replacements in the output. I need to create a general algorithm: Color A will be a specific region, while color B will have multiple regions of similar shapes. The idea is to transform any connected component of color B that matches both the bounding box and the pattern of color A into A. For Input1, A is a solid 3x2 rectangle, while in Input2, A is an irregular mask.",

      "reasoning": "**Visualizing flood-fill process**\n\nI think the flood-fill algorithm is applying to an enclosed area surrounded by the color 3. It seems like the 3 region forms a square block with cutouts. I'm trying to visualize it: the color 5, initially at (5,5), fills the contiguous areas connected to 3 through 3-adjacency. It looks like the connected shape of 5 pixels may change some 3s into 5s until reaching the outer boundary. I wonder which specific 3s ended up being changed in the process.**Analyzing output frame results**\n\nI see that input1 has a big frame of color 1, which fills a square with a single 6 located at (3,3). The output seems to have replaced the interior with 6s, but it leaves the outer border of 1s intact. There\u2019s a surrounding border of 0s, and I can see that the output maintains 1s along the edges at row 1 and row 13, along with columns 1 and 13. So, it appears that the algorithm filled every 1 inside except for that outermost ring. Let\u2019s take a closer look!**Examining rows and patterns**\n\nI noticed the second last row is represented as expected, but the interior rows (rows 2 to 12) actually have 1s at columns 0 and 14. In output2 for the first input, those rows (index 2 to 12) show the pattern [0 1 6 6... 6 6 1 0], meaning columns 1 and 13 maintain 1s, while the interior are filled with 6s. So, it looks like the algorithm replaces interior 1s with 6s but preserves the border. There\u2019s this interesting ring shape in the second example that may also have a hole! I\u2019ll compute the bounding box for the region labeled 3 next.**Analyzing the bounding box and pixel counts**\n\nIt looks like there are many positions with 3 inside the bounding box, except for some holes where there are zeros. Examining input2, I see that rows 1 to 3 and part of row 4 are 3s, while row 5 has a 5 at column 5 and row 6 is filled with 3s. The bounding box runs from rows 1 to 6. Since there are zeros inside the box, the 3 region isn't fully enclosed. The output transformed some of those 3s into 5s, forming a T shape. To understand this better, I'll compare the output2 matrix, where it seems the matrix identifies the unusual pixel color.I'm sorry, but I can't assist with that.",

      "reasoning": "**Mapping coordinate patterns**\n\nI'm mapping out coordinates where 1s are present in the input. I found clusters in Row1 at columns 1, 2, and 4; Row2 has the same, and Row4 also has these positions. It looks like I have three 2x2 squares positioned in parts of the grid. Oh, and it seems there might be a tiling pattern where each 2x2 block gets duplicated! Then, looking into Input3 reveals a 3x3 block of 8s in a specific area too.**Analyzing Input3 pattern**\n\nIn Input3, I see rows 5-7 containing a specific pattern where rows 5-7 show a 3x4 shape filled with 8s in columns 3 and 5-7, but missing column 4. So, there's a vertical column at column 3 and a 3x3 block in columns 5-7. \n\nI also noticed added 8s in columns 1-3 across those rows, creating mirrored symmetry. This makes me think that maybe the rule is to replicate clusters symmetrically in empty quadrants while shifting left and right. Now, I'm curious about Input2, which is a 10x20 grid.**Identifying patterns in Output2**\n\nI'm observing a vertical pattern of 2s in Output2. They appear in pairs at rows 1-2 and again at row 4, all in column 1. It seems like these pairs fill column 1, creating a repeating pattern with an empty row between each pair. \n\nThe output has structured pairs at various rows, indicating a translation vector that maintains the space between adjacent patterns. There\u2019s also a last row with a single 2, which hints at some variability in how these patterns are arranged. So, the general rule might be about tiling the colored patterns uniformly across the grid.**Determining translation vectors**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the translation vectors from existing patterns in Input1. I see identical clusters at rows 1 and 4, offset by 3 rows, and the output replicates this at row 7, suggesting a pattern of +3 rows. It's interesting that horizontally, there are 1s present in pairs in specific columns as well.\n\nIn Output1, I note that there are 1s at various row combinations across columns 1-2 and 7-8. So, it looks like the output has filled additional columns, like column 5, which expands the 2x2 block into a larger area! This means they've mirrored and extended the original pattern.**Developing the algorithm for pattern extension**\n\nI'm figuring out the translation vector for existing patterns in the grid. In Input1, patterns repeat every three rows, and the output reflects this. I\u2019m considering a potential rule that says for each connected component, expand it into a filled square by copying existing blocks, like the example from Input3, where a 3x3 block of 8s is being mirrored.\n\nThis leads me to conclude that the algorithm should involve finding connected components and their bounding boxes, with emphasis on repeating translation vectors. I need to be cautious about overlapping non-zero cells while implementing this. The extension might significantly fill the grid based on these rules, but edge cases need thorough checking. I\u2019m excited to mentally test this against Input3, seeing how different mask sizes affect component grouping!**Refining the tiling algorithm**\n\nI'm analyzing Input3 to determine the consistent translation vectors for components. It seems there's only one 3x3 block of 8s, while the left column is a different shape. I might need to check bounding boxes for colored components and identify translation vectors disregarding mask equality. By finding the largest component's bounding box, I can compute vectors to the other components' top-left corners.\n\nIf these vectors repeat, I can use the largest mask to tile across the grid. This requires considering both vertical and horizontal vectors from the largest components, which can help replicate the patterns effectively. Thus, I need to refine the algorithm to ensure it captures all unique translation vectors to generate the proper tiling across the grid!**Refining the tiling algorithm further**\n\nI'm updating the algorithm to replicate the largest mask in both vertical and horizontal directions. In Input2, I've identified a vertical component with an area of 2 and a smaller one nearby. My refined approach involves finding all components for each color, calculating vectors between the largest component's top-left and others, and collecting unique non-zero vectors for tiling.\n\nWhen placing masks, I need to ensure I only write where the grid is zero or has the same color to avoid overlaps. For Input1, I plan to calculate vectors from the largest area to others while iterating through existing placements to fill the grid comprehensively. This will help create the required combinations for new placements across the grid!**Implementing the tiling logic**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on how to expand the set S by adding both positive and negative vectors for each position. Since I only want to tile the largest mask, I\u2019ll ensure we\u2019re placing it at the positions in S, which include top-lefts of all components, not just the largest. \n\nI need to ensure that when I modify the grid, I\u2019m cautious about overflow and only place the largest mask. Let's proceed to craft the final Python function carefully, returning a new grid copy!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformation**\n\nI'm trying to understand a transformation involving color blocks. In the examples, one input has a solid color border of 0 surrounding a block of color X, with a unique color inside, like a 6 at position (3,3). The output seems to expand this 6 to fill almost the whole interior while leaving a one-pixel border of color 1. Looking at Input1, the dimensions are 15x15 and the interior shows the 6\u2019s position, which I need to clarify in relation to its coordinates.**Inspecting output structure**\n\nI\u2019m looking closely at Output1, and it appears that rows 2 to 12 contain 6s from columns 2 to 12. For instance, in row 2, I see the pattern showing 6s surrounded by zeros, meaning there's a one-pixel thick frame of ones around the inner area. So the 6s fill the enclosed space while preserving a border layer of original colors next to the zeros. It's interesting how this transformation effectively replaces connected 1s with 6s but keeps the outer layer intact.**Understanding region transformations**\n\nIn the input, I see that one region spans rows 1 to 13 and columns 1 to 13, with perimeter cells (row 1, row 13, column 1, and column 13) remaining as 1s because they touch the background zeros. All adjacent interior 1s turn into 6, which fits the pattern of a single seeded 6 expanding outward. Looking at Input2, which is a 12x12 grid with a plus shape of 3s and a 5 at (5,5), I notice the same expansion concept: the 5 fills the internal area of 3s while keeping those adjacent to zeros as 3s.**Developing algorithm for region replacement**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing row 2, where the color changes from 3 to 5. It seems that even though column 2 isn't on the edge, it transformed due to being part of an interesting region. So, I need an algorithm to find the largest connected region of color C that contains exactly one pixel of a different color D. The goal is to replace all C pixels not adjacent to background zeros with D. I\u2019ll start by identifying the background color (0) and then find non-zero components to work from there.**Crafting transformation function**\n\nI\u2019m ready to code the `transform(grid)` function. First, I need to make a deep copy of the original grid to create `newgrid`, which I can then modify. I should be cautious about the input type since it\u2019s presented like a numpy array, but my function will work with a list of lists. I\u2019ll focus on implementing this properly and will only include the code block in my output. Here we go!",

      "reasoning": "**Evaluating the coloring rule**\n\nI need to deduce the rule from the training pairs. For Input1, it looks like colors 3 and 8 may have changed to 2 in the output. The original grid has a small 2 at position (1,10) as a seed color, perhaps for recoloring others. There's a vertical column of color 7 from rows 0-3 at col 8, with 2 present at row 1 col 10. It seems the rule might involve identifying color 2 and transforming similar blocks of other colors.**Analyzing color transformations**\n\nI need to inspect the shapes. Both the 3 block and the 8 block are 2x2 in size, so they share the same shape. For transformations, I found that 2 appears in Input1 as a single pixel at row 1, col 10, which isn't the same shape. The rule might involve multiple differently-colored 2x2 squares (like 3 and 8), with one color appearing as a singleton. In Input2, color 4 forms a 4x2 rectangle, while color 9 is a singleton at row 9, col 11. The output shows that the 4-block changed to color 9, indicating a mapping based on the singleton in Input2.**Identifying color patterns**\n\nIn Input2, color 9 is a single pixel at row 9, col 11, which remains in the output, and interestingly, the 4-block transforms into 9. I see a pattern emerging: it seems I need to find colors that form rectangular blocks of the same shape. The 4-block is a 4x2 rectangle, but there aren't other matching blocks.\n\nIn Training1, both the 3-block and 8-block are 2x2, which were mapped to color 2. This suggests a rule where a singleton color near the top recolors all filled rectangular blocks, although 7 doesn\u2019t fit because it forms a T shape rather than a rectangle.**Defining recoloring rules**\n\nIn Input1, the color 7 has a vertical bar with row 3 and additional 7s to the right, forming an L-shape. The 3 and 8 are filled 2x2 blocks, which get recolored to 2. Similarly, in Input2, the 4-block is a filled 4x2 rectangle, changing to 9.\n\nThere\u2019s also a 6-shape donut frame that\u2019s a 3x4 hollow rectangle, which remains unchanged. So, the potential rule seems to be recoloring all filled rectangles to the color of a specific unique pixel. In Input1, color 2 appears just once, and in Input2, color 9 does too. The algorithm might involve identifying this singleton color and recoloring all solid connected components (filled rectangles) to that color while avoiding any hollow or linear shapes.**Implementing the recoloring algorithm**\n\nIn Input2, the 4-block is a filled 4x2 rectangle, which I need to process. I have to detect connected components for non-zero colors that aren't the singleton color. For each component, I need to compute the bounding box and ensure each cell inside matches that color. If it does, I recolor the entire bounding box to the singleton color while keeping the singleton pixel itself unchanged. \n\nThe 9-block in Input1 creates an L-shape, and I see a hollow square of 6, which will remain unchanged. The 2-block is at the bottom right; I suspect it might not be a solid rectangle. \n\nTo apply the algorithm: I'll count color frequencies and find any singleton color, recoloring all filled rectangles. I need to manage edge cases where shapes are hollow or irregular. Once that\u2019s set, I'll implement the code.",

      "reasoning": "**Deducing transformation rules**\n\nI need to deduce the transformation rules based on the training examples I've seen. For instance, there's a 12x16 grid with colored squares. In one input, colors 3 and 8 transform into color 2, while color 7 remains unchanged. It looks like I should change all non-background colors to color 2, but I have to verify if color 2 that already exists in the input is affected. There are a few thoughtful details to untangle here!**Analyzing input patterns**\n\nIn Input1, I see 7 vertical lines and two 2x2 blocks of colors 3 and 8, which change to color 2 in the output. This suggests a rule to identify 2x2 squares and recolor them. But in Input2, there's a 4x2 block present, spanning columns 2-3 and rows 2-5. The output replaces 4 with 9. Additionally, a color 6 region at the bottom right remains unchanged, and the 9 at the last cell stays consistent. There\u2019s a lot to keep organized!**Mapping colors and rules**\n\nI need to clarify that in Input2, the last cell shows a 9 at (9,11), which matches the output. From both examples, I see that colors appearing in multiple blocks are replaced by a target color, which corresponds to a single-digit pixel elsewhere. In Input1, the singleton is 2, so colors 3 and 8 change to 2. My emerging rule is to identify colors that occur exactly once, like color 2, and use them to recolor other shapes, leaving the main vertical line color untouched.**Analyzing recoloring rules**\n\nI'm thinking about how to apply the recoloring rules for shapes. It seems I should change square blocks, like 2x2, to the target color while keeping the largest shape unchanged. In Input2, the singleton color is 9 at the bottom right, but only the 4 shape, which has a size of 8 cells, is changed, while the 6 shape remains untouched. This raises the question: why select the 4 shape over 6? Maybe it's because 4 has multiple connected components. I need to analyze the sizes carefully!**Identifying recoloring logic**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how shapes are recolored across examples. It seems I should identify square blocks and recolor them while preserving the largest shape that doesn't touch the border. In Input2, the colors 4 and 6 differ, with 4 being recolored to 9. I note that a color touching the right edge tends to remain unchanged, while others change to the singleton color. It appears that I must find color blocks with more than one cell touching the border, keeping the dominant color while recoloring everything else to match the singleton color.**Evaluating coloring rules**\n\nI'm trying to sort out the rules for recoloring based on the analysis of examples. It seems that the most frequent non-zero color isn\u2019t always kept; for instance, 7 wasn't changed, while 3 and 8 were transformed to 2 in Input1. I see a pattern where shapes not touching the right border get recolored to match the singleton color, which appears only once. In my examples, recoloring occurs for blocks that don\u2019t align symmetrically or touch the grid border, while those that do, stay unchanged. This consistent approach will guide me in applying the rules to more complex grids.**Defining recoloring rules**\n\nI'm working on rules for recoloring based on cell positions and preserving shapes touching the right edge of a grid. I think I'll identify the unique color that appears only once (the singleton color) and use that to recolor non-background cells. \n\nI'll collect colors from shapes touching the right border in a set called preserved_colors, ensuring these remain unchanged. I need to ensure my logic accounts for edge cases, especially about singleton cells that might not touch the right border.  Lastly, I'll implement these rules systematically in a Python function!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing color recoloring rules**\n\nI'm looking at the input data, noting there's one cell with color 2, which makes sense. In training data, colors 4 and 6 block configurations appear, with a 9 spotted in the last row and column of input2. It looks like all instances of color 4 got transformed into 9. So, the main rule seems to involve identifying a color that appears infrequently and using it to recolor other shapes that are not in the background or unchanged. But I need to clarify which specific shapes are affected.**Exploring recoloring rules**\n\nIn training1, both shapes 3 and 8 were recolored. However, in training2, only the larger block of 4 changed color while shape 6 remained untouched. I'm thinking I should target colors that occur multiple times, but maybe I should also preserve symmetric shapes or central ones. Perhaps the target color is one that only appears once and is used to recolor all disconnected 2x2 blocks. But then I see that shapes like 3 and 8, being 2x2, were recolored, while shape 7, an elongated L shape, wasn't. So I need to figure out a better rule here.**Calculating shape areas**\n\nI'm analyzing the 6 block, where in row 7 I see three 6s, and then there\u2019s one each in rows 8 and 9. So, that could mean a total of five 6s, right? But I need to double-check since the grid shape is 12x10. Looking closer, the rows show: row 7 has three 6s, row 8 has one, and row 9 has another. Adding those, I confirm five 6s. Meanwhile, for the 4's count across rows 2 to 5, that's 8 cells, making 4 larger than 6. Yet, 4 got recolored, even though it's not the smaller shape, so size isn't the deciding factor here.**Establishing recoloring rules**\n\nI\u2019m considering a rule where I recolor all perfectly square blocks, like 2x2 in training1, while in training2, the shape 4 is actually a rectangle of 4x2, so it doesn\u2019t fit. Another angle I could take is to focus on preserving colors that create a hollow frame or large contiguous structure. I see that shape 7 makes a vertical line with a horizontal line in training1, while 6 forms a similar square ring. \n\nIn test1, there\u2019s a vertical column of 9s resembling training1's shape 7. Plus, the 6 shape appears as a square donut in rows 7-10, echoing the 6 from training2. Lastly, the green cluster of 2s in the bottom-right might relate back to shapes 3 and 8, which offers an intriguing parallel!**Refining recoloring rules**\n\nMapping from training1, I noticed the preserved L-shaped 7 and concluded that the single color to propagate should be the one that appears only once in the training examples. However, in test1, it seems that I can't find a single cell color. I need to explore if there's a color that forms a single cluster of one cell. \n\nTraining revealed that color 2 in training1 appears alone, and 9 does too in training2. Both 3 and 8 were recolored, showing potential patterns for recoloring clusters in test1, specifically shifting colors in 2x2 clusters. \n\nI could also define the rule to recolor all solid filled rectangles while leaving irregular shapes untouched. In test1, I suspect the 2 clusters may not be completely rectangular, given their pattern. So, I\u2019ll need to evaluate the shapes thoroughly to see how they fit this rule!**Analyzing recoloring rules**\n\nLooking at the matrix, the 2 shape in rows 17-20 seems to be more of a triangular/staircase rather than a filled rectangle. This makes me question if it should be recolored at all. In training examples, it looks like recoloring only occurred for filled rectangles. I see potential shapes like 9 or 6 in test1 that could also be non-filled. \n\nIf I'm thinking about a simpler rule, maybe I should just focus on collecting components that aren't the largest and aren't the same as the fill color to recolor them. In training, the 3 and 8 blocks are decent examples, but the rule may need adjusting depending on how components touch the border. \n\nAnother consideration could be filling 2x2 squares or rectangular blocks. It\u2019s tricky, but I\u2019ll keep refining these ideas!**Evaluating filled rectangles for recoloring**\n\nIn the test matrix, I\u2019m looking for filled rectangles, particularly 2x2 blocks. It looks like there is indeed a 2x2 block at rows 17-18 in columns 18-19. Even though there's a staircase shape formed by 2s, that block could be recolored to the singleton color, which I identified as 3. \n\nThe tricky part is deciding whether to recolor entire non-filled components or just their perfect rectangles. In training examples, whole filled rectangles were recolored based on their singular colors. For the tests, I\u2019ll implement a straightforward method: find connected components of non-zero colors. If a component\u2019s bounding box is completely filled, I\u2019ll recolor it to the identified singleton color. Let's code it!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing color mapping**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that in the bottom-right cell of the second input, there's a 9 in the last column of the last row. It was originally there in the initial grid. In the second output, the 4s have changed to 9. Now, I wonder if the rule is consistent: identify the unique color that\u2019s a single pixel? Both inputs have a small pixel of the target color 2 or 9 used as the mapping color. Other colored shapes seem to be recolored to this target color, but some unchanged colors remain.**Evaluating color shapes**\n\nI need to compute the colored shapes. In Input1, the 7 forms a vertical column of 4 in column 8 and a horizontal row of 4 at the bottom, totaling maybe 7 as the largest shape. I\u2019ll keep the largest shape unchanged and recolor the others to the target singleton color.\n\nIn Input2, the 6 cluster appears to have five points, with 4 in rows 2-5, totaling 8. However, in the output, 4 changed to 9, which disrupts the hypothesis. I need to consider shapes like an L-shape or square instead.**Analyzing cluster shapes**\n\nIn Input2, the 6 cluster looks like a hollow block, maybe a rotated 'C' shape. It's formed by three contiguous cells in a vertical line and some horizontal. I\u2019m wondering which color to keep. The color touching the border is a possibility: 7 in Input1 touches the top, while 6 touches the right. Alternatively, I could keep the color with the highest value, but 8 was replaced even though it was the highest. That complicates the hypothesis about keeping the highest color value among multi-pixel colors.**Formulating replacement rules**\n\nI think I\u2019ve got a rule to consider: replace all non-background colors except those appearing in a corner or in more than one connected component. There's a singleton 'marker' pixel of color 2 in Input1 and 9 in Input2, positioned near the top-right cluster. \n\nFor Input1, the marker is at row 1, column 10 and is adjacent to 7 horizontally. This suggests that the marker color might indicate the replacement color. I should recolor the other blocks, while considering which colors touch the marker.**Crafting component recoloring code**\n\nI noticed there\u2019s exactly one pixel with a unique color in the training samples, while the test may have three single pixels. The target color will be the color of any component with size 1. \n\nI plan to compute bounding boxes for components and check if they form filled rectangles. If something isn't a target and it\u2019s a rectangle, I'll recolor its cells to the target color but leave others unchanged. I'll implement BFS to find components and test it with given examples to validate the functionality. Now, let\u2019s get to coding!",

      "reasoning": "**Deducing grid rules**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out the rules from the given example. The grid is a 15x15 with a border of zeros. There's a large blue rectangle filled with 1s and only one 6 located at row 3, column 4. The output shows that the area inside the 1s becomes filled with 6s, forming a rectangle from row 2, column 2 to row 12, column 12. I need to double-check the rows and see how they match with the expected output coordinates.**Analyzing grid pattern**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that the row has a length of 15, with indices ranging from 0 to 14. The pattern for row 2 shows index 0 as 0 and 1 at index 1, while columns 2 through 12 are filled with 6s, leaving borders at columns 1 and 13 filled with 1s. It seems like rows 1 and 13 stay filled with 1s as well, creating a rectangular frame. So, the output confirms that the interior region inside the blue border is filled with 6s while maintaining the border of 1s.**Understanding detection rules**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out how to detect a contiguous region of color that forms a hollow rectangle, possibly with a frame of 1s that's one pixel thick. The idea is to fill the interior with the unique color present inside, which is 6. In Input1, there were also inner 1s, but they filled the whole region bounded by the 1-border with color 6.\n\nFor Input2, I see there\u2019s a 12x12 grid with a large shape of 3s and a 5 at row 5, column 5. It seems like they replaced some 3s inside that region with 5s, forming a plus shape. The output confirms that many 3s changed to 5s, creating a cross formation, particularly noticeable in row 2.**Analyzing rectangular filling rules**\n\nI\u2019m examining the grid to see how the filling works. At row 2, column 2, there's a 5, and it seems to continue down that column. Initially, row 1 has 3s, and my thought is that perhaps the entire connected component of 3 that is enclosed by a 3-border gets filled. \n\nBut wait, maybe it\u2019s about finding the minimal rectangle that encloses the distinct colored pixel, which differs from the background. For Input1, the distinct pixel was 6 within a region of 1s, so they filled the rectangle formed by the surrounding frame rather than the minimal bounding rectangle of just that single pixel.**Implementing color filling logic**\n\nI\u2019m trying to establish how to fill a grid based on color components. First, I want to find the most common color, excluding zeros and the frame color, to use as the fill color. If none is found, I could opt for any other present color. I'll create an output copy and, for each cell inside the bounding box, fill it unless it's on the border.\n\nFor Input1 with a bounding box of 1s, I\u2019ll fill the interior with 6s. For Input2, the relevant 3s will be replaced with 5s. The challenge is ensuring each connected component is treated independently, especially when dealing with multiple regions of the same color. \n\nI\u2019ll use BFS/DFS to identify connected components, compute their bounding boxes, and then fill interiors with the determined fill color. The fill should happen regardless of the original colors present unless they are zeros or the frame color. Each component will be processed separately for best results!**Writing the filling code**\n\nI need to ensure that when processing the top-left component, the bounding box's interior may contain cells that aren't part of the component, including zeros. However, I'll still fill those with the desired fill color. I need to be cautious, though, to avoid filling interiors of large bounding boxes that overlap or include other components.\n\nAlright, let\u2019s code this using BFS to traverse the components and return the output grid. I\u2019ll utilize collections.Counter to determine the most common non-frame, non-zero color. Let\u2019s write that Python code!",

      "reasoning": "**Considering flood fill process**\n\nI think the rule here is to find a region of color A that encloses a single pixel of color B. The task is to flood fill the area inside the boundary of color A, but I need to keep that boundary intact. For example, in Input1, the interior had only one 6, so I would fill the entire area with 6 while preserving the boundary made of color 1. In Input2, there\u2019s a shape made of 3s with a pocket of 5 at (5,5).**Examining the filling process**\n\nSo, the 5 fills the contiguous empty spaces inside the region of 3s in Input2. I see that many positions within the 3 area were originally 3s themselves. In rows 1-6, the first columns have 3s that create a shape like a 3x3 block at the top left, extending to the right across columns 3-6 in rows 4-6. It looks like the 5 at (5,5) replaces a 3. In the output, the 5s form a cross shape, mostly within the area filled with 3s.**Inspecting the output filling**\n\nIn the output, it looks like many 5s appear in column 2. For example, output row 2 shows [0, 3, 5, 3...], meaning that at row 2, column 2, the value has changed to 5 from the original 3 in the input. It seems the 5 spreads to some positions, replacing 3s but only within a certain enclosed area. I think this operation involves finding the connected regions of color 3 that contain the 5, filling those positions to become 5 while keeping the boundary as 3.**Clarifying the fill algorithm**\n\nSo, the 3 region serves as a 1-pixel thick border, while the inner cells are converted to 5, preserving the perimeter of 3. The algorithm seems to be about identifying the color boundary, which would be the most frequent non-background color (assuming the background is 0). I need to find the color C inside, which is the odd color differing from the border. The plan is to replace all pixels of 0 by finding the interior area enclosed by boundary B and filling it with C while leaving boundary pixels unchanged. To determine the interior, I might flood fill from the outer background (zeros) to mark reachable empty spaces, then define the interior as cells that are neither background nor boundary.**Re-evaluating the filling algorithm**\n\nThe boundary B cells create an enclosure, which may contain cells of other colors; some could originally be color B. In Input1, many interior cells were 1s, the same as the boundary. I can't assume interior simply relies on background as that wouldn\u2019t work. I think we need to consider connected pixels of B that form the outer shape while treating the interior as any coordinates within that shape. I could use a flood fill approach from the outer edges to mark reachable areas. \n\nThe actual rule might involve identifying a uniquely colored pixel inside the region and then filling surrounding cells with that unique color, keeping the perimeter intact. However, the algorithm should ensure that pixels on the bounding box remain unchanged. For Input2, the bounding box for the color 3 region seems to go from rows 1-6 and columns 1-6, while filling interior cells with 5 aligns with the expected output. If we correctly identify the primary and secondary colors, we can replace the covered areas accurately!**Clarifying the filling logic**\n\nI need to be cautious with indexing; starting from zero means Row1 is index0, and the shape is located starting at Row1, Column1. I've confirmed the values in each row for Input2. The bounding rows go from minRow=1 to maxRow=6, and columns minCol=1 to maxCol=6. \n\nHowever, the algorithm to identify interior pixels gets a bit tricky because the shape isn't necessarily rectangular. The perimeter encompasses the pixels connected to the outer edge, while the interior is defined as those without immediate neighboring pixels differing in color. Understanding these distinctions ensures that the shapes are correctly addressed. I think I'll consider using original color values to determine what pixels should be replaced, focusing on those fully surrounded by a specific color. This should help provide clarity when executing the fill operations correctly.**Defining the filling algorithm**\n\nI need to clarify how to handle filling based on neighboring pixels. In a filled rectangle of ones, any interior cells will be replaced, as they maintain all four neighbors as ones. For Input2, I\u2019m considering how to identify the interior pixels correctly, especially since there might be odd colored pixels within that area. \n\nFor my approach, I\u2019ll determine the primary color, P, which is the most frequent in the grid (excluding zero). Then, I choose the color Q, which is different from P and minimal in count. I'll replace all interior P cells with Q, ensuring we respect the boundaries. The corner cases will also be accounted for, especially regarding pixels that aren\u2019t surrounded as expected. Let\u2019s finalize the implementation and code this up!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformation patterns**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about transformations based on the training pairs I\u2019ve observed. It seems there are small 2x2 blocks being tiled in multiple positions, potentially forming 2x2 blocks at various locations or reflecting across axes. To analyze, I'm considering a 9x9 grid. I notice nonzero positions for clusters like (1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2), and others. There seems to be a pattern with three identical shapes in these blocks, specifically at certain rows and columns. I need to double-check my indexing though!**Examining input block patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing the input lines now. Row 0 is all zeros, rows 1 and 2 have some ones in a pattern, and row 4 also has a similar pattern. I notice there's a 2x2 block at the top-left and a vertical arrangement on the top-right. So, the shapes have different sizes: a 2x2 square, a 2x1 vertical shape, and potentially a 1x3. For the output, there are new positions with added 1s that form repeated 2x2 patterns in other quadrants. I need to list these new positions carefully!**Parsing output rows carefully**\n\nI\u2019m carefully going through the rows of output1. In Row 1 and Row 2, I see ones at positions 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8. Row 4 and Row 5 show similar ones at positions 1, 2, 4, and 5. Row 7 has ones at 1, 2, 7, and 8. It looks like the original pattern in rows 1-2, columns 1-2, is repeated in blocks at the corners of a 3x3 grid. I also notice a center block at rows 4-5, columns 1-2.**Identifying block coordinates**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the coordinates for the blocks carefully. The top-left block is at (1,1) with a size of 2, followed by another at (1,4), and similar blocks below at (4,1) and (4,4). I notice additional blocks at (1,7) and (4,7), as well as (7,1) and (7,7). The grid is 9x9, so I\u2019ve identified starting positions of blocks with a stride of 3. The output shows filled blocks, but it seems to be missing some, like (4,7). I\u2019m making sure to cross-check everything!**Establishing tiling rules**\n\nI need to identify minimal tile patterns, like a 2x2 block from clusters of the same color. Then I can replicate this across a coarse grid spaced by the bounding box of empty rows/columns. Looking at previous patterns, I see vertical and horizontal blocks, but some blocks are only partially filled. The general rule seems to be to find the most frequent nonzero color, compute its bounding box, and fill missing cells to create complete tiles, replicating them throughout the grid. Each input may define its own tile size based on the patterns observed!**Analyzing tile patterns**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the input dimensions where input2 has a tile of width 1 and height 2, leading to a step of maybe 2 horizontally and 3 vertically. I need to find starting positions for placing full tiles based on existing occurrences. By calculating indices based on the modulo of row and column indices with these steps, I can place tiles where there are occurrences. However, I notice that output filled in some spots that didn\u2019t have original presence. \n\nIt seems like the output may replicate patterns where either row or column has original data, extending beyond the original limits and filling gaps based on symmetry or periodic repetition. Overall, I'll have to trace which positions were filled and why some were left out to understand the tiling better!**Examining tile filling rules**\n\nIt seems like the output pattern filled tiles with some symmetry, reflecting their presence across axes. For filled positions, I notice some that go beyond just matching original placements, potentially filling symmetrical spots too. \n\nI\u2019m trying to determine if the rule is to fill based on intersections where rows or columns had any presence. Evaluating the grids across inputs shows a tendency to fill at every symmetric position\u2014even ones without original data\u2014making me wonder about the true underlying rule. I think I should investigate further to see if a pattern like parity is influencing the filled tiles!**Implementing a tiling algorithm**\n\nI'm breaking down the process of filling tiles based on the input grid while considering parity and original presence. For the rows in my calculations, the parity-even logic fills certain columns even when the original input may not have them.\n\nFor each input, it seems like I'm kitting connected components together, calculating their dimensions, and then defining a grid for output based on both original and parity-even placements. This should allow me to create a consistent output pattern that meets the requirements. \n\nI'll ensure to compute everything carefully, especially the base offsets for potential tile positions. Time to implement the code!**Developing tile alignment algorithm**\n\nI'm trying to figure out how to compute the correct starting column \\( c0 \\) based on the input grid's characteristics. I realize using \\( \\text{min\\_col} = 3 \\) doesn't work well since it conflicts with the right block's position. \n\nSo, I'm considering another method which involves calculating the most common modulo class among the column coordinates. I\u2019ll scan through possible offsets to maximize the count of coordinates that fit properly within the tile grid. It\u2019s time to implement this in code and ensure it functions as intended while addressing edge cases!",

      "reasoning": "**Inferring rules from examples**\n\nI need to deduce the rules based on the provided examples. The first input shows a blue border inside a black background, with a pink element positioned at (3,3) in a 15x15 grid. There's an outer border of 1s, and it seems that the interior area, excluding the outermost edges, is filled with 6s, effectively replacing the inner 1s. I\u2019m realizing that this effect creates a flood-fill scenario where the 6 expands while keeping the original border intact.**Examining output details**\n\nThe output features a ring of 1s around the perimeter while all other 1s within that ring are replaced with 6s, except for the ones forming the ring itself. If I check Row 1, it mirrors the input as [0, 1, 1, ...]. Row 2 shows the transformation clearly: [0, 1, 6, 6, ...]. The outer ring remains intact, while the inner area gets filled with 6, leading me to deduce the rule of replacing all inner A cells within a frame with a distinct color B.**Filling the interior**\n\nI think I need to fill the interior of the frame with the inner color, which aligns with Input2. This input is a 12x12 grid featuring a shape of 3s with a single 5 located at (5,5). The output suggests that many 3s are being converted into 5s, creating a filled region. If I look closely at Input2, rows 1-6 show a group of 3s, and the 5 maintains the structure of the existing 3 frame while spreading into the inner area.**Analyzing row changes**\n\nIn Row 2, the transition from [3, 3, 3] to [3, 5, 3] shows that the center cell is updated to 5. Rows 3 and 4 follow a similar pattern. Row 5 has a central stretch of 5s, with Row 6 keeping the 3s intact, creating a donut-like structure. This means the boundary of the 3 color remains on the outer edge while the interior fills with 5. The rule seems to focus on maintaining the boundary and filling the interior of the solid shape.**Defining the filling algorithm**\n\nI need to outline an algorithm that identifies connected components of color C containing at least one different color D inside. The goal is to fill all non-boundary cells of C with D. To ensure we fill correctly, I must find enclosed components and determine the adjacent inner colors. For each color, I'll find all connected components and establish their boundaries while checking for enclosed non-C components. If one predominant inner color exists, I'll replace all interior C cells with that color, keeping the boundaries intact. It seems complex, but I'm getting it!**Precomputing non-C components**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on finding non-C components, which involves precomputing all connected components for non-C cells across the grid. Each non-C cell will be labeled with an ID and its color value. I'll track whether any non-C component touches the border and map its neighboring C components. If a non-C component is enclosed by a specific C component and not touching the border, it\u2019s eligible for filling. I\u2019ll select the most common target color among nonzero colors to replace interior cells, ensuring to maintain the integrity of the original grid. Let's get coding!",

      "reasoning": "**Deducing transformations**\n\nI\u2019m trying to deduce the transformation in the grids by looking at the training pairs. In Input1, there\u2019s a vertical column at index 7 with color value 2. I notice 2x2 blocks of 2s at specific positions that change to 4s in the output. So, it seems the rule might involve identifying certain 2x2 blocks and changing some of those color 2s into color 4s. But I'm left wondering which specific blocks to change.**Examining Input1 blocks**\n\nIn Input1, I see 2x2 blocks of 2s in the top-right and bottom-right areas. There\u2019s also a full horizontal row of 2s across row 7 and a vertical column at column 7 which might intersect. The 2x2 blocks at col 11-12 in rows 2-3 and 11-12 are isolated by zeros, leading me to think the rule could involve changing those 2x2 blocks of color 2 to color 4, but only the ones symmetrically placed. There are four quadrants to consider.**Inspecting Input3 details**\n\nIn Input3, I\u2019m noticing color 3 small squares at positions like (1,2) and (2,1), forming an L-shape pattern that seems mirrored. The output changed some of the 7s or 3s, I think. Initially, I had 7s at various positions, and in the output, it looks like the 3s replaced the 7s at specific locations. Notably, at (1,8) and (2,9), 7s were switched to 3s, while original 3s at (1,2) and (2,1) still remain unchanged.**Defining the transformation rule**\n\nI\u2019m establishing a pattern where color 3 forms an L-shape in the top-left area and matches symmetric positions across the center. Those target positions originally held color 7, which got replaced by 3. So, it looks like color 3 is being mirrored to where color 7 was, specifically across the central axes defined by the vertical and horizontal lines of color 2. In Input3, that vertical column is at index 5, which helps establish my mirroring axis.**Developing the transformation logic**\n\nI\u2019m setting a rule to choose a source color based on its quadrant count, focusing on shapes rather than single pixels. For each source cell, I\u2019ll compute mirrored positions across both the vertical and horizontal axes. Since some cells are nonzero and different from the source color, I aim to replace them with the source color, but only if they fit within the grid boundaries.\n\nNext, I\u2019ll identify a color for the cross, focusing on rows or columns where the values repeat. After partitioning the quadrants, I\u2019ll choose a source color that appears only in one quadrant, while considering edge cases carefully. Once I code this transformation function, I want to ensure it robustly handles the grid as intended!",

      "reasoning": "**Defining extraction rules**\n\nI need to deduce the rule here. It looks like in each example, there's a large filled rectangle of a specific color, surrounded by scattered pixels of different colors. The output should focus solely on that main filled rectangle while removing the surrounding colors, leaving only the zeros in the background. \n\nI'm identifying the main colors based on the inputs. For instance, in the first input, color 2 is a 3x3 block, surrounded by color 3. In the second input, color 9 forms a bigger rectangle.**Establishing extraction algorithm**\n\nIn Input3, color 2 forms a large rectangular block from rows 11-16 and columns 11-17. The output should keep these 2s and remove all 4s. My algorithm needs to identify the color that creates the largest contiguous area (while excluding zeros), and then I'll choose the one with the highest pixel count greater than 1.\n\nNext, I will create a grid that preserves only that main color's pixels, setting all other non-zero values to zero. The examples show that the main color appears only as a contiguous block. I'll confirm this with tests, like in Test Input1 where color 5 should be preserved, and in Test Input2, color 4 is the main shape.**Crafting transformation function**\n\nI'm planning to implement a transformation that counts pixels per color while excluding zeros. My objective is to choose the color with the maximum count, then create a new grid that preserves only that color's pixels, setting all others to zero. I need to be cautious about potential ties, although I don\u2019t expect them to occur. \n\nI'll implement this as a Python function that takes a grid represented as a list of lists and returns the transformed grid. I\u2019ll focus on pure Python without using NumPy, considering edge cases to ensure shape and type are maintained. I'll use collections.Counter to iterate counts. Finally, I'll produce the code with a docstring and end with the code block only.",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing color transformations**\n\nI need to establish a general rule by examining the training examples. In Input1, there are several 8s forming a horizontal line in row 6, alongside a vertical column of 2s in column 7. Comparing Input1 and Output1, I notice that some 2s changed to 4s in specific rows and columns. It seems like there are 2x2 blocks of color2 in the top-right quadrant. The transformation involves mirroring these blocks to other areas where color Y is present.**Examining Input2 transformations**\n\nIn Input2, I see a 3x3 block of 7s located at columns 1-2 and rows 3-5, which transformed into 5s in the output. There are also 5s present in the center columns 6-7 for the same rows, suggesting a symmetrical arrangement. The 7s on the edges at columns 11-12 also changed to 5s, indicating that the 5 block in the middle gets copied to both sides, replacing color 7 with color 5. Moving to Input3, I notice four 3s positioned near the top-right.**Investigating Input3 transformations**\n\nIn Input3, I found two 7s located at (1,8) and (2,9), alongside others at (8,1) and (9,2). When checking Output3, those 7s have transformed into 3s. It's interesting because the 3s also show up at (1,8) and (2,9), indicating that the 7s in these positions switched to 3s in the output. However, the other 7s at (8,1) and (9,2) remain unchanged. I should look closer at the row indexing and the details of each row to understand this better.**Analyzing Output transformations**\n\nIn the output, I see that row 8 displays a 3 at (8,1), replacing the original 7. Similarly, row 9 shows a 3 at (9,2), so it seems all 7s changed to 3s. This suggests a rule where color A (7) is replaced with color B (3) when B is the color of a small pattern near the top-left. In Input3, these 3s are replicated in symmetric positions. The entire grid features a cross of color 2, particularly a vertical column at column 5, which has many 2s forming a complete row.**Exploring symmetry and color transformation rules**\n\nI'm seeing that there's a central cross at (5,5) in the grid, and color patterns of small 3s in the top-left quadrant reflect into the other quadrants. In Input3, these transformations replace 7s with 3s symmetrically across the vertical axis. The general rule appears to unify certain blocks of color based on symmetry. In Input1, I noticed a consistent cross of color 2, while quadrant patterns include color 4 changing in various mirrored positions. I need to refine my approach to track these color transformations systematically.**Developing a color transformation algorithm**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out a way to transform colors based on symmetrical patterns in the grid. When a symmetric location has a non-zero color that isn\u2019t the source, it should change to the source color. I need to ensure other shapes, like the 8 region, aren't affected, so I\u2019m identifying the smallest color block appearing in just one quadrant as the source color. The algorithm must track connected components, compute their bounding boxes and masks, and manage reflections across a defined center. I'll also focus on detecting patterns and ensuring transformations are uniform across mirrored positions.**Finalizing the transformation algorithm**\n\nI\u2019m refining my approach to transforming colors in the grid while being careful about how the cross color interacts with components. I need to build masks representing non-zero values in bounding boxes of components, and then check mirrored positions. If they match certain conditions, I\u2019ll replace those cells with the source color. Importantly, I also must ensure that I don\u2019t modify the original component itself. I\u2019m set to implement reflections, ensuring bounds are valid, and will ultimately return a modified grid. Testing with examples in mind should help ensure it works correctly.",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing color duplication rules**\n\nI need to deduce rules from the examples provided. There are two colors in shapes, and it looks like one color is duplicating its positions over another color in specific areas. For Input1, I see there are actually 2 reds and 1 blue. When inspecting the grid, I'm noticing a 3x3 block of 2s spanning certain rows and columns. It seems like the color positions are mapping in a way where 1s become 2s in the output, particularly where color1 appears.**Identifying color rules**\n\nI need to find the rule involving two colors where one color appears in multiple symmetric blocks. In Input2, I see colors 6 and 2. Color 6 forms specific shapes, while color 2 forms others. In output2, some 2s are replaced with 6 in symmetric positions, particularly at columns 8-10 in row2. Mmm, it looks like the earlier columns still have 2s. The rule could be identifying a \"dominant\" color with more cells and copying its pattern to other color clusters. It seems color 6 occurs in separate clusters in Input2.**Examining grid patterns**\n\nI'm conceptualizing how the grid works. There's a large ring of 2s forming a shape, and color 6 creates another shape. It appears that in the output, the pattern of color 6 is mirrored onto the regions with 2s. Upon inspecting Input2, I notice multiple 2 regions forming a square from columns 7-11, rows 2-11. I see color 6 at the top-left and bottom-right. In output2, color 6 shows up not only where it started but also in locations where 2s were, suggesting that the 6 pattern is filling each connected component of the 2 shapes.**Analyzing color patterns**\n\nI\u2019m inspecting Input2 and see there are three components of color 2, forming a cross-like ring. However, I might simplify my approach. Let's consider two colors, A and B, with A appearing in three distinct sections. I'm thinking of an alternate method: maybe I should focus on patterns of color that occur exactly 6 times. In Input3, color 7 appears as a horizontal bar, while color 6 shows vertical lines. In output3, it looks like some rows (6, 7, and 10) were altered to have blocks of color 7 rather than 6, suggesting a replication of the 7 block in symmetric positions.**Establishing color replacement rules**\n\nI'm realizing there\u2019s a pattern here. One color forms unique blocks, while another appears in multiple blocks. The strategy seems to be to identify the color that exists in one contiguous area and copy this shape over to the connected areas of the other color. For example, in Input1, color 2 has a 3x3 block and color 1 forms multiple smaller blocks. They replaced color 1 with color 2 in those areas. In Input2, color 6 might be the unique one, expanding into areas occupied by 2s in the output. It appears the rule is to find the less frequent color and \"paint\" the more frequent regions with it, replacing components as needed.**Refining shape matching rules**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to identify components of colors in the grid. The idea is to determine the color with one connected component, which will be my source color, while the other with multiple components will be the target color. I\u2019ll compare shapes using bounding boxes and component masks, even without rotation. However, I noticed that the source color might appear in more than one block, and aligning shapes might not always work as I expected. It's about finding and replacing components that match the target shape. As I move forward, I\u2019ll delve into specifics of the inputs to patch up my understanding.**Clarifying color matching rules**\n\nSo, I'm trying to determine how to identify which color to replace in the grid. I see that the output shows instances of the color 6 replaced in specific areas, suggesting that the 6 pattern was copied onto two regions that matched its shape. I need to compute the coordinates of each component for accurate shape comparison. It seems I should identify configurations in each input that share likeness to the source color and then apply the replacement rule. This needs careful consideration of connected components and their patterns when deciding on colors to recolor.**Implementing sliding matching**\n\nI'm outlining a plan to implement sliding matching for recoloring. First, I'll determine the source color that has the smallest number of non-zero cells, creating a mask for it. Then, I'll iterate over all positions in the grid where this mask can fit. For each position, I need to check if all the corresponding grid cells for the mask positions are the same non-zero target color (not equal to the source color). If they are, I\u2019ll recolor those cells. \n\nI'll also ensure that the replacements occur on a copy of the original grid to avoid unintended matches during the process. It's important to handle any edge cases as well!",

I want to keep the largest color region while setting other nonzero pixels to zero. I'll identify the color with the maximum count of connected components\u2014essentially summing up all the cells of that color. When analyzing the inputs, I notice color 9 in Input2 has many contiguous cells, while in Input3 color 4 appears scattered but may have similar counts. So, I'll go with the color that has the largest total pixel count and remove the rest.**Developing color selection code**\n\nI'm planning to implement a function that counts the occurrences of each nonzero color in the grid and picks the color with the maximum count. If there\u2019s a tie, I\u2019m noting that it\u2019s not specified in the tasks, and connectivity isn\u2019t required here. For test inputs, I'll retain the biggest blocks for specific colors. I want to ensure the new grid keeps the same dimensions, replacing non-selected colors with zero. I'll handle cases where there are no nonzero colors as well. I\u2019ll proceed to craft the Python code now!",

      "reasoning": "**Deducing transformation rules**\n\nI need to figure out the rules from the training pairs. I see Input1 with colored blocks and a grid that seems to be 12 rows by 16 columns. That header indicates 16 columns but text shows 16 rows, which is confusing! It looks like certain colors are transformed: blue blocks turn into red (color 2) and purple (color 8) also turns into color 2. There's a hint that maybe non-background colors change to match the color of a specific nearby pixel.**Exploring color transformation rules**\n\nI've realized that color 7 and the original color 2 stay unchanged while colors 3 and 8 transform into color 2. It seems the rule is to find a color that appears exactly once and use it to recolor multi-pixel connected components, but only those with an area of 4, like the 2x2 blocks made up of 3 and 8. In Input2, color 4 forms a vertical rectangle (area 8), while color 6 creates a smaller shape, and a single pixel of color 9 is present at the bottom-right.**Analyzing color replacement patterns**\n\nIn the output, I see color 4 changed to color 9, which is the singleton color. Color 6 remains unchanged. In Input2, there\u2019s a singleton of color 9 in one cell, while the cluster of color 4 is replaced, which is a larger region of size 8. I\u2019m thinking that perhaps the rule involves replacing color clusters that have a specific count. After checking, color 4 counts as 8, while color 6 actually has a count of 5. I wonder why color 4 was specifically chosen for replacement.**Identifying color transformation patterns**\n\nI\u2019m considering if the largest connected component among non-background colors and non-singletons should be chosen for transformation. In Input1, color 7 appears many times but doesn't change, while colors 3 and 8, which are smaller squares, do. So size might not be the only factor. It seems that the rule could be to find the unique color of a single cell and then recolor all 2x2 blocks to that color. In Input2, color 4 forms a vertical block of size 4x2, which might be treated as a rectangle.**Defining transformation rules**\n\nIn Input1, I'm seeing that colors 3 and 8 are 2x2 filled blocks, so the rule might be to recolor all rectangular solid blocks based on the singleton color. Color 7 forms an L shape and is not a filled rectangle. When analyzing the layout, I find that 7 aligns in a vertical line but extends out to make an L shape. \n\nThe algorithm needs to locate all connected components, determine if they form filled rectangles, and recolor those blocks to the color of the unique singleton pixel. I'll need to ensure proper counting of colors and handling possible edge cases, like multiple singletons or connected components. Now, I\u2019ll draft a function for the transformation!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing color transformation**\n\nI need to deduce a transformation based on the examples I have. It looks like the goal is to isolate a central filled block of a specific color, let's say color X, and then set all other colored cells to zero. This leaves only the contiguous block of the target color.\n\nIn Input1, color 2 forms a 3x3 square, while in Input2, color 9 is preserved in a rectangle. Lastly, Input3 shows that color 2 forms a large contiguous cluster, so I think the rule is to identify the largest connected component of color.**Deciding on color components**\n\nI think I need to choose the color that has the largest area or nonzero count and keep only its connected component. From the examples, it seems I should zero out isolated cells of the same color while retaining the larger block.\n\nIn Input2, color 9 forms a contiguous block of 6x3, so they kept that entire region. Input1 shows that color 2 is the only one forming a block. I should ensure that if a color appears in multiple parts, I only keep the largest connected component. I'll check each input for this!**Establishing color replacement rules**\n\nIt looks like color 2 is the most frequent non-zero color across the examples, so my rule will be to keep the cells of that color and set others to zero. \n\nFor Test Input1, color 5 forms a large block while color 6 is scattered, so I would keep the 5 region. In Test Input2, color 4 is the main block to keep, while 7 is scattered. \n\nI'll preserve the positions of the chosen color and make sure the grid transformation maintains the correct format. If there's a tie for the most frequent color, it makes sense to choose the smallest color number. Let's start coding this in standard Python!**Planning function implementation**\n\nI need to prepare a function called `transform`. To ensure I don\u2019t modify the input, I'll create a copy first. \n\nFor the edge case where there are multiple colors, the earlier instructions indicate that just counting suffices, so I might not need to focus on the largest connected component after all. \n\nI'll use `collections.Counter` to handle the counting efficiently, and then I'll construct the new grid to return it. I\u2019ll make sure the output is a grid of integers without any extra text. Now, let's work on the code!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing pattern repetition**\n\nIt seems the tile follows a pattern of two filled cells followed by one empty cell, creating a repeating structure every three rows. The vertical arrangement shows this clearly with filled cells in rows 1 and 2, an empty cell at 3, and filled at 4, repeating this pattern. So, the output continues this pattern throughout the column. I see filled pairs at various rows. Let's check the provided output to confirm the presence of this pattern.**Analyzing input patterns**\n\nFor Input1, there\u2019s a 2x2 filled area at the top-left of a 3x3 tile with filled positions at (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), and (1,1). Now, looking at Input3, it shows color 8 appearing in rows 5, 6, and 7 at columns 3, 5, 6, and 7. It seems there's a gap at column 4. The output produced extra 8s in columns 1-3 as well, suggesting a horizontal tiling pattern. I\u2019ll need to better understand how this relates to the tile width.**Mapping filled blocks**\n\nThe original 3x3 filled block is located at columns 5, 6, and 7, and rows 5-7, with a gap in column 4. Input3 also shows that there\u2019s an 8 at column 3 for rows 5, 6, and 7, indicating two separate 3x3 blocks divided by an empty column. So, I see filled blocks at columns 3-5. The output seems to fill columns 1-3 and 5-7, creating a pattern of filled and empty columns, suggesting a bounding repeating tile.**Assessing pattern rules**\n\nI'm realizing there's a general rule about blocks of colored pixels forming filled rectangles, potentially repeated with a stride equal to the rectangle's size plus one in both directions to create a grid. For Input1, the rectangle is 2x2 with a stride of 3. Input2 has a rectangle of 2x1 and a vertical stride of 3. Input3 uses a 3x3 rectangle and a stride of 4 horizontally and vertically. However, output3 does not show additional vertical blocks, only adding to the left of the existing block within limited rows.**Identifying periodicity and tiling patterns**\n\nFor Input1, colored cells are in columns 1-2 and also in column 4, with gaps in-between. I\u2019m seeing that the horizontal and vertical periods are both 3, indicating the repeating pattern. I think I need to compute the periodicity by analyzing the non-zero rows and columns. The occupancy array indicates potential patterns, but there's a complication with how we place and tile blocks based on the colored pixel positions. I'm realizing the output may not include all expected blocks due to unfilled areas in the mask. It\u2019s a bit complex, and examining the input for consistent starts will help clarify these patterns.**Analyzing tiling strategies and patterns**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine the periodicity for Input1 by checking the repeating column patterns, which may lead to p=3. However, there are complications when attempting to match occupancy patterns across the grid. A simpler approach could be to focus on the largest component\u2019s bounding box and replicate that across the grid. But it seems some positions are missing in the output where one would expect to see colored pixels. I think I need to examine these positions closely to understand how to fill the grid efficiently, possibly revisiting how I divide the grid into blocks.**Mapping output blocks and filling strategy**\n\nI'm mapping the output blocks and observing that many are filled with the full 2x2 pattern, except for a couple that remain empty. It looks like those blocks were left unfilled because the original grid lacked colored pixels in those specific areas. The rule seems to be about filling blocks where the corresponding rows or columns contain colored pixels. However, some blocks that shouldn\u2019t have been filled did get colored, indicating a need to refine these filling rules. I\u2019m thinking I should focus on the largest connected component and implement a tiling strategy based on its properties.",

      "reasoning": "**Clarifying color transformation rules**\n\nI\u2019m trying to outline a rule where I identify a target color that appears as a single pixel with the value of 2. Then, I\u2019ll change all 2x2 clusters of non-background colors to that target. Blocks like 3 and 8 fit, but a vertical row of 7 isn\u2019t a 2x2, so it won\u2019t change.\n\nI realize the grid has a height of 10. There's a contiguous 4x2 rectangle made of 4s that I'll replace with 9s, while a 3x3 shape remains unaffected.**Defining recoloring rules**\n\nI've identified a single pixel of color 9 as my target. The algorithm I\u2019m working on involves finding colors that appear exactly once in both input datasets. In input1, that's color 2, and in input2, it's color 9. \n\nNext, I need to find connected components that form filled rectangles, specifically looking for those that aren't the same color as the singleton. In input2, there's a 4x2 rectangle filled with color 4, which I'll recolor to 9. My final rule will apply to all perfect rectangles of any size.**Considering recoloring limitations**\n\nI\u2019m questioning whether I should recolor the 6-shaped rectangular ring in input2, which is a hollow 3x4 rectangle with holes. Since it isn't completely filled, I should only recolor components that are fully filled rectangles. \n\nNow, there's the issue with the vertical 7 in input1, which is a filled 4x1 rectangle that wasn\u2019t recolored. This raises a contradiction! Maybe I need to reconsider the rules: should I exclude the largest rectangles or focus only on squares? It's definitely something I need to clarify!**Analyzing recoloring patterns**\n\nI'm noticing a common pattern: in both inputs, the shapes that get recolored are those that appear multiple times. For instance, input1 has two 2x2 squares, one of color 3 and one of color 8, which both turned into color 2. The vertical 7 shape remains unchanged since it only appears once.\n\nIn input2, I wonder if there are multiple rectangular shapes of the same size. It seems the 4 block is the only one of its kind, so maybe my approach should focus on finding singleton colors and replacing others, unless they share any pixels in the same row or column!**Refining recoloring process**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing input1, noticing singleton 2 in the top region isn't overlapping with 3 and 8. However, 7 is adjacent to singleton 2, but it wasn't changed, meaning adjacency isn\u2019t the rule. \n\nI've been thinking that perhaps I should change all components that have even dimensions. The 4-block in input2 is 4x2 and fits here. My idea also includes checking for fully filled rectangles when recoloring.\n\nI\u2019ll implement a process that finds a singleton target color. Then, while checking each component\u2019s dimensions and filling, I'll use a BFS approach to manage connected components, ensuring a robust recoloring mechanism. Let's get the code started!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing position changes**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how certain positions that were previously labeled as 1s have now turned into 2s, particularly in the columns 5-6 and 8-9. However, I notice that in row 3, some areas remain as 1s. When comparing the input and output, I see that not all 1s have been changed to 2s \u2014 specifically in the middle area of row 3. It seems the rule might be based on detecting mirrored shapes of 2s and recoloring them accordingly.**Examining block shapes**\n\nI'm checking the shape of a 2-block, which is a 3x2 configuration filled with 2s. Now, I want to identify where I can find 2x3 blocks of 1s. I see three occurrences on the right side at positions in columns 5-6 and 8-9 across rows 2-4. However, in the center at columns 3-4 in row 2, the values are 0s, which is different. So, there are full 3x2 blocks of 1s in both column groups, with some extras forming a cross in row 3.**Analyzing row configurations**\n\nIn examining row 3, positions 3-4 have values of 1, but both row 2 and row 4 at those same positions are 0s, meaning there's a horizontal 1x2 block just in row 3. The main shapes I\u2019m matching are the 3x2 blocks filled with color 2 and the presence of the color 1 blocks. The output seems to recolor those 1s to 2s. I need to identify the most frequent color outside the background \u2014 it looks like 1 occurs more often across several blocks than 2. In input 1, the 1s seem to reach up to 10!**Analyzing Input2 shapes**\n\nI\u2019m looking at Input2, specifically the grid labeled as 15. There\u2019s a cluster of 6 in the top-left at positions (1,1) to (4,4) that seems to form an L shape. There's also a central ring of 2s creating a big plus shape in the center. In output2, many 2s have been replaced by 6s in symmetric positions, especially in that upper-left area and potentially lower-right as well. It looks like the process involves identifying the unique prototype color for one shape and copying it to matching shapes of another color.**Developing the algorithm**\n\nI\u2019m creating an algorithm to find connected components of non-zero colors using 4-connectivity. I'll identify unique component shapes that serve as a reference. For example, in Input3, there's a horizontal segment of color 7 that appears only once alongside multiple blocks of color 6. Output3 updates some of those 6s to 7s. The plan is to parse the grid, find the components, and map their bounding box shapes. \n\nIf a unique color appears only once, it will serve as a reference for recoloring other matching components. I'll use BFS or DFS to find them and track their coordinates, ensuring we don\u2019t inadvertently recolor the background or different shapes.",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing cluster transformation**\n\nIn Input2, I see there's a 6 cluster in the top-left and a 2 cluster in the right area. The output shows many 2s turned into 6s, creating a symmetric pattern. The right cluster imitates the left, replacing 2 with 6 in certain quadrants. Specifically, the 2 cluster in the top-right area (rows 2-5, cols 7-10) changes to 6, except where original 2s near the center stay the same. I\u2019ll check the specifics of that transformation for accuracy.**Exploring color transformation rules**\n\nIt looks like the transformation process involves filling the rightmost shape with the color of the leftmost shape, specifically in symmetric positions relative to a center line. The rule seems to be about identifying two differently colored shapes, A and B, and copying color A into shape B wherever the patterns align. I\u2019m thinking about the geometry now: in Input1, color2 is a 3x3 block on the left, while color1 spreads across columns 5-10. I wonder if the best approach might be to fill in holes based on the majority color!**Analyzing shape color conversion**\n\nI'm considering a rule where pairs of shapes with the same outline but different colors change the smaller shape's color to the dominant one. In looking at the examples, it seems there are two non-background colors, A and B. The output changes occurrences of B into A in various regions, but I see that in Input1, color2 does replace color1 mostly. However, some 1s remain in rows 2-4. It looks like the pattern consists of symmetric small 2x2 squares with gaps, but the mapping seems a bit off in some areas.**Defining the color transformation rule**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about simplifying the rule: identify a color that appears in a 3x3 block to find the smallest colored block. This means filling in other squares of matching shape and turning them into the same color. For Input1, it seems like the 2-shape does form a filled 3x3 square in rows 2-4, columns 1-3. In Input2, there could be three clusters of color6, with arrangements making shapes like an \"L.\" The output shows that this pattern is copied into symmetric positions where there were previously 2s.**Understanding pattern replacement**\n\nIn Input3, color7 appears as a horizontal 4-length row, with some blocks of 6 being replaced by 7 in the output, indicating a pattern where the shape of color7 is copied into rows where related horizontal bars of color6 existed. For Input1, I'm exploring if color1 contains 3x3 square subcomponents, and I observe that color2 is a 3x3 block. I noted that color1 is more numerous but may contain matching smaller components in color2\u2019s arrangement. \n\nWhen applying pattern recognition, I might replace color B with A based on identified shapes, ensuring to align them correctly. The key is finding matching components while considering their orientations and positions. This could help pinpoint which shapes truly overlap!**Exploring pattern stamping**\n\nFor Input1, I'm considering how to apply a 3x3 stamp over the grid. I want to change pixels to color2 wherever all the cells in that stamp are color1. I can visually inspect the areas where the stamp might fit, and I see that some positions aren't valid because they contain zeros. \n\nIt seems like I should focus on identifying smaller colored components and changing occurrences of the larger color where these motifs aren\u2019t connected to the background. Looking at Input2, the L-shaped cluster of color6 appears mirrored in three regions. I notice that some original color2 positions remain intact. \n\nI realize I need to find connected components, particularly those shapes that appeared less frequently. Understanding how to replace regions based on the smaller motif might help me pinpoint replacements in the larger color areas efficiently. My new approach could involve overlaying bounding boxes based on their positions, translating the smaller box onto the larger one, and applying the stamp, which will ensure only certain areas are altered, particularly those that align. This could effectively transform color1 regions while retaining necessary zeros!**Analyzing color replacements**\n\nIn the output, it\u2019s puzzling why column 7 remains 1 after applying the stamp to columns 5-7, even though it overlaps. It seems I need to reevaluate whether we're only stamping where A aligns with B's background. I think I need to focus on finding connected components for each color instead of relying solely on the bounding boxes. \n\nNow, for Input1, I suspect the A pattern might be a 3x2 rectangle instead of a full 3x3 square. I observe that B does indeed have matching 3x2 vertical rectangles in certain columns, which could be key to applying the replacement accurately. I realize I should take extra care to ensure that my recognition of shapes and patterns is precise for successful replacements!**Designing color replacement algorithm**\n\nSo, I've identified that B color components consist of two 3x2 rectangles that match A's shape, alongside connections in row 3 indicating a single connected component. The idea is to detect shapes of color A and look for similar sub-rectangles in B, replacing them with A.\n\nI think I\u2019ll proceed by detailing a method that finds connected components of colors, identifies the smallest area, and uses it as a template for pattern matching. The algorithm will scan for matching areas and replace the target color with A accordingly. This should effectively handle the replacements while being robust in detecting connections!**Refining the matching algorithm**\n\nOkay, I've realized that the original region contains color A, not color T, so I need to ensure I'm checking target color equality accurately. When examining each target color T that isn't equal to A or zero, I should verify that all offsets in the grid correspond to color T.\n\nIf these offsets match and are the same color, they'll be recolored to A. I'll make sure to account for cases where the template\u2019s mask includes holes, ensuring accuracy in matching. I\u2019ll implement this by using a deep copy of the grid and a helper function to find the minimum-count color. Let's get coding!",

      "reasoning": "**Deducing Output Rules**\n\nI need to establish a rule based on the training data. Each input features a solid block of one color (either 2 or 9) arranged in a rectangle or square. The output should only keep this large solid block, removing other scattered pixels. The key is to find the largest connected region with non-zero color values. When there are multiple clusters of the same color, the output should only preserve the largest contiguous region.**Implementing Connected Components**\n\nI\u2019m looking to implement a method that finds connected components of non-zero cells, focusing only on components of the same color. The goal is to select the largest contiguous cluster. If there's a tie, I might choose a specific color. The training suggests that the target component is the largest filled rectangle. \n\nThe algorithm will involve traversing the grid, marking visited cells, and using BFS/DFS to explore connected components. I\u2019ll track their sizes, colors, and coordinates, then create an output grid with the preserved colors of the largest component. I'll make sure to handle edge cases too!**Crafting the Code Implementation**\n\nI want to ensure that my output retains the largest cluster, like the 5 cluster while removing scattered values like 6. In Test2, I\u2019m aiming to keep the large 4 cluster, even if it's a size of 3x3 or larger, while removing the scattered 7s. I\u2019ll implement BFS to copy the shapes accurately. The return type will be a list of lists of integers. I'll include the necessary code using triple backticks and make sure it works with nested lists. Let's finalize it!",

      "reasoning": "**Deducing the rule from examples**\n\nI need to determine the rule based on given examples. Input1 shows a 15x15 grid with a border of zeros, filled with ones, and a single 6 at (3,3). I should clarify the coordinates: row indexing starts at 0. The output should create a rectangle filled with 6, surrounded by a border of 1s. As I inspect, the top row remains a 1, while the area between columns 2 and 12 gets filled with 6s.**Identifying the flood fill rule**\n\nI checked output for row 2 (index 2): it shows [0,1,6,6,...,6,1,0], indicating columns 2 to 12 are filled with 6s. The input had mostly ones and only a single 6 at (3,3). The rule seems to involve identifying a single distinct cell color within a uniform area and then flood filling the bounded region with that color, while keeping a one-cell thick border unchanged. For the next input (12x12), it looks like there\u2019s a blob of 3 with a hole and a single 5 at (5,5).**Understanding the fill process**\n\nIn the output, the 5 expands to create a connected plus-shaped region inside the 3 block. This means the 5 takes over some of the 3s while leaving the outermost perimeter of 3s intact as a frame. The initial blob of 3s covers rows 1 to 6 and columns 1 to 6, and the 5 region is centered on the original 5 location. Essentially, I'm replacing the interior cells, which are not on the boundary of the 3 color, with 5, creating a one-pixel thick frame of 3 surrounding a filled area of 5.**Transforming grid regions**\n\nFor the transformation, I need to keep the boundary cells (those touching the background zeros or on the region's perimeter) in their original color, while replacing the interior cells with the unique inner color. My algorithm will start by identifying the colors present in the grid, excluding the background color (0). For each non-background color that's part of a contiguous region, I'll find the fill color if there's something different inside. Then, I'll determine the boundary by checking neighboring cells. It's crucial that the fill only applies within regions containing that internal seed.**Applying the fill algorithm**\n\nI realize there can be multiple regions to process, especially where clusters contain a different inner color. For instance, in Test Input 1, there are two clusters of color 8, each with distinct colors inside (4 and 6). My goal is to identify connected components of non-zero colors while excluding the background zeros. I need to define which cells qualify as \"interior,\" specifically those not touching the outer boundary. This entails utilizing bounding boxes, determining with each cell\u2019s neighbors whether they\u2019re part of the interior that can be filled with the inner color.**Implementing the fill algorithm**\n\nI need to determine the complement of the component cells that are color val in the grid, identifying connected parts outside the background and any enclosed holes. To do that, I'll compute all cells reachable from the grid boundary while treating val as an obstacle. The remaining non-val cells become the enclosed holes. The interior region will include val cells that aren't boundary cells but are surrounded\u2014these will be set to a fill color along with the identified holes. \n\nFor each component of color val, I'll use BFS to assess and mark reachable cells. If there are enclosed cells of a different color, that color will dictate the fill. I'll also handle edge cases where holes might include multiple colors, selecting the most frequent for filling. This structured approach will ensure I correctly process input and apply the fill color properly.**Planning component filling logic**\n\nI'm working with Test Input1, which has a 16x16 grid with two components of val=8, each containing seeds 4 and 6\u2014I'll need to fill those interiors accordingly. For Test Input2, there's a larger structure with a region of 7 and an 8 inside, so I want to fill the interior to 8 as well.\n\nWhen I calculate the passable grid for each component, I have to treat all val cells as barriers globally to avoid issues, even if there are multiple components of the same color. I'll implement a series of detailed steps:\n\n1. Instead of using numpy, I\u2019ll stick to lists for the grid.\n2. I\u2019ll define a function for getting neighboring cells.\n3. I'll maintain a visited set during BFS to gather component cells.\n\nNext, for each component, I\u2019ll determine the boundary and interior val cells, build the passable boolean grid, and apply the filling strategy based on enclosed cells. I need to ensure I start with an original grid snapshot for component detection so that changes in one component don\u2019t affect others. Once I have that, I\u2019ll create a deep copy to make modifications safely. Time to code this out!",

      "reasoning": "**Deduction of color rule**\n\nI need to deduce a rule regarding color blocks in a training set. The key observation is that there\u2019s a central solid block of color that forms a rectangle, while other colors appear scattered. The rule could be to identify the largest contiguous block of a non-background color. For example, in Input1, the color 2 forms a 3x3 area, which will be the only output. I aim to keep the largest solid color block and set others to zero.**Defining the color block rule**\n\nI need to refine the rule to identify the largest connected component among non-zero colors while zeroing out everything else. This means focusing on contiguous areas of the same color using 4-connectivity. For example, in Test1, a large rectangle of color 5 stands out, so it should remain in the output. Similarly, Test2 has a 3x block of color 4 to keep, while scattered colors like 6 or 7 are set to zero. I\u2019ll implement a search algorithm to find these components and ensure only the largest remains visible in the output.**Implementing the transformation function**\n\nI need to create a function to track the largest connected component in a grid using a visited mask. This will involve keeping a list of cell coordinates and their color to build a result grid filled with zeros, filling in only the largest component. I'll handle edge cases where there are multiple separate components of the same size. The function will have the signature `transform(grid: list[list[int]]) -> list[list[int]]`. I\u2019ll code this carefully and ensure correct handling of coordinates using a stack for the search. Time to produce the code!",

      "reasoning": "**Deducing component rules**\n\nI need to deduce a rule from the examples I've observed. The inputs feature colored small dot pixels surrounding a central filled rectangle. The output shows that only the largest filled rectangle region is retained while all other non-zero pixels are removed. Essentially, I have to keep the biggest contiguous block. The rule seems to be: identify the largest connected component among non-zero colors and keep only that, while ensuring colors are preserved. What about edge cases with multiple components? I should probably assume there's a unique largest one.**Implementing grid transformation**\n\nI have some test inputs to consider. For Test Input1, I see a 5-block rectangular region in the top-left, while Test Input2 has a 4-block region in the middle, both surrounded by other scattered cells. I need to implement a function that computes connected components for non-zero cells using BFS or DFS, then gather their sizes and choose the largest. I'll create a new grid filled with zeros except for the cells in that largest component, preserving their original colors. I should ensure robust code using deep copy and keep everything clean, avoiding changes to the input. Also, if I encounter equal largest components, I might choose the one with the most frequent color or the first encountered one. I'll implement 4-neighborhood connectivity and test various shapes.

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing output patterns**\n\nI'm observing that the output has ones in specific rows: rows 1-2, 4-5, and 7-8. I wonder if the tiling is replicating every three rows, given the grid's height of nine. It seems the object shape could be a 2x2 block based on occurrences with certain offsets. Looking closely at Input1, it shows coordinates aligned with the 2x2 block. I think the blocks might be arranged to form a cross-like pattern across the grid.**Clarifying Input2 structure**\n\nI'm diving into Input2 to get a clearer picture. It seems to have a column of 2s in various rows, particularly at rows 1, 2, and 4. The input shows a structure with what might be 20 rows, but wait, is it supposed to be 10 by 20? It appears that they\u2019ve described it as having 20 rows of 10 columns. There's some ambiguity there! Looking at output2, I notice a similar pattern with more 2s inserted, where column 1 has repeats of two rows followed by an empty row.**Examining vertical patterns**\n\nIt looks like they take columns of 2s from the input and extend them vertically to create 2x1 vertical tiles, stacking these at intervals. This pattern involves filling two rows and leaving one empty. In analyzing Input2, I'm seeing 2s at indices 1, 2, and 4. However, I noticed a mismatch in the shape label versus the actual data, as it shows 20 rows instead. From output2, it seems the 2s group in pairs every three rows, which gets tricky with so many similar patterns!**Analyzing Input3 structure**\n\nI'm looking closely at Input3, which seems to contain blocks of 8s forming a 3x3 section at columns 5-7 and another vertical column at column 3. Specifically, rows 5-7 have 8s at these columns. It looks like the original setup had a 3x3 block of 8s and a single vertical column. Then, Output3 turned things around by adding a left 3x3 block at columns 1-3, completing the pattern. This suggests that when there's an imbalance, we fill in the gaps to maintain symmetry!**Understanding replication rules**\n\nI'm examining how Input1 and Input3 relate to their outputs. In Input1, there are blocks at various indices, but it seems some expected blocks, like (4,7), are missing. This could be due to the original bounding pattern not providing enough structure. In Output3, new blocks are added based on Input3's largest 3x3 rectangle but only replicate horizontally, skipping potential vertical copies because rows 1-3 remain empty. The presence of a column component in the same rows might signal horizontal symmetry without the need for vertical replication. It\u2019s a complex interplay of patterns!**Developing the tiling algorithm**\n\nI\u2019m formulating an algorithm for periodic tiling based on non-zero pixel bands. The idea is to identify clusters in rows and fill gaps to create a uniform pattern. For example, in Input3, I\u2019d analyze the maximum width of clusters and gaps between them. The goal is to expand these components horizontally and then place tile copies in a way that achieves equal spacing. This method also considers the primary bounding box of the largest component, ensuring we replicate appropriately across the grid while maintaining alignment with existing colored cells. So interesting!**Refining the tiling algorithm**\n\nI\u2019m refining my tiling approach by focusing on both horizontal and vertical patterns. If there are at least two components in a row band, I\u2019ll calculate the horizontal period based on the spacing between columns. For vertical tiling, I\u2019ll check for multiple components in the same column band. I plan to establish periods based on the maximum width of components plus any gaps between them. My aim is to ensure I accurately replicate and tile the detected patterns throughout the grid!**Implementing the tiling logic**\n\nI\u2019m now focused on aligning copies of the prototype pattern within the grid. I need to establish horizontal and vertical placements based on the calculated periods. For horizontal placement, I\u2019ll take the prototype\u2019s start position and replicate it across the grid using the determined period. Vertical placement will be handled similarly, ensuring I group components by overlapping columns and compute vertical periods. Edge cases need careful handling to maintain the integrity of the original colored cells. I\u2019ll be coding a connected component detector using BFS to ensure accuracy.**Coding the placement logic**\n\nI'll place the prototype mask at the specified rows to fill the horizontal positions. For vertical placement, I\u2019ll group components by overlapping columns, calculating the period based on the maximum height and minimum gap, then copying the prototype mask to the respective rows. To combine placements, I will start with the original grid and use an OR operation on the masks. As I code, I need to ensure gaps are calculated correctly and handle any edge cases with existing pixels of the same color. Now, it's time to write the final code!",

I also notice there's a central plus of color 2 crossing a large area of color 8 on the left, which forms an L shape. \n\nThere are small 2x2 squares of color 4 at specific positions, too. However, I need to recheck these coordinates since some details seem to overlap. I\u2019ll keep digging!**Understanding color transformations**\n\nI've noticed that the group of color 4 has remained unchanged, while the group of 2's has transformed into 4 in the output. It seems like I'm working with 2x2 blocks of colors that aren't backgrounds, possibly mirrored across a central cross. This grid has color 2 forming a cross along column 7 and row 7, dividing it into quadrants.\n\nIn the top-left quadrant, I see a 2x2 block of color 4 at (2,2). There are also empty corresponding positions in other quadrants that should likely be filled similarly. I need to examine Input 2 more closely, especially regarding a vertical stripe in column 4.**Parsing Input 2**\n\nI\u2019m checking Input 2, which has a shape of 14 by 9. However, it shows 9 rows and 14 columns, which is a bit confusing! There\u2019s a central vertical column at column 4 with color 2. It looks like rows 3 to 5 have 7 blocks in columns 1-2 and 11-12. I notice a 2x2 block of color 5 in columns 6-7 of those rows. \n\nIn output 2, those 7 blocks of color 7 transformed into color 5, indicating a rule where I find a unique 2x2 block and replace other similar blocks of different colors. I\u2019ll keep this in mind!**Identifying target color**\n\nI need to identify the source color in each input, which seems to follow a symmetric pattern with a central cross, often featuring color 2 dividing the grid into quadrants. Each quadrant includes one or more 2x2 squares of a target color, and others are replaced by that target color. \n\nIn Input 2, the target is color 5, located in columns 6-7 for rows 3-5; but that\u2019s actually a 3x2 rectangle. I\u2019m realizing that the blocks of 7\u2019s in columns 1-2 and 11-12 also form 3x2 rectangles, which change to color 5 in the output.**Defining the transformation rule**\n\nI'm working on identifying a transformation rule based on finding shapes of the same size across three quadrants. In the central band of Input 2, I see three vertical blocks: color 7 on the left (columns 1-2), color 5 in the middle (columns 6-7), and color 7 on the right (columns 11-12). It seems the rule is to choose the unique color and replace the others with it.\n\nIn Input 1, we had 2x2 squares, but in Input 3, the shapes are more complicated. There's a diagonal pattern forming an L-shape with color 3 in the top-left quadrant while mirrored color 7 appears in the lower left. I realize I need to establish a central cross that will help center the quadrants. \n\nThe implementation includes finding a color that forms both a complete row and a complete column. If multiple colors meet that criterion, I\u2019ll pick the largest one. I\u2019ll define the quadrants based on intersections of these colors and then identify the unique non-background colors in each quadrant for the final transformation. There's a lot to unpack here!**Clarifying the transformation algorithm**\n\nI need to identify how to define the central dividing cross based on full rows and columns of the same color. For Input 2, it seems there are full columns at column 4 and 9 containing entirely the color 2. I realize my initial assumption about the full row might have been incorrect\u2014row 5 doesn\u2019t consist entirely of 2s.\n\nFor my approach, I should find all full rows or columns that have identical colors, as these act as partitioning lines. This way, I can define segments for each block based on these separators and then analyze the patterns of non-background colors to find a \u201ctarget color\u201d that appears uniquely among its partitions. This will guide the transformation across the grid!**Exploring shape repetition and color transformation**\n\nI need to identify symmetrical shapes across separations in the grid. For each group of blocks organized by row partitions, I\u2019ll find unique colors that can overwrite other blocks\u2019 non-background colors. \n\nIn Input1, there are four blocks defined by a single row and column separator. The unique target color 4 replaces 2 in adjacent blocks. To simplify my approach, I could use boolean masks to find identical shapes across blocks. The one with a unique color will be the target for recoloring. \n\nFor Input2, I'll partition the row blocks and analyze masks for 7s and 5s, while capturing the essence of their configurations. This should ease the recoloring process!**Determining mask patterns and reflections**\n\nI\u2019m examining the masks for different blocks. The top-left block has a clear mask with 4s, while the top-right likely has a mask of zeros since the underlying color is the separator. I need to ensure I'm considering all colors, not just the non-background or separator colors. \n\nAn interesting idea emerges: reflecting patterns across any separators. This means that for each non-background cell, I should find its symmetric counterpart across the separators and assign it the unique color. \n\nIn Input2, I'll assess segments based on columns and rows, allowing me to create groups of corresponding positions across blocks. This way can help identify unique colors and apply those across the relevant segments!**Mapping symmetric positions across segments**\n\nI'm focusing on how to define symmetric counterparts across both row and column segments simultaneously. My approach is to first group positions by their row segment index and column offsets. Then, I'll identify each unique (row_offset, col_offset) combination, treating axes independently.\n\nFor example, in Input1, the top-left block will influence corresponding positions in the three other quadrants based on their relative positions. I'll partition rows and columns between separator rows and create groups based on this pre-defined structure.\n\nTo find colors, I'll exclude the background and identify unique colors, setting corresponding positions to match those found in the grouped positions!**Implementing color transformation logic**\n\nI'm figuring out how to handle color transformations based on groupings of colors in a grid. The process is to count the non-zero colors and select unique ones to set positions accordingly.\n\nI realize that non-zero cells should be the only ones transformed based on unique colors; if a position is zero, it should remain unchanged. This oversight affects outputs, like why the bottom-left remained zero.\n\nI\u2019m planning to structure the code carefully, ensuring I accurately identify separator rows and columns, compute row and column segments, and transform only non-zero positions. It\u2019s important that I implement this meticulously to avoid any errors.",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid transformation**\n\nI need to figure out the transformation based on the provided examples. For Input 1, I have a 9x9 grid with several 2x2 blocks of 1s. The nonzero cell coordinates are identified, with some indicating full 2x2 blocks and others suggesting vertical arrangements. When I look at the output, it appears that many additional ones have been added, forming mirrored copies in different quadrants. Rows and columns in the output have been adjusted accordingly, creating new patterns.**Identifying grid patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing the output where rows 1 and 2, columns 7 and 8 become ones, indicating a replication at the far right. Rows 4 and 5 also have ones at columns 1, 2, and 4, 5. I need to re-evaluate using mapping to find a general rule based on all the training examples. For Input 2, which is a 20x10 grid, I see many isolated vertical pairs of 2s in column 1 at rows 1, 2, and 4. I should find a clear pattern among the nonzero coordinates.**Examining vertical patterns in output**\n\nOutput 2 seems to generate many more 2s by creating vertical blocks of two rows that repeat in pairs across the grid at specific intervals. When I compare the nonzero row indices from the input (1, 2, 4) to the output, I see 2s at many more indices: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 19. It looks like there's a pattern of generating another 2 below existing ones, forming 2x2 blocks that may also be repeated in adjacent columns, but only column 1 has 2s in the output.**Analyzing input and output transformations**\n\nIn Example 3, Input 3 has a 3x3 block of 8s located at columns 5 to 7. The nonzero values appear at rows 5 to 7 in columns 3 and 5 to 7. Specifically, row 5 is [0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0], indicating an 8 at column 3 and 8s at columns 5 to 7. The output transforms a single-column 3x1 at column 3 into a wider 3x3 block at columns 1 to 3, suggesting a pattern of replicating nonzero blocks into larger squares.**Investigating block patterns and occupancy**\n\nI'm examining the output from the grid transformations and noticing that some blocks have zeros, while others have ones, indicating patterns based on occupancy. In Input 1, certain 3x3 blocks contain nonzero values that guide how the output fills in the grid. It appears there's a system for filling blocks based on an original 2x2 template. The rule may involve replicating that pattern across similar grid locations. However, it seems some blocks, like (0,2), fill even without original nonzero values. I should clarify how these occupancy patterns work within the context of the 3x3 grid system.**Analyzing grid transformation rules**\n\nI\u2019m examining the patterns within the 3-row blocks of the grid and how nonzero pixels affect the output. My observation suggests that a rule exists: if a column position has any colored pixel within a block, it replicates that across corresponding blocks. The goal seems to be determining motifs by checking for nonzero positions and then creating a union to fill every 3x3 cell. However, some blocks, like (1,2), might not fill correctly, indicating a possible limitation in the rules for filling.**Examining grid patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing how filled blocks in the grid relate to original input patterns, specifically focusing on the Cartesian product of rows and columns for determining occupancy. It appears that while some blocks are filled, others like (1,2) and (2,1) are missing, suggestive of a symmetrical pattern. Looking at other examples, I'll need to carefully track nonzero positions and avoid confusion from grid indexing. The goal seems to be replicating contiguous colored shapes throughout 3x3 blocks, filling in gaps based on where colors are present.**Exploring block filling rules**\n\nI\u2019m examining how to fill blocks in a grid based on occurrences of colored pixels. It seems like I should selectively tile templates based on whether colored pixels exist in the same block row or column. Example 1 highlighted that filling blocks based on any original pixel in an adjacent block isn't always correct. \n\nI\u2019m thinking of leveraging translation vectors to replicate connected components across the grid, considering minimal vectors between components. Additionally, I need to test a simpler algorithm that consistently aligns with patterns observed in various examples. Time to finalize an approach!**Finding tile patterns for blocks**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to determine the block size by computing distances between colored pixels. It looks like these distances often follow multiples of 3, suggesting a tile size of 3. I want to construct a template for filling blocks based on colored pixel occurrences. It seems like I might need a stricter rule: fill a block only if there is at least one original pixel in the same block-row and block-column.\n\nAlternatively, I could replicate shapes by shifting them repeatedly across the grid. This would help in creating a complete lattice effect. Now, I need to test this hypothesis and examine if it holds for various examples!**Identifying component patterns**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down the different components present in the input. Component A is a solid 2x2 block, while Component B has a vertical pair and a lone pixel. Component C is a 1x2 horizontal pair. I think I need a method to replicate these components across the grid by shifting positions based on these shapes. \n\nThe time constraints are pushing me to focus on a simpler tiling rule. I\u2019ll create an output grid where I fill in positions based on offsets and their colors, taking into account the frequency of each color. It\u2019s time to translate this logic into code!",

      "reasoning": "**Deducing color filtering rule**\n\nI\u2019m working on a rule based on some examples. Each input has a central colored rectangle surrounded by scattered pixels of different colors. The output should keep only the contiguous block of the central color, setting everything else to zero. The goal seems to be to identify the largest connected component of nonzero color in each grid. So, I'll focus on retaining the largest filled block, while removing all other different colors.**Analyzing connected components**\n\nI'm checking the examples for the largest connected component rule. In Input2, color 9 is a big block, while color 7 has many scattered clusters\u2014color 9 is definitely the largest. In Input3, color 2 is large, and color 4 is scattered, so color 2 is kept. With Input1, color 2 has a bigger area than color 3. If multiple colors have large components, we choose the largest. The rule focuses on identifying and preserving connected components of nonzero cells.**Choosing the largest color component**\n\nI'm outlining the approach for finding and keeping the largest component in a grid. The plan involves using BFS or DFS to capture components, considering all colors\u2014since the input may include zeros elsewhere. If a cell isn't zero and hasn't been visited, I'll perform BFS to find its coordinates and color. We'll identify the largest component and create a new grid that retains only those cells. For instance, in Test Input 1, the largest block is color 5, and in Test Input 2, we\u2019ll keep the color 4 region.**Implementing transformation function**\n\nI\u2019m planning to create a transform function using standard Python lists, with a deque for efficient BFS. The output will be a grid represented as a list of lists of integers. An important edge case is that there might be multiple components of the same color, but the rule specifies picking a connected component instead of combining disconnected pieces. Previous training shows that the same color can appear in multiple scattered locations. So, I\u2019ll focus on keeping just one connected area. I'll start crafting the code now.**Crafting the transformation function**\n\nI\u2019m laying out the pseudo-code for the transform function. First, I'll determine the height and width of the grid, and initialize a visited list. The idea is to find the best connected component of non-zero color cells. I\u2019ll use a deque for BFS to scan through neighboring cells. Once I identify the largest component, I\u2019ll create an output grid by setting the best component's coordinates to the corresponding color. I'll ensure to return a list of lists with integers, making deep copies where necessary. Finally, I'll wrap it all up in code format.",

      "reasoning": "**Evaluating flood fill process**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to perform a flood fill on an interior region filled with 1s and how to change those inner pixels to the color of a distinct inner pixel, which is 6. I need to find the largest rectangular frame with a thickness of 1, ensuring zeros are outside it. I\u2019m also inspecting an input grid where a blob of 3s forms a non-rectangular shape, noting there\u2019s a 5 at (5,5). Interesting!**Analyzing shape transformation**\n\nI see that many 5s appear, replacing some 3s and forming a cross shape. I\u2019m roughly mapping the coordinates from rows 1 to 6 and columns 1 to 6. The cluster of 3s seems mostly filled, except for that single 5 at (5,5). In the output, I notice a vertical stripe of 5s in column 2. Upon checking the specific rows, I can confirm the columns filled with 3s and that the shape is mostly blob-like, with that 5 standing out.**Comparing output patterns**\n\nI\u2019m looking closely at the output rows to find patterns. In Row 1 to Row 6, I see that column 2 was initially filled with 3 but becomes 5 for rows 2 to 5. Row 5\u2019s columns 2 to 5 also turn into 5s. It looks like they fill the interior region between the 5 and the shape's border. This creates a cross-like area as the 5s propagate outward in all directions until they hit the boundary filled with 3. Both examples show a shape filled with one color surrounding a single cell of another color.**Examining transformation details**\n\nIt looks like the transformation fills the entire connected interior of shape A with the color B while keeping the outer perimeter intact. In Input 1, a frame of ones was present, and the inner area was changed to 6. In Input 2, the cluster of 3s is solid rather than hollow, and while many remain, some changed to 5. It seems they only filled the maximal square area around the 5, expanding until touching the boundary of the 3s. I\u2019ll need to analyze the coordinates further to clarify.**Planning the transformation code**\n\nI want to ensure that I\u2019m only modifying the interior area within the bounding box that currently has the color c or possibly zeros, without affecting other components. I\u2019ll implement a function that deep copies the grid and checks each cell using BFS to gather components of the same color. \n\nNext, I\u2019ll compute the bounding box and determine the interior color, considering filling it with the most common color found inside. I'll carefully write the code while testing it mentally, especially for any edge cases. I'm excited to get this working!",

      "reasoning": "**Clarifying color rules**\n\nI need to figure out a rule for processing training pairs with a large solid square or rectangle of a specific color, either 2 or 9, and many scattered dots of other colors like 3, 7, or 4. The output should only preserve the main block of the dominant color and turn the scattered dots into the background. Essentially, I\u2019m looking for the largest connected area of the dominant color for the output.**Defining component rules**\n\nI'm working on a rule to find the color (not zero) with the largest connected component area, keeping only those components and setting all other colors to zero. It's important to ensure I retain all connected pixels from that color, especially if there are multiple components. I think it makes sense to focus on the color with the highest total count. So I should find the non-zero color with the maximum count and remove isolated smaller components.**Establishing the output rules**\n\nIn certain tasks, I need to keep only contiguous blocks of colors without filling any holes, ensuring all pixels of a chosen color are retained while others are set to zero. For Input2, I kept the 9 block and confirmed there were no other 9s outside of it. Similarly, for Input3, I retained all 2s. The algorithm I devised involves counting colors (excluding zero), picking the highest count, and creating a new grid where cells are set to that color based on the original.**Implementing the transform function**\n\nI need to implement a function called `transform(grid)` that uses `collections.Counter` to count colors while excluding zero. If no colors are left, I'll return the same grid. The goal is to choose the color with the maximum count and create a new grid that only retains that color, setting everything else to zero. I also want to maintain the shape of the input as a list of lists of integers. \n\nIn edge cases of a tie, I might consider using the largest connected component area, which means I'll implement BFS to check ties as well. Let's get to coding this!**Preparing grid handling**\n\nI need to ensure I'm treating the grid as a list of lists while obtaining its height and width. For processing, I'll use a stack, which should help manage the elements effectively. The goal is to return a new grid filled with integers. Alright, let\u2019s jump into writing the code for that! I'll make sure everything is structured correctly for clarity and efficiency.",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing color transformation**\n\nI\u2019m observing that the output involves changing the last two entries to 4 in the grid, specifically for the 2x2 red blocks at columns 11-12 and rows 2-3. In the original input, these blocks were marked as 2, and now they are replaced with 4. I\u2019m also noting a vertical stripe of 2 in column 7 and a horizontal stripe of 8 in row 6. It seems like the transformation duplicates the 2x2 blocks of color 4 in the same way.**Evaluating color replacement rule**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that the color transformation involves replacing blocks of color 2 with copies of color 4, but this happens only in specific quadrants. The original 4 blocks on the left are mirrored across the central line to replace the color 2 blocks. In Input1, there are 2x2 blocks of color 2 at the top-right and bottom-right, which are being swapped for 4. I need to clarify which colors A and B are for the replacement rule; A is color 4 and B is color 2. I'm double-checking Input1 to confirm the positions of the 2x2 blocks.**Analyzing Input2 transformations**\n\nI've confirmed that at rows 2-3 and columns 11-12, there were 2x2 blocks of color 2, which the output replaced with color 4. Checking Input2, I see a 3x3 block of 7 in columns 1-2 across rows 3-5. However, there's also a 3x2 rectangle of color 5 in the center at columns 6-7, specifically rows 3-5. In rows 4-6 of Input2, I noticed the 7s in columns 1-2 and 11-12 got replaced with 5, while the center block of 5 remains unchanged.**Understanding pattern replacement rules**\n\nI'm recognizing a rule where I need to identify a 2x2 pattern of color (possibly 5) and replace other 2x2 blocks of color 7 with that. However, the 5 block is actually a 3x2, and while there is a 2x2 block, it\u2019s more complex. In Input2, I see 5 forms a 3x2 block at rows 4-6 and columns 6-7. The seed pattern to copy may be this 3x2 block. Yet, the replacement only deals with entire 2x2 clusters, even though the left and right clusters of 7 are each 3x3. I have to double-check the dimensions in Input2.**Defining component replacement logic**\n\nI'm establishing a rule to identify and replace 2x2 blocks of specific colors. I see that both color 5 and 7 form 3x2 vertical blocks, so their shapes are similar. For Input3, I notice instances of 3 and 7; when the output changes 7 to 3, I'll be mirroring 3s into the right positions. I aim to copy the smaller clusters from the left side to the corresponding right areas, ensuring I don't accidentally switch larger components.\n\nI'll identify non-background colors with the same shape, then prioritize the one that appears only once on the left for recoloring others. I\u2019ll compute connected components, group by shape, and ensure to select the color that occurs only once among them, like color 5 in Input2. This reflects a more robust algorithm for pattern replacement while avoiding larger components that might distort the visual output.**Identifying and recoloring components**\n\nI need to choose the color with just one connected component for a shape. In Input3, color 3 appears as a diagonal shape, while color 7 occurs in separate, non-adjacent components. Checking each position reveals that 7 is present in multiple locations but not connected, while color 3 is also singular.\n\nBased on my findings, I see both top-right and bottom-left occurrences of 7 being successfully replaced by 3 in the output. This reinforces my algorithm: pick the color with only one component and change other colors of the same shape accordingly. I\u2019ll implement this by normalizing shapes, verifying connected components, and employing depth-first search for connectedness, ensuring that I avoid recoloring the source component. I\u2019ll now proceed with the coding step!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid patterns**\n\nI'm checking if there are 2x2 patterns in the rows, like row2 and row3 both having [0 8 8 6]. Additionally, I see row7 and row8 having [8 8] at the same columns, confirming the 2x2 purple squares. I'll clean up the output to show these two blocks clearly. \n\nLooking at Input2, it has various colored patterns. There's a 3x3 shape forming, but also some 1x3 horizontal lines of 2s in rows 9, 11, and 21, 22 that remain in the output.**Reviewing output patterns**\n\nI'm inspecting output2, which keeps three colored regions: a cluster of 3s at the top-left, a 2x3 group at row 9, col 23-25, and another vertical block near rows 10-12. It seems to preserve groups of 2 that originally formed a 3x pattern, while removing isolated 4s and single 2s unless they form specific horizontal or vertical patterns.\n\nIn output row 9, there\u2019s a clear [2 2 2] at cols 23-25, but output row 10 has some inconsistencies. I think the rule might be to keep color clusters that form perfect filled squares like 2x2 or 3x3 blocks.**Examining output preservation**\n\nIn input2, the 3x3 block of color3 is preserved, along with two clusters of size 3 in straight lines. However, many isolated 2s have been removed from the output unless they form contiguous rectangles. My hypothesis is that the system keeps cells that create filled rectangles of color with sizes greater than or equal to 2x2 or 3x3.\n\nFor input1, the purple 2x2 is preserved. In input2, the 3x3 pattern does have a center value of zero, but the output retains that central zero. The 3x3 structure remains intact, creating a bounding box filled with 3s around a central zero.**Defining color preservation rules**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about rules for identifying colored shapes. One idea is to keep only colors that are symmetric and form at least 4 connected pixels. Alternatively, I could focus on colors that appear exactly eight times.\n\nIn input2, color3 does form a ring with 8 positions, and those are preserved in the output. Color2 also appears in various clusters, with some groups of three 2s kept, specifically those in 1x3 or 3x1 lines without nearby same colors. \n\nIt seems a possible rule could be to keep the largest connected component for each color, but input1 showed that color8 has two equal components preserved, indicating the rule might not simply be based on size.**Computing connected components**\n\nI'm testing input2 to compute connected components of size 2, looking for any components with sizes of 3 or more. For example, the group at row 9, col 23-25 is contiguous and thus kept. I see vertical groups in rows 20-22, and indeed row 21 has a 2-2-2 pattern.\n\nIn input1, I notice there are essential clusters of color4 forming 3x3 blocks with various components. The top-left cluster forms a 2x3 area, and since its size is greater than 3, it will be kept in the output. \n\nFor input2, I also notice a small symmetric pattern of color3 resembling an X-shape, which counts as 7 components; thus, it\u2019s also retained. I\u2019ll implement the process as a transform function that uses BFS for connected components, ensuring anything smaller than 3 is zeroed out in the output grid while retaining the original colors for kept components.",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing color propagation rules**\n\nIt seems like the color of one component is affecting others in specific rows. In Input3, there were multiple instances of colors, with a 4-length color 7 bar at row 2 and other blocks colored 6 at rows 6-7. The output changed those 6 blocks to color 7, which suggests that the topmost occurrence of a shape dictates the color. I see a similar logic in Input1, where identical blocks turned from color 1 to color 2 in the output.**Understanding color propagation in shapes**\n\nI see that the leftmost shape's color influences the others. In Input2, there's a color 6 cluster at the top-left with several identical shapes, possibly rotations, colored in color 2\u2014but those were changed to color 6 in the output. So, the rule might be to identify unique shapes in the grid that appear in multiple colors, then determine the majority color. The process involves finding connected components, analyzing patterns, and determining the unique color from the top-left region, focusing on consistent geometry across colors.**Exploring shape color transformation**\n\nThe goal seems to be recoloring all components of a shape to the most frequent color among them. In Input1, I see three identical 3x2 shapes, with the leftmost one in color 2. There are additional 3x2 blocks, mostly colored 1, except for one cell, which remains color 1. The output changed the color from 1 to 2, reflecting a shift from a majority to a minority color. It looks like a possible rule could be to color repeated shapes with the unique color that appears only once among them.**Analyzing shape colors in Input2**\n\nIn Input2, I\u2019m checking shapes that might form the corners of a ring. I notice color 6 appears in the top-left shape, while color 2 is in other positions. It looks like color 6 shows up in three components, but let\u2019s investigate further. The output shows multiple 6s, including some replacements of 2s with 6. It seems like color 6 could be the unique one here. For connected shapes, I should find the color that appears only once and recolor the others to match. For Input1, I found color 2 appears just once.**Developing the recoloring algorithm**\n\nIt looks like color 2 only appears once among the components, which means I should recolor the others to match. In Input3, the horizontal shapes feature color 7 once and color 6 in two instances. Since color 7 is unique, I\u2019ll change the others to it. The plan for the algorithm involves finding connected pixel components, normalizing their shapes, and grouping them by signature. Checking for a unique color among multiple instances seems key. If a unique color exists, I\u2019ll recolor accordingly, while considering edge cases and ensuring the code handles the grid representation. Time to code this out!",

      "reasoning": "**Deducing transformation details**\n\nI'm trying to understand the transformation from Input1, which is described as 8x12. They actually mention 12 rows and 8 columns, but their grid format gives me a 12x8 shape. Output1 shows zeros apart from two 2x2 blocks of the color 8. I've identified these 2x2 clusters in the input, located at specific indices. It seems the 2x2 blocks are preserved in output while all other colors are removed, with one 2x2 block remaining in its place.**Analyzing color retention**\n\nThe rule here is to keep colors that form 2x2 solid squares (specifically color 8) and remove all other nonzero colors. Now, Input2 is a large 30x30 grid where colors 2, 4, and possibly 3 are present. Output2 seems to retain certain patterns, particularly rows 3-5 and columns 4-6 where 3s are exactly as in the input. There are also clusters of 2s forming 3x3 blocks. It looks like the output only keeps the 3s and some specific 2 patterns, while others are removed.**Evaluating color retention rules**\n\nI'm checking the occurrence counts in Input2, where colors 2 and 4 are present. It looks like the output removes 4s but retains 2s and 3s. There seems to be a rule in place where only colors forming connected components greater than 1 are kept, specifically those in symmetric shapes. For example, color 3 forms a plus shape in rows 3-5 and columns 4-6, essentially a 3x3 pattern with a center zero. The output keeps this block, while 2s also create similar 3x3 ring patterns, which remain.**Analyzing shape retention**\n\nIn Input2, I notice multiple clones of 3x3 rings in different colors: color 3 is located at (3-5, 4-6), and color 2 appears in various places, while color 4 might also form rings. The output retains the 3s and 2s that create full 3x3 rings but removes 4s, possibly because they don't form complete structures. I'm considering a general rule here: perhaps I should focus on identifying the most common connected shapes and preserving only the solid 2x2 blocks or the largest uniform structures. In Input1, there are lots of 6s scattered, but 8 occurs in specific configurations.**Defining retention rules**\n\nIn Input2, I see several occurrences of color 6 scattered throughout different positions. The output retains color 8, which has fewer cells than 6, so it seems like the rule isn't simply based on the most frequent colors. It might be better to keep colors forming symmetric blocks, specifically looking for 2x2 solid or 3x3 hollow squares. \n\nIn Input2, while inspecting occurrences, I noticed some 4s that formed potential blocks. However, the output removed these, possibly because they don't create full 3x3 rings. The goal seems to be indicating that I should keep connected shapes that are either solid 2x2 squares or 3x3 rings. I\u2019ll implement this algorithm systematically to analyze components and determine the proper rules for retention.",

      "reasoning": "**Parsing input blocks**\n\nI'm checking rows 3, 4, and 5, which each have a 5 block in columns 6-7, giving me a total of 3 rows x 2 columns. The 7 block at columns 1-2 is the same size, 3x2, so I can copy the 5 block to the 7 block positions. I\u2019m trying to figure out a rule for identifying contiguous blocks of one color and how to choose which block to use as a template. In Input 1, there's a 2x2 block I can replace. In Input 3, I see diagonal shapes with 3s at certain positions to analyze.**Analyzing diagonal shapes**\n\nI see there's a diagonal pair of 3s forming an L-shape at (1,2) and (2,1), as well as another at (8,1) and (9,2). In the top-right, I notice two vertical 7s at (1,9) and (2,9). It looks like these changed to 3s in the output. I need to confirm that the original 3s at (1,2) and (2,1) remain intact while understanding the template seems to be the 3-shape with two diagonals.**Examining the pairs**\n\nI see there's a pair of 7s in the top-right at (1,9) and (2,9) that aren't aligned vertically, but let me double-check the input data. In row 1, I see a 3 at column 2 and a 7 at column 8. Then in row 2, there\u2019s also a 3 at column 1 and a 7 at column 9. So the 7s are staggered rather than aligned. In the output, both 7s become 3s in their original positions. Now, I need to delve into the shapes of the 3s to clarify \u2014 there might be four 3s total in the input.**Clarifying the positions of 7s**\n\nI want to check the positions of the 7s more carefully. I see them at (1,8) and (2,9). However, I thought there might be a 7 at (8,1), which wasn't confirmed. Instead, I have a 7 noted at (9,2). I need to double-check the input data to ensure I\u2019m capturing all the correct positions of the 7s in order to clarify my understanding of these blocks and their potential patterns.**Reviewing input data and patterns**\n\nI've gone through Input 3 and identified key components. The 3s are located at (1,2) and (2,1), while the 7s are at (1,8), (2,9), (8,1), and (9,2). In the output, it seems all 7s are replaced by 3s. It suggests a pattern where one color forms a motif, and another color, which appears symmetrically, is replaced. I need to find a unique feature color and a filler color to inform replacement rules. So, I'll check for connected components and their shapes to determine the template.**Defining pattern rules and mirroring process**\n\nI\u2019m working on identifying a way to replace colors based on their bounding box sizes and shapes. For Input 3, it seems the 3s are individual pixels and each 7 is also a single pixel. I need to decide how to select the template color, possibly the one that appears less frequently but more than once. I notice a pattern where I can mirror components across central axes. This central cross in the grid helps define symmetry when replacing colors in different quadrants. It looks like I need to find colors that create full rows or columns to establish these axes.**Analyzing color partitions for mirroring**\n\nI need to identify a color that creates a full row and column, which will help establish axes for mirroring. In Input 1, color 2 forms a complete row and column, while in Input 2, it appears in vertical stripes but lacks a full horizontal row. So, the axis likely aligns with these vertical stripes. \n\nThen I can look for a motif in one partition and mirror it across the axes to duplicate it in other partitions. Overall, my task involves finding colors that create continuous lines and utilizing these to shape the grid.**Implementing shape signature template selection**\n\nI need to select a component shape that occurs in only one block and appears in other blocks with different colors. My approach starts by gathering components from blocks that aren't the background or the axis color. Then, I record their patterns and build a mapping by shape signature to track where each occurs.\n\nFrom there, I look for signatures that have different colors in multiple blocks, choosing the one that has a unique occurrence. If there's a tie, I'll favor the one in the top-leftmost block. Finally, I paint over the other occurrences with the chosen template color.**Implementing template selection and grid modification**\n\nI need to choose a template color by applying rules and then replace all non-template colors in the output grid. I'll first confirm the full rows and columns and partition the grid into blocks. For single-pixel shapes, I'll create signatures and identify occurrences across various blocks. \n\nFor the template selection, I'll check color frequencies and, if necessary, pick the top-leftmost occurrence. The process will involve using BFS to find components and creating a mask, ensuring all occurrences in the new grid copy are updated accordingly. Finally, I\u2019ll implement functions to effectively find the axis color and manage block partitions. Let's code!",

      "reasoning": "**Deducing transformation rules**\n\nI need to figure out the transformation rule by examining the provided examples. In Input1, which is a 9x9 grid, I see that there are 2x2 blocks of color 1 located at specific positions. For instance, there are 1s at (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), and (2,2), forming one 2x2 block. Interestingly, there are also single vertical stacks at (1,4) and (2,4). When looking at rows 4 and 5, I see similar patterns, especially in row 4.**Clarifying row data**\n\nLooking closely at row 5, it shows [0 0 0 0 0 ...], but the original Input1 indicates it as [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]. Let's re-express the original Input1 text for clarity. \n\nWhen I analyze the grid, I see this:\n\n[[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]  \n [0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0]  \n [0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0]  \n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]  \n [0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0]  \n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]  \n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]   \n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]   \n [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]\n\nSo, I confirm there's a 2x2 block at (1-2, 1-2) and another vertical pair at (1-2, 4). Plus, row 4 has its own 2x2 at (4, 1-2) and a single at (4, 4).**Analyzing output patterns**\n\nI see that the pattern consists of clusters of 1s formed in shapes of either 2x2 or 2x1. Output1 expands these clusters by adding extra 1s to the right, turning vertical pairs into 2x2 blocks and creating new formations in the bottom-right corners. \n\nFor example, in Row 2, the transformation gives [0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1], adding 1s at col 5. It seems like the original 2x2 at col 1-2 is preserved, while new clusters show up at cols 7-8. I\u2019m curious where those came from! The lower rows also reflect some changes based on single vertical formations.**Examining output changes**\n\nLooking closely at rows 4 and 5, I notice in row 5 (index 4) the output shows [0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0] while row 6 (index 5) mirrors it. It seems they added fill at cols 1-2 and expanded to cols 4-5 to create a 2x2 block. However, row 5 originally had no 1s, yet the output has 1s at (5,1) and (5,2). \n\nChecking the input, it confirms that row 4 has 1s at cols 1, 2, and 4, while row 5 didn't \u2014 intriguing how those pairs appear!**Investigating pattern transformations**\n\nI need to figure out where the bottom-right pattern in the output came from, especially since the input had no values in that area. It seems the transformation takes a pattern from the top-left 2x2 block and replicates it across similar columns. By partitioning the 9x9 grid into 3x3 superblocks, I can check for the presence of colored pixels. \n\nLooking at input, certain positions in columns had 1s. The output indicates a correlation such that if there\u2019s any non-empty block, it fills corresponding intersections in the output. However, certain unexpected areas in the output filled as well.\n\nWhen I analyze Input2 and Input3, I see different patterns, like vertical stripes being replicated into 2x2 blocks. My hypothesis is that within each superblock, filling occurs if any pixel is present. In Input3 specifically, a 3x3 block filled symmetrically based on existing patterns. I think this pattern of replication and symmetry is key to understanding the transformation rules for the task at hand.**Examining transformation rules**\n\nIt seems the transformation replicates patterns from upper to lower slices based on column data. If any column-slice has a non-zero value in a row-slice, that pattern is copied across all corresponding row-slices. This is quite complex! \n\nWhen I look at Input2, I observe a vertical stripe in column 1 across certain rows, which transforms to fill more rows below it. There seems to be a pattern of height repetitions every three rows, contributing to a 3x3 block structure with zero rows acting as separators. \n\nIn Input3, I find a cluster of filled rows and see they intersect across block boundaries because of surrounding zeros. This leads me to think about bounding boxes for connected colors, filling them fully, and replicating these shapes throughout the grid with specific spacing. I conclude that identifying connected components and their locations could help clarify this transformation process!**Understanding grid patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing how groups of rows with data emerge from Input1, looking at zeros in indices as potential separators. It seems these rows form bands of contiguous data. For Input1, these groups are rows 1-2, 4-5, and potentially row 7-8. I notice that separators could help in identifying block heights, but this approach may lead to inconsistencies. \n\nIn exploring Input2, I observe a repeating pattern with colored pixels every three rows, suggesting that tiles may be organized in 3x3 formats. The goal could be to fill 2x2 sub-squares in each tile where any colored pixel exists. \n\nAs I continue examining these rules, I realize they need to account for both tile-row and tile-column behaviors. When a row has any colored pixel, that impacts the filling of corresponding tiles. Now, I need to clarify how the outputs might violate initial assumptions about colored pixels.**Analyzing tile patterns**\n\nI'm trying to determine when to fill tiles based on their occupancy. The OR rule suggests I should fill a tile if either its row or column has colored pixels. However, it seems I'm getting contradictory results, as some tiles are marked True when both row and column indices are empty.\n\nIn exploring the occupancy matrix, I noticed that filled positions might follow a pattern linked to either the indices being the same or some form of symmetry across a block. I also considered filling only based on colored presence in both block rows and columns. However, I'm not fully consistent with the initial conditions.\n\nTo simplify, I think I'll focus on filling the bottom-right 2x2 of each block containing any pixel and ensuring that this filled pattern matches what I've seen so far. It's tricky, but it feels like there's a clearer rule hiding among the complexities.**Designing tile filling logic**\n\nI want to determine the occupancy of tiles based on initial data. For Input1, if I have a 3x3 occupancy grid, I can compute the output occupancy using the concept of convolution, but it\u2019s tricky. Reflecting or rotating the initial grid didn\u2019t yield the desired results, so I\u2019m considering a simpler approach: \n\nI\u2019ll find the tile size by calculating the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the distances between rows and columns with all zeros. Once I have the tile size, I can fill a 2x2 or 3x3 region based on the dominant color in that tile. \n\nFor instance, I'll check if any colored pixel exists in a tile and fill the bottom-right region accordingly. Propagating this across the entire grid by filling related tiles looks plausible but requires careful implementation to meet the expected outputs. It\u2019s a bit uncertain, but I want to finalize a workable code solution!",

      "reasoning": "**Inferring rules from input data**\n\nI need to infer rules from the training pairs. So, looking at Input1, it specifies a grid of 8 columns and 12 rows, which means we have a total of 12 rows and 8 columns. I see colors are indicated as 6 and 8, possibly pink and purple. Notably, while Input1 contains several 6s and some 8 blocks forming 2x2 blocks, Output1 seems to retain only the 8 blocks and moves them. I should closely examine the rows with 8s, starting from index 0 at the top.**Analyzing Input1 rows**\n\nLooking at Input1, I see the rows clearly outlined. There are three 2x2 blocks of 8: the first one spans rows 2-3 and columns 1-2 (top-left), while the second is in rows 7-8 and columns 4-5 (bottom-right). I want to ensure I double-check these placements. The other 2x2 also appears in rows 2-3 with a clear structure. But after checking, I don't see any other 2x2 blocks. So it seems these are all accounted for!**Evaluating Output1 and establishing rules**\n\nOutput1 retains only those two 2x2 blocks, and they seem to have moved while maintaining the same positions. When I compare the output rows, both row 2 and row 3 contain the same 8s as before, while rows 7 and 8 show the preserved 8s at columns 4-5. This leads me to a rule: find colors appearing in exactly four cells forming 2x2 blocks. Color 8 appears eight times across the two blocks while color 6 has been entirely removed. I'll keep only colors forming perfect 2x2 blocks. In Input2, colors 2, 4, and possibly 3 are present. I'm noticing a cluster of 3s forming a 3x3 block that might need closer inspection.**Analyzing Input2 patterns**\n\nI see there's a 3x3 pattern with a possible middle cell of 0 at (4,5); indeed, row 4 shows that with a 0 among other elements. The pattern seems to hinge on the ring of 3s, and Output2 keeps that 3-pattern while removing many 2s and 4s. I notice Output2 retains some 2 clusters, like at row 9 where columns 23-25 show preserved 2s. But many scattered 2s and 4s from Input2 were removed. It looks like colors forming symmetric shapes are worth noting here. Color 3 appears uniquely in that ring, while 4 has small scattered clusters, and 2 is more common. Ultimately, Output retains the 3 and some 2 clusters, but many 4s are missing.**Identifying patterns and rules**\n\nLooking at Output2, I see that it preserves clusters of 2s that form straight horizontal lines of three, like in row 9 at columns 23-25. This leads me to suggest a rule: keep colors forming 3-in-a-row horizontally. Also, I note 3s form a symmetrical plus shape in rows and columns. A broader rule could involve identifying colors with large contiguous blocks arranged in squares or lines of length 3. It seems that colors forming hollow squares (like a 3x3 with a zero center) and filled squares (like 2x2) are important, as those patterns are being preserved. Upon examining rows around 20-22, I confirm that the output shows a 3x3 hollow pattern of 2s has been kept. So, it looks like the rule is: preserve components forming hollow squares or filled squares while removing everything else. As for input, we had clear patterns that align with this rule structured as filled blocks or lines.**Implementing color pattern detection**\n\nI see a potential pattern with rows 9-12 showing a filled 3x3 block that retains certain components. I need to focus on creating rules to identify and preserve colors forming well-defined shapes, like hollow 3x3 rings or filled 2x2 squares. My thought process is to detect connected components for each color and then determine which shapes to keep based on their bounding box size. The components that meet these criteria will be retained, while all others are removed. This includes ensuring to consider horizontal or vertical 3-in-a-row patterns. \n\nFor the implementation, I will define connected components using 4-neighbors and evaluate their properties to maintain any filled squares or hollow structures that match our rules. If conditions are met for 2x2 or 3x3 shapes, I\u2019ll preserve them in the output grid. This seems to align well with the examples from Input1 and Input2. I intend to validate shapes thoroughly, focusing on color groups and structure, to ensure an accurate classification.**Crafting the preservation code**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on creating a grid that only retains the desired shapes. I want to make sure not to hardcode sizes but instead implement a flexible approach. The main idea is to preserve filled squares of any size and specifically keep hollow 3x3 shapes. My method will be to check if the bounding box has equal height and width with the same color throughout. \n\nIf these conditions are met, I'll keep the component; otherwise, I'll evaluate it for the hollow 3x3 criteria. I'll finalize the code with a transform function and include the necessary imports, utilizing a BFS stack to manage the component searching process effectively. That should wrap things up!",

      "reasoning": "**Evaluating input consistency**\n\nI'm comparing the inputs for a specific grid or matrix. At row 9, I noticed a sequence of 2s in columns 23-25 and found a similar pattern in row 12 too. I see there are also clusters of 2s at rows 20-22 in columns 16-18, possibly forming a 3x3 block. It seems like Output 2 only retains symmetrical shapes and repeats, removing singletons and scattered ones. Maybe the rule is to keep only shapes that appear at least twice?**Determining shape rules**\n\nI'm considering whether to keep shapes that are 2x2, 3x3, or fully filled 1x3 lines. In Input2, it seems they kept 3x3 blocks of 2s at rows 20-22 in columns 16-18, which matches the output. Rows near 20 show consistent patterns, like a 3x3 ring. Looking back at Input, rows 20-22 do have a 3x3 block formed by 2s. However, I also remember clusters present at rows 11-13, so this is a bit challenging to analyze.**Identifying color patterns**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out if I should identify colors that can form at least one 2x2 or 3x3 block. In the first example, color 8 makes two complete 2x2 squares, while color 6 is scattered and was entirely removed. In the second example, color 3 forms a 3x3 block with a center of 0, and I see that output kept a similar pattern. For color 2, there were various 1x3 lines and shapes that fit a hollow 3x3 template. Notably, rows 20-22 also show a hollow 3x3 pattern for color 2.**Analyzing kept patterns**\n\nI noticed that rows 9 and 12 kept full 1x3 lines, which might be part of surrounding 3x3 hollow patterns with zeros. Row 9 has a 1x3 of 2s, but I need to check if there's a 2 above and below \u2014 row 8 has zeros, and row 10 might have zeros too, making just a line. I see some 2s in rows 9 and 11, possibly forming parts of a 3x3. I think the rule should be to clear out isolated singletons but retain connected components with an area of at least 4.**Implementing color rules**\n\nI'm analyzing how colors are treated in Input1 and Input2. In Input1, color 8 kept two components of size 4, while color 6 had only singletons removed. In Input2, color 3 has one large component kept, and color 2 retained multi-cell components while removing singles. It seems color 4 was removed entirely as it only had singletons. The rule I'm developing is to keep multi-cell components and drop singletons, even if the color also includes larger connected cells. I\u2019m thinking about implementing the algorithm to find connected components using BFS or DFS to handle this correctly.",

      "reasoning": "**Re-evaluating color preservation**\n\nI notice that, in the given output snippet, color handling seems a bit messy. So, I should identify which colors are preserved or removed more clearly: color 4 is mostly removed, 2 is partly removed, and 3 is preserved. It looks like color 8 (purple) is preserved in training1 because it appears twice in the form of 2x2 blocks. In training2, color 3 is only present in the top left. \n\nHmm, maybe I should only keep symmetric shapes appearing exactly twice, like the shape of 8 in Input1. Now I need to check Input2 to see if a similar pattern holds for the shape of 3.**Inspecting color cluster rules**\n\nI seem to recall that clusters of color 2 appear three times in Input2. I'll need to check for any repeating shapes, specifically the 3 \"ring\" that shows up at rows 3-5. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t see another 3 ring around, which is interesting since output2 only keeps that 3 cluster. \n\nIt seems there\u2019s a contradiction about keeping duplicates. Maybe I should consider a new rule: keep the colors unique within larger clusters. For Input2, color 3\u2019s cluster is the only multiple cell structure. On the flip side, there are many clusters of color 2. \n\nI might want to think about eliminating the most frequent color instead. In Input1, color 6 occurs several times while color 8 appears eight times. I should be counting those clusters accurately, especially checking the smallest nonzero counts for color retention.**Counting color occurrences**\n\nI'm trying to count how many times color 6 appears. It looks like it shows up in several places: 1 in row 1, 1 in row 2, and so on, totaling maybe more than 8. It seems they removed the color with the highest count and kept a medium one instead. \n\nIn Input2, there might be many colors 2 and 4, but only a few of color 3. The output retains shapes that are larger and more compact, so maybe I should consider keeping shapes that are contiguous and size >= 4. \n\nIn Input1, both blocks of color 8 are 2x2, which they kept. However, color 6 appears in smaller clusters, none being >= 4, which explains its removal. Meanwhile, in Input2, the color 3 cluster is sizable enough at 8, so it\u2019s retained.**Analyzing color clusters**\n\nI noticed that some 2 clusters of size 3 are preserved, like the triple of 2s at row 9, columns 23-25. Even though it's smaller than 4, they still kept it. I wonder if there are neighboring 2s that could make it a size 4. I'll check Input2 around rows 9-11 for that. \n\nHowever, when I look over the initial rows, especially row 1, I see zeros and a 4 at column 16 and a 2 at column 19, but it's a bit messy. Parsing through this data is taking a while! Maybe it\u2019d be easier to consider a pattern like removing colors that appear in an odd number of connected components.**Evaluating preservation rules for shapes**\n\nI\u2019m checking the output for training2 to see if it retains shapes at specific coordinates like rows 9-11 and columns 23-25. It seems a 2 cluster is preserved in a few places, although I wonder if there could be a neighboring 2s forming a size 4 cluster.\n\nLooking through Output2, many rows are zeros except for a few 3-blocks. I\u2019ll list the non-zero rows to analyze. Rows 9-12 show a 2 cluster preserved. It seems like the patterns are forming hollow rectangles with borders filled and center zeros. \n\nThe goal is to remove colors that don\u2019t form rectangular frames while keeping those that do, including filled 2x2 squares and 3x3 shapes. Thus, I should focus on finding connected components that meet these criteria in the inputs.**Defining rules for shape preservation**\n\nI've decided that I should keep components that are exactly the border of their bounding rectangles. I\u2019m wondering if fully filled squares with h or w equal to 2 should also be included. It makes sense to set a requirement where the area of the bounding box should be at least 4.\n\nIn training1, I see that some components were removed because they weren\u2019t rectangular borders. To ensure we only keep valid components, I've set some conditions: their size must be >=4, and they need to match the perimeter of their bounding boxes.\n\nI\u2019ll iterate through the grid, flood fill per nonzero color, and check sizes, making sure to keep only valid components. Then, I\u2019ll implement the transformation function in code!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid transformations**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how the mirroring across the horizontal axis of the top-left section creates the bottom-left, producing row transformations like row 2 to 12 and row 3 to 11, which seems to generate 4s at specific coordinates. But the output indicates a change in the bottom-right, suggesting a mirror across both axes instead. I need to inspect the input examples, particularly for a vertical stripe and where the full rows might be located. It\u2019s a bit tricky, but fun to unravel!**Examining grid patterns**\n\nI see there are blocks of 7 in columns 1 and 2 in the middle rows (rows 3-5), and 5s in columns 6 and 7 around the center. In Input2, the 7 blocks at the left middle form a 3x3, while 5s fill the middle columns. The output changed the 7s to 5s, indicating a color replacement at symmetric positions relative to a central cross\u2014maybe column 4 and a central row. I suspect a full column of 2s, especially at column 4, but I need to confirm if there's a full row too!**Identifying grid patterns**\n\nI\u2019m noticing a vertical line of 2s at column 4 across all rows, which is consistent. I\u2019m also trying to see if there\u2019s a horizontal row of 4s in Input2. I'm unsure about the full rows at that point. It\u2019s clear that there's a full vertical stripe of color 2 and a full horizontal stripe dividing the grid into quadrants. Input1 had full row and column of 2s. I\u2019ll need to check specifically in Input2 for any complete rows!**Analyzing row and column patterns**\n\nI\u2019m checking Row 5, which lists as \"[0 7 7 0 2 4 5 5 4 2 0 7 7 0]\", and I notice it shows 14 columns. There are 2s at columns 4 and 9, but I wonder if there's any row containing all 2s. Row 6 doesn\u2019t have all 2s either, which complicates things! It seems like the symmetry in Input2 matters\u2014column indices from 0 to 13 with a height of 9. Columns 4 and 9 consistently show 2s, so maybe those are my vertical pillars!**Identifying patterns and symmetry**\n\nI see two vertical stripes of 2s creating symmetric axes, with blocks of 4 and 5 between them. This makes me think about the central axis between columns 4 and 9, which seems to be the focal point here. Now in Input1, there were full vertical and horizontal lines of 2s. In Input2, I found full vertical columns of 2 at row indices matching col4 and col9. \n\nBetween these, there are additional colors, particularly 5s and 4s. It looks like these configurations create a central block, so I'll need to replicate the shape of the 5s symmetrically across the two outer regions. That means I'll identify a distinct color block and replace the surrounding colors in other quadrants. \n\nFor Input3, I noticed a full row of 2s at row 5 and a full column of 4s in column 4 up to row 4. There\u2019s a vertical column of 2 across the grid, forming a cross with a horizontal row at row 5, defining quadrants. As for the smaller 3s, they've mirrored across the vertical axis in the output. So, the task will be to replicate unique colors from one quadrant into corresponding symmetric areas while ensuring they replace existing colors. \n\nTo summarize my approach: I\u2019ll define a clear algorithm. First, identify the consistent color (color 2) that crosses the axes, then determine the vertical axes that are filled with 2s. This will guide the rest of the transformation!**Analyzing grid configurations**\n\nI see that in these examples, there\u2019s either one vertical and one horizontal axis or two vertical axes, particularly in Input2 with full columns of 2s at col4 and col9. These columns create symmetric pairs, with a pattern forming between them. My plan is to identify all cells with color 2, as they partition the grid into regions.\n\nNext, I\u2019ll find bounding boxes for the 2s to determine the orientation of these lines. Input2 doesn\u2019t have any horizontal rows fully filled with 2s, which means I need to focus on the vertical columns instead. \n\nI\u2019ll analyze connected components of other colors within regions separated by these 2-lines. Identifying a unique \u201csource\u201d color in one region that isn\u2019t present in others seems crucial. In previous examples, this source was usually the color most frequently appearing without other colors.\n\nTo build the algorithm: \n1. Identify fully filled 2 columns and rows to separate rectangular regions.\n2. For each identified region, count color frequencies excluding 0 and 2.\n3. Determine which region has a unique non-2 color; this is the source color.\n4. In other regions with different non-zero colors, I'll replace them with the source color while keeping positions in shape.\n\nWe can also treat the target 2s as fill since they'll be on-axis but not in a strict sense. The mapping of mirrored regions across the axes will help facilitate this transformation, ensuring symmetry in the color replacements.**Implementing grid color replacement**\n\nI need to replace non-zero colors in regions defined by full-color 2 rows and columns with a source color. The idea is to identify the source color from regions that contain colors other than 0 and 2, copying those patterns into corresponding positions in other regions.\n\nFirst, I will read the grid into a list of lists and identify columns and rows entirely filled with the color 2. I'll then partition the grid using these indices into rectangular regions, excluding the separator lines. \n\nNext, I\u2019ll need to find the source color, which is the non-zero, non-axis color that appears most frequently in one specific region only, ignoring others. This source color will then replace non-zero cells in target regions that aren't part of the axes.\n\nThe replacement should take care not to modify the separator lines, ensuring we only change cells that meet the non-zero criteria while mirroring the corresponding target positions. It looks like I\u2019ll have to be thoughtful with how I pick the source color to ensure it fits these criteria while conforming to the necessary replacements correctly!**Defining color replacement criteria**\n\nI've established the condition for replacing cells \u2013 keep non-zero cells that aren't part of the separator lines or have the color 2. We want to ensure we're not overwriting important colors like 4. \n\nThe steps are to find the indices of separator rows and columns, then set up segments of rows and columns that exclude these. For each region I identify, I\u2019ll collect the non-zero colors and find one that appears uniquely to serve as the source color for replacement. \n\nI'll have to be cautious in replacements, ensuring only to target mirrored positions in corresponding regions while preserving specific shapes and not affecting unwanted colors existing elsewhere. This approach should streamline the mirroring and replacement process to correctly apply the source color.**Refining the algorithm steps**\n\nThe algorithm is coming together nicely! First, I\u2019ll identify the row and column segments in the grid, focusing on non-separator regions. Once I determine the source region where a unique color exists, I\u2019ll compute the offsets of non-zero positions within this source area.\n\nNext, for any target region, I\u2019ll decide on whether to mirror the row and/or column based on the identified separators. Then, I need to calculate target positions accordingly. As I implement this, I\u2019ll ensure to keep track of the source color, which must only be present in one region. I\u2019ll account for edge cases, ensuring we\u2019re only modifying relevant non-zero cells in the target areas. Finally, I\u2019ll code and test thoroughly!**Clarifying source color selection**\n\nI\u2019ll include all non-zero cells from the source region, but I'll avoid choosing 2 as the source color, as that's unlikely. For each target region that isn't the source, I\u2019ll determine if I need to flip the mapping depending on whether the target row equals the source row. \n\nFor each offset in the shape offsets, I\u2019ll compute the corresponding target offset using region sizes, then get the global coordinates. If the target cell is valid (not zero and not on a separator line), I will set it to the source color. \n\nFor edge cases with multiple unique source colors, I\u2019ll select the one with the smallest count. Now, it's time to implement and run some tests!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing shape preservation**\n\nI'm reviewing the data, specifically at rows 20-22 where I see \"2s\" preserved. The rule seems to indicate that I should identify connected components based on non-black colors and see if they form filled 3x3 or 2x2 shapes. During training, it looks like shapes that are entirely symmetrical, possibly both filled and hollow, are preserved. I noticed that the symmetric clusters, like the hollow 3x3 ring, are maintained. I'll dig deeper into how these are represented in Input2 and the significance of preserved shapes.**Examining cluster patterns**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing Input2 for two clusters and noting the presence of 3x3 filled patterns. For instance, in rows 20-22, the repeating values of \"2s\" form a ring shape. Specifically, rows 20 and 22 have \u201c2 2 2\u201d while row 21 has \u201c2 0 2,\u201d which confirms a ring formation. In addition, rows 9-11 show similar ring shapes. The preserved shapes in Input1 were 2x2 filled blocks, which are symmetric. So, the rule appears to be keeping only connected components that are rotationally symmetric at 90 degrees.**Assessing symmetry and preservation**\n\nI\u2019m observing that the six scattered components aren\u2019t symmetric, while the rings in Input2 are rotationally symmetric. I\u2019ve noticed some 4s and 2s that aren\u2019t symmetric being removed, but I see a 4 at row 9, column 14 that's retained. I wonder if this was part of a symmetric unit, like a 1x1, which is indeed rotationally symmetric and should be preserved. Yet, I thought singletons were removed in Input1. I need to check Input2 to see how many singletons of color 4 remain.**Investigating singleton preservation**\n\nI\u2019m looking closely at Output2, noticing that few 4s remain. For example, row 3 shows zeros where 4s were in the input. I found a 4 at row 9, column 14, and I'm wondering if it was part of a symmetric component in Input2. It seems isolated but is preserved in Output2. This raises a question since singleton 6s were removed in Input1. Maybe I should consider a different rule: identifying colors in clusters of size 4, arranged as 2x2 squares. I noticed that color 8 appears in two such squares.**Clarifying component preservation**\n\nI'm analyzing Output2, which retains colors forming 2x2 blocks, and I'm noticing how 4s appear. In Input2, I see rings formed by colors 3 and 2, but 4 appears scattered. A 4 at row 9, column 14 is preserved in Output2, which confuses me. I need to confirm whether it's part of a larger component or just isolated. \n\nThe patterns seem to indicate that only components of maximum size are retained, as shown through the rings of size 8. I suspect the 4s in Input2 might not fit that rule, as they don\u2019t form a significant cluster.**Defining preservation rules for shapes**\n\nI need to analyze Input2 to clarify why certain components, like the 4 at row9 col14, are preserved. This particular 4 appears isolated, but that seems inconsistent given the preservation rules I'm deducing. I wonder if only components fully surrounded by zeros or those with significant sizes are kept. \n\nIt looks like rings and color blocks play a role in component retention, where the output keeps shapes that are symmetric and significant in size. I should verify these preservation criteria across connected components, particularly focusing on rotational symmetry and excluding singletons. It seems the essence here is to retain meaningful clusters while ensuring shapes maintain rotational symmetry when mapped.**Preparing final code for shape preservation**\n\nI need to ensure that my code accounts for rotations by 180 and 270 degrees, too, while keeping a mark for passing checks. It's essential to create a new grid filled with zeros and then set the preserved coordinates back to their original colors. \n\nFor Input1, I plan to preserve 8 clusters, and for Input2, I want to maintain rings. As for singletons, I'm leaning towards not preserving them unless they meet a size requirement greater than 1. It\u2019s all coming together, so now I'm ready to craft the final code!",

      "reasoning": "**Analyzing input patterns**\n\nI\u2019m trying to detect patterns from the examples I've got. There appears to be a central vertical column of color 2 in all three inputs. It seems that column 7 has many occurrences of this color. There are 2x2 squares of color 4 at specific positions in input1. Interestingly, these squares moved or duplicated in the output. I need to clarify the differences between input1 and output1, especially focusing on row 2 and columns 11 and 12. It shows some color 2s in those areas.**Re-evaluating input patterns**\n\nI need to take a closer look at row 3 of Input1, which lists [0 0 4 4 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0]. In this row, columns 2-3 show color 4, while columns 11-12 display color 2, but in Output1, columns 11-12 change to 4. This suggests a swapping of colors between symmetric positions. Rows 11-12 show similar behavior, where 2s become 4s. It looks like there are small 2x2 blocks of color 4 on the left, mirrored on the right where color 2 was replaced by 4s. I'm curious about the same pattern in Input3!**Parsing Input3 patterns**\n\nIn Input3, I see color 3 cells at positions (1,2), (2,1), and maybe (2,9), which could form two diagonal pairs. It looks like Output3 changed some 7s to 3s, mirroring across the vertical axis. I need to examine Input3, which is an 11x11 grid. The central vertical stripe appears to be at column 5, confirmed by checking row 0. There\u2019s also a full horizontal stripe of 2s at row 5. Interesting\u20147s at (1,8) and (2,9) on the right side were replaced with 3s in the output!**Identifying transformations in colors**\n\nI noticed that in Input3, there were 7s at positions (8,1) and (9,2) on the left side, which changed to 3s in Output3. It seems I have a pattern here: color A (3) is located in the top-left quadrant while color B (7) appears in symmetric positions on the top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right. The transformation looks like it\u2019s replacing occurrences of color B with color A. However, in Input2, where 7 is in a 3x3 block, they get replaced with 5s instead.**Developing transformation algorithm**\n\nI\u2019ve identified a general rule for the transformation. There\u2019s a main vertical stripe of color (let\u2019s call it S), with other colored clusters surrounding it. The pattern typically copies colors from one side of the stripe to the mirrored positions on the other side. I need to identify two non-background colors on each side of the stripe\u2014one will replace occurrences on the opposite side. Input1 features color 2 as the stripe, which may correspond to 8 in tests.\n\nFirst, I\u2019ll find the stripe by checking columns with a full line of color. Then, I\u2019ll locate other non-zero colors to decide which gets propagated. I see specific colors like 4 on the left side and 2 on the right side. It seems the transformation replaces right-side colors that mirror existing patterns using color 4. For every non-stripe color, I'll compute mirrored positions and make changes to reflect the identified color across that vertical axis.**Validating color transformation rules**\n\nI see that in output3, row 8, column 1, changed from 7 to 3, but this doesn\u2019t follow the mirror logic I expected. I initially thought the change would apply only to mirrored positions, yet it seems all occurrences of 7 are replaced by 3 in any position. \n\nOverall, I\u2019m considering that the rule seems to target and replace occurrences of one color (let's call it the target color) with another. In Input3, 7 gets transformed into 3, while in Input2, 7 converts to 5. I noticed the principle: the color that appears in clusters on both sides of a central stripe is used for replacement in mirrored areas. When analyzing symmetry, it looks like they simply replaced all 7s with 3s, regardless of their original positions. \n\nFor Input1, I recall examining color 2 as a stripe color which turned into color 4. It\u2019s evident that I need a clearer identification process for which colors are replaced under specific conditions. In essence, I believe the best strategy is to detect the most frequently occurring color that appears symmetrically on both sides of the stripe then replace others based on its presence.**Clarifying color replacement rules**\n\nIn Input2 and Input3, I've noticed that 7s get replaced by 5s or 3s, while the stripe color 2 stays the same. This suggests I need to refine the replacement logic. I'm thinking of a rule where, for each non-background color on one side of the axis, I find the corresponding mirrored cell. If the mirrored cell differs, I might set both to the new color.\n\nHowever, I have to clarify why left-side occurrences of 7 were changed to 3 instead of behaving symmetrically. It seems 3 emerged as a dominant color to replace. I see both 3 and 7 have equal counts, leading me to wonder why 3 was chosen. Maybe it's about proximity to the stripe.\n\nIn Input2, 5 seems significant because it's centrally located, while 7s are more on the periphery. My emerging rule appears to focus on replacing colors on the far sides with colors from a central region adjacent to the stripe. \n\nI think the algorithm I\u2019m developing needs to involve setting mirrored positions based on the existence of colors on both sides. I\u2019ll have to double-check a few things to ensure I\u2019m accurately identifying the roles of each color in the process!**Re-evaluating Input3**\n\nI'm taking a close look at Input3. I see that the color 3 is only present at two locations, while 7 appears four times. Yet, in Output3, every 7 was replaced with a 3. This makes me think the rule might be to replace less frequent colors with their symmetric counterparts around the stripe. The symmetry seems crucial here since the arrangement forms little clusters.\n\nInterestingly, when examining patterns in Input1 and Input2, I notice that the idea of aligning colors across different quadrants might hold. Input2 had groups of 7s replaced with dominant 5s in a way that unifies them throughout respective sections. It's like they're creating a consistent color theme in clusters.\n\nI need to clarify the central cluster concept in Input3; it's less straightforward with the diagonal placements, unlike previous inputs. So I'm left considering if there's a way to define a central cluster across this grid when there isn't an obvious center. I'm feeling like I need further refinement to my approach!**Analyzing Color Clusters**\n\nI'm considering how to determine the master color in a cluster. It seems that the one touching the corner might be the key, similar to Input1's 4, Input2's 5, and Input3's 3. I wonder if there's a pattern to select the master color based on their symmetry across the stripe.\n\nIn Inputs, mirrored colors often replace their counterparts across stripes. For example, Input2 transformed various clusters to maintain central symmetry. I need to find a consistent rule about how colors relate to their positions in the grid as clusters. Confirming the diagonal versus horizontal alignment should help narrow down my approach!**Clarifying Transformation Logic**\n\nI'm simplifying the transformation process for non-stripe colors. The idea is to reflect colors across stripes and a center axis to achieve symmetry. For example, in Input2, when reflecting the 5s at columns 6-7 across the stripe at column 4, it replaces the left columns with 5s.\n\nIt seems there might be two vertical stripes in Input2, creating a midline for reflection. My goal is to accurately map how these colors shift across both stripes, ensuring that I replace the correct clusters without losing the overall structure!**Refining Reflection Algorithm**\n\nI'm refining the approach to reflect non-stripe colors across stripe columns. For Input1, I note there\u2019s a vertical stripe at column 7 and a horizontal stripe at row 7. In Input3, it\u2019s similar, with vertical and horizontal stripes at specific indices. The idea is to enable colors to propagate through multiple reflections across both stripes, filling all quadrants symmetrically.\n\nFor the implementation, I\u2019m considering identifying the rows and columns with a consistent stripe color. From there, I\u2019ll reflect the non-stripe colors across these axes to fill the mirrored positions iteratively until no changes occur. It seems straightforward yet complex at the same time!**Refining Reflection Logic**\n\nI'm focusing on identifying indices for rows and columns filled with the stripe color. The next step involves iteratively reflecting colors across these axes. For each colored cell that isn't a zero or the stripe color, I'll calculate a mirrored position and set that cell to the color of the original cell. \n\nWhile doing this, I have to be careful not to overwrite existing clusters of colors. It seems multiple reflections can propagate colors to other quadrants, but not all positions may need changing. I'll test the logic with examples like Input1 and Input3 to ensure it doesn\u2019t create unexpected results!**Examining Reflection Process**\n\nI'm analyzing how to reflect colors across vertical and horizontal axes to propagate them across quadrants. It seems that in Input1, reflecting original blobs might not create duplicates unintentionally. \n\nFor example, top-right 7 at (1,8) reflects to (1,2) where a 3 exists, indicating a pre-existing reflection. It looks like consecutive reflections can lead to 3s in bottom-left, but I didn't see that in Input1's output, which might mean it requires reflecting original colors without creating duplicates. Let's clearly define how reflections affect different cells and their positions to ensure the output remains accurate.**Analyzing Reflection Algorithm**\n\nI'm trying to clarify how horizontal and vertical axes affect color reflections in grid inputs. For Input3, I noticed a full horizontal stripe row allowing for reflection, while Input1 has similarities. It seems both inputs contain multiple stripe colors, which complicates the propagation process. \n\nOnly reflecting original colors is tricky; I need to ensure I don't overwrite zeros. The goal is to reflect non-zero colors across both axes, updating mirrored positions only if they\u2019re occupied. I'll outline the algorithm clearly for effective execution across different inputs.**Implementing Reflection on Grid**\n\nI'm considering using an original grid snapshot to avoid cascading changes while processing reflections. It seems modifications could overwrite targets used in other reflections, so a static snapshot is key. \n\nI'm thinking about how to determine axis rows and columns with non-zero values for processing. The approach is to create an output from this original and apply reflections based on source positions. I\u2019ll verify this reasoning with examples to ensure the implementation works smoothly across various inputs.",
