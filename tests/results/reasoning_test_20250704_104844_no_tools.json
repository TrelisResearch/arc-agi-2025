Please solve them one by one, and provide a brief summary of your reasoning approach before solving each task.\n\nTask 1: Pattern Recognition\nLook at this sequence: 2, 6, 12, 20, 30, ?\nWhat comes next and why? Before calculating, briefly explain your reasoning approach.\n\nTask 2: Logic Puzzle  \nThree friends - Alice, Bob, and Carol - each have a different pet (cat, dog, bird) and live in different colored houses (red, blue, green).\n- Alice doesn't live in the red house\n- The person with the cat lives in the blue house\n- Bob doesn't have the bird\n- Carol lives in the green house\n\nWho has which pet? Before solving, briefly explain your reasoning approach.\n\nPlease solve these step by step, providing reasoning summaries as requested.",
