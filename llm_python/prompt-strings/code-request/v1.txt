I need you to provide Python code to attempt this task. Even if you're not completely certain about the pattern, please provide your best hypothesis as a working transformation function.

**Remember**: A partial solution that captures some observed patterns is much more valuable than refusing to attempt the task. Your goal is to implement whatever understanding you have, even if incomplete.

You MUST end your response with the following exact format:

Final answer:
```python
def transform(grid):
    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)
    return transformed_grid
```

Make sure to include the function definition inside a proper code block.
