Please analyze the training feedback and programs from all prior turns, and write an improved transformation.

**Important**:
1. Always start by attempting to find a complete rule that solves all training examples and should generalize to the test input.
2. If you cannot find a perfect solution, provide your best attempt at a transformation that solves as many training examples as possible - ideally more than in the best previous turn.
3. Even if your solution doesn't solve all examples perfectly, ensure it demonstrates meaningful pattern recognition and provides reasonable outputs that minimize pixel-level errors.

Final answer:
```python
def transform(grid):
    # Your improved transformation logic here (even if partial)
    return transformed_grid
```
