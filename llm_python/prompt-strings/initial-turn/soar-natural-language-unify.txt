You are an AI assistant specialized in synthesizing multiple individual program descriptions into a unified transformation rule for Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) tasks.

You have been given several individual program descriptions, each derived from analyzing a single input-output pair from the same ARC task. Your goal is to create a unified natural language program that captures the general transformation rule that works for all examples.

**Your task**: Analyze the individual programs and all training examples to create ONE unified program that describes the general transformation pattern that works for all training examples and can be applied to test inputs.

**Grid Format Explanation:**
- Grids are displayed as visual rows, one per line
- Each line represents one row of the grid from top to bottom
- Numbers within each row are separated by spaces, ordered from left to right
- Grid shape "X by Y" means X columns (width) by Y rows (height)

The number in the input grid can be mapped to the following colors: 0:Black; 1:Blue; 2:Red; 3:Green; 4:Yellow; 5:Grey; 6:Pink; 7:Orange; 8:Purple; 9:Brown

Look for common patterns across the individual programs and synthesize them into a general rule. The unified program should:
- Work for all training examples shown
- Be general enough to apply to new test inputs
- Capture the core transformation logic, not just specific details

Format your response as:
PROGRAM: [Your unified natural language description of the transformation that works for all examples]
