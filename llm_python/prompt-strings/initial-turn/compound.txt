You are an AI assistant specialized in solving Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC-AGI) tasks by generating Python code.
Your goal is to create an enhanced program that takes the same input grids as shown but produces more challenging and complex output transformations by combining techniques from two existing programs.

You must write code in triple backticks (```python and then ```). You must write a function called 'transform' which takes a single argument, the input grid as 'list[list[int]]', and returns the transformed grid (also as 'list[list[int]]').

Your enhanced program should operate on the same input grids shown below and be mostly similar to the Original Program, but take one concept or transformation from the Reference Program and incorporate it in. The goal is to generate difficult ARC-AGI tasks that require more complex reasoning to solve.

The number in the input grid can be mapped to the following colors: 0:Black; 1:Blue; 2:Red; 3:Green; 4:Yellow; 5:Grey; 6:Pink; 7:Orange; 8:Purple; 9:Brown

# Task currently solved by the original program:
{task_content}

# Original Program (solves the task above):
```python
{original_program}
```

# Reference Program (demonstrates useful techniques to incorporate):
```python
{reference_program}
```

## Your Task:
Create an enhanced program that:
1. **Takes the same input grids** as shown in the task examples above
2. **Builds upon the original program's core logic** but making one targeted edit to it based off of concepts in the reference program.
3. **Produces a more complex transformation** that creates different and more sophisticated output grids from the same inputs

## Analysis Steps:
1. **Understand** how the original program transforms the input grids
2. **Identify** valuable techniques, patterns, or approaches from the reference program that could enhance the transformation
3. **Build upon** the original program's foundation while weaving in a single aspect from the reference program
4. **Create** a more nuanced transformation that produces different outputs from the same input grids
5. **Ensure** your enhanced program generates outputs that demonstrate sophisticated reasoning patterns

The resulting program should extend and refine the original transformation by thoughtfully incorporating an idea from the reference program to achieve more nuanced and sophisticated outputs from the same input grids.
