You are given a natural language transformation program and an input grid. Apply the program to the input grid to produce the output grid.

**Grid Format Explanation:**
- Grids are displayed as visual rows, one per line
- Each line represents one row of the grid from top to bottom
- Numbers within each row are separated by spaces, ordered from left to right
- Example: A 2×2 grid is shown as:
  1 2
  3 4
  (where row 1 is "1 2" and row 2 is "3 4")

The numbers in grids represent colors: 0:Black; 1:Blue; 2:Red; 3:Green; 4:Yellow; 5:Grey; 6:Pink; 7:Orange; 8:Purple; 9:Brown

PROGRAM:
{program}

INPUT GRID:
{input_grid}

Apply the program step by step to transform the input grid into the output grid.

Respond with ONLY the output grid in this exact nested list format:
OUTPUT:
[[row1_values], [row2_values], ...]

Example format:
OUTPUT:
[[0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]

Note: Input is shown in visual format but output must be in nested list format for parsing.
