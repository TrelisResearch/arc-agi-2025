      "reasoning": "**Examining ARC-AGI Transformations**\n\nI'm starting to look at the ARC-AGI tasks, focusing on the input-output transformations. My initial thought is that the goal is to shrink the grid. The first example shows a transformation from a 17x12 grid to a 5x6 grid. This indicates that the output size is a smaller grid size relative to the original input.\n\n\n**Decomposing Grid Relationships**\n\n\\n\\nI'm digging into the relationship between the input and output grids. Specifically, I am analyzing the way that the output is derived from the input. I'm focusing on how the values from the input grid are mapped to the output. For instance, I observe that in the initial input example, the output grid appears to be composed of elements that exist within the original, larger grid.\n\n\n**Inferring Transformation Rules**\n\n\\n\\nI am now working on generalizing a rule. Considering the output's size relative to the input, I've started investigating whether the output represents specific elements extracted from the original, focusing on the \"8 8\" blocks found in the input. My hypothesis is to understand how the \"purple squares\" are related to the output. It looks like these \"purple squares\" may have an anchoring role. The positions of these features seem related to the elements that are extracted to create the output.\n\n\n**Refining Pattern Recognition**\n\n\\n\\nI am now attempting to formalize a rule for ARC-AGI tasks. I've identified \"8 8\" blocks as a potentially significant feature, suspecting a relation between their location and the output. I'm evaluating the idea that the output values may be adjacent to or extracted from the vicinity of these blocks, or maybe a region that excludes the purple squares. Analyzing input-output pairs continues.\n\n\n**Testing the \"8 8\" Extraction**\n\n\\n\\nI've identified a potential rule: extract rows bracketed by \"8 8\" pairs, excluding the pairs themselves. This works perfectly in Input 3! Now, I'm testing this on Input 1 and Input 2. However, Input 1 doesn't have the same \"8 8\" pattern as input 3. This indicates a rule that involves \"8 8\" pairs is probably not the key to the problem.\n\n\n**Re-evaluating \"8 8\" Anchors**\n\n\\n\\nI've found an initial rule that works for Input 3, where output rows are between \"8 8\" blocks. Now I'm testing this hypothesis. I've analyzed Input 1, looking for rows that start and end with these \"8 8\" pairs. However, the data indicates the rule doesn't directly apply, with the 2x2 \"8 8\" blocks scattered. I will re-evaluate how the \"8 8\" blocks relate to the output, exploring whether adjacency or internal contents define the extraction process.\n\n\n**Defining Subgrid Extraction**\n\n\\n\\nI have formulated a likely rule. I will extract regions *between* vertically aligned \"8 8\" blocks, which are \"purple squares\", in the input. I am confident the output is composed of these extracted segments. After I found that pattern in Input 1, I tested and verified the rule. The cells extracted are the output grid. This seems to be the solution.\n\n\n**Finalizing the Solution**\n\n\\n\\nI've verified the rule successfully! It involves identifying \"8 8\" blocks, which serve as anchors. The output is formed by extracting the cells between these blocks, across two consecutive rows. I've tested it on the three input pairs. The outputs from my extraction process perfectly matched the solutions. I'm confident in this approach now.\n\n\n**Validating the Extraction**\n\n\\n\\nI am now verifying the effectiveness of my extraction rule with input pairs. Testing it on Input 2, I am looking for pairs of \"8 8\" anchors to define subgrid extraction. After cross-referencing the position of the purple squares to the output, I can confirm the extraction rule, which extracts the cells between the blocks across two adjacent rows, holds for Input 2.\n\n\n**Defining the Extraction Process**\n\n\\n\\nI have formulated a robust solution. My method involves identifying the 2x2 blocks of the color 8. The output is formed by extracting the values between these blocks across adjacent rows. I tested it on Input 1, input 2, and input 3. My extraction method produces outputs that perfectly matches the given solutions. I believe I have solved this class of task.\n\n\n**Formalizing ARC-AGI Rules**\n\n\\n\\nI'm now distilling the extraction procedure to its core. My rule states: Find those 2x2 blocks of color \"8,\" and derive the output grid. The output grid is composed of the cells in the rows *between* those blocks, the *same two consecutive* rows. This rule works for all the examples I've tested.\n\n\n**Synthesizing a Rule**\n\n\\n\\nI've now completely defined my extraction rule. My approach centers on identifying \"8 8\" blocks. The output is formed by pulling the values between these blocks across consecutive rows. I have verified that this method works with the three example pairs provided.\n\n\n**Identifying \"Purple\" Anchors**\n\n\\n\\nI've narrowed it down! The output grid is extracted between pairs of 2x2 \"8 8\" blocks, referred to as the purple squares, within consecutive rows. This produces the output. I confirmed that this pattern reliably produces the output values. I am ready to formalize the extraction process.\n\n\n**Synthesizing Extraction Rule**\n\n\\n\\nI've formalized the pattern: Identify 2x2 \"8 8\" blocks (\"purple squares\") and extract cells between them on the same two rows. Specifically, the output is composed of the cells between the pairs of \"purple squares,\" read across two consecutive rows. The rule is confirmed by analyzing the provided examples.\n\n\n**Synthesizing a Rule**\n\n\\n\\nI've now nailed it. I identify \"purple squares\", the 2x2 \"8 8\" blocks. I extract and output the cells between those \"purple squares\" across the two adjacent rows. The outputs exactly match the solutions for all provided pairs.\n\n\n**Identifying Extraction Regions**\n\n\\n\\nI am defining the extraction rules now. The consistent pattern has to do with the identification of  2x2 blocks, or \"purple squares.\" My plan is to focus on extracting values found between these \"purple squares\" across two consecutive rows. This seems to be the central procedure for generating output grids from the provided inputs.\n\n\n**Defining Cell Extraction**\n\n\\n\\nI am starting to think through the core logic for these ARC-AGI problems. I've observed that finding \"purple squares\", or 2x2 blocks of \"8 8\", is crucial. The output seems to be built by extracting segments that are framed by these \"purple squares\" on the same row. This is the main component.\n\n\n**Refining the Extraction Rule**\n\n\\n\\nI've been simplifying my extraction procedure. After testing, I know that the '8 8' pairs are the anchor points. Now, I am sure of a pattern, focusing on identifying 2x2 blocks in the input and extracting between them. Input 2 was the last test example. This gives a clear rule to define.\n\n\n**Synthesizing a Rule**\n\n\\n\\nI've distilled the process. Identify 2x2 \"8 8\" blocks and extract the values between them. The output comprises these extracted segments. This method explains all the examples, always yielding the correct output, because the \"purple squares\" are anchoring the extraction. I've also verified this method on all the input-output pairs provided.\n\n\n**Synthesizing a Rule**\n\n\\n\\nI've formalized the methodology. My rule revolves around \"purple squares,\" or 2x2 blocks. The output is formed by taking the elements between the pairs, and extracting them across the same two rows. This procedure accurately predicts the correct output for all examined examples.\n\n\n**Synthesizing a Rule**\n\n\\n\\nI've defined a comprehensive solution. I first check for rows bracketed by \"8 8\" pairs, extracting content between them for the output. If none exist, I identify 2x2 blocks of \"8 8\". Then I extract segments between pairs of those 2x2 blocks. The output is formed using a width-based consistency filter to keep segments of the same width.\n\n\n**Formalizing Extraction Process**\n\n\\n\\nI have now successfully described the approach. My rule identifies the 2x2 blocks of \"8,\" and then extracts the segments between them on the same two consecutive rows, if they exist. I have also verified this method. This provides the outputs of the input/output pairs. I've identified the extraction process and its conditions.\n\n\n**Formalizing the Approach**\n\n\\n\\nI've established a firm methodology for tackling these ARC-AGI challenges. My process begins by identifying either framed rows (rows starting and ending with \"8 8\" blocks, extracting the contents in between) or, if those aren't found, paired \"8 8\" blocks (2x2 squares), extracting the contents. Finally, I filter segments by a consistent width.\n\n\n**Finalizing Rule Formulation**\n\n\\n\\nI have now defined the essential processes for addressing ARC-AGI challenges. First, I inspect input rows for complete \"8 8\" frame patterns. If identified, the internal segments are extracted to produce the output. If \"frame rows\" are not found, I look for \"purple squares\", 2x2 \"8 8\" blocks, extracting segments between them on two rows, filtering for segments of equal width. This is the complete methodology.\n\n\n**Finalizing Rule Implementation**\n\n\\n\\nI have now finalized the essential steps. I first analyze input for rows framed by \"8 8\" blocks, extracting the contents between them if found, and generating the output. Failing that, I search for 2x2 blocks of color \"8,\" and extract the content between pairs. Finally, I apply a width filter to the resulting segments for output.\n\n\n**Defining Extraction Process**\n\n\\n\\nI have fully defined the procedure. First, I look for horizontal \"frame rows,\" extracting the contents between the \"8 8\" blocks. Then, if none, I look for \"purple squares\", 2x2 blocks of \"8 8,\" extracting the data between these, filtering by a consistent width. This accounts for all input examples.\n\n\n",
      "program": "The transformation rule processes the input grid to extract content located between patterns of the color 8 (purple). There are two types of patterns, and the rule prioritizes searching for full \"framed rows\" first.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1.  **Search for Framed Rows:**\n    Iterate through each row of the input grid. Identify any row `r` that meets two conditions:\n    *   It begins with two consecutive cells of color 8 (i.e., `grid[r][0]` and `grid[r][1]` are both 8).\n    *   It ends with two consecutive cells of color 8 (i.e., `grid[r][width-2]` and `grid[r][width-1]` are both 8, where `width` is the number of columns in the grid).\n    For each such \"framed row,\" extract the segment of cells starting from the third cell (column index 2) up to, but not including, the second-to-last cell (column index `width-2`).\n    If at least one such framed row is found, and all the extracted segments from these rows have the exact same width, then concatenate these segments vertically to form the final output grid. If this condition is met, the process stops here.\n\n2.  **Search for Inner-Frame Regions (if no Framed Rows were found in Step 1):**\n    If no framed rows were identified in Step 1, then proceed to this step.\n    Scan the input grid for pairs of 2x2 blocks of color 8 that are horizontally aligned on the same two consecutive rows.\n    Specifically, find a row `r` and column `c1` where a 2x2 block of 8s begins (i.e., `grid[r][c1]`, `grid[r][c1+1]`, `grid[r+1][c1]`, and `grid[r+1][c1+1]` are all 8).\n    Then, on the same rows `r` and `r+1`, find a second 2x2 block of 8s starting at column `c2`, where `c1 < c2`.\n    For each such identified pair of 2x2 blocks `(r, c1)` and `(r, c2)`:\n    *   Extract the segment of cells from row `r` that are located between these two 2x2 blocks. This segment includes cells from column `c1+2` up to column `c2-1`.\n    *   Similarly, extract the segment of cells from row `r+1` located between the two 2x2 blocks (from column `c1+2` to `c2-1`).\n    Collect all such 2-row segments.\n    Finally, filter this collection: retain only those 2-row segments whose width (number of columns) is identical to the width of the very first 2-row segment encountered during the scan.\n    Concatenate these filtered 2-row segments vertically to form the final output grid.",
