      "Observe grids have border of 0 (black) top and bottom rows with pattern of something else? In each input, there is a rectangular frame: top row: 0 at corners, then a color across (1,4,6 etc). bottom row similar with same color across and 0 at corners. Left column has 2's down left side, right column has another color (4,3,8?). Actually rightmost column has a color (4 in first, 3 in second, 8 in third). Inside there are scattered other colored cells (like 1,7,8, etc). Output seems to \"move\" some of those interior colored cells to a new location: For example Input1: interior includes a 1 at (0 row? Actually row0 col1-col10 are 1s border top). There's also a 1 at row9 col5 (value 1). In output, that 1 moved to row1 col5 (just inside left border). Also 7s originally at (2,9) and (9,8) maybe. In output they moved to bottom right area? Let's map.\n",

Let's examine: The 1 interior at (9,5) moved to (1,5). That's upward towards top edge (color 1). Indeed top edge is color 1, so the 1 moved upward to just below top edge (row1). Similarly the 7 interior at (2,9) moved to (10,8-9) maybe? Actually there were 7's at (2,9) and (9,8). Output shows 7's at (10,8) and (10,9)? Wait row10 index10 is second-last row before bottom. Row10 col8=7, col9=7 (matching bottom edge color 7). So the 7's moved downwards to just above bottom edge.\n",

Input grids are 23x5 etc, containing pattern: columns separated by column of 5 (color 5 = Grey) as separators, and rows have zeros and patterns. It seems each input encodes three separate subgrids (maybe three objects) arranged horizontally separated by column of 5. For Input1: shape 23x5: Actually grid shape 23 rows, 5 columns? Wait representation: [[0 0 ...] ...]. They show 23 by 5 meaning 23 columns? Actually they say grid shape: 23 by 5 (maybe width 23, height 5). The list of rows seems each row is length 23. Yes there are 5 rows. So width 23, height 5. So it's 5 rows of length 23. Within each row, there are patterns separated by column of 5 values (grey). So there are three sections (since two 5 separators?). Indeed pattern: first 5 columns zeros, then a 5, then next region, then 5, then region, then 5, then zeros. So maybe it's three 5x5 blocks? Let's examine Input1 rows: row2 (index1) has pattern 1 0 1 (vertical line) and 2 2 etc. Actually region after first 5 column: columns 7-... up to before second 5 is region for color 1/2 etc. So each region seems to contain shapes of a particular color: first region uses color 1 (blue) vertical line shape, second region uses color 2 (red) something, third region uses color 3 (green) block of three?

Could be using outer product: For each row in region1 (size 5) and each column in region2 (size 5) produce a cell. That would give 5x5 output maybe 25 not 9.\n",

Let's see width of each region likely 5 again? Input3 width 27, with separators at col6 and 13 and 20? Actually pattern: \"5\" separators. So each region width 5. Region3 is columns after second separator? In Input3, there are colors 7 (region3) maybe 4x4 block? Let's check rows for region3: Row1: 7 7 7 7, row2: 7 7 7 7, row3: 7 7 7 7, row4: 7 7 7 7, row5 zeros. That's a 4x4 block of 7s (since region width maybe 4? Actually there are four 7s per row). Similarly region4 (color8) also 4x4 block. So block size 4x4. Output size 16x16 = 4*4. So scaling factor is block size (N) times itself to get N^2 dimension.\n",

Wait N=3 gives 9x9 which is 3*3 both dimensions = 9, yes N^2=9. N=4 gives 16=4*4 = N^2. So output size = N^2 by N^2 (square). Good.\n",

Actually region1 appears to have a plus shape spanning 3 rows, 3 columns? Let's map region1 5x5 but maybe non-zero cells are within central 3x3 area (since zeros border).
