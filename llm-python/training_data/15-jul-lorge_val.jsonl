{"messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert at solving abstract reasoning puzzles. Write clean, efficient Python code."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You are solving an ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) task. \nI will show you training examples with input and output grids, plus a test input grid. Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 9\u00d73 output grid.**\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 1 0\n1 1 0\n0 1 0\n0 1 1\n0 1 0\n1 1 0\nOutput:\n0 2 0\n2 2 0\n0 2 0\n0 2 2\n0 2 0\n2 2 0\n0 2 0\n2 2 0\n0 2 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 1 0\n1 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 1\n0 1 0\n1 0 1\nOutput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 2\n0 2 0\n2 0 2\n0 2 0\n2 0 2\n0 2 0\n2 0 2\n0 2 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 1 0\n1 1 0\n0 1 0\n0 1 0\n1 1 0\n0 1 0\nOutput:\n0 2 0\n2 2 0\n0 2 0\n0 2 0\n2 2 0\n0 2 0\n0 2 0\n2 2 0\n0 2 0\n\nTest Input:\n1 1 1\n0 1 0\n0 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 1 0\n0 1 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Transform each row by replacing 1s with 2s\n    transformed_rows = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = [2 if x == 1 else x for x in row]\n        transformed_rows.append(new_row)\n    # Output is transformed_rows followed by the first three transformed rows\n    output = transformed_rows + transformed_rows[:3]\n    return output\n```"}]}
