just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    input_rows = len(grid)\n    input_cols = len(grid[0])\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(19)]\n    for r in range(19):\n        output_grid[r][9] = 4\n    for c in range(19):\n        output_grid[9][c] = 4\n    for r in range(input_rows):\n        for c in range(input_cols):\n            value = grid[r][c]\n            if r < 19:\n                if value != 0:\n                    output_grid[r][c] = value\n                if value != 0 and c < 9:\n                    if c + 10 < 19:\n                        output_grid[r][c + 10] = value\n    return output_grid\n```"}]}

just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    H_in = len(grid)\n    W_in = len(grid[0]) if H_in > 0 else 0\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(19)]\n    for i in range(19):\n        output_grid[9][i] = 4\n        output_grid[i][9] = 4\n    for r_in in range(H_in):\n        for c_in in range(W_in):\n            val = grid[r_in][c_in]\n            if r_in < 19 and c_in < 19:\n                output_grid[r_in][c_in] = val\n            if r_in < 9 and c_in < 9 and val != 0:\n                output_grid[r_in + 10][c_in] = val\n                output_grid[r_in][c_in + 10] = val\n                output_grid[r_in + 10][c_in + 10] = val\n    return output_grid\n```"}]}

just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    input_height = len(grid)\n    input_width = len(grid[0])\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(19)]\n    h_div_in = -1 \n    v_div_in = -1 \n    for r_check in range(input_height):\n        is_h_line = True\n        for c_check in range(input_width):\n            if grid[r_check][c_check] != 4:\n                is_h_line = False\n                break\n        if is_h_line and input_width > 0:\n            h_div_in = r_check\n            break\n    for c_check in range(input_width):\n        is_v_line = True\n        for r_check in range(input_height):\n            if grid[r_check][c_check] != 4:\n                is_v_line = False\n                break\n        if is_v_line and input_height > 0:\n            v_div_in = c_check\n            break\n    if h_div_in != -1:\n        for c_out in range(19):\n            output_grid[9][c_out] = 4\n    if v_div_in != -1:\n        for r_out in range(19):\n            output_grid[r_out][9] = 4\n    for r in range(input_height):\n        for c in range(input_width):\n            value = grid[r][c]\n            if value != 0 and value != 4: \n                if r < 19 and c < 19:\n                    output_grid[r][c] = value\n                if v_div_in != -1:\n                    if r < h_div_in and c < v_div_in:\n                        if c + 10 < 19:\n                            output_grid[r][c + 10] = value\n                    elif r > h_div_in and c < v_div_in:\n                        if r -

just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    R_in = len(grid)\n    C_in = len(grid[0])\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(19)]\n    for c in range(19):\n        transformed_grid[9][c] = 4\n    for r in range(19):\n        transformed_grid[r][9] = 4\n    col_9_is_full_4s = False\n    if C_in > 9:\n        pass\n    for r_in in range(R_in):\n        for c_in in range(C_in):\n            value = grid[r_in][c_in]\n            if value != 0 and value != 4:\n                if r_in < 19 and c_in < 19:\n                    transformed_grid[r_in][c_in] = value\n                if r_in < 9 and c_in < 9:\n                    if r_in + 10 < 19:\n                        transformed_grid[r_in + 10][c_in] = value\n                elif r_in > 9 and c_in < 9:\n                    if c_in + 10 < 19:\n                        transformed_grid[r_in][c_in + 10] = value\n    return transformed_grid\n```"}]}

just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    R_in = len(grid)\n    C_in = len(grid[0])\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(19)]\n    for i in range(19):\n        output_grid[9][i] = 4\n        output_grid[i][9] = 4\n    has_bottom_left_active = False\n    if R_in >= 10:\n        for r_in in range(10, min(R_in, 19)):\n            for c_in in range(min(C_in, 9)):\n                if grid[r_in][c_in] != 0 and grid[r_in][c_in] != 4:\n                    has_bottom_left_active = True\n                    break\n            if has_bottom_left_active:\n                break\n    if has_bottom_left_active:\n        for r_in in range(10, min(R_in, 19)):\n            for c_in in range(min(C_in, 9)):\n                val = grid[r_in][c_in]\n                if val != 0 and val != 4:\n                    r_out = r_in -

Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 7 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 7 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 2 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 2 0 0 0 5 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    R = len(grid)\n    C = len(grid[0])\n    N_ROWS_OUT = 19\n    N_COLS_OUT = 19\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(N_COLS_OUT)] for _ in range(N_ROWS_OUT)]\n    for j in range(N_COLS_OUT):\n        transformed_grid[9][j] = 4\n    if C == 19:\n        for r in range(min(R, N_ROWS_OUT)):\n            for c in range(min(C, N_COLS_OUT)):\n                if c == 9 and grid[r][c] == 4:\n                    transformed_grid[r][c] = 4\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n        for r in range(9):\n            for c in range(9):\n                if grid[r][c] != 0:\n                    transformed_grid[r][c + 10] = grid[r][c]\n                    transformed_grid[r][c] = 0\n    else:\n        for r in range(9):\n            if r >= R: continue\n            for c in range(min(C, N_COLS_OUT)):\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n        for r_out in range(10, N_ROWS_OUT):\n            r_in = r_out -

just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    R_in = len(grid)\n    C_in = len(grid[0])\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(19)]\n    for r in range(R_in):\n        for c in range(C_in):\n            output_grid[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n    for i in range(19):\n        output_grid[9][i] = 4\n        output_grid[i][9] = 4\n    if C_in == 19:\n        for r in range(10, 19):\n            for c in range(9):\n                if grid[r][c] != 0:\n                    output_grid[r -

just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows_in = len(grid)\n    cols_in = len(grid[0])\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(19)]\n    for r in range(min(rows_in, 19)):\n        for c in range(min(cols_in, 19)):\n            output_grid[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n    h_line_rows = []\n    for r in range(min(rows_in, 19)):\n        is_h_line = True\n        if min(cols_in, 19) == 0: \n            is_h_line = False\n        else:\n            for c_check in range(min(cols_in, 19)):\n                if grid[r][c_check] != 4:\n                    is_h_line = False\n                    break\n        if is_h_line:\n            h_line_rows.append(r)\n    v_line_cols = []\n    for c in range(min(cols_in, 19)):\n        is_v_line = True\n        if min(rows_in, 19) == 0:\n             is_v_line = False\n        else:\n            for r_check in range(min(rows_in, 19)):\n                if grid[r_check][c] != 4:\n                    is_v_line = False\n                    break\n        if is_v_line:\n            v_line_cols.append(c)\n    for h_line_row in h_line_rows:\n        row_shift_amount = h_line_row + 1\n        for r_src in range(h_line_row):\n            r_tgt = r_src + row_shift_amount\n            if r_tgt < 19: \n                for c in range(19): \n                    if output_grid[r_src][c] != 0 and output_grid[r_src][c] != 4:\n                        output_grid[r_tgt][c] = output_grid[r_src][c]\n    v_line_cols.sort() \n    for v_line_col in v_line_cols:\n        col_shift_amount = v_line_col + 1\n        for c_src in range(v_line_col):\n            c_tgt = c_src + col_shift_amount\n            if c_tgt < 19: \n                for r in range(19):\n                    if output_grid[r][c_src] != 0 and output_grid[r][c_src] != 4:\n                        output_grid[r][c_tgt] = output_grid[r][c_src]\n    return output_grid\n```"}]}

just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    input_rows = len(grid)\n    input_cols = len(grid[0])\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(19)]\n    for i in range(19):\n        output_grid[i][9] = 4\n        output_grid[9][i] = 4\n    for r_src in range(9):\n        for c_src in range(9):\n            val = 0\n            if r_src < input_rows and c_src < input_cols:\n                val = grid[r_src][c_src]\n            if val != 0 :\n                output_grid[r_src][c_src] = val\n                output_grid[r_src][c_src + 10] = val\n                output_grid[r_src + 10][c_src] = val\n                output_grid[r_src + 10][c_src + 10] = val\n    return output_grid\n```"}]}

just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    input_rows = len(grid)\n    input_cols = len(grid[0])\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(19)]\n    for c in range(19):\n        output_grid[9][c] = 4\n    for r in range(19):\n        output_grid[r][9] = 4\n    move_behavior = (input_cols >= 10)\n    for r in range(min(input_rows, 19)):\n        for c in range(min(input_cols, 19)):\n            output_grid[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n    if move_behavior:\n        for r in range(input_rows):\n            for c in range(9):\n                if r != 9 and grid[r][c] != 0:\n                    output_grid[r][c + 10] = grid[r][c]\n                    output_grid[r][c] = 0\n    else:\n        for r in range(input_rows):\n            for c in range(input_cols):\n                if r != 9 and grid[r][c] != 0:\n                    output_grid[r][c + 10] = grid[r][c]\n    return output_grid\n```"}]}

just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    input_height = len(grid)\n    input_width = len(grid[0])\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(19)]\n    for r in range(19):\n        output_grid[r][9] = 4\n    for c in range(19):\n        output_grid[9][c] = 4\n    source_data = [] \n    if input_width == 19:\n        r_sq_start = 10\n        c_sq_start = 0\n        for r_in in range(r_sq_start, r_sq_start + 9):\n            for c_in in range(c_sq_start, c_sq_start + 9):\n                if grid[r_in][c_in] != 0:\n                    val = grid[r_in][c_in]\n                    r_rel = r_in -

just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows_in = len(grid)\n    cols_in = len(grid[0])\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(19)]\n    for i in range(19):\n        output_grid[9][i] = 4\n        output_grid[i][9] = 4\n    if cols_in == 19:\n        for r_in in range(10, rows_in):\n            for c_in in range(9):\n                val = grid[r_in][c_in]\n                if val != 0 and val != 4:\n                    output_grid[r_in][c_in] = val\n                    output_grid[r_in][c_in + 10] = val\n                    output_grid[r_in -

just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    H_in = len(grid)\n    W_in = len(grid[0])\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(19)]\n    has_vertical_4_line = False\n    if W_in > 9:\n        if grid[9][9] == 4 and W_in == 19:\n            has_vertical_4_line = True\n    for c in range(19):\n        output_grid[9][c] = 4\n    if has_vertical_4_line:\n        for r in range(19):\n            output_grid[r][9] = 4\n        for r in range(9):\n            for c in range(9):\n                output_grid[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n        for r in range(10, 19):\n            for c in range(9):\n                output_grid[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n        for r_in in range(10, 19):\n            for c_in in range(9):\n                r_out = r_in -

write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n8 7 8 7 8 7 8\n0 7 8 7 8 7 0\n0 0 8 7 8 0 0\n0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n7 8 7 8 7 8 7 0\n7 8 7 8 7 8 0 0\n7 8 7 8 7 0 0 0\n0 8 7 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    seven_coords = []\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 7:\n                seven_coords.append((r, c))\n    if not seven_coords:\n        return [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n    source_col = seven_coords[0][1] \n    lowest_seven_r = 0\n    for r, c in seven_coords:\n        if r > lowest_seven_r:\n            lowest_seven_r = r\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            row_diff = lowest_seven_r - r\n            col_diff = abs(c - source_col)\n            if row_diff >= 0 and col_diff <= row_diff:\n                if col_diff % 2 == 0:\n                    output_grid[r][c] = 7\n                else:\n                    output_grid[r][c] = 8\n    return output_grid\n```"}]}

the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in

the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 23\u00d723 output grid.**\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process.

the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return

the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return

the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\nimport collections\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    output_grid =

Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\nimport collections\ndef transform(grid):\n    color_counts =

patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    min_r,

Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here

patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    r_max =

positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    num_rows = len(grid)\n    num_cols = len(grid[0])\n

Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here

examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact

Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant",

just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\nimport collections\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    visited = set()\n    solid_rectangles = []\n    def is_valid(r, c):\n        return 0 <= r < rows and 0 <= c < cols\n    def get_connected_component_bbox_and_cells(start_r, start_c):\n        q = collections.deque([(start_r, start_c)])\n        visited.add((start_r, start_c))\n        component_cells = []\n        min_r, max_r = start_r, start_r\n        min_c, max_c = start_c, start_c\n        while q:\n            r, c = q.popleft()\n            component_cells.append((r, c))\n            min_r = min(min_r, r)\n            max_r = max(max_r, r)\n            min_c = min(min_c, c)\n            max_c = max(max_c, c)\n            for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                if is_valid(nr, nc) and grid[nr][nc] != 0 and (nr, nc) not in visited:\n                    visited.add((nr, nc))\n                    q.append((nr, nc))\n        return min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c, component_cells\n    def is_solid_rectangle(bbox):\n        min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c = bbox\n        for r in range(min_r, max_r + 1):\n            for c in range(min_c, max_c + 1):\n                if grid[r][c] == 0:\n                    return False\n        return True\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] != 0 and (r, c) not in visited:\n                min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c, _ = get_connected_component_bbox_and_cells(r, c)\n                bbox_dims = (min_r, min_c, max_r, max_c)\n                if is_solid_rectangle(bbox_dims):\n                    current_subgrid = []\n                    for sr in range(min_r, max_r + 1):\n                        current_subgrid.append(grid[sr][min_c : max_c + 1])\n                    solid_rectangles.append((min_r, min_c, max_r + 1 -

rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou

rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return

rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return

just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\nimport collections\ndef transform(grid):\n    input_rows = len(grid)\n    input_cols = len(grid[0])\n    output_rows = 5\n    output_cols = 10\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(output_cols)] for _ in range(output_rows)]\n    blocks = []\n    visited = [[False for _ in range(input_cols)] for _ in range(input_rows)]\n    all_nonzero_cells = []\n    for r in range(input_rows):\n        for c in range(input_cols):\n            if grid[r][c] != 0:\n                all_nonzero_cells.append(r)\n            if grid[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:\n                color = grid[r][c]\n                block_cells = []\n                q = collections.deque([(r, c)])\n                visited[r][c] = True\n                min_r, max_r = r, r\n                min_c, max_c = c, c\n                current_block_coords = []\n                while q:\n                    curr_r, curr_c = q.popleft()\n                    current_block_coords.append((curr_r, curr_c))\n                    min_r = min(min_r, curr_r)\n                    max_r = max(max_r, curr_r)\n                    min_c = min(min_c, curr_c)\n                    max_c = max(max_c, curr_c)\n                    for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                        nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n                        if 0 <= nr < input_rows and 0 <= nc < input_cols and \\\n                           grid[nr][nc] == color and not visited[nr][nc]:\n                            visited[nr][nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr, nc))\n                if (max_r -

just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    R, C = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    output_grid = [[0 for _ in range(C)] for _ in range(R)]\n    def find_objects(input_grid):\n        visited = [[False for _ in range(C)] for _ in range(R)]\n        objects = []\n        for r in range(R):\n            for c in range(C):\n                if input_grid[r][c] != 0 and not visited[r][c]:\n                    component_pixels = []\n                    q = [(r, c)]\n                    visited[r][c] = True\n                    min_r, max_r = r, r\n                    min_c, max_c = c, c\n                    head = 0\n                    while head < len(q):\n                        curr_r, curr_c = q[head]\n                        head += 1\n                        component_pixels.append((curr_r, curr_c))\n                        min_r = min(min_r, curr_r)\n                        max_r = max(max_r, curr_r)\n                        min_c = min(min_c, curr_c)\n                        max_c = max(max_c, curr_c)\n                        for dr, dc in [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]:\n                            nr, nc = curr_r + dr, curr_c + dc\n                            if 0 <= nr < R and 0 <= nc < C and input_grid[nr][nc] != 0 and not visited[nr][nc]:\n                                visited[nr][nc] = True\n                                q.append((nr, nc))\n                    obj_height = max_r -

just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Final answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if r < 13 and c < 13:\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n    best_h_row_idx = -1\n    best_h_color = -1\n    max_h_color_cells = 0\n    for r_idx in range(rows):\n        row_counts = {}\n        for val in grid[r_idx]:\n            if val != 0:\n                row_counts[val] = row_counts.get(val, 0) + 1\n        if row_counts:\n            most_freq_val = max(row_counts, key=row_counts.get)\n            if row_counts[most_freq_val] > max_h_color_cells:\n                max_h_color_cells = row_counts[most_freq_val]\n                best_h_color = most_freq_val\n                best_h_row_idx = r_idx\n    h_line_start_row = -1\n    h_line_end_row = -1\n    if best_h_row_idx != -1:\n        current_row = best_h_row_idx\n        while current_row >= 0:\n            row_colors = {}\n            for val in grid[current_row]:\n                if val != 0:\n                    row_colors[val] = row_colors.get(val, 0) + 1\n            if (best_h_color in row_colors and row_colors[best_h_color] > cols // 3) or \\\n               (sum(row_colors.values()) > cols // 3 and best_h_color not in row_colors and len(row_colors) == 1):\n                h_line_start_row = current_row\n                current_row -= 1\n            else:\n                break\n        current_row = best_h_row_idx\n        while current_row < rows:\n            row_colors = {}\n            for val in grid[current_row]:\n                if val != 0:\n                    row_colors[val] = row_colors.get(val, 0) + 1\n            if (best_h_color in row_colors and row_colors[best_h_color] > cols // 3) or \\\n               (sum(row_colors.values()) > cols // 3 and best_h_color not in row_colors and len(row_colors) == 1):\n                h_line_end_row = current_row\n                current_row += 1\n            else:\n                break\n    h_thickness = 0\n    if h_line_start_row != -1 and h_line_end_row != -1:\n        h_thickness = h_line_end_row -
