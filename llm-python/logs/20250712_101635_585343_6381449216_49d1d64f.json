          "Analyzing the training examples, the key observations are:\n\n- The output grid is always 4\u00d74.\n- The input grids vary in size and layout.\n- The outputs seem to incorporate boundary framing with zeros (black or 0), and the interior appears to include the original values, sometimes extended with additional colors.\n- From the examples, a pattern emerges where the transformation includes:\n  - Embedding the input in a larger 4\u00d74 grid.\n  - Surrounding the original input with zeros (black boundary).\n  - Filling additional cells with certain values resembling the original input's min, max, or existing patterns.\n- The third example hints at a kind of mirroring or extending pattern, with the output embedding input in a 4\u00d74 frame, perhaps with some extension or padding based on the input.\n\nThough the exact pattern isn't fully explicit, the best educated guess based on the provided data is:\n\n**Transform the input into a 4\u00d74 grid by:**\n- Creating a skeleton 4\u00d74 filled with zeros.\n- Placing the original input in a corner or central position.\n- Filling remaining spaces with the min or max of the original input, or some extension.\n\nGiven the test input:\n```\n2 8\n1 4\n3 4\n```\n\nand the pattern in previous examples, the best approximation is:\n\n- Create a 4\u00d74 grid.\n- Map the input in a specific corner (e.g., top-left), or centered.\n- Fill missing spots with zeros or min/max values.\n\nHere's a code implementation that:\n- Places the input at the top-left corner of a 4\u00d74 grid.\n- Fills remaining cells with zeros.\n- Attempts to match the general pattern observed.\n\n**Note**: Since the data isn't perfectly explicit, this will be an educated attempt.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    # Initialize a 4x4 grid filled with zeros\n    result = np.zeros((4,4), dtype=int)\n    input_rows = len(grid)\n    input_cols = len(grid[0]) if input_rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Place the input in the top-left corner of the 4x4 grid\n    for r in range(input_rows):\n        for c in range(input_cols):\n            if r < 4 and c < 4:\n                result[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n    \n    # Optional: further enhancement could fill remaining cells with min or max of input values,\n    # but for simplicity, just leave zeros.\n    return result.tolist()\n```\n\nThis approach is a minimal, reasonable assumption: embed the input into the output grid, preserving its structure at the top-left, and fill the rest with zeros, consistent with boundary framing and padding observed.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize a 4x4 grid filled with zeros\n    result = np.zeros((4,4), dtype=int)\n    input_rows = len(grid)\n    input_cols = len(grid[0]) if input_rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Place the input in the top-left corner of the 4x4 grid\n    for r in range(input_rows):\n        for c in range(input_cols):\n            if r < 4 and c < 4:\n                result[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n    \n    # Return as list of lists\n    return result.tolist()\n```"
