              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out what's going on here. I need to analyze the training examples and come up with a transformation function that maps input grids to output grids. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput has a complex pattern with numbers increasing and then some parts with zeros. The output seems to take the top part of the input and mirror it in some way, but not sure. Wait, maybe the output is a combination of the original grid's top sections and mirrored versions? Or maybe the output is the same as the input but with some parts rotated or reflected?\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input and output. The input has a section where numbers increase up to 5 and then some zeros, but the output seems to have the same numbers but arranged differently. Wait, maybe the output is a combination of the original grid's top-left section and mirrored versions? Or maybe the output is a transformation that takes the original grid and flips parts of it vertically and horizontally?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's input and output: The input has some sections where numbers increase and then zeros, but the output seems to have those sections repeated in a mirrored way. For example, the bottom part of the input has some numbers that are mirrored in the output. Maybe the transformation is taking the original grid and reflecting it vertically or horizontally in certain regions?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has a pattern where numbers increase in a certain way, and the output seems to have those patterns mirrored. For example, the input's bottom part has numbers 1-7 in reverse order, and the output has them mirrored again. Maybe the transformation involves reflecting certain parts of the grid, or rotating it.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output grid is 18x18. The input grid in the training examples is also 18x18. Wait, the test input is 18x18 as well. So the transformation function must always return a 18x18 grid.\n\nWait, but looking at the test input, the output is not shown. But the test input is given to help understand the pattern. Let's see what the test input looks like. The test input has a section where numbers increase up to 9, then some zeros, then a mirrored section with numbers decreasing again. The output for the test input is not shown, but based on the training examples, maybe the transformation involves some reflection or mirroring.\n\nAnother approach: Look for patterns in the positions of numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have the original numbers in the top-left part and then mirrored versions in the bottom. Wait, maybe the transformation is a combination of flipping the grid vertically and horizontally. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput's first few rows have numbers increasing, then zeros, then some numbers again. The output seems to take the original numbers and mirror them in some way. For instance, the output in Example 1 seems to have the same numbers but arranged in a way that reverses certain parts.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is a reflection over the vertical axis. Let me check. For example, in Example 1, the input's first row is 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1... and the output's first row is 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1... which is the same as the original's first row, but maybe some parts are mirrored. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves taking certain parts of the grid and reflecting them. For example, in Example 2's input, the output seems to take the original's top part and mirror it. For example, the input's top rows have numbers increasing, and the output mirrors those numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping the grid vertically, then horizontally, then rotating. But I need to look for patterns that repeat across multiple examples.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output grid seems to have certain sections that repeat the input's numbers in a mirrored fashion. For example, in Example 1's output, the first part of the grid is the same as the input's first part, but then some sections are mirrored. Maybe the transformation is a combination of flipping the grid vertically and then mirroring certain parts.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 3's input and output: The input's bottom part has numbers that are mirrored in the output. For example, in the input's bottom rows, numbers go 1-7 and then some zeros, while the output's bottom rows have those numbers reversed again. Maybe the transformation involves reflecting the grid vertically and then horizontally.\n\nBut how can I code this? Let's think of possible transformations that could achieve this.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the transformation is to take the original grid and reflect it vertically and horizontally. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, if we take the original grid and flip it vertically, then horizontally, would that match the output? Let's see.\n\nOriginal input for Example 1:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nRow 1: 1 2 3 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3\n...\nRow 17: 1 3 5 2 4 1 3 5 2 4 1 3 5 2 4 1 3 5\n\nIf we flip vertically (reverse the order of rows), then flip horizontally (reverse each row), would that match the output?\n\nThe output of Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nRow 1: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3\nRow 2: 1 3 5 2 4 1 3 5 2 4 1 3 5 2 4 1 3 5\n...\nRow 17: 1 3 5 2 4 1 3 5 2 4 1 3 5\n\nWait, the output seems to have the input's top part mirrored. For example, in the output, the first few rows are the same as the input's first few rows but with numbers increasing in a certain way. It's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 3's input and output. The input's bottom rows have numbers like 1-7, then some zeros, then mirrored numbers. The output seems to have those mirrored again. Maybe the transformation is a combination of flipping the grid vertically and then horizontally.\n\nBut how can I code this? Let's think about possible transformations.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the transformation is a reflection over the vertical axis. For example, each row is reversed. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row is 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1... If reversed, it would be 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1... which is similar to the output's first row. But the output's first row is all 1s. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is a reflection over the vertical axis followed by some other operations. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is a rotation of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input's pattern. The test input has numbers increasing up to 9 in the top part, then some zeros, then mirrored numbers. The output (which we don't see) may involve reversing parts of the grid.\n\nAnother possible pattern: The output seems to take the original grid and mirror certain sections. For example, in Example 1, the output has the same numbers as the input but mirrored in certain regions. Maybe the transformation is to take the original grid and reflect it vertically and horizontally.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to take the original grid and flip it vertically, then flip it horizontally, and then rotate it. But without seeing the output for the test input, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1: the output is the same as the input's first part, but with some parts reversed. For example, the first row of output is all 1s, which is the same as the original's first row. So maybe the transformation is to take the original grid and somehow mirror certain parts, but not the entire grid.\n\nThis is challenging. Let's think of what transformations are common in ARC tasks. Common operations include flipping, rotating, translating, scaling, reflecting, combining shapes, etc.\n\nAnother observation: In the training examples, the output grids seem to have the same numbers as the input but arranged in a mirrored or rotated way. For example, in Example 2's input, the output seems to have the same numbers but mirrored in some way. So perhaps the transformation involves reflecting the grid vertically and/or horizontally.\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's try to code a function that flips the grid vertically and horizontally. For example:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Flip vertically (reverse rows)\n    transformed_grid = ["
