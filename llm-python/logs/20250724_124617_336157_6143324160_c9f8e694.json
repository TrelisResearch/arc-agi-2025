    "content": "Let me analyze the training examples to identify the pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n- Input has blocks of 5s in specific patterns\n- Output seems to replace the 5s with the first number in each row (1 or 2)\n- The 5s that are replaced seem to be in contiguous blocks\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n- Similar pattern where 5s are replaced by the first number in each row (3 or 4)\n- The replacement happens in blocks/regions of 5s\n\nLet me examine more carefully:\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Row 1 starts with 1, so 5s in that row become 1s\n- Row 2 starts with 2, so 5s in that row become 2s\n- Row 3 starts with 1, so 5s in that row become 1s\n- And so on...\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. For each row, find the first non-zero number\n2. Replace all 5s in that row with that first non-zero number\n3. Leave other numbers unchanged\n\nLet me verify this with both examples:\n\nExample 1: Row 1 (1 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) \u2192 first non-zero is 1, so 5s become 1s\nExample 2: Row 1 (3 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) \u2192 first non-zero is 3, so 5s become 3s\n\nThis looks correct. Let me implement this transformation:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each row, find the first non-zero element and use it to replace 5s\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        # Find the first non-zero element in the row\n        first_nonzero = 0\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[i])):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] != 0:\n                first_nonzero = transformed_grid[i][j]\n                break\n        \n        # Replace all 5s in this row with the first non-zero element\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[i])):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = first_nonzero\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

For each row, find the first non-zero number\n2. Replace all 5s in that row with that first non-zero number\n3. Leave other numbers unchanged\n\nLet me verify this with both examples:\n\nExample 1: Row 1 (1 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) \u2192 first non-zero is 1, so 5s become 1s\nExample 2: Row 1 (3 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0) \u2192 first non-zero is 3, so 5s become 3s\n\nThis looks correct. Let me implement this transformation:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each row, find the first non-zero element and use it to replace 5s\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        # Find the first non-zero element in the row\n        first_nonzero = 0\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[i])):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] != 0:\n                first_nonzero = transformed_grid[i][j]\n                break\n        \n        # Replace all 5s in this row with the first non-zero element\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[i])):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = first_nonzero\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
