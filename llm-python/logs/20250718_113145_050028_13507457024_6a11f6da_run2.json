              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the transformation involves some combination of:\n1. Replacing certain values with others (e.g., 0 \u2192 6, 1 \u2192 8)\n2. Applying some kind of pattern or shape transformation\n3. Possibly using symmetry or position-based transformations\n\nBased on the examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain values with others based on their position and value\n- Applying some kind of pattern transformation that involves symmetry or shape\n- Possibly using a combination of value replacement and pattern transformation\n\nHere's my best attempt at implementing this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Value replacement based on position and value\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Replace 0 with 6 or 8 based on position\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Replace 1 with 6 or 8 based on position\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8 with 6 or 1 based on position\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Replace 6 with 1 or 8 based on position\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n    \n    # Apply some pattern transformation (this is a guess based on examples)\n    # This part is more speculative and may not be accurate\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 6:\n                # Replace 6 with 1 or 8 based on position\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n            elif transformed[i][j] == 1:\n                # Replace 1 with 6 or 8 based on position\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Value replacement based on position and value\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Replace 0 with 6 or 8 based on position\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Replace 1 with 6 or 8 based on position\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8 with 6 or 1 based on position\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Replace 6 with 1 or 8 based on position\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n    \n    # Apply some pattern transformation (this is a guess based on examples)\n    # This part is more speculative and may not be accurate\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 6:\n                # Replace 6 with 1 or 8 based on position\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n            elif transformed[i][j] == 1:\n                # Replace 1 with 6 or 8 based on position\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed\n```",
