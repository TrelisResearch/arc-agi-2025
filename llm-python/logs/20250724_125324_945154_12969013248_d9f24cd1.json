          "content": "Let me analyze the training examples to identify the transformation pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n- Input has 5s at positions (3,6) and (5,2), and 2s at positions (9,1), (9,4), (9,6)\n- Output shows a pattern where 2s form vertical lines in columns 1, 4, 6, and there's some interaction with the 5s\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n- Input has 5s at positions (3,5), (5,1), (6,8), and 2s at positions (9,1), (9,4), (9,7)\n- Output again shows 2s forming vertical lines in columns 1, 4, 7, with interactions with 5s\n\nLet me identify the key patterns:\n1. The 2s at the bottom form vertical lines extending upward\n2. The 5s seem to influence where these vertical lines go or how they're modified\n3. In some cases, 5s get incorporated into the vertical structures\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- The 2s at the bottom create vertical \"pillars\" in their respective columns\n- When a 5 is in the same column as a 2-pillar, it seems to affect how that pillar looks\n- In example 1: 5 at (5,2) creates a special pattern around it in column 2\n- In example 2: 5s seem to either connect to pillars or modify them\n\nLet me trace this more systematically:\n- All columns with 2s at the bottom (row 9) get vertical lines of 2s going up\n- When there's a 5 in such a column, it might create a \"bridge\" or change the pattern\n- 5s not aligned with 2-columns might create their own modifications\n\nActually, let me look at the exact positions:\nExample 1: 2s at cols 1,4,6 in row 9 \u2192 vertical lines in cols 1,4,6\nExample 2: 2s at cols 1,4,7 in row 9 \u2192 vertical lines in cols 1,4,7\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. Identify columns where 2s exist in the bottom row (row 9)\n2. Create vertical lines of 2s in those columns\n3. Handle 5s specially - they might modify the pattern or create connections\n\nLooking at how 5s are handled:\n- In example 1: 5 at (3,6) and (5,2) - column 6 has a 2, column 2 has a 2\n- In example 2: 5s at (3,5) [no 2 below], (5,1) [2 below], (6,8) [no 2 below]\n\nLet me see if 5s that align with 2-columns get special treatment:\n- Example 1: 5 at (5,2) where column 2 has a 2 \u2192 creates a horizontal connection?\n- Example 1: 5 at (3,6) where column 6 has a 2 \u2192 incorporated in the pattern\n\nI think the pattern is:\n1. Draw vertical lines of 2s in all columns that have 2s in the bottom row\n2. Place 5s in their original positions\n3. Where 5s and 2-columns intersect, create special patterns\n\nLooking more closely at intersections:\nExample 1: 5 at (5,2) - in output we see 5 and 2 interaction\nExample 1: 5 at (3,6) - in output we see 5 incorporated in column 6\n\nActually, let me recheck the output patterns more carefully by looking at specific rows.\n\nLet me try a different approach - maybe the 2s form complete vertical bars, and 5s modify them:\n\nIn example 1 output, column 1: all 2s\nIn example 1 output, column 4: all 2s  \nIn example 1 output, column 6: mostly 2s with some 5s\n\nThe key insight might be:\n1. Create full vertical columns of 2s where there were 2s in the bottom row\n2. Place 5s in their original positions, which may override some 2s\n3. Handle special interactions where 5s are in 2-columns\n\nLet me implement this understanding:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Find columns with 2s in the bottom row (row 9)\n    bottom_2_columns = []\n    for col in range(10):\n        if grid[9][col] == 2:\n            bottom_2_columns.append(col)\n    \n    # Create vertical lines of 2s in those columns\n    for col in bottom_2_columns:\n        for row in range(10):\n            result[row][col] = 2\n    \n    # Place all 5s in their original positions\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            if grid[row][col] == 5:\n                result[row][col] = 5\n    \n    # Handle special case: if there's a 5 in a column with a 2-line,\n    # we might need to adjust the pattern around it\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            if grid[row][col] == 5 and col in bottom_2_columns:\n                # In the examples, when a 5 is in a 2-column, it often \n                # creates specific patterns.

              "content": "Let me analyze the training examples to identify the transformation pattern.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\n1. Both inputs have `2`s in the bottom row, and `5`s scattered in the upper part of the grid\n2. In the outputs, the `2`s seem to form vertical lines/columns, and there's some interaction between `2`s and `5`s\n3. The bottom rows with `2`s are preserved but extended upward\n4. The `5`s seem to influence the pattern - they either remain or create connections\n\nLet me examine more carefully:\n- In example 1: `2`s are at positions (9,1), (9,4), (9,6) in the input, and they form vertical lines in columns 1, 4, and 6 in the output\n- In example 2: `2`s are at positions (9,1), (9,3), (9,5), (9,7) and form vertical lines in columns 1, 3, 5, 7\n- The `5`s appear to create connections or modifications in the pattern where they intersect with the `2` columns\n\nIt seems like:\n1. Vertical lines are drawn upward from each `2` in the bottom row\n2. `5`s interact with these lines - possibly creating horizontal connections or modifying the pattern where they intersect\n\nLet me trace this more systematically:\n- From each `2` in the bottom row, draw a vertical line up\n- Where `5`s exist, they might create horizontal bridges or modify the vertical lines\n\nLooking more carefully at intersections:\n- In example 1, there's a `5` at (3,6) and (5,2) \n- In the output, these create modifications to the pattern\n\nLet me try a different approach - maybe it's about creating a \"support structure\" from the bottom `2`s:\n1. Draw vertical lines from each `2` in the last row\n2. Where `5`s exist, they might create horizontal connections between vertical lines\n3. Or `5`s might be preserved or transformed in some way\n\nActually, let me look at the specific positions:\nExample 1 input: `2`s at columns 1, 4, 6 in row 9; `5`s at (3,6) and (5,2)\nExample 1 output: Vertical lines in columns 1, 4, 6; modifications where `5`s were\n\nIt looks like:\n1. Vertical columns of `2`s are created from the bottom row `2` positions\n2. `5`s either remain or create connections\n3.

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify the transformation pattern.\n\nLet me first examine the input and output grids carefully:\n\nExample 1:\n- Input has 5s at positions (3,6) and (5,2), and 2s at positions (9,1), (9,4), (9,6)\n- Output shows a pattern where 2s form vertical lines in columns 1, 4, 6, and there's some connection to the 5s\n\nExample 2:\n- Input has 5s at positions (3,5), (5,1), (6,8), and 2s at positions (9,1), (9,3), (9,6)\n- Output shows similar pattern with 2s forming vertical lines\n\nLooking more closely, I notice:\n1. The 2s in the bottom row seem to create vertical lines of 2s going upward\n2. The 5s appear to influence the pattern - they either remain or get modified\n3. The vertical lines of 2s seem to extend upward but may be interrupted or modified by 5s\n\nLet me trace this more systematically:\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Column 1: 2 at bottom, vertical line of 2s created\n- Column 4: 2 at bottom, vertical line of 2s created  \n- Column 6: 2 at bottom, vertical line of 2s created, but 5 at position (3,6) becomes part of pattern\n\nIn Example 2:\n- Column 1: 2 at bottom, vertical line of 2s created\n- Column 3: 2 at bottom, vertical line of 2s created\n- Column 6: 2 at bottom, vertical line of 2s created\n\nIt looks like the 2s in the bottom row create vertical columns of 2s going upward, and 5s interact with these patterns in some way.\n\nLet me look at how 5s are treated:\n- In Example 1: 5 at (3,6) remains a 5, but 5 at (5,2) seems to influence nearby cells\n- In Example 2: 5s at (3,5) and (5,1) and (6,8) all seem to remain but affect the pattern\n\nActually, looking more carefully:\n- It seems like each column that has a 2 in the bottom row gets filled with 2s vertically\n- 5s act as obstacles or modify the pattern in their vicinity\n- The pattern might involve connecting 5s with the vertical 2 lines\n\nLet me try a different approach. Looking at the exact positions:\n\nIn the output, it seems like:\n1. Vertical lines of 2s are drawn in columns where there are 2s in the bottom row\n2. 5s either remain as 5s or get incorporated into the 2 patterns in some specific way\n\nLooking even more carefully at the outputs:\n- The 2s form complete vertical columns (from row 0 to row 9) in their respective columns\n- But there are modifications where 5s were present\n\nLet me check if there's a connectivity pattern:\n- In Example 1: 5 at (3,6) and 5 at (5,2) - the output shows 5 at (3,6) remains, and there's a modification at (4,6) and (5,6) \n- It looks like the vertical 2 line gets modified when it encounters a 5\n\nI think the pattern is:\n1. For each column that has a 2 in the bottom row (row 9), draw a vertical line of 2s from top to bottom\n2. When a 5 is encountered in that column, it affects how the 2s are placed around it\n3. 5s remain in their positions but may influence adjacent cells\n\nActually, let me recheck the exact modifications:\nIn Example 1, column 6: input 5 at (3,6), output has 5 at (3,6) but also 5 at (4,6) and 2 at (5,6)\nIn Example 1, column 2: input 5 at (5,2), output has 5 at (5,2) and 2s around it\n\nThis is getting complex.

              "content": "Let me analyze the training examples to identify the pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n- Input has 5s at positions (3,6) and (5,2), and 2s at positions (9,1), (9,4), (9,6)\n- Output shows 2s forming vertical lines at columns 1, 4, 6, and also a vertical line at column 7\n- The 5s seem to influence the pattern - one 5 at (3,6) and another at (5,2)\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n- Input has 5s at positions (3,5), (5,1), and (6,8), and 2s at positions (9,1), (9,4), (9,7)\n- Output shows 2s forming vertical lines at columns 1, 4, 7, and also columns 2 and 8 (influenced by 5s)\n\nPattern observations:\n1. The 2s in the bottom row seem to create vertical lines going upward\n2. The 5s appear to modify or influence these vertical lines\n3. In both examples, there are vertical columns of 2s that extend upward from the bottom row\n4. The 5s seem to either create new columns or modify existing ones\n\nLet me look more carefully:\n- In Example 1: 2s at columns 1, 4, 6 in bottom row \u2192 vertical lines in those columns\n- There's also a column 7 with 2s, which has a 5 at position (3,6) \n- In Example 2: 2s at columns 1, 4, 7 in bottom row \u2192 vertical lines in those columns\n- There are also columns 2 and 8 with 2s, influenced by 5s at (5,1) and (6,8)\n\nIt seems like:\n1. Vertical lines of 2s are drawn upward from each 2 in the bottom row\n2. 5s influence the pattern - they might cause additional columns or modify existing ones\n3. When a 5 is present, it might cause a vertical line at its column or affect nearby columns\n\nLet me recheck Example 1:\n- Bottom row 2s: columns 1, 4, 6\n- Vertical lines of 2s: columns 1, 4, 6, 7\n- 5s at (3,6) and (5,2) - column 6 has a 5 and also gets a vertical line, column 2 has a 5 and column 7 gets influenced\n\nExample 2:\n- Bottom row 2s: columns 1, 4, 7\n- Vertical lines of 2s: columns 1, 2, 4, 7, 8\n- 5s at (3,5), (5,1), (6,8) - columns 1, 5, 8 have 5s. Column 1 already has 2, column 8 gets new line, column 5 influences column 2?\n\nLet me think differently:\n1. Draw vertical lines of 2s from each 2 in the bottom row\n2. 5s might cause additional vertical lines or modify existing patterns\n\nActually, looking more carefully:\nIn Example 1 output, there's a 5 at position (3,6) and (5,2) which are preserved.\nIn Example 2 output, there's a 5 at position (3,5), (5,1), (6,8) which are preserved.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n1. Preserve all existing elements (2s and 5s)\n2. Draw vertical lines of 2s upward from each 2 in the bottom row\n3. 5s might trigger additional behavior\n\nLet me check if 5s cause vertical lines too:\nExample 1: 5 at (5,2) - column 2 in output has 2s at rows 0-8 except 3, and 5 at (5,2) is preserved\nExample 1: 5 at (3,6) - column 6 in output has 2s at rows 0-6, 0, and 5 at (3,6) is preserved\n\nWait, let me recheck the coordinates. In a 10x10 grid with 0-based indexing:\nExample 1: 5 at row 3 col 6, 5 at row 5 col 2\nBottom row is row 9.\n\nLooking at output of Example 1:\n- Column 1: 2s from rows 0-9 (all rows)\n- Column 4: 2s from rows 0-9 (all rows)  \n- Column 6: 2s from rows 0-3, 5 at row 3, 2s at rows 4-9\n- Column 7: 2s from rows 0-9 (all rows)\n\nSo it seems like 2s in bottom row create full vertical lines, and 5s also create vertical lines of 2s but the 5 itself is preserved.\n\nLet me verify with Example 2:\nBottom 2s at columns 1, 4, 7 \u2192 vertical lines at columns 1, 4, 7\n5s at (3,5), (5,1), (6,8) \u2192 \n- 5 at (5,1): column 1 already has 2 line, 5 preserved\n- 5 at (3,5): column 5 gets 2s, 5 preserved  \n- 5 at (6,8): column 8 gets 2s, 5 preserved\n\nBut looking at output:\nColumn 2 also has 2s - why?\n\nLet me re-read the coordinates carefully.\n\nActually, let me look at the pattern more systematically:\n1. All 2s and 5s from input are preserved in output\n2. Vertical columns of 2s are created:\n   - From each 2 in the bottom row (row 9)\n   - From each 5 (regardless of row)\n\nLet me verify:\nExample 1 input:\n- 2s in bottom row (row 9): columns 1, 4, 6\n- 5s: at (3,6) and (5,2) \n- So columns that should get vertical 2s: 1, 2, 4, 6\n- But output shows 2s in columns 1, 4, 6, 7\n\nExample 2 input:\n- 2s in bottom row (row 9): columns 1, 4, 7\n- 5s: at (3,5), (5,1), (6,8)\n- So columns that should get vertical 2s: 1, 4, 5, 7, 8\n- Output shows 2s in columns 1, 2, 4, 7, 8\n\nHmm, there's a mismatch. Let me think of another rule.\n\nWait, in Example 1, there's a 5 at column 6, and in the output there's a vertical line at column 7 (which is 6+1).\nIn Example 2, there's a 5 at column 5, and there's a vertical line at column 2 (which is 5-3) and 8 (which is 5+3).\n\nThat doesn't seem right either.\n\nLet me try a different approach:\nMaybe 5s not only create vertical lines but also shift or influence nearby columns.\n\nActually, let me just implement what's clear and see:\n1. Copy input to output\n2. For every 2 in bottom row, create a vertical line of 2s in that column\n3. For every 5, create a vertical line of 2s in that column (but preserve the 5)\n\nLet me check this with Example 1:\n2s in bottom row: columns 1, 4, 6\n5s: (3,6) and (5,2) \nColumns for vertical 2s: 1, 2, 4, 6\nBut output has 2s in columns 1, 4, 6, 7\n\nStill column 7 is unexplained.\n\nLet me just implement my best guess:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    result = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find all columns that should have vertical lines of 2s\n    columns_with_lines = set()\n    \n    # Add columns with 2s in the bottom row (row 9)\n    for col in range(10):\n        if grid[9][col] == 2:\n            columns_with_lines.add(col)\n    \n    # Add columns with 5s (5s create vertical lines but preserve themselves)\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            if grid[row][col] == 5:\n                columns_with_lines.add(col)\n    \n    # Draw vertical lines of 2s in identified columns\n    for col in columns_with_lines:\n        for row in range(10):\n            # If there's no 5 at this position, place a 2\n            if grid[row][col] != 5",

The 2s in the bottom row seem to generate vertical lines of 2s going upward\n2. The 5s seem to interact with these lines - possibly blocking or modifying them\n3. In some cases, 5s appear to be connected to the 2 lines or influence where they terminate\n\nLooking more closely:\n- In Example 1: 2s at (9,1), (9,4), (9,6) create vertical lines. The 5 at (5,2) seems to affect the line from (9,1) and the 5 at (3,6) affects the line from (9,6)\n- In Example 2: Similar pattern with 2s creating vertical lines and 5s interacting with them\n\nIt seems like:\n1. Each 2 in the bottom row creates a vertical line of 2s going upward\n2. 5s act as obstacles or connection points - they might cause the line to stop or change direction\n3. Sometimes 5s get incorporated into the pattern\n\nLet me refine my understanding:\n- Vertical lines of 2s are drawn from each 2 in the bottom row upward\n- When a line encounters a 5, it might stop there or the 5 might become part of the line\n- There might also be horizontal connections\n\nActually, let me look at this differently:\n- The 2s in the bottom row seem to generate columns of 2s\n- The 5s seem to create connections or special patterns\n\nLooking at the specific positions:\nExample 1:\n- Bottom 2s at columns 1, 4, 6\n- Result: Columns of 2s at those positions\n- 5s at (3,6) and (5,2) affect how the lines look\n\nExample 2:\n- Bottom 2s at columns 1, 4, 7  \n- Result: Columns of 2s at those positions\n- 5s at (3,5), (5,1), (6,8) affect the pattern\n\nI think the pattern is:\n1. Draw vertical lines of 2s from each 2 in the bottom row upward\n2. When there's a 5 in the grid, it affects the nearest vertical line - possibly making a horizontal connection or modifying the pattern\n\nLet me check if 5s create horizontal bridges:\nIn Example 1: 5 at (5,2) - there's a horizontal connection at row 4 from column 6 to 7, and at row 5 there's a connection at column 6 to 7.\n\nActually, looking more systematically:\n- Vertical columns of 2s are created from bottom 2s\n- 5s seem to either become part of the structure or influence connections\n- There are horizontal segments connecting some vertical lines\n\nLet me try a different approach:\nThe pattern might be that 2s in the bottom row create full columns, and 5s create horizontal bars or connections.\n\nActually, let me re-examine:\nIn output of Example 1, row 4 (0-indexed): 0 2 0 0 2 0 5 2 0 0\nRow 5: 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 6: 0 2 5 0 2 0 2 0 0 0\n\nI notice that 5s are preserved in their positions and sometimes there are horizontal connections from 5s.\n\nLet me try to identify the core transformation:\n1. Create vertical lines of 2s from each bottom-row 2 going upward\n2. Preserve 5s in their original positions\n3. Add horizontal connections from 5s to nearby vertical lines of 2s\n\nActually, let me look at it as:\n1. Each column with a 2 in the bottom gets filled with 2s from bottom up to some point\n2. 5s remain and may connect to these vertical lines\n\nLooking at Example 1 output more carefully:\n- Column 1: 2s from rows 0-9 (full column)\n- Column 4: 2s from rows 0-9 (full column)  \n- Column 6: 2s with some variations due to 5 at (3,6)\n- Column 7: Only appears where 5 is at (3,6)\n\nLet me try:\n1.

The vertical lines of 2s appear in the same columns where 2s exist in the bottom row\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- In both examples, 2s in the bottom row create vertical columns of 2s\n- 5s seem to either:\n  - Create a 5 in their position in the output\n  - Modify nearby positions (possibly creating connections with 2 lines)\n\nLet me trace this more systematically:\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Bottom row 2s at columns 1, 4, 6, 8 \u2192 vertical lines of 2s in those columns\n- 5 at (3,6) and (5,2) \u2192 appear in output, and seem to connect/modify the 2 lines\n\nIn Example 2:\n- Bottom row 2s at columns 1, 4, 7 \u2192 vertical lines of 2s in those columns\n- 5s at various positions \u2192 appear in output and create modifications\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. Create vertical lines of 2s in columns where there are 2s in the bottom row\n2. Place 5s in their original positions\n3. 5s seem to create connections with the vertical 2 lines - possibly filling in 2s in their row in the columns of the vertical lines\n\nLet me refine my understanding:\n- Vertical lines of 2s are drawn in all columns that contain a 2 in the bottom row\n- All 5s from input are placed in output\n- 5s also seem to cause horizontal lines of 2s in their row, but only in columns where vertical 2 lines exist\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Find columns with 2s in the bottom row (row 9)\n    bottom_row_2_cols = []\n    for col in range(10):\n        if grid[9][col] == 2:\n            bottom_row_2_cols.append(col)\n    \n    # Draw vertical lines of 2s in those columns\n    for col in bottom_row_2_cols:\n        for row in range(10):\n            result[row][col] = 2\n    \n    # Place all 5s from input to output\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            if grid[row][col] == 5:\n                result[row][col] = 5\n    \n    # For each 5, draw horizontal lines of 2s in its row, but only in columns with vertical 2 lines\n    # But looking more carefully at the examples, 5s seem to modify the intersection points\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            if grid[row][col] == 5:\n                # 5s seem to create a pattern where they might change the value at their position\n                # or affect nearby cells\n                # Looking at examples, when a 5 is in a row with vertical 2 lines,\n                # it seems to create specific patterns\n                \n                # Let's check the specific pattern:\n                # In example 1: 5 at (3,6) - in column with vertical 2 line\n                #               5 at (5,2) - in column with vertical 2 line\n                # In example 2: 5 at (3,5) - not in column with vertical 2 line, but creates connection\n                #               5 at (5,1) - in column with vertical 2 line\n                #               5 at (6,8) - not in column with vertical 2 line initially, but creates pattern\n                \n                # The pattern seems to be that 5s create horizontal connections\n                # in their rows to the vertical 2 lines\n                for c in bottom_row_2_cols:\n                    if result[row][c] == 2:  # If there's already a vertical 2 line here\n                        # Keep it as 2, but 5 position remains 5\n                        pass\n                    else:\n                        # Fill with 2 to create horizontal connection\n                        result[row][c] = 2\n    \n    return result\n```",

              "content": "Let me analyze the training examples to identify the transformation pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n- Input has 5s at positions (3,6) and (5,2), and 2s at positions (9,1), (9,4), (9,6)\n- Output shows a pattern where 2s form vertical lines in columns 1, 4, 6, and there's some interaction with the 5s\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n- Input has 5s at positions (3,5), (5,1), (6,8), and 2s at positions (9,1), (9,4), (9,7)\n- Output again shows 2s forming vertical lines in columns 1, 4, 7, with interactions with 5s\n\nLet me identify the key patterns:\n1. The 2s at the bottom form vertical lines extending upward\n2. The 5s seem to influence where these vertical lines go or how they're modified\n3. In some cases, 5s get incorporated into the vertical structures\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- The 2s at the bottom create vertical \"pillars\" in their respective columns\n- When a 5 is in the same column as a 2-pillar, it seems to affect how that pillar looks\n- In example 1: 5 at (5,2) creates a special pattern around it in column 2\n- In example 2: 5s seem to either connect to pillars or modify them\n\nLet me trace this more systematically:\n- All columns with 2s at the bottom (row 9) get vertical lines of 2s going up\n- When there's a 5 in such a column, it might create a \"bridge\" or change the pattern\n- 5s not aligned with 2-columns might create their own modifications\n\nActually, let me look at the exact positions:\nExample 1: 2s at cols 1,4,6 in row 9 \u2192 vertical lines in cols 1,4,6\nExample 2: 2s at cols 1,4,7 in row 9 \u2192 vertical lines in cols 1,4,7\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. Identify columns where 2s exist in the bottom row (row 9)\n2. Create vertical lines of 2s in those columns\n3. Handle 5s specially - they might modify the pattern or create connections\n\nLooking at how 5s are handled:\n- In example 1: 5 at (3,6) and (5,2) - column 6 has a 2, column 2 has a 2\n- In example 2: 5s at (3,5) [no 2 below], (5,1) [2 below], (6,8) [no 2 below]\n\nLet me see if 5s that align with 2-columns get special treatment:\n- Example 1: 5 at (5,2) where column 2 has a 2 \u2192 creates a horizontal connection?\n- Example 1: 5 at (3,6) where column 6 has a 2 \u2192 incorporated in the pattern\n\nI think the pattern is:\n1. Draw vertical lines of 2s in all columns that have 2s in the bottom row\n2. Place 5s in their original positions\n3. Where 5s and 2-columns intersect, create special patterns\n\nLooking more closely at intersections:\nExample 1: 5 at (5,2) - in output we see 5 and 2 interaction\nExample 1: 5 at (3,6) - in output we see 5 incorporated in column 6\n\nActually, let me recheck the output patterns more carefully by looking at specific rows.\n\nLet me try a different approach - maybe the 2s form complete vertical bars, and 5s modify them:\n\nIn example 1 output, column 1: all 2s\nIn example 1 output, column 4: all 2s  \nIn example 1 output, column 6: mostly 2s with some 5s\n\nThe key insight might be:\n1. Create full vertical columns of 2s where there were 2s in the bottom row\n2. Place 5s in their original positions, which may override some 2s\n3. Handle special interactions where 5s are in 2-columns\n\nLet me implement this understanding:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Find columns with 2s in the bottom row (row 9)\n    bottom_2_columns = []\n    for col in range(10):\n        if grid[9][col] == 2:\n            bottom_2_columns.append(col)\n    \n    # Create vertical lines of 2s in those columns\n    for col in bottom_2_columns:\n        for row in range(10):\n            result[row][col] = 2\n    \n    # Place all 5s in their original positions\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            if grid[row][col] == 5:\n                result[row][col] = 5\n    \n    # Handle special case: if there's a 5 in a column with a 2-line,\n    # we might need to adjust the pattern around it\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            if grid[row][col] == 5 and col in bottom_2_columns:\n                # In the examples, when a 5 is in a 2-column, it often \n                # creates specific patterns. Let's try to replicate:\n                # Keep the 5 at its position\n                # Sometimes the row above gets special treatment\n                \n                # Based on examples, if 5 is in a 2-column, \n                # the pattern in that column might change around the 5\n                # For simplicity, let's just ensure 5 is placed correctly\n                # and the rest of the column remains 2s\n                pass  # 5 is already placed above\n    \n    return result\n```",
