Let me check if it's a rotation or reflection - doesn't seem to be a simple one\n2. Let me examine specific positions:\n\nLooking at the first row of output:\n- Example 1: [2, 1, 5] - first column of input is [2, 1, 5]\n- Example 2: [2, 6, 5] - first column of input is [2, 6, 5]\n- Example 3: [9, 5, 5] - first column of input is [9, 5, 5]\n- Example 4: [2, 2, 2] - first column of input is [2, 2, 2]\n\nThat's it! The first row of the output is the first column of the input.\n\nLooking at the second row of output:\n- Example 1: [2, 5, 2] - main diagonal of input is [2, 5, 2]\n- Example 2: [2, 2, 5] - main diagonal of input is [2, 2, 5]\n- Example 3: [9, 5, 8] - main diagonal of input is [9, 5, 8]\n- Example 4: [6, 1, 6] - main diagonal of input is [2, 1, 2] - No, this doesn't match\n\nLet me recheck example 4 more carefully:\nInput:\n2 6 6\n2 1 1\n2 6 2\n\nActually, let me look at the middle row of output vs anti-diagonal or other patterns:\n- Example 4 output row 2: [6, 1, 6]\n\nLet me try a different approach for the second row:\n- Example 1: [2, 5, 2] - Could this be the anti-diagonal? [1, 5, 5] - No\n- Wait, let me check the second column: [2, 5, 2] - Yes!\n\nSecond row of output = second column of input\n\nFor the third row of output:\n- Example 1: [1, 1, 2] - third column of input is [1, 1, 2] - Yes!\n- Example 2: [5, 2, 5] - third column of input is [5, 2, 5] - Yes!\n- Example 3: [5, 8, 9] - third column of input is [5, 8, 9] - Yes!\n- Example 4: [6, 1, 2] - third column of input is [6, 1, 2] - Yes!\n\nSo the pattern is:\n- First row of output = First column of input\n- Second row of output = Second column of input  \n- Third row of output = Third column of input\n\nThis is simply the transpose of the matrix!\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Transpose the grid: rows become columns\n    transformed_grid = [\n        [grid[0][0], grid[1][0], grid[2][0]],  # First column becomes first row\n        [grid[0][1], grid[1][1], grid[2][1]],  # Second column becomes second row\n        [grid[0][2], grid[1][2], grid[2][2]]   # Third column becomes third row\n    ]\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
