          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice several patterns:\n1. Values in the input grid are often transformed into specific positions in the output grid\n2. Certain values (like 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) appear to be mapped to specific positions or patterns\n3. There seems to be a pattern where certain values are placed in specific rows or columns\n4. The output grid is always 7x7, so the transformation must produce a 7x7 grid\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that maps values to specific positions in the output grid based on their value and position in the input grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
