Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 0\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\nOutput:\n0 4 0 0 8 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 9 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 6 0 7\n7 0 0 0 0 2 0 9 0 4 0 0 0 0 6 0 9\n0 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 3 0 0 0 6 4 0\n6 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 6 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 7 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 6 0 0 5 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n8 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 8 4 0 8 0 6 0 0 2 0\n0 0 7 0 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 6 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 6 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 3 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 2 3 0 9 0 4 0 0 0 3 0 0 8\n0 0 3 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 0 0 0 9 4 9 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 6 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 1 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 1 2 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 4 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 9 0 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Next, try to identify a transformation that solves at least one of the training examples.\n\nTraining Example 1 \u2717:\nExpected: [[0, 4, 0, 0, 8, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 7], [7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 9, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 9], [0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 3, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 0], [6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 2, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 4, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0], [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0]]\nYour output: [[7, 4, 3, 3, 8, 9, 0, 9, 0, 7, 4, 2, 0, 0, 9, 4, 7], [7, 4, 3, 3, 8, 9, 0, 9, 0, 7, 4, 2, 0, 0, 9, 4, 7], [7, 4, 3, 3, 8, 1, 0, 9, 0, 7, 4, 2, 0, 0, 9, 4, 7], [7, 4, 3, 3, 8, 1, 0, 9, 0, 7, 4, 2, 0, 0, 9, 4, 7], [7, 4, 3, 3, 8, 1, 0, 9, 0, 7, 4, 2, 0, 0, 9, 4, 7], [7, 4, 3, 3, 8, 1, 0, 9, 0, 7, 4, 2, 0, 0, 9, 4, 7], [7, 4, 3, 3, 8, 1, 0, 9, 0, 7, 4, 2, 0, 0, 9, 4, 9], [7, 4, 3, 3, 8, 1, 0, 9, 0, 7, 4, 2, 0, 0, 9, 4, 9], [7, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 0, 9, 0, 7, 3, 2, 0, 0, 9, 4, 9], [6, 2, 3, 3, 8, 1, 0, 9, 0, 7, 3, 2, 0, 0, 9, 4, 9], [6, 2, 3, 3, 8, 2, 0, 9, 0, 7, 3, 2, 0, 0, 9, 4, 9], [6, 2, 3, 3, 8, 2, 0, 9, 0, 7, 3, 2, 0, 0, 9, 4, 6], [6, 2, 3, 3, 8, 2, 0, 9, 0, 7, 3, 2, 0, 0, 9, 4, 6], [6, 8, 3, 3, 8, 2, 0, 9, 0, 7, 7, 2, 0, 0, 6, 4, 6], [6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 2, 0, 9, 0, 4, 7, 2, 0, 0, 6, 4, 6], [6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 2, 0, 9, 0, 4, 7, 2, 0, 0, 6, 4, 6], [6, 8, 6, 3, 8, 5, 0, 9, 0, 5, 7, 2, 0, 0, 5, 4, 6]]\nPixel accuracy: 36.7%\n\nTraining Example 2 \u2717:\nExpected: [[8, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 6], [0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 0, 8, 0, 6, 0, 0, 2, 0], [0, 0, 7, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 3, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 2], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nYour output: [[8, 3, 7, 8, 4, 0, 8, 6, 1, 1, 4, 2, 6], [8, 3, 7, 8, 4, 0, 8, 6, 1, 1, 4, 2, 6], [8, 3, 7, 8, 4, 0, 8, 6, 1, 1, 4, 2, 6], [8, 3, 7, 8, 4, 0, 8, 6, 1, 1, 4, 2, 6], [8, 3, 7, 8, 4, 0, 8, 6, 6, 1, 4, 2, 6], [8, 3, 7, 8, 4, 0, 8, 6, 6, 1, 4, 2, 6], [8, 3, 7, 8, 4, 0, 8, 6, 6, 1, 4, 2, 6], [8, 3, 7, 8, 4, 0, 8, 6, 6, 1, 4, 2, 6], [8, 3, 7, 8, 4, 0, 3, 6, 6, 1, 4, 2, 6], [8, 3, 7, 8, 4, 0, 3, 6, 6, 1, 4, 2, 6], [8, 3, 7, 8, 8, 0, 3, 6, 6, 1, 4, 2, 2], [8, 3, 7, 8, 8, 0, 3, 6, 6, 1, 4, 2, 2], [8, 3, 7, 8, 5, 0, 3, 6, 5, 1, 4, 2, 2]]\nPixel accuracy: 26.0%\n\nTraining Example 3 \u2717:\nExpected: [[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]]\nYour output: [[0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]]\nPixel accuracy: 93.1%\n\nTraining Example 4 \u2717:\nExpected: [[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]]\nYour output: [[0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0]]\nPixel accuracy: 95.9%\n\n"

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n2 2 3\n5 5 5\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n2 2 3\n5 5 5\n0 2 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n3 6 4 2 4\n8 4 3 3 4\n5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n3 6 4 2 4\n8 4 3 3 4\n5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n1 9 9 6 1 8 4\n4 6 7 8 9 7 1\n9 3 1 4 1 3 6\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 9 9 6 1 8 4\n4 6 7 8 9 7 1\n9 3 1 4 1 3 6\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n9 1 2 8 4 9 8 2 1\n4 4 3 1 2 7 6 7 9\n2 1 6 9 7 8 4 3 6\n9 8 6 3 4 2 9 1 7\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Always start by attempting to find a complete rule that solves all training examples and should generalize to the test input.\n2. If you cannot find a perfect solution, provide your best attempt at a transformation that solves as many training examples as possible - ideally more than in the best previous turn.\n3. Even if your solution doesn't solve all examples perfectly, ensure it demonstrates meaningful pattern recognition and provides reasonable outputs that minimize pixel-level errors.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your improved transformation logic here (even if partial)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nTraining results: 0/3 examples solved, 82.4% pixel accuracy - Good partial progress!

Even if your solution doesn't solve all examples perfectly, ensure it demonstrates meaningful pattern recognition and provides reasonable outputs that minimize pixel-level errors.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your improved transformation logic here (even if partial)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nTraining results: 0/3 examples solved, 90.5% pixel accuracy - Good partial progress! Your approach is capturing some patterns. Next, try to identify a transformation that solves at least one of the training examples.\n\nTraining Example 1 \u2717:\nExpected: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process.

this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Even if your solution doesn't solve all examples perfectly, ensure it demonstrates meaningful pattern recognition and provides reasonable outputs that minimize pixel-level errors.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your improved transformation logic here (even if partial)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nTraining results: 0/3 examples solved, 31.7% pixel accuracy - Good partial progress! Your approach is capturing some patterns. Next, try to identify a transformation that solves at least one of the training examples.\n\nTraining Example 1 \u2717:\nExpected: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2,

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0

in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Next, try to identify a transformation that solves at least one of the training examples.\n\nTraining Example 1 \u2717:\nExpected: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Even if your solution doesn't solve all examples perfectly, ensure it demonstrates meaningful pattern recognition and provides reasonable outputs that minimize pixel-level errors.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your improved transformation logic here (even if partial)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nTraining results: 0/3 examples solved, 96.3% pixel accuracy - Good partial progress! Your approach is capturing some patterns. Next, try to identify a transformation that solves at least one of the training examples.\n\nTraining Example 1 \u2717:\nExpected: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\n2 0 2 2 0 0 2 2\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 6 0 0 0 6 6 0\n0 6 6 0 0 6 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0\n2 0 6 6 0 0 2 2\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 6 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n2 2 0 0 0 2\n2 2 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 2\n0 2 2 2 0 0\nOutput:\n6 6 0 0 0 2\n6 6 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 2\n0 6 6 6 0 0\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 6 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0\n0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 2 2 0 0 0 2\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 8 8 8 8 1 8 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 8 2 2 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 8 1\n1 8 2 8 8 8 1 1 8 2 2 8 1 1 1 1\n1 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 8 2 8 8 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1\n1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n1 1 8 8 8 8 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 8 2 2 8 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 1 1\n1 1 8 2 8 8 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1\n8 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 8 2 2 8 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 8 2 8 1 1 8 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1\n1 1 8 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 8 1\n1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 8 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n8 2 2 8\n8 8 2 8\n8 8 8 8\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 1 8 1 1 1\n1 8 8 8 8 1 8 1 1 8 8 1 1 1 1 1\n1 8 2 2 8 8 1 1 8 1 1 8 8 1 1 1\n1 8 2 2 8 1 1 8 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 1\n1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n1 8 1 8 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 1 8 8 8 8\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 2 2 8\n1 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 8 2 2 8\n1 8 1 1 1 8 2 8 8 1 1 8 8 8 8 8\n1 1 1 1 1 8 8 2 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 8 8 8 8\n1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 2 2 8\n1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 2 2 8\n1 1 8 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 8 1 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n8 2 8 8\n8 8 2 8\n8 8 8 8\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n1 8 1 8 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 8 8 1\n1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 1\n8 8 2 8 2 8 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1\n1 8 8 2 8 8 8 1 1 8 2 8 2 8 8 1 1 1\n8 8 2 2 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 2 8 8 1 8 1 1\n1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 8 2 2 8 8 8 1 1 1\n1 8 1 8 1 1 8 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8\n8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n1 1 1 1 8 8 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n8 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1\n8 8 1 1 1 8 2 8 2 8 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 8 1 1 8 8 2 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8\n1 1 1 1 1 8 8 2 2 8 1 1 8 8 1 1 8 1\n1 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1\n1 8 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8\n8 2 8 2 8\n8 8 2 8 8\n8 8 2 2 8\n8 8 8 8 8\n\nTest Input:\n1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8\n1 1 1 8 1 1 8 1 1 8 1 1 8 8 2 2 8 8\n1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 2 8 8 8\n1 1 8 2 2 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 2 8\n1 1 8 2 8 8 8 1 8 1 8 1 1 8 8 8 8 8\n1 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n8 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 8 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 8 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 1\n1 1 1 1 8 1 8 1 1 8 2 2 8 8 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 2 8 8 8 8 1 1 1\n8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 2 8 1 1 1 1\n8 2 2 8 8 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1\n8 2 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n8 8 8 2 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 8 1\n8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 2 2 8 1 1 1 1 8\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 8 2 2 8 1 1 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 2 8 8 8 1 1 1 1 1\n8 1 8 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1 1\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 8 8 8 1 1 8 1 1 0\n1 1 8 8 1 1 8 1 1 8 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 8 8 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 8 1 1\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1\n1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1\n1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 8 8 1 1 1 8 1 0 1 1\n1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 8 8 1 0 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n1 1 8 8 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 8 1 1 1\n1 8 8 1 1 1 0 1 1 8 8 1 1\n1 8 8 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 8 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1\n8 8 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1\n8 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 8 1\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 8 8 1\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1\n0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\nOutput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 0 1\n1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 8 1 1\n8 1 8 8 8 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1\n1 1 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8\n1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 8\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 8 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 8 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 8 1\n0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1\n\nTest Input:\n1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1\n0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0\n1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0\n0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1\n1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1\n1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3\n3 0 0 3 5

and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Always start by attempting to find a complete rule that solves all training examples and should generalize to the test input.\n2. If you cannot find a perfect solution, provide your best attempt at a transformation that solves as many training examples as possible - ideally more than in the best previous turn.\n3. Even if your solution doesn't solve all examples perfectly, ensure it demonstrates meaningful pattern recognition and provides reasonable outputs that minimize pixel-level errors.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your improved transformation logic here (even if partial)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nTraining results: 0/3 examples solved, 90.6% pixel accuracy - Good partial progress!
