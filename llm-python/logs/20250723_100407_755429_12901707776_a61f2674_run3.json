          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid seems to be influenced by the positions of the 5s in the input grid.\n2. In Example 1, the 5s are in the third column of the input, and the output has 1s in the third column for most rows, with 2s in the last three rows.\n3. In Example 2, the 5s are in the fifth column of the input, and the output has 1s in the fifth column for most rows, with 2s in the last two rows.\n4. The transformation seems to be related to the position of 5s in the input grid, with values being set to 1 or 2 based on their position.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Setting cells to 1 if they are in the same column as a 5 in the input grid, except for the last few rows where they are set to 2.\n- Leaving other cells as 0.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Find the columns with 5s in the input\n    five_columns = [col for col in range(9) if any(grid[row][col] == 5 for row in range(9))]\n    \n    # For each column with 5s, set cells to 1 or 2 based on row\n    for col in five_columns:\n        for row in range(9):\n            if row < 6:\n                transformed[row][col] = 1\n            else:\n                transformed[row][col] = 2\n                \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Find the columns with 5s in the input\n    five_columns = [col for col in range(9) if any(grid[row][col] == 5 for row in range(9))]\n    \n    # For each column with 5s, set cells to 1 or 2 based on row\n    for col in five_columns:\n        for row in range(9):\n            if row < 6:\n                transformed[row][col] = 1\n            else:\n                transformed[row][col] = 2\n                \n    return transformed\n```",

In Example 2, the 5s are in different positions, and the output has 1s and 2s in different locations.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n1. Identifying positions of 5s in the input grid\n2. Using these positions to determine where to place 1s and 2s in the output grid\n\nBased on this, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Places 1s in positions where there's a 5 in the input grid, but not in the first column\n- Places 2s in positions where there's a 5 in the input grid, but in the first column\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    for row in range(9):\n        for col in range(9):\n            if grid[row][col] == 5:\n                if col != 0:\n                    transformed[row][col] = 1\n                else:\n                    transformed[row][col] = 2\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    for row in range(9):\n        for col in range(9):\n            if grid[row][col] == 5:\n                if col != 0:\n                    transformed[row][col] = 1\n                else:\n                    transformed[row][col] = 2\n    \n    return transformed\n```",

In Example 1, the output has 1s in the third column of the first 5 rows, and 2s in the last 3 rows.\n2. In Example 2, the output has 1s in the fifth column for the first 7 rows, and 2s in the eighth and ninth rows.\n3. The transformation seems to be related to the position of the value 5 in the input grid.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Identifying positions where the value 5 appears in the input grid\n- Placing a 1 in the corresponding position in the output grid\n- Placing a 2 in positions that are diagonally adjacent to the 5s in the input grid\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(9):\n        for col in range(9):\n            if grid[row][col] == 5:\n                # Place a 1 in the current position\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 1\n                \n                # Place a 2 in the diagonally adjacent positions\n                if row > 0 and col > 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row-1][col-1] = 2\n                if row > 0 and col < 8:\n                    transformed_grid[row-1][col+1] = 2\n                if row < 8 and col > 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row+1][col-1] = 2\n                if row < 8 and col < 8:\n                    transformed_grid[row+1][col+1] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(9):\n        for col in range(9):\n            if grid[row][col] == 5:\n                # Place a 1 in the current position\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 1\n                \n                # Place a 2 in the diagonally adjacent positions\n                if row > 0 and col > 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row-1][col-1] = 2\n                if row > 0 and col < 8:\n                    transformed_grid[row-1][col+1] = 2\n                if row < 8 and col > 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row+1][col-1] = 2\n                if row < 8 and col < 8:\n                    transformed_grid[row+1][col+1] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid seems to be influenced by the positions of the 5s in the input grid.\n2. In Example 1, the 5s are in the third column of the input, and the output has 1s in the third column for most rows, with 2s in the last three rows.\n3. In Example 2, the 5s are in the fifth column of the input, and the output has 1s in the fifth column for most rows, with 2s in the last two rows.\n4. The transformation seems to be related to the position of 5s in the input grid, with values being set to 1 or 2 based on their position.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Setting cells to 1 if they are in the same column as a 5 in the input grid, except for the last few rows where they are set to 2.\n- Leaving other cells as 0.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Find the columns with 5s in the input\n    five_columns = [col for col in range(9) if any(grid[row][col] == 5 for row in range(9))]\n    \n    # For each column with 5s, set cells to 1 or 2 based on row\n    for col in five_columns:\n        for row in range(9):\n            if row < 6:\n                transformed[row][col] = 1\n            else:\n                transformed[row][col] = 2\n                \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Find the columns with 5s in the input\n    five_columns = [col for col in range(9) if any(grid[row][col] == 5 for row in range(9))]\n    \n    # For each column with 5s, set cells to 1 or 2 based on row\n    for col in five_columns:\n        for row in range(9):\n            if row < 6:\n                transformed[row][col] = 1\n            else:\n                transformed[row][col] = 2\n                \n    return transformed\n```",
