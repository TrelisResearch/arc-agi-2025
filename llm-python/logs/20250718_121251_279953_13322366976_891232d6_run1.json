          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids for these examples. Let me look at the examples and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input and output grids are both 28x19. The input has a lot of 0s and some numbers like 7, 6, etc. The output has numbers like 6, 2, 3, 8, etc. It seems like some numbers are being replaced with others. For instance, in the first example's output, there's a 6 in the first row, which might correspond to a 0 in the input. But I need to find a consistent rule.\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input has a lot of 0s except for some 7s in specific positions. The output has numbers like 6, 2, 3, 8, etc. For example, in the input, there's a row with 0s except for 7s in the 10th column. The output for that row has 7s and some numbers like 8, 7, 2, etc. Maybe there's a transformation based on the position of the 7s or other numbers.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that in Example 3, the output has numbers that are in the same positions as the 7s in the input, but replaced with other numbers. For example, in the input, there's a row with 0s except for 7s in columns 5-7. The output has 7s in those positions but also some other numbers. Wait, maybe the transformation is not just replacing numbers but also modifying based on their positions or surrounding cells.\n\nLooking at Example 4. The input has a 7 in the 6th row, column 6, and the output has a 7 there. But in another part, the input has a 7 in row 12, column 1, and the output has an 8 there. So maybe there's a rule where certain positions are replaced with specific numbers based on their location.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain numbers are replaced based on their position. For example, numbers in certain rows or columns are replaced with others. Or maybe the numbers are being replaced based on the number of surrounding cells with certain values.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 3. The input has a row with 0s except for 7s in positions (row 5, columns 5-7). The output for that row has 7s in the same positions but also other numbers. For instance, in the output, the 7th column (index 6?) has a 8. Maybe there's a rule where certain positions are replaced based on their proximity to other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the count of certain numbers in the vicinity. For example, in Example 3, the output has numbers that are in positions where the input had 7s, but with some modification. For example, the output has 8 in some positions where the input had 7s. But how?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 3, the input has a 7 in position (row 5, column 5). The output for that position is 7. But in another part, the input has a 7 in (row 12, column 1), and the output is 8. So maybe there's a rule that replaces 7s with 8s in certain positions. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of adjacent 7s. For example, in Example 3, the output has numbers that are in positions where the input had 7s, but the value is determined by the number of adjacent 7s. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at Example 4. The input has a 7 in row 5, column 6. The output has a 7 there. But in row 12, column 1, the input has a 7, and the output has an 8. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with numbers based on their position in the grid.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 4, the output has 2s in some positions. For instance, in row 7, column 6, the output is 2. The input for that position is 0. Maybe the transformation is replacing certain positions with numbers based on their coordinates. For example, if the row and column indices are even or odd, or some other property.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if (row + column) is even, replace with a certain number. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 7s in the input. For example, in Example 3, the output has numbers that are 2s, 3s, 6s, etc., which might be related to the number of 7s in the vicinity.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a pattern where certain numbers are replaced with others. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6s where the input had 0s. But that's not consistent. For example, in the first example's output, the first row has a 6 in column 17. The input for that position is 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the number in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. For instance, in Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions. Looking at the input for Example 3, the last row has a 6 in column 5. The output for that row has a 6 in column 5. But the output for that row also has 2s in other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and its position. For example, if the original value is 0, replace it with a number based on its position. For example, in Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions. The input for those positions is 0. So maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with numbers based on their coordinates.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 3. The input has a row with 0s except for 7s in positions 5-7 (columns 5-7). The output for that row has 7s in those positions, but also other numbers. For example, in the output, the 7th column (index 6?) has an 8. Maybe that's because there are multiple 7s around it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 7s in the input. For example, if a cell is in a position where there are multiple 7s nearby, it's replaced with a certain number. But how to quantify that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, and the position is in a certain row or column, replace it with a specific number. For example, in Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions where the input was 0. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 4. The input has a 7 in row 5, column 6. The output has 7 there. But in row 12, column 1, the input has a 7, and the output has 8. So maybe the transformation is replacing 7s with 8s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 7 and the row is even, replace with 8. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 4, the input has a 7 in row 12, column 1. The output for that position is 8. Also, in the output, there's a 2 in row 7, column 6. The input for that position is 0. So maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with numbers based on their position. For example, if the row is even, replace with 2, if the column is even, replace with 2, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the sum of row and column indices. For example, if (row + column) is even, replace with 2, else 3. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: in Example 3, the output has numbers that are in the same positions as the input's 7s, but with some modifications. For instance, the input has a 7 in (row 5, column 5). The output has 7 in that position. But in (row 12, column 1), the input has 7 and the output has 8. So maybe the rule is that if the cell is part of a certain pattern, like a line or a shape, it's replaced with a specific value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 7s in the input. For example, if a cell is part of a group of 7s, then replace it with a certain number. But again, without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 4. The input has a 7 in row 5, column 6. The output has 7 there. But in row 12, column 1, the input has 7 and the output has 8. Maybe the transformation is replacing 7s with 8s if they are in certain positions. For example, if the row is even, replace with 8. But that's not consistent with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 4, there are 2s in positions where the input was 0. For example, row 7, column 6 is 2. The input for that position is 0. So maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with numbers based on their position. For example, if the row is 7 and column is 6, replace with 2. But how to generalize that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, then the new value is determined by the row and column. Like, if the row is even, then replace with 2, else 3. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions. The input for those positions is 0. The output has 6s in positions where the input was 0. But why 6? Maybe because the row or column index is a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, and the row is 23, then replace with 6. But that's too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the first row of the output has 0s except for 6 and 2 in certain positions. The input for those positions was 0. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with numbers based on the row and column. For example, in row 0, column 17, the output is 6. Maybe the row and column indices determine the new value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, then the new value is the number of 7s in the same row or column. But how to calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the first row has 6s in certain positions. The input for those positions was 0. So maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with numbers based on the number of 7s in the input. For example, if there are multiple 7s in the row or column, replace with 6. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure of the exact pattern. Maybe I should try to find a rule that works for multiple examples.\n\nLooking at Example 4's output. The input has a 7 in row 5, column 6. The output is 7. But in row 12, column 1, the input is 7 and output is 8. So maybe the transformation is replacing 7s with 8s in certain positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 7s in the input. For example, if a cell is part of a group of 7s, then replace with a certain number. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns where numbers are replaced with other numbers based on their position. For example, in Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions. The input for those positions is 0. The output has 6 in row 0, column 17. The input for that position is 0. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 6 if the row is 0 and column is 17. But that's too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the row and column indices. For example, if the original value is 0 and the row is even, replace with 2, else 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the first row has 0s except for 6 and 2 in certain positions. The input for those positions is 0. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with numbers based on the row and column. For example, if the row is 0 and the column is 17, replace with 6. But how to generalize that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, then the new value is the sum of the row and column indices modulo some number. For example, row + column mod 5 gives the new value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, then the new value is the number of 7s in the input grid. But that's not possible since the output varies.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the first row has 6s and 2s. The input for those positions is 0. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with numbers based on their position. For example, if the column is 17, replace with 6. But again, this is too specific.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions. For example, in the last row of the input (row 23), the input has 6 in column 5. The output for that row has 6 in column 5. But in the output of Example 3, the first row has 6 in column 17. The input for that position is 0. So maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 6s in certain positions, and 7s with 8s in others.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example:\n\n- If the original value is 0, replace it with 6 if the row is even and column is even, else replace with 2.\n- If the original value is 7, replace with 8 if the row is even, else 7.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 4's output, the input has a 7 in row 5, column 6. The output is 7. But in row 12, column 1, the input is 7, and the output is 8. So maybe if the row is even, replace 7 with 8. But row 5 is odd, so it's kept as 7. Row 12 is even, so replaced with 8.\n\nThat seems possible. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 7 in row 0, column 5. The output for that position is 7. But in row 7, column 5, the input has 0 and the output is 6. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example:\n\n- If the original value is 7 and the row is even, replace with 8.\n- If the original value is 0 and the row is even, replace with 6.\n- If the original value is 0 and the column is even, replace with 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, replace with a certain value regardless of the original value. For example, in Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions where the input was 0. Maybe the row is 0, column is 17, so replace with 6. But again, this is arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions. The input for those positions is 0. The output has 6 in row 0, column 17. The input for that position is 0. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 6s in certain positions, and 7s with 8s in others. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 7s in the input. For example, if the cell is in a row where there are multiple 7s, replace with 6. But how to determine that.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let me try to find a pattern that works for at least some examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions. The input for those positions is 0. The output has 6 in row 0, column 17. The input for that position is 0. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 6 if the row is 0 and column is 17. But this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, if the row is even and column is even, replace with 2. If row is even and column is odd, replace with 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 4, the output has 2s in positions where the input was 0. For example, in row 7, column 6, the input is 0, and output is 2. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 2 if the row is 7 and column is 6. But again, this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, then the new value is the row index plus column index modulo some number. For example, row + column mod 5. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the first row has 6s in certain positions. The input for those positions is 0. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 6 if the row is 0 and column is 17. But this is too specific.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is replacing 0s with certain numbers based on their position, and replacing 7s with other numbers based on their position.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the original value is 0, replace it with 6 if the row is 0 and column is 17.\n- If the original value is 7, replace it with 8 if the row is 12 and column is 1.\n\nBut this is not a general rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example:\n\n- Replace 0 with 6 if the row is even and column is even.\n- Replace 0 with 2 if the row is odd and column is even.\n- Replace 7 with 8 if the row is even.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the first row has 6 in column 17. The input for that position is 0. The output has 6 in that position. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 6 in certain positions, and 7s with 8 in others.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to proceed. Given that, I'll try to write a function that replaces 0s with certain values based on their position, and replaces 7s with other values based on their position.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the original value is 0, replace it with 6 if the row is 0 and column is 17.\n- If the original value is 0, replace it with 2 if the row is 7 and column is 6.\n- If the original value is 7, replace it with 8 if the row is 12 and column is 1.\n\nBut this is not a general solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, if the row is even, replace 0 with 2. If the column is even, replace 0 with 6.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example:\n\n- If the original value is 0, then the new value is 6 if the row is 0, else 2.\n- If the original value is 7, then the new value is 8 if the row is even, else 7.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 0s with 2 or 6 based on their position, and replaces 7s with 8 based on their row.\n\nBut this is not a solid pattern, but it's the best I can do given the examples.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids for these examples. Let me look at the examples and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input and output grids are both 28x19. The input has a lot of 0s and some numbers like 7, 6, etc. The output has numbers like 6, 2, 3, 8, etc. It seems like some numbers are being replaced with others. For instance, in the first example's output, there's a 6 in the first row, which might correspond to a 0 in the input. But I need to find a consistent rule.\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input has a lot of 0s except for some 7s in specific positions. The output has numbers like 6, 2, 3, 8, etc. For example, in the input, there's a row with 0s except for 7s in the 10th column. The output for that row has 7s and some numbers like 8, 7, 2, etc. Maybe there's a transformation based on the position of the 7s or other numbers.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that in Example 3, the output has numbers that are in the same positions as the 7s in the input, but replaced with other numbers. For example, in the input, there's a row with 0s except for 7s in columns 5-7. The output has 7s in those positions but also some other numbers. Wait, maybe the transformation is not just replacing numbers but also modifying based on their positions or surrounding cells.\n\nLooking at Example 4. The input has a 7 in the 6th row, column 6, and the output has a 7 there. But in another part, the input has a 7 in row 12, column 1, and the output has an 8 there. So maybe there's a rule where certain positions are replaced with specific numbers based on their location.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain numbers are replaced based on their position. For example, numbers in certain rows or columns are replaced with others. Or maybe the numbers are being replaced based on the number of surrounding cells with certain values.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 3. The input has a row with 0s except for 7s in positions (row 5, columns 5-7). The output for that row has 7s in the same positions but also other numbers. For instance, in the output, the 7th column (index 6?) has a 8. Maybe there's a rule where certain positions are replaced based on their proximity to other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the count of certain numbers in the vicinity. For example, in Example 3, the output has numbers that are in positions where the input had 7s, but with some modification. For example, the output has 8 in some positions where the input had 7s. But how?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 3, the input has a 7 in position (row 5, column 5). The output for that position is 7. But in another part, the input has a 7 in (row 12, column 1), and the output is 8. So maybe there's a rule that replaces 7s with 8s in certain positions. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of adjacent 7s. For example, in Example 3, the output has numbers that are in positions where the input had 7s, but the value is determined by the number of adjacent 7s. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at Example 4. The input has a 7 in row 5, column 6. The output has a 7 there. But in row 12, column 1, the input has a 7, and the output has an 8. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with numbers based on their position in the grid.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 4, the output has 2s in some positions. For instance, in row 7, column 6, the output is 2. The input for that position is 0. Maybe the transformation is replacing certain positions with numbers based on their coordinates. For example, if the row and column indices are even or odd, or some other property.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if (row + column) is even, replace with a certain number. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 7s in the input. For example, in Example 3, the output has numbers that are 2s, 3s, 6s, etc., which might be related to the number of 7s in the vicinity.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a pattern where certain numbers are replaced with others. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6s where the input had 0s. But that's not consistent. For example, in the first example's output, the first row has a 6 in column 17. The input for that position is 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the number in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. For instance, in Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions. Looking at the input for Example 3, the last row has a 6 in column 5. The output for that row has a 6 in column 5. But the output for that row also has 2s in other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and its position. For example, if the original value is 0, replace it with a number based on its position. For example, in Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions. The input for those positions is 0. So maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with numbers based on their coordinates.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 3. The input has a row with 0s except for 7s in positions 5-7 (columns 5-7). The output for that row has 7s in those positions, but also other numbers. For example, in the output, the 7th column (index 6?) has an 8. Maybe that's because there are multiple 7s around it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 7s in the input. For example, if a cell is in a position where there are multiple 7s nearby, it's replaced with a certain number. But how to quantify that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, and the position is in a certain row or column, replace it with a specific number. For example, in Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions where the input was 0. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 4. The input has a 7 in row 5, column 6. The output has 7 there. But in row 12, column 1, the input has a 7, and the output has 8. So maybe the transformation is replacing 7s with 8s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 7 and the row is even, replace with 8. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 4, the input has a 7 in row 12, column 1. The output for that position is 8. Also, in the output, there's a 2 in row 7, column 6. The input for that position is 0. So maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with numbers based on their position. For example, if the row is even, replace with 2, if the column is even, replace with 2, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the sum of row and column indices. For example, if (row + column) is even, replace with 2, else 3. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: in Example 3, the output has numbers that are in the same positions as the input's 7s, but with some modifications. For instance, the input has a 7 in (row 5, column 5). The output has 7 in that position. But in (row 12, column 1), the input has 7 and the output has 8. So maybe the rule is that if the cell is part of a certain pattern, like a line or a shape, it's replaced with a specific value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 7s in the input. For example, if a cell is part of a group of 7s, then replace it with a certain number. But again, without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 4. The input has a 7 in row 5, column 6. The output has 7 there. But in row 12, column 1, the input has 7 and the output has 8. Maybe the transformation is replacing 7s with 8s if they are in certain positions. For example, if the row is even, replace with 8. But that's not consistent with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 4, there are 2s in positions where the input was 0. For example, row 7, column 6 is 2. The input for that position is 0. So maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with numbers based on their position. For example, if the row is 7 and column is 6, replace with 2. But how to generalize that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, then the new value is determined by the row and column. Like, if the row is even, then replace with 2, else 3. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions. The input for those positions is 0. The output has 6s in positions where the input was 0. But why 6? Maybe because the row or column index is a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, and the row is 23, then replace with 6. But that's too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the first row of the output has 0s except for 6 and 2 in certain positions. The input for those positions was 0. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with numbers based on the row and column. For example, in row 0, column 17, the output is 6. Maybe the row and column indices determine the new value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, then the new value is the number of 7s in the same row or column. But how to calculate that?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the first row has 6s in certain positions. The input for those positions was 0. So maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with numbers based on the number of 7s in the input. For example, if there are multiple 7s in the row or column, replace with 6. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure of the exact pattern. Maybe I should try to find a rule that works for multiple examples.\n\nLooking at Example 4's output. The input has a 7 in row 5, column 6. The output is 7. But in row 12, column 1, the input is 7 and output is 8. So maybe the transformation is replacing 7s with 8s in certain positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 7s in the input. For example, if a cell is part of a group of 7s, then replace with a certain number. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns where numbers are replaced with other numbers based on their position. For example, in Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions. The input for those positions is 0. The output has 6 in row 0, column 17. The input for that position is 0. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 6 if the row is 0 and column is 17. But that's too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the row and column indices. For example, if the original value is 0 and the row is even, replace with 2, else 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the first row has 0s except for 6 and 2 in certain positions. The input for those positions is 0. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with numbers based on the row and column. For example, if the row is 0 and the column is 17, replace with 6. But how to generalize that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, then the new value is the sum of the row and column indices modulo some number. For example, row + column mod 5 gives the new value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, then the new value is the number of 7s in the input grid. But that's not possible since the output varies.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the first row has 6s and 2s. The input for those positions is 0. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with numbers based on their position. For example, if the column is 17, replace with 6. But again, this is too specific.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions. For example, in the last row of the input (row 23), the input has 6 in column 5. The output for that row has 6 in column 5. But in the output of Example 3, the first row has 6 in column 17. The input for that position is 0. So maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 6s in certain positions, and 7s with 8s in others.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example:\n\n- If the original value is 0, replace it with 6 if the row is even and column is even, else replace with 2.\n- If the original value is 7, replace with 8 if the row is even, else 7.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 4's output, the input has a 7 in row 5, column 6. The output is 7. But in row 12, column 1, the input is 7, and the output is 8. So maybe if the row is even, replace 7 with 8. But row 5 is odd, so it's kept as 7. Row 12 is even, so replaced with 8.\n\nThat seems possible. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 7 in row 0, column 5. The output for that position is 7. But in row 7, column 5, the input has 0 and the output is 6. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example:\n\n- If the original value is 7 and the row is even, replace with 8.\n- If the original value is 0 and the row is even, replace with 6.\n- If the original value is 0 and the column is even, replace with 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, replace with a certain value regardless of the original value. For example, in Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions where the input was 0. Maybe the row is 0, column is 17, so replace with 6. But again, this is arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions. The input for those positions is 0. The output has 6 in row 0, column 17. The input for that position is 0. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 6s in certain positions, and 7s with 8s in others. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 7s in the input. For example, if the cell is in a row where there are multiple 7s, replace with 6. But how to determine that.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let me try to find a pattern that works for at least some examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions. The input for those positions is 0. The output has 6 in row 0, column 17. The input for that position is 0. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 6 if the row is 0 and column is 17. But this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, if the row is even and column is even, replace with 2. If row is even and column is odd, replace with 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 4, the output has 2s in positions where the input was 0. For example, in row 7, column 6, the input is 0, and output is 2. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 2 if the row is 7 and column is 6. But again, this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 0, then the new value is the row index plus column index modulo some number. For example, row + column mod 5. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the first row has 6s in certain positions. The input for those positions is 0. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 6 if the row is 0 and column is 17. But this is too specific.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is replacing 0s with certain numbers based on their position, and replacing 7s with other numbers based on their position.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the original value is 0, replace it with 6 if the row is 0 and column is 17.\n- If the original value is 7, replace it with 8 if the row is 12 and column is 1.\n\nBut this is not a general rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example:\n\n- Replace 0 with 6 if the row is even and column is even.\n- Replace 0 with 2 if the row is odd and column is even.\n- Replace 7 with 8 if the row is even.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the first row has 6 in column 17. The input for that position is 0. The output has 6 in that position. Maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 6 in certain positions, and 7s with 8 in others.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to proceed. Given that, I'll try to write a function that replaces 0s with certain values based on their position, and replaces 7s with other values based on their position.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the original value is 0, replace it with 6 if the row is 0 and column is 17.\n- If the original value is 0, replace it with 2 if the row is 7 and column is 6.\n- If the original value is 7, replace it with 8 if the row is 12 and column is 1.\n\nBut this is not a general solution.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, if the row is even, replace 0 with 2. If the column is even, replace 0 with 6.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example:\n\n- If the original value is 0, then the new value is 6 if the row is 0, else 2.\n- If the original value is 7, then the new value is 8 if the row is even, else 7.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 0s with 2 or 6 based on their position, and replaces 7s with 8 based on their row.\n\nBut this is not a solid pattern, but it's the best I can do given the examples.\n"
