We identify each blob (connected component) of non-zero cells in the input.\n2. We record its size (number of cells).\n3. We sort the distinct sizes and assign the smallest blob the color `1`, the next larger blob `2`, and so on.\n4. Finally, we fill each blob in the output grid with its assigned color, leaving the background as `0`.\n\nThis captures the key pattern observed in the training examples: all shapes are retained in place, but recolored according to their relative areas."

We identify each blob (connected component) of non-zero cells in the input.\n2. We record its size (number of cells).\n3. We sort the distinct sizes and assign the smallest blob the color `1`, the next larger blob `2`, and so on.\n4. Finally, we fill each blob in the output grid with its assigned color, leaving the background as `0`.\n\nThis captures the key pattern observed in the training examples: all shapes are retained in place, but recolored according to their relative areas."
