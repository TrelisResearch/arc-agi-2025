              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. **Color/Value Transformation**: The values in the output grids seem to be transformed based on their original values. For example, values of 0 in the input often become 7 or 5 in the output, and values of 9 often become 8 or 6.\n\n2. **Shape Preservation**: The overall shape and structure of the grid are preserved, but the values are transformed in a non-trivial way.\n\n3. **Symmetry and Positional Patterns**: There are some patterns related to symmetry and positional relationships between cells.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves a combination of value mapping and some positional transformation. Here's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 30x30 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(30)] for _ in range(30)]\n    \n    # Value mapping based on observed patterns\n    value_map = {\n        0: 7,  # 0 -> 7\n        1: 2,  # 1 -> 2\n        2: 5,  # 2 -> 5\n        3: 3,  # 3 -> 3\n        4: 4,  # 4 -> 4\n        5: 6,  # 5 -> 6\n        6: 8,  # 6 -> 8\n        7: 1,  # 7 -> 1\n        8: 9,  # 8 -> 9\n        9: 5   # 9 -> 5\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the transformation\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            original_value = grid[i][j]\n            transformed_value = value_map.get(original_value, original_value)\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = transformed_value\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 30x30 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(30)] for _ in range(30)]\n    \n    # Value mapping based on observed patterns\n    value_map = {\n        0: 7,  # 0 -> 7\n        1: 2,  # 1 -> 2\n        2: 5,  # 2 -> 5\n        3: 3,  # 3 -> 3\n        4: 4,  # 4 -> 4\n        5: 6,  # 5 -> 6\n        6: 8,  # 6 -> 8\n        7: 1,  # 7 -> 1\n        8: 9,  # 8 -> 9\n        9: 5   # 9 -> 5\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the transformation\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            original_value = grid[i][j]\n            transformed_value = value_map.get(original_value, original_value)\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = transformed_value\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
