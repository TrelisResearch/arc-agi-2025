There are patterns where values like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are being replaced with higher values in certain regions.\n3. The transformation seems to be based on the position of the values and their neighbors.\n4. There are patterns where values in the middle of the grid are being replaced with higher values, while values on the edges remain the same.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with higher values in specific patterns, particularly in the middle of the grid.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the pattern of values to replace\n    # This is a simple pattern where we replace certain values with higher values\n    # in specific regions of the grid\n    for i in range(18):\n        for j in range(22):\n            # Replace values in the middle of the grid with higher values\n            if 3 <= i <= 14 and 5 <= j <= 16:\n                if transformed_grid[i][j] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 4:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 5:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 7:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 9:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the pattern of values to replace\n    # This is a simple pattern where we replace certain values with higher values\n    # in specific regions of the grid\n    for i in range(18):\n        for j in range(22):\n            # Replace values in the middle of the grid with higher values\n            if 3 <= i <= 14 and 5 <= j <= 16:\n                if transformed_grid[i][j] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 4:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 5:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 7:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 9:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with others in specific patterns.\n2. There are patterns where values like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are being replaced with higher values in certain regions.\n3. The transformation seems to be based on the position of the values and their neighbors.\n4. There are patterns where values in the middle of the grid are being replaced with higher values, while values on the edges remain the same.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with higher values in specific patterns, particularly in the middle of the grid.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the pattern of values to replace\n    # This is a simple pattern where we replace certain values with higher values\n    # in specific regions of the grid\n    for i in range(18):\n        for j in range(22):\n            # Replace values in the middle of the grid with higher values\n            if 3 <= i <= 14 and 5 <= j <= 16:\n                if transformed_grid[i][j] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 4:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 5:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 7:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 9:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the pattern of values to replace\n    # This is a simple pattern where we replace certain values with higher values\n    # in specific regions of the grid\n    for i in range(18):\n        for j in range(22):\n            # Replace values in the middle of the grid with higher values\n            if 3 <= i <= 14 and 5 <= j <= 16:\n                if transformed_grid[i][j] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 4:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 5:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 7:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n                elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 9:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
