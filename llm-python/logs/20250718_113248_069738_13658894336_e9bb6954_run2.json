          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe several patterns that might be involved in the transformation:\n\n1. **Numerical patterns**: Numbers 7, 8, 9 seem to appear in specific positions and are often transformed or extended.\n2. **Shape patterns**: There are instances where numbers are extended or repeated in certain patterns.\n3. **Positional patterns**: Certain numbers seem to be placed in specific rows or columns based on their value.\n4. **Transformation of 7s and 8s**: In some examples, 7s and 8s are transformed into longer sequences or extended in specific ways.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Extending or repeating numbers in specific patterns\n- Transforming 7s and 8s into longer sequences\n- Placing numbers in specific rows or columns based on their value\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # Rule 1: Replace 7 with a sequence of 7s in specific positions\n    for i in range(17):\n        for j in range(18):\n            if grid[i][j] == 7:\n                # Replace 7 with a sequence of 7s in specific positions\n                # This is a simplified version based on observations\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n    \n    # Rule 2: Replace 8 with a sequence of 8s in specific positions\n    for i in range(17):\n        for j in range(18):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8 with a sequence of 8s in specific positions\n                # This is a simplified version based on observations\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    # Rule 3: Replace 9 with a sequence of 9s in specific positions\n    for i in range(17):\n        for j in range(18):\n            if grid[i][j] == 9:\n                # Replace 9 with a sequence of 9s in specific positions\n                # This is a simplified version based on observations\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n    \n    # Rule 4: Replace 0 with a sequence of 0s in specific positions\n    for i in range(17):\n        for j in range(18):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Replace 0 with a sequence of 0s in specific positions\n                #
