    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by analyzing each example.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 3x12 grid. So each row of the input is being expanded into 4 columns? Wait, 3 rows in input, each row becomes 4 columns in output? Wait, the output is 3 rows each with 12 elements. Wait, original input is 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 3 rows, each with 12 elements. So each input row is being transformed into 4 times as many elements? Because 3*4=12. Hmm. Wait, maybe each input row is being expanded into 4 columns, but how?\n\nWait, for example 1's input:\n\nFirst input row is 7 5 7. The output first row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Let me split that into 3 parts. The first three elements are 7 5 7, then next three are 7 5 7 again? Wait, no. Wait the output row is 12 elements. Let me split into 3 parts of 4 elements each? Or maybe each input row is being duplicated in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking each row of the input and applying some transformation that expands it into 4 columns. Let me check the first row of output. The first row of output is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Let me see the pattern here. The original input row is 7 5 7. The output row starts with 7 5 7, then repeats 7 5 7 again? But that would be 6 elements. Wait, but the output is 12 elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is being mirrored or transformed in some way. Let's look at the first output row. Let me split it into four parts of three elements each. Wait, 12 elements divided into 3 parts would be 4 parts of 3 elements each? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input rows and some transformed versions.\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nFirst output row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Let me see if this is the original input row followed by some pattern. The original input row is 7 5 7. The output row seems to be 7 5 7 repeated three times? But 3 times would be 9 elements. But the output is 12 elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is being expanded into 4 columns. Let me think about the first input row: 7 5 7. The output first row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Let's split this into four parts of three elements each:\n\nFirst three: 7 5 7\n\nSecond three: 7 5 7\n\nThird three: 7 5 7\n\nFourth three: 7 5 7?\n\nWait that would be 12 elements. But the output is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. So that's four times 7 5 7? Wait, but that would be 12 elements. But the first three elements are 7 5 7, then next three are 7 5 7 again, then same again. But the output is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Wait that's 7 5 7 followed by 7 5 7 followed by 7 5 7 followed by 7 5 7? But that would be 7 5 7 repeated four times. But the output is 12 elements, which would be 4*3=12. But the actual output is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Wait that's 7 5 7, then 7 5 7, then 7 5 7, then 7 5 7. So the first three elements are 7 5 7, then next three are 7 5 7 again. So that's four times. But that would be 4*3=12 elements. So maybe each input row is being repeated four times? But that would be the same as the input row repeated four times. But in example 1's output, the first row is 7 5 7 repeated four times. But the second row of the output is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Let me check that. Original input row is 5 5 7. The output row is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Hmm, that seems different. Let me split this into four parts of three elements each. First three: 7 5 5, then 5 5 7, then 7 5 5, then 5 5 7. Wait that's not matching the input. The input row is 5 5 7. So maybe the output row is the input row mirrored or transformed in some way. Alternatively, maybe each row is being transformed into a pattern that's a combination of the original row and some mirrored or reversed version.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the original row and then applying some transformation that expands it into 4 columns. For example, maybe each input row is being expanded into four times its length. But that's not possible here since the input is 3 elements and output is 12 elements. So 3*4=12. So maybe each input row is expanded into four times its length. How?\n\nLooking at example 1's first input row: 7 5 7. The output row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Let me see the pattern here. It seems that the original row is followed by a mirrored version. Wait, the original row is 7 5 7. The output row is 7 5 7 followed by 7 5 7 again? But that would be 6 elements. But the output is 12 elements. Hmm. Maybe the original row is being repeated four times? But that would be 3*4=12 elements. But that would make the first row of output as 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Which is exactly the first row of example 1's output. So that's possible. Wait, but then the second row of the output is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Let me check. The original input row is 5 5 7. If we repeat that four times, it would be 5 5 7 5 5 7 5 5 7 5 5 7. But the output row is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. That's different. So that's not the case. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is transformed into a pattern that's a combination of the original row and some mirrored or reversed version. For example, in the first input row, the original is 7 5 7. The output row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Let's look at the first three elements: 7 5 7. Then the next three: 7 5 7. Then again 7 5 7, then 7 5 7. So that's four times. But that's the same as the original row repeated four times. But then why is the second input row's output different? Let's look at the second input row for example 1: 5 5 7. The output row is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Let me split this into four parts of three elements each. First three: 7 5 5, then 5 5 7, then 7 5 5, then 5 5 7. So the pattern here is that the original row is 5 5 7, but the output is 7 5 5 followed by 5 5 7, then 7 5 5, then 5 5 7. So that seems like the original row is being mirrored and then repeated. Or maybe the first element is swapped with the third? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output row is generated by taking the original row and then adding some transformed version of it.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput is:\n\n7 7 8\n\n5 8 8\n\n5 8 8\n\nOutput is:\n\n8 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 8\n\n8 8 5 5 8 8 8 8 5 5 8 8\n\n8 8 5 5 8 8 8 8 5 5 8 8\n\nHmm. The first input row is 7 7 8. The output first row is 8 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 8. Let me split into four parts of three elements each. First three: 8 7 7, then 7 7 8, then 8 7 7, then 7 7 8. So that's like the original row is 7 7 8, but the first element is 8, then the next three are 7 7 8, then 8 7 7, then 7 7 8. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the original row, then adding some mirrored version.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first output row: 8 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 8. The first three elements are 8 7 7, then 7 7 8, then 8 7 7, then 7 7 8. So the pattern seems to be that the original row is transformed into a pattern where the first element is 8, then the original row, then 8 again, then the original row again. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 3:\n\nInput is:\n\n8 8 8\n\n5 5 7\n\n5 7 8\n\nOutput:\n\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7\n\n8 7 5 5 7 8 8 7 5 5 7 8\n\nThe first input row is 8 8 8. The output first row is all 8s. So that's straightforward. The second input row is 5 5 7. The output is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Wait, that's similar to example 1's second row. The third input row is 5 7 8. The output is 8 7 5 5 7 8 8 7 5 5 7 8. So again, the pattern seems to be that the input row is transformed into some pattern.\n\nLooking at example 4:\n\nInput is:\n\n8 8 7\n\n7 5 5\n\n5 7 8\n\nOutput:\n\n7 8 8 8 8 7 7 8 8 8 8 7\n\n5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5\n\n8 7 5 5 7 8 8 7 5 5 7 8\n\nSo the first input row is 8 8 7. The output first row is 7 8 8 8 8 7 7 8 8 8 8 7. Split into four parts of three elements each: 7 8 8, 8 8 7, 7 8 8, 8 8 7. So the pattern here is that the original row is transformed into a pattern that starts with 7, then the original row, then 7, then the original row again. But that's not clear.\n\nHmm. Trying to find a pattern. Let's think about the output for each row. For example, in example 1, the first input row is 7 5 7. The output row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Which seems like the original row is repeated four times. But that's not the case for the second row of example 1. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is being transformed into a pattern that is a combination of the original row and some mirrored version. For example, the first row of example 1 is 7 5 7. The output row is 7 5 7 followed by 7 5 7, then again 7 5 7, then again 7 5 7. So four times. But that would make the output row 7 5 7 repeated four times. Which is 12 elements. But then for the second row of example 1, the input is 5 5 7. The output row is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which is not the same as 5 5 7 repeated four times. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the original row and then applying some transformation that involves flipping or mirroring. For example, in example 1, the first input row is 7 5 7. The output row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. So the first three elements are the original, then the next three are the same as the original, but maybe with some changes. Wait, but the original is 7 5 7, and the next three elements are 7 5 7 again. So that's four times. But that's not the case for the second row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is being transformed into a pattern that is the original row, followed by the original row reversed, then the original row again, then the reversed original row. But that would be 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 elements. Let's check for example 1's first row. Original is 7 5 7. Reversed is 7 5 7. So the same. So the output would be 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Which matches the first row of example 1. Then for the second row of example 1, original is 5 5 7. Reversed is 7 5 5. So the output would be 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5. But the actual output is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which is different. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the original row, then the original row reversed, then the original row again, then the reversed original row again. But for example 1's first row, the reversed is same as original. So the output would be 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Which matches. But for the second row of example 1, original is 5 5 7. Reversed is 7 5 5. So the output would be 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5. But the actual output is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which is different. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that each row is transformed into a combination of the original row and some other transformation. Let's look at example 2's first row. Input is 7 7 8. Output is 8 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 8. Split into four parts of three elements: 8 7 7, 7 7 8, 8 7 7, 7 7 8. So the first part is 8 7 7, which is the original row with first element changed to 8. Then the next part is the original row. Then again 8 7 7, then the original row again. So that's not consistent. But maybe the pattern is that each row is transformed into a combination of the original row and some other row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the original row and then applying a transformation that involves flipping the first and last elements. Let's see. For example, in example 1's first row: 7 5 7. If we flip the first and last elements, it's the same. So the output row is the same as the original. But the output row is 7 5 7 repeated four times. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the original row and then applying some pattern that involves mirroring and repetition. For example, for each row, the output is the original row, followed by the original row reversed, then the original row again, then the reversed original row again. But for example 1's first row, the reversed is same as original, so the output is original repeated four times. For example 2's first row, original is 7 7 8. Reversed is 8 7 7. So the output would be 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7. But the actual output is 8 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 8. Which is different. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let me try to look for another pattern. Maybe the output is generated by taking the original row and then applying some transformation that depends on the position. For example, the first row of the output is the original row repeated four times. But the second row of example 1 is different. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each row of the input and then creating a new row that is a combination of the original row and some other row. For example, in example 1's first row, the output row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Which can be viewed as the original row followed by the same row again. But that's 6 elements. But the output is 12. So maybe it's followed by the original row again, then again. So four times. But that's not matching the second row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the original row and then applying some transformation that depends on the row's position. For example, the first row of the output is the original row, then the second row is the original row with some changes, etc. But this is too vague.\n\nLooking at example 3's first input row is 8 8 8. The output first row is all 8s. So that's straightforward. The second input row is 5 5 7. The output is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which is similar to example 1's second row. The third input row is 5 7 8. The output is 8 7 5 5 7 8 8 7 5 5 7 8. Which seems like the original row is transformed into a pattern where the first element is 8, then the original row is 5 7 8, then some changes. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of each example, maybe the output is generated by taking each row of the input and then applying a transformation that involves some kind of mirroring and repetition. For example, in example 1, the first row of the output is 7 5 7 repeated four times. But for the second row, the output is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which is 7 5 5 followed by 5 5 7, then 7 5 5, then 5 5 7. So that's the original row (5 5 7) with the first element replaced by 7, then the original row, then replaced again, then original row again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each row of the input and then applying a transformation that involves flipping the first and last elements, then repeating that pattern. For example, in example 1's first row, 7 5 7. Flipping first and last gives the same. So the output is the same row repeated four times. But for example 1's second row, original is 5 5 7. Flipping first and last gives 7 5 5. Then the output row is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which is the flipped row followed by original row, then flipped row again, then original row again. That would be 7 5 5, 5 5 7, 7 5 5, 5 5 7. Which is exactly the output row. So that seems to fit.\n\nLet me check example 2's first row. Original is 7 7 8. Flipping first and last gives 8 7 7. Then the output row is 8 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 8. Which is 8 7 7, 7 7 8, 8 7 7, 7 7 8. So that's the flipped row, original row, flipped row, original row. Which matches the pattern.\n\nFor example 3's second row: input is 5 5 7. Flipping first and last gives 7 5 5. The output row is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which is 7 5 5, 5 5 7, 7 5 5, 5 5 7. Which fits the pattern.\n\nFor example 4's first input row: 8 8 7. Flipping first and last gives 7 8 8. The output row is 7 8 8 8 8 7 7 8 8 8 8 7. Which is 7 8 8, 8 8 7, 7 8 8, 8 8 7. So that fits.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each input row, create a new row by taking the flipped version of the row (flipping first and last elements), then the original row, then the flipped version again, then the original row again. Then, the output row is the concatenation of these four parts.\n\nWait, but for example 1's first row, the flipped version is the same as the original (since first and last are same). So the output is the original row repeated four times. Which is the case. For example 1's second row, the original is 5 5 7. Flipping gives 7 5 5. So the output row is flipped, original, flipped, original. Which is 7 5 5, 5 5 7, 7 5 5, 5 5 7. Which is the output row.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. So the transformation for each row is to take the original row, flip it (swap first and last elements), then repeat the sequence [flipped, original] twice, and concatenate them.\n\nBut wait, for each row, the output row is constructed by taking the flipped row, original row, flipped row, original row. Which is four parts, each of three elements. So total 12 elements.\n\nSo for each input row, the output row is:\n\nflipped_row + original_row + flipped_row + original_row\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's test this with example 1's first row:\n\nOriginal: [7,5,7]\n\nFlipped: [7,5,7] (since first and last are same)\n\nSo output row is [7,5,7] + [7,5,7] + [7,5,7] + [7,5,7] = 12 elements. Which matches.\n\nFor example 1's second row:\n\nOriginal: [5,5,7]\n\nFlipped: [7,5,5]\n\nSo output row is [7,5,5] + [5,5,7] + [7,5,5] + [5,5,7] = 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which matches the output row.\n\nYes! This seems to fit all the examples.\n\nNow let's check example 2's first row:\n\nOriginal: [7,7,8]\n\nFlipped: [8,7,7]\n\nSo output row is [8,7,7] + [7,7,8] + [8,7,7] + [7,7,8] = 8 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 8. Which matches the output row.\n\nExample 3's second row: [5,5,7] \u2192 flipped is [7,5,5]. Output row is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which matches.\n\nExample 4's first row: [8,8,7] \u2192 flipped is [7,8,8]. Output row is 7 8 8 8 8 7 7 8 8 8 8 7. Which matches.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern.\n\nSo the transformation for each input row is to take the original row, flip it (swap first and last elements), then concatenate the flipped row, original row, flipped row, original row.\n\nSo for each row in the input grid, the output row is constructed as follows:\n\nflipped_row = [row[-1], row[1], row[0]] ?\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the original row is [a, b, c]. Flipping first and last elements would give [c, b, a]. So for example, original row [7,5,7], flipped is [7,5,7]. For original [5,5,7], flipped is [7,5,5]. For original [7,7,8], flipped is [8,7,7]. For original [8,8,7], flipped is [7,8,8].\n\nSo the flipped row is [row[-1], row[1], row[0]] ?\n\nWait, for a row of length 3, the first element is index 0, last is index 2. So flipped row would be row[2], row[1], row[0].\n\nYes. So for a row of three elements, the flipped row is [row[2], row[1], row[0]].\n\nSo for each input row, we create the flipped row by swapping first and last elements. Then, the output row is the concatenation of flipped_row + original_row + flipped_row + original_row.\n\nSo for example, the output row is 4 times the length of the input row. Since input row is 3 elements, output row is 12 elements.\n\nSo the transformation for each row is to create a new row that is flipped_row + original_row + flipped_row + original_row.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\nflipped_row = [row[2], row[1], row[0]]\n\noutput_row = flipped_row + row + flipped_row + row\n\nBut wait, for example 1's first row, the output row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Which is flipped_row (7,5,7) + row (7,5,7) + flipped_row (7,5,7) + row (7,5,7). So that's 4 times the row. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code for the function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Flip the row\n        flipped = [row[2], row[1], row[0]]\n        # Create the output row\n        output_row = flipped + row + flipped + row\n        transformed.append(output_row)\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but the output is a 3x12 grid. The input grid is 3 rows. Each row is transformed into 12 elements. So this code would work.\n\nLet me test this with example 1's input:\n\nExample 1's input is:\n\nRow 0: 7 5 7 \u2192 flipped is [7,5,7] \u2192 output row is [7,5,7,7,5,7,7,5,7,7,5,7] \u2192 which matches the first row of the output.\n\nRow 1: 5 5 7 \u2192 flipped is [7,5,5] \u2192 output row is [7,5,5,5,5,7,7,5,5,5,5,7] \u2192 which matches the second row of example 1's output.\n\nRow 2: 7 7 5 \u2192 flipped is [5,7,7] \u2192 output row is [5,7,7,7,7,5,5,7,7,7,7,5] \u2192 which matches the third row of example 1's output.\n\nYes! So this code would work for example 1.\n\nLet me check example 2's input:\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nRow 0: 7 7 8 \u2192 flipped is [8,7,7]. Output row is [8,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,8] \u2192 which matches the first row of example 2's output.\n\nRow 1: 5 8 8 \u2192 flipped is [8,8,5]. Output row is [8,8,5,5,8,8,8,8,5,5,8,8]. But the example 2's second row is 8 8 5 5 8 8 8 8 5 5 8 8. Which matches.\n\nRow 2: 5 8 8 \u2192 same as row 1. Output row is same as row 1. Which matches example 2's third row.\n\nYes.\n\nExample 3's input:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 8 \u2192 flipped is [8,8,8]. Output row is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. Which matches.\n\nRow 1: 5 5 7 \u2192 flipped is [7,5,5]. Output row is [7,5,5,5,5,7,7,5,5,5,5,7]. Which matches the second row of example 3's output.\n\nRow 2: 5 7 8 \u2192 flipped is [8,7,5]. Output row is [8,7,5,5,7,8,8,7,5,5,7,8]. Which matches the third row of example 3's output.\n\nYes.\n\nExample 4's input:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 7 \u2192 flipped is [7,8,8]. Output row is [7,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,7]. Which matches the first row of example 4's output.\n\nRow 1: 7 5 5 \u2192 flipped is [5,5,7]. Output row is [5,5,7,7,5,5,5,5,7,7,5,5]. Which matches the second row of example 4's output.\n\nRow 2: 5 7 8 \u2192 flipped is [8,7,5]. Output row is [8,7,5,5,7,8,8,7,5,5,7,8]. Which matches the third row of example 4's output.\n\nYes! So this code works for all the examples.\n\nSo the code is as described. Now, the function needs to take the input grid (3 rows) and return a 3x12 grid. The code above does that.\n\nSo the final answer is the code that for each row, flips the first and last elements, then concatenates flipped, original, flipped, original.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by analyzing each example.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 3x12 grid. So each row of the input is being expanded into 4 columns? Wait, 3 rows in input, each row becomes 4 columns in output? Wait, the output is 3 rows each with 12 elements. Wait, original input is 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 3 rows, each with 12 elements. So each input row is being transformed into 4 times as many elements? Because 3*4=12. Hmm. Wait, maybe each input row is being expanded into 4 columns, but how?\n\nWait, for example 1's input:\n\nFirst input row is 7 5 7. The output first row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Let me split that into 3 parts. The first three elements are 7 5 7, then next three are 7 5 7 again? Wait, no. Wait the output row is 12 elements. Let me split into 3 parts of 4 elements each? Or maybe each input row is being duplicated in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking each row of the input and applying some transformation that expands it into 4 columns. Let me check the first row of output. The first row of output is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Let me see the pattern here. The original input row is 7 5 7. The output row starts with 7 5 7, then repeats 7 5 7 again? But that would be 6 elements. Wait, but the output is 12 elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is being mirrored or transformed in some way. Let's look at the first output row. Let me split it into four parts of three elements each. Wait, 12 elements divided into 3 parts would be 4 parts of 3 elements each? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input rows and some transformed versions.\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nFirst output row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Let me see if this is the original input row followed by some pattern. The original input row is 7 5 7. The output row seems to be 7 5 7 repeated three times? But 3 times would be 9 elements. But the output is 12 elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is being expanded into 4 columns. Let me think about the first input row: 7 5 7. The output first row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Let's split this into four parts of three elements each:\n\nFirst three: 7 5 7\n\nSecond three: 7 5 7\n\nThird three: 7 5 7\n\nFourth three: 7 5 7?\n\nWait that would be 12 elements. But the output is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. So that's four times 7 5 7? Wait, but that would be 12 elements. But the first three elements are 7 5 7, then next three are 7 5 7 again, then same again. But the output is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Wait that's 7 5 7 followed by 7 5 7 followed by 7 5 7 followed by 7 5 7? But that would be 7 5 7 repeated four times. But the output is 12 elements, which would be 4*3=12. But the actual output is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Wait that's 7 5 7, then 7 5 7, then 7 5 7, then 7 5 7. So the first three elements are 7 5 7, then next three are 7 5 7 again. So that's four times. But that would be 4*3=12 elements. So maybe each input row is being repeated four times? But that would be the same as the input row repeated four times. But in example 1's output, the first row is 7 5 7 repeated four times. But the second row of the output is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Let me check that. Original input row is 5 5 7. The output row is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Hmm, that seems different. Let me split this into four parts of three elements each. First three: 7 5 5, then 5 5 7, then 7 5 5, then 5 5 7. Wait that's not matching the input. The input row is 5 5 7. So maybe the output row is the input row mirrored or transformed in some way. Alternatively, maybe each row is being transformed into a pattern that's a combination of the original row and some mirrored or reversed version.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the original row and then applying some transformation that expands it into 4 columns. For example, maybe each input row is being expanded into four times its length. But that's not possible here since the input is 3 elements and output is 12 elements. So 3*4=12. So maybe each input row is expanded into four times its length. How?\n\nLooking at example 1's first input row: 7 5 7. The output row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Let me see the pattern here. It seems that the original row is followed by a mirrored version. Wait, the original row is 7 5 7. The output row is 7 5 7 followed by 7 5 7 again? But that would be 6 elements. But the output is 12 elements. Hmm. Maybe the original row is being repeated four times? But that would be 3*4=12 elements. But that would make the first row of output as 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Which is exactly the first row of example 1's output. So that's possible. Wait, but then the second row of the output is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Let me check. The original input row is 5 5 7. If we repeat that four times, it would be 5 5 7 5 5 7 5 5 7 5 5 7. But the output row is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. That's different. So that's not the case. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is transformed into a pattern that's a combination of the original row and some mirrored or reversed version. For example, in the first input row, the original is 7 5 7. The output row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Let's look at the first three elements: 7 5 7. Then the next three: 7 5 7. Then again 7 5 7, then 7 5 7. So that's four times. But that's the same as the original row repeated four times. But then why is the second input row's output different? Let's look at the second input row for example 1: 5 5 7. The output row is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Let me split this into four parts of three elements each. First three: 7 5 5, then 5 5 7, then 7 5 5, then 5 5 7. So the pattern here is that the original row is 5 5 7, but the output is 7 5 5 followed by 5 5 7, then 7 5 5, then 5 5 7. So that seems like the original row is being mirrored and then repeated. Or maybe the first element is swapped with the third? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output row is generated by taking the original row and then adding some transformed version of it.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput is:\n\n7 7 8\n\n5 8 8\n\n5 8 8\n\nOutput is:\n\n8 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 8\n\n8 8 5 5 8 8 8 8 5 5 8 8\n\n8 8 5 5 8 8 8 8 5 5 8 8\n\nHmm. The first input row is 7 7 8. The output first row is 8 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 8. Let me split into four parts of three elements each. First three: 8 7 7, then 7 7 8, then 8 7 7, then 7 7 8. So that's like the original row is 7 7 8, but the first element is 8, then the next three are 7 7 8, then 8 7 7, then 7 7 8. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the original row, then adding some mirrored version.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first output row: 8 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 8. The first three elements are 8 7 7, then 7 7 8, then 8 7 7, then 7 7 8. So the pattern seems to be that the original row is transformed into a pattern where the first element is 8, then the original row, then 8 again, then the original row again. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 3:\n\nInput is:\n\n8 8 8\n\n5 5 7\n\n5 7 8\n\nOutput:\n\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\n7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7\n\n8 7 5 5 7 8 8 7 5 5 7 8\n\nThe first input row is 8 8 8. The output first row is all 8s. So that's straightforward. The second input row is 5 5 7. The output is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Wait, that's similar to example 1's second row. The third input row is 5 7 8. The output is 8 7 5 5 7 8 8 7 5 5 7 8. So again, the pattern seems to be that the input row is transformed into some pattern.\n\nLooking at example 4:\n\nInput is:\n\n8 8 7\n\n7 5 5\n\n5 7 8\n\nOutput:\n\n7 8 8 8 8 7 7 8 8 8 8 7\n\n5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5\n\n8 7 5 5 7 8 8 7 5 5 7 8\n\nSo the first input row is 8 8 7. The output first row is 7 8 8 8 8 7 7 8 8 8 8 7. Split into four parts of three elements each: 7 8 8, 8 8 7, 7 8 8, 8 8 7. So the pattern here is that the original row is transformed into a pattern that starts with 7, then the original row, then 7, then the original row again. But that's not clear.\n\nHmm. Trying to find a pattern. Let's think about the output for each row. For example, in example 1, the first input row is 7 5 7. The output row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Which seems like the original row is repeated four times. But that's not the case for the second row of example 1. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is being transformed into a pattern that is a combination of the original row and some mirrored version. For example, the first row of example 1 is 7 5 7. The output row is 7 5 7 followed by 7 5 7, then again 7 5 7, then again 7 5 7. So four times. But that would make the output row 7 5 7 repeated four times. Which is 12 elements. But then for the second row of example 1, the input is 5 5 7. The output row is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which is not the same as 5 5 7 repeated four times. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the original row and then applying some transformation that involves flipping or mirroring. For example, in example 1, the first input row is 7 5 7. The output row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. So the first three elements are the original, then the next three are the same as the original, but maybe with some changes. Wait, but the original is 7 5 7, and the next three elements are 7 5 7 again. So that's four times. But that's not the case for the second row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each row is being transformed into a pattern that is the original row, followed by the original row reversed, then the original row again, then the reversed original row. But that would be 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12 elements. Let's check for example 1's first row. Original is 7 5 7. Reversed is 7 5 7. So the same. So the output would be 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Which matches the first row of example 1. Then for the second row of example 1, original is 5 5 7. Reversed is 7 5 5. So the output would be 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5. But the actual output is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which is different. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the original row, then the original row reversed, then the original row again, then the reversed original row again. But for example 1's first row, the reversed is same as original. So the output would be 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Which matches. But for the second row of example 1, original is 5 5 7. Reversed is 7 5 5. So the output would be 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5. But the actual output is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which is different. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that each row is transformed into a combination of the original row and some other transformation. Let's look at example 2's first row. Input is 7 7 8. Output is 8 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 8. Split into four parts of three elements: 8 7 7, 7 7 8, 8 7 7, 7 7 8. So the first part is 8 7 7, which is the original row with first element changed to 8. Then the next part is the original row. Then again 8 7 7, then the original row again. So that's not consistent. But maybe the pattern is that each row is transformed into a combination of the original row and some other row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the original row and then applying a transformation that involves flipping the first and last elements. Let's see. For example, in example 1's first row: 7 5 7. If we flip the first and last elements, it's the same. So the output row is the same as the original. But the output row is 7 5 7 repeated four times. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the original row and then applying some pattern that involves mirroring and repetition. For example, for each row, the output is the original row, followed by the original row reversed, then the original row again, then the reversed original row again. But for example 1's first row, the reversed is same as original, so the output is original repeated four times. For example 2's first row, original is 7 7 8. Reversed is 8 7 7. So the output would be 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7. But the actual output is 8 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 8. Which is different. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Let me try to look for another pattern. Maybe the output is generated by taking the original row and then applying some transformation that depends on the position. For example, the first row of the output is the original row repeated four times. But the second row of example 1 is different. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each row of the input and then creating a new row that is a combination of the original row and some other row. For example, in example 1's first row, the output row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Which can be viewed as the original row followed by the same row again. But that's 6 elements. But the output is 12. So maybe it's followed by the original row again, then again. So four times. But that's not matching the second row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the original row and then applying some transformation that depends on the row's position. For example, the first row of the output is the original row, then the second row is the original row with some changes, etc. But this is too vague.\n\nLooking at example 3's first input row is 8 8 8. The output first row is all 8s. So that's straightforward. The second input row is 5 5 7. The output is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which is similar to example 1's second row. The third input row is 5 7 8. The output is 8 7 5 5 7 8 8 7 5 5 7 8. Which seems like the original row is transformed into a pattern where the first element is 8, then the original row is 5 7 8, then some changes. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of each example, maybe the output is generated by taking each row of the input and then applying a transformation that involves some kind of mirroring and repetition. For example, in example 1, the first row of the output is 7 5 7 repeated four times. But for the second row, the output is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which is 7 5 5 followed by 5 5 7, then 7 5 5, then 5 5 7. So that's the original row (5 5 7) with the first element replaced by 7, then the original row, then replaced again, then original row again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each row of the input and then applying a transformation that involves flipping the first and last elements, then repeating that pattern. For example, in example 1's first row, 7 5 7. Flipping first and last gives the same. So the output is the same row repeated four times. But for example 1's second row, original is 5 5 7. Flipping first and last gives 7 5 5. Then the output row is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which is the flipped row followed by original row, then flipped row again, then original row again. That would be 7 5 5, 5 5 7, 7 5 5, 5 5 7. Which is exactly the output row. So that seems to fit.\n\nLet me check example 2's first row. Original is 7 7 8. Flipping first and last gives 8 7 7. Then the output row is 8 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 8. Which is 8 7 7, 7 7 8, 8 7 7, 7 7 8. So that's the flipped row, original row, flipped row, original row. Which matches the pattern.\n\nFor example 3's second row: input is 5 5 7. Flipping first and last gives 7 5 5. The output row is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which is 7 5 5, 5 5 7, 7 5 5, 5 5 7. Which fits the pattern.\n\nFor example 4's first input row: 8 8 7. Flipping first and last gives 7 8 8. The output row is 7 8 8 8 8 7 7 8 8 8 8 7. Which is 7 8 8, 8 8 7, 7 8 8, 8 8 7. So that fits.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each input row, create a new row by taking the flipped version of the row (flipping first and last elements), then the original row, then the flipped version again, then the original row again. Then, the output row is the concatenation of these four parts.\n\nWait, but for example 1's first row, the flipped version is the same as the original (since first and last are same). So the output is the original row repeated four times. Which is the case. For example 1's second row, the original is 5 5 7. Flipping gives 7 5 5. So the output row is flipped, original, flipped, original. Which is 7 5 5, 5 5 7, 7 5 5, 5 5 7. Which is the output row.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. So the transformation for each row is to take the original row, flip it (swap first and last elements), then repeat the sequence [flipped, original] twice, and concatenate them.\n\nBut wait, for each row, the output row is constructed by taking the flipped row, original row, flipped row, original row. Which is four parts, each of three elements. So total 12 elements.\n\nSo for each input row, the output row is:\n\nflipped_row + original_row + flipped_row + original_row\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's test this with example 1's first row:\n\nOriginal: [7,5,7]\n\nFlipped: [7,5,7] (since first and last are same)\n\nSo output row is [7,5,7] + [7,5,7] + [7,5,7] + [7,5,7] = 12 elements. Which matches.\n\nFor example 1's second row:\n\nOriginal: [5,5,7]\n\nFlipped: [7,5,5]\n\nSo output row is [7,5,5] + [5,5,7] + [7,5,5] + [5,5,7] = 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which matches the output row.\n\nYes! This seems to fit all the examples.\n\nNow let's check example 2's first row:\n\nOriginal: [7,7,8]\n\nFlipped: [8,7,7]\n\nSo output row is [8,7,7] + [7,7,8] + [8,7,7] + [7,7,8] = 8 7 7 7 7 8 8 7 7 7 7 8. Which matches the output row.\n\nExample 3's second row: [5,5,7] \u2192 flipped is [7,5,5]. Output row is 7 5 5 5 5 7 7 5 5 5 5 7. Which matches.\n\nExample 4's first row: [8,8,7] \u2192 flipped is [7,8,8]. Output row is 7 8 8 8 8 7 7 8 8 8 8 7. Which matches.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern.\n\nSo the transformation for each input row is to take the original row, flip it (swap first and last elements), then concatenate the flipped row, original row, flipped row, original row.\n\nSo for each row in the input grid, the output row is constructed as follows:\n\nflipped_row = [row[-1], row[1], row[0]] ?\n\nWait, wait. Wait, the original row is [a, b, c]. Flipping first and last elements would give [c, b, a]. So for example, original row [7,5,7], flipped is [7,5,7]. For original [5,5,7], flipped is [7,5,5]. For original [7,7,8], flipped is [8,7,7]. For original [8,8,7], flipped is [7,8,8].\n\nSo the flipped row is [row[-1], row[1], row[0]] ?\n\nWait, for a row of length 3, the first element is index 0, last is index 2. So flipped row would be row[2], row[1], row[0].\n\nYes. So for a row of three elements, the flipped row is [row[2], row[1], row[0]].\n\nSo for each input row, we create the flipped row by swapping first and last elements. Then, the output row is the concatenation of flipped_row + original_row + flipped_row + original_row.\n\nSo for example, the output row is 4 times the length of the input row. Since input row is 3 elements, output row is 12 elements.\n\nSo the transformation for each row is to create a new row that is flipped_row + original_row + flipped_row + original_row.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\nflipped_row = [row[2], row[1], row[0]]\n\noutput_row = flipped_row + row + flipped_row + row\n\nBut wait, for example 1's first row, the output row is 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7 7 5 7. Which is flipped_row (7,5,7) + row (7,5,7) + flipped_row (7,5,7) + row (7,5,7). So that's 4 times the row. Which is correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code for the function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Flip the row\n        flipped = [row[2], row[1], row[0]]\n        # Create the output row\n        output_row = flipped + row + flipped + row\n        transformed.append(output_row)\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but the output is a 3x12 grid. The input grid is 3 rows. Each row is transformed into 12 elements. So this code would work.\n\nLet me test this with example 1's input:\n\nExample 1's input is:\n\nRow 0: 7 5 7 \u2192 flipped is [7,5,7] \u2192 output row is [7,5,7,7,5,7,7,5,7,7,5,7] \u2192 which matches the first row of the output.\n\nRow 1: 5 5 7 \u2192 flipped is [7,5,5] \u2192 output row is [7,5,5,5,5,7,7,5,5,5,5,7] \u2192 which matches the second row of example 1's output.\n\nRow 2: 7 7 5 \u2192 flipped is [5,7,7] \u2192 output row is [5,7,7,7,7,5,5,7,7,7,7,5] \u2192 which matches the third row of example 1's output.\n\nYes! So this code would work for example 1.\n\nLet me check example 2's input:\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nRow 0: 7 7 8 \u2192 flipped is [8,7,7]. Output row is [8,7,7,7,7,8,8,7,7,7,7,8] \u2192 which matches the first row of example 2's output.\n\nRow 1: 5 8 8 \u2192 flipped is [8,8,5]. Output row is [8,8,5,5,8,8,8,8,5,5,8,8]. But the example 2's second row is 8 8 5 5 8 8 8 8 5 5 8 8. Which matches.\n\nRow 2: 5 8 8 \u2192 same as row 1. Output row is same as row 1. Which matches example 2's third row.\n\nYes.\n\nExample 3's input:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 8 \u2192 flipped is [8,8,8]. Output row is [8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]. Which matches.\n\nRow 1: 5 5 7 \u2192 flipped is [7,5,5]. Output row is [7,5,5,5,5,7,7,5,5,5,5,7]. Which matches the second row of example 3's output.\n\nRow 2: 5 7 8 \u2192 flipped is [8,7,5]. Output row is [8,7,5,5,7,8,8,7,5,5,7,8]. Which matches the third row of example 3's output.\n\nYes.\n\nExample 4's input:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 7 \u2192 flipped is [7,8,8]. Output row is [7,8,8,8,8,7,7,8,8,8,8,7]. Which matches the first row of example 4's output.\n\nRow 1: 7 5 5 \u2192 flipped is [5,5,7]. Output row is [5,5,7,7,5,5,5,5,7,7,5,5]. Which matches the second row of example 4's output.\n\nRow 2: 5 7 8 \u2192 flipped is [8,7,5]. Output row is [8,7,5,5,7,8,8,7,5,5,7,8]. Which matches the third row of example 4's output.\n\nYes! So this code works for all the examples.\n\nSo the code is as described. Now, the function needs to take the input grid (3 rows) and return a 3x12 grid. The code above does that.\n\nSo the final answer is the code that for each row, flips the first and last elements, then concatenates flipped, original, flipped, original.\n"
