The output grid has a 9x11 structure, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n2. The transformation seems to involve some kind of shape detection and replacement, where certain patterns of 8s are replaced with different numbers.\n3. There are patterns where 8s are replaced with 1s, 2s, 3s, or 4s, depending on their position and context.\n4. The transformation appears to be based on the shape and position of 8s in the input grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Identifies patterns of 8s\n- Replaces them with different numbers based on their shape and position\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n

The output grid has a 9x11 structure, which is consistent with the problem statement.\n2. The transformation seems to involve some kind of shape detection and replacement, where certain patterns of 8s are replaced with different numbers.\n3. There are patterns where 8s are replaced with 1s, 2s, 3s, or 4s, depending on their position and context.\n4. The transformation appears to be based on the shape and position of 8s in the input grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Identifies patterns of 8s\n- Replaces them with different numbers based on their shape and position\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n

patterns. It replaces 8s with 1s in many cases, but the actual transformation is more complex and depends on the specific patterns of 8s in the input grid.",
