          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the transformation seems to involve some form of rearrangement or permutation of the values in the grid. Let's look at the patterns:\n\n1. In Example 1, the input grid is:\n```\n5 0 0\n3 5 0\n0 0 5\n```\nAnd the output is:\n```\n5 3 0\n0 5 0\n0 0 5\n```\nThis looks like the values are being rearranged in a way that the 5s are moving to the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\n\n2. In Example 2, the input grid is:\n```\n5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0\n6 0 5 0\n6 0 4 5\n```\nAnd the output is:\n```\n5 0 6 6\n0 5 0 0\n0 0 5 4\n0 0 0 5\n```\nThis looks more complex, but I notice that the 5s are still being moved to the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\n\n3. In Example 3, the input grid is:\n```\n5 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0\n8 8 5 0 0\n0 2 0 5 0\n0 2 0 1 5\n```\nAnd the output is:\n```\n5 0 8 0 0\n0 5 8 2 2\n0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 1\n0 0 0 0 5\n```\nAgain, the 5s are being moved to the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves moving the 5s to the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, while other values are rearranged in some way.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the positions of all 5s in the input grid\n    five_positions = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                five_positions.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Place the 5s in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        # Calculate the position in the diagonal\n        diagonal_index = i + j\n        # Calculate the position in the transformed grid\n        new_i = diagonal_index\n        new_j = 0\n        # If new_i exceeds 2, wrap around\n        if new_i > 2:\n            new_i = new_i % 3\n        # Place the 5 in the new position\n        transformed_grid[new_i][new_j] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the positions of all 5s in the input grid\n    five_positions = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                five_positions.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Place the 5s in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        # Calculate the position in the diagonal\n        diagonal_index = i + j\n        # Calculate the position in the transformed grid\n        new_i = diagonal_index\n        new_j = 0\n        # If new_i exceeds 2, wrap around\n        if new_i > 2:\n            new_i = new_i % 3\n        # Place the 5 in the new position\n        transformed_grid[new_i][new_j] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the transformation seems to involve some form of rearrangement or permutation of the values in the grid. Let's look at the patterns:\n\n1. In Example 1, the input grid is:\n```\n5 0 0\n3 5 0\n0 0 5\n```\nAnd the output is:\n```\n5 3 0\n0 5 0\n0 0 5\n```\nThis looks like the values are being rearranged in a way that the 5s are moving to the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\n\n2. In Example 2, the input grid is:\n```\n5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0\n6 0 5 0\n6 0 4 5\n```\nAnd the output is:\n```\n5 0 6 6\n0 5 0 0\n0 0 5 4\n0 0 0 5\n```\nThis looks more complex, but I notice that the 5s are still being moved to the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\n\n3. In Example 3, the input grid is:\n```\n5 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0\n8 8 5 0 0\n0 2 0 5 0\n0 2 0 1 5\n```\nAnd the output is:\n```\n5 0 8 0 0\n0 5 8 2 2\n0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 1\n0 0 0 0 5\n```\nAgain, the 5s are being moved to the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves moving the 5s to the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, while other values are rearranged in some way.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the positions of all 5s in the input grid\n    five_positions = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                five_positions.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Place the 5s in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        # Calculate the position in the diagonal\n        diagonal_index = i + j\n        # Calculate the position in the transformed grid\n        new_i = diagonal_index\n        new_j = 0\n        # If new_i exceeds 2, wrap around\n        if new_i > 2:\n            new_i = new_i % 3\n        # Place the 5 in the new position\n        transformed_grid[new_i][new_j] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the positions of all 5s in the input grid\n    five_positions = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                five_positions.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Place the 5s in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        # Calculate the position in the diagonal\n        diagonal_index = i + j\n        # Calculate the position in the transformed grid\n        new_i = diagonal_index\n        new_j = 0\n        # If new_i exceeds 2, wrap around\n        if new_i > 2:\n            new_i = new_i % 3\n        # Place the 5 in the new position\n        transformed_grid[new_i][new_j] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
