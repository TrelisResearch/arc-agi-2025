              "content": "Looking at the training examples, I observe the following pattern:\n\n1. The transformation seems to propagate values from a single cell to surrounding cells in a radial pattern.\n2. When a cell contains a value (not 0), it appears to spread that value to adjacent cells in a spiral or wave-like pattern.\n3. The spread seems to be in a specific order, starting from the original cell and spreading outward in a certain direction.\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that spreads values from non-zero cells to their neighbors in a specific pattern.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = np.copy(grid_np)\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            # If the cell is not zero, spread the value to neighboring cells\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread value to right, down, left, up in a spiral pattern\n                # This is a simplified version of the spreading pattern\n                # We'll spread the value to the right, then down, then left, then up\n                # and repeat this pattern\n                for k in range(4):\n                    # Calculate the direction\n                    if k == 0:\n                        # Right\n                        for x in range(j+1, 12):\n                            if transformed_grid[i][x] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[i][x] = grid_np[i][j]\n                            else:\n                                break\n                    elif k == 1:\n                        # Down\n                        for x in range(i+1, 13):\n                            if transformed_grid[x][j] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[x][j] = grid_np[i][j]\n                            else:\n                                break\n                    elif k == 2:\n                        # Left\n                        for x in range(j-1, -1, -1):\n                            if transformed_grid[i][x] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[i][x] = grid_np[i][j]\n                            else:\n                                break\n                    elif k == 3:\n                        # Up\n                        for x in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n                            if transformed_grid[x][j] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[x][j] = grid_np[i][j]\n                            else:\n                                break\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nThis implementation attempts to spread non-zero values from their original positions to neighboring cells in a spiral pattern. The spreading pattern is simplified and may not perfectly match all training examples, but it captures the general idea of value propagation observed in the examples.",
