The transformation seems to be taking specific positions from the input grid and placing them in the output grid.\n4. In Example 1, the output has a single 0 in the middle of the 3x3 grid.\n5. In Example 2, there are two 0s in the output grid, one in the middle and one in the middle of the bottom row.\n6. In Example 3, there are two 0s in the output grid, one in the top-left and one in the middle of the bottom row.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation is taking specific positions from the input grid and placing them in the output grid. Specifically, it seems to be taking the values at positions (4, 12), (4, 13), (4, 14), (12, 4), (12, 5), (12, 6), (12, 7), (12, 8), (12, 9), (12, 10), (12, 11), (12, 12), (12, 13), (12, 14), (12, 15) from the input grid and placing them in the output grid.\n\nBased on this pattern, I will write a Python function that implements this transformation.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Extract the relevant values from the input grid\n    relevant_values = [\n        grid[4][12], grid[4][13], grid[4][14],\n        grid[12][4], grid[12][5], grid[12][6], grid[12][7], grid[12][8], grid[12][9],\n        grid[12][10], grid[12][11], grid[12][12], grid[12][13], grid[12][14], grid[12][15]\n    ]\n    \n    # Create the output grid\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(3):\n            row.append(relevant_values[i*3 + j])\n        transformed_grid.append(row)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
