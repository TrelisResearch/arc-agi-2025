The output grid is always 4x4, while the input grid appears to be 10x10 (based on the test input)\n2. The output seems to focus on specific cells in the input grid, particularly those with values 0, 1, 8, and others\n3. The transformation appears to be selecting specific cells from the input grid and creating a new grid from them\n4. There seems to be a pattern of selecting cells in a specific pattern, possibly based on their values and positions\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves selecting specific cells from the input grid and creating a new 4x4 grid from them.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 4x4 output grid initialized with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(4)]\n    \n    # Define the positions to take from the input grid\n    # These positions are based on observing the training examples\n    positions = [\n        (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3),\n        (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3),\n        (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3),\n        (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)\n    ]\n    \n    # Fill the transformed grid with values from the input grid\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            # Get the corresponding position in the input grid\n            input_row, input_col = positions[i * 4 + j]\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[input_row][input_col]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 4x4 output grid initialized with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(4)]\n    \n    # Define the positions to take from the input grid\n    # These positions are based on observing the training examples\n    positions = [\n        (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3),\n        (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3),\n        (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3),\n        (3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)\n    ]\n    \n    # Fill the transformed grid with values from the input grid\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            # Get the corresponding position in the input grid\n            input_row, input_col = positions[i * 4 + j]\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[input_row][input_col]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
