In other words, the output grid is the same as the input grid.\n\n### Implementation\nGiven the hypothesis, the implementation of the transformation function is straightforward:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Since the transformation is an identity transformation, we simply return the input grid\n    return grid\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Since the transformation is an identity transformation, we simply return the input grid\n    return grid\n```\n\nThis solution assumes that the transformation is an identity transformation, which means the output grid is the same as the input grid.
