          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe that the transformation seems to involve some form of pattern recognition and rearrangement of values in the grid. The patterns suggest that values are being moved based on their position and value, possibly following some kind of rule that involves shifting or reordering elements.\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that:\n1. Values are being moved from one position to another in a systematic way.\n2. The transformation seems to involve some kind of rearrangement or rotation of values in the grid.\n3. The output grid always has the same size as the input grid (3x3 for the first example, 4x4 for the second, etc.).\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that rearranges values in a way that seems to follow a pattern of shifting values in a certain direction or based on their position.\n\nHere's my hypothesis for the transformation:\n\n- The transformation involves shifting values in a certain pattern, possibly based on their position and value.\n- The exact pattern is not fully clear, but I'll implement a transformation that rearranges values in a way that seems to follow a consistent pattern across the examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
