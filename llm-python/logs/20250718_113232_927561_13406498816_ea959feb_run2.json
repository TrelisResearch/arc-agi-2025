For example, in Example 1, the output grid appears to be a repetition of the input grid in a certain pattern.\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that repeats the input grid in a certain pattern.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The input grid is 22x25\n    # The output grid is also 22x25\n    # We'll repeat the input grid in a certain pattern\n    \n    # Create a new grid of size 22x25\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(25)] for _ in range(22)]\n    \n    # Copy the input grid into the transformed grid\n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(25):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The input grid is 22x25\n    # The output grid is also 22x25\n    # We'll repeat the input grid in a certain pattern\n    \n    # Create a new grid of size 22x25\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(25)] for _ in range(22)]\n    \n    # Copy the input grid into the transformed grid\n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(25):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

Repeating patterns from the input\n2. Rotations or reflections of patterns\n3. Replacing certain values with others based on their position\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that the output grid is a repetition of the input grid in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output grid appears to be a repetition of the input grid in a certain pattern.\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that repeats the input grid in a certain pattern.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The input grid is 22x25\n    # The output grid is also 22x25\n    # We'll repeat the input grid in a certain pattern\n    \n    # Create a new grid of size 22x25\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(25)] for _ in range(22)]\n    \n    # Copy the input grid into the transformed grid\n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(25):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The input grid is 22x25\n    # The output grid is also 22x25\n    # We'll repeat the input grid in a certain pattern\n    \n    # Create a new grid of size 22x25\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(25)] for _ in range(22)]\n    \n    # Copy the input grid into the transformed grid\n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(25):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
