Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 3 3 4 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 3 2 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 2 3 4 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 3 3 4 0 0 0 4 3 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 2 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 4 3 3 3 2 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 2 3 3 4 0\n0 0 0 0 4 3 3 3 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 8 8 8 8 8\n0 0 8 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 8 0 0 0 8\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 8 8\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0\n0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 8 8 8 8 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 2 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 4 8 8 8 4\n0 0 8 0 2 8 8 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 8\n0 0 4 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 4 2 0 0 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 8 2 0 2 4\n0 0 4 8 4 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 0\n0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 4 8 8 8 4 0\n0 0 4 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 1 1 1 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 2 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 1 2 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 2 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 1 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 1 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 2 0 0 2 4 0\n0 0 0 4 1 1 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 1 2 0 1 0\n0 0 0 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 0 4 1 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 3 3 3 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 3 3 3 0\n0 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 3 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 3 0\n0 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0\n0 3 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 0 3 0\n0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process.

that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 0\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\nOutput:\n0 4 0 0 8 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 9 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 6 0 7\n7 0 0 0 0 2 0 9 0 4 0 0 0 0 6 0 9\n0 0 0 3 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 3 0 0 0 6 4 0\n6 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 6 0 6\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 6 0 0\n0 8 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 4 7 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 6 0 0 5 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n8 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 6\n0 0 0 8 4 0 8 0 6 0 0 2 0\n0 0 7 0 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 6 0 4 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 6 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 3 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 3 0 0 8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 2 3 0 9 0 4 0 0 0 3 0 0 8\n0 0 3 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 0 0 0 9 4 9 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 6 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 1 9 0 0 0 7 0 0 1 2 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 4 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 9 0 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n2 2 3\n5 5 5\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n2 2 3\n5 5 5\n0 2 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n3 6 4 2 4\n8 4 3 3 4\n5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n3 6 4 2 4\n8 4 3 3 4\n5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 4 0 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n1 9 9 6 1 8 4\n4 6 7 8 9 7 1\n9 3 1 4 1 3 6\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 9 9 6 1 8 4\n4 6 7 8 9 7 1\n9 3 1 4 1 3 6\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n9 1 2 8 4 9 8 2 1\n4 4 3 1 2 7 6 7 9\n2 1 6 9 7 8 4 3 6\n9 8 6 3 4 2 9 1 7\n5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import

              "I didn\u2019t find a single clean rule that covers all three examples perfectly, but I did spot that in each case there is a \u201cprimary\u201d multi\u2010colored rectangle (with nested rings or sub\u2010blocks) in one corner, and a similarly sized empty rectangle elsewhere that in the solution is filled with a rotated or reflected copy of the primary pattern.  My improved heuristic will:\n\n1. Extract the bounding box of the largest non\u2010zero region (\u201cprimary pattern\u201d).\n2. Scan for any similarly sized all\u2010zero sub\u2010rectangle.\n3. Paste a rotated (by 180\u00b0) copy of the primary pattern into that empty slot.\n4. If no suitable empty slot is found, return the input unchanged.\n\nThis fixes Example 1 (fills the bottom\u2010right), Example 2 (fills the bottom\u2010left), and Example 3 (fills the center\u2010right), by a simple 180\u00b0 rotation. It still may not catch every subtle case, but it matches more of the training transformations.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = arr.shape\n\n    # 1) Find the primary non-zero bounding box\n    ys, xs = np.where(arr != 0)\n    if len(ys) == 0:\n        return grid\n    y0, y1 = ys.min(), ys.max()\n    x0, x1 = xs.min(), xs.max()\n    primary = arr[y0:y1+1, x0:x1+1]\n    ph, pw = primary.shape\n\n    # 2) Look for an empty (all-zero) sub-rectangle of same size\n    for yi in range(h - ph + 1):\n        for xi in range(w - pw + 1):\n            # skip the primary's own location\n            if yi == y0 and xi == x0:\n                continue\n            region = arr[yi:yi+ph, xi:xi+pw]\n            if np.all(region == 0):\n                # 3) Paste a 180\u00b0 rotated copy of primary\n                rotated = np.rot90(primary, 2)\n                out = arr.copy()\n                out[yi:yi+ph, xi:xi+pw] = rotated\n                return out.tolist()\n\n    # 4) Fallback: no change\n    return grid\n```"

That seed\u2019s rows are extended horizontally by repeating the pattern, and the\n    band of rows spanned by the seed is filled with those repeated rows. Outside that\n    band remains zero.\n\n    Steps:\n    1. Find minimal non-zero bounding box [r0..r1], [c0..c1].\n    2. For each row r in [r0..r1]:\n       a. Extract the non-zero segment seg = grid[r][c0:c1+1].\n       b. Repeat seg to fill columns c0..W\u22121.\n    3. Fill rows r0..r1 of the output with these tiled rows.\n    4.

this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0

in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\n2 0 2 2 0 0 2 2\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 6 0 0 0 6 6 0\n0 6 6 0 0 6 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0\n2 0 6 6 0 0 2 2\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 6 6 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0\n0 6 6 6 0 0 6 6 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n2 2 0 0 0 2\n2 2 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 2\n0 2 2 2 0 0\nOutput:\n6 6 0 0 0 2\n6 6 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 0 2\n0 6 6 6 0 0\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 6 6 0\n0 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0\n2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0\n0 2 0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 2 2 0 0 0 2\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 8 8 8 8 1 8 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 8 2 2 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 8 1\n1 8 2 8 8 8 1 1 8 2 2 8 1 1 1 1\n1 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 8 2 8 8 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1\n1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n1 1 8 8 8 8 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 8 2 2 8 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 1 1\n1 1 8 2 8 8 1 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1\n8 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 8 2 2 8 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 8 2 8 1 1 8 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1\n1 1 8 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 8 1\n1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 8 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n8 2 2 8\n8 8 2 8\n8 8 8 8\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 1 8 1 1 1\n1 8 8 8 8 1 8 1 1 8 8 1 1 1 1 1\n1 8 2 2 8 8 1 1 8 1 1 8 8 1 1 1\n1 8 2 2 8 1 1 8 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 1\n1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n1 8 1 8 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 1 8 8 8 8\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 2 2 8\n1 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 8 2 2 8\n1 8 1 1 1 8 2 8 8 1 1 8 8 8 8 8\n1 1 1 1 1 8 8 2 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 8 8 8 8\n1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 2 2 8\n1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 2 2 8\n1 1 8 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 8 1 8 8 8 8\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8\n8 2 8 8\n8 8 2 8\n8 8 8 8\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n1 8 1 8 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 8 8 1\n1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 1\n8 8 2 8 2 8 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1\n1 8 8 2 8 8 8 1 1 8 2 8 2 8 8 1 1 1\n8 8 2 2 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 2 8 8 1 8 1 1\n1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 8 2 2 8 8 8 1 1 1\n1 8 1 8 1 1 8 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8\n8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n1 1 1 1 8 8 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n8 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1\n8 8 1 1 1 8 2 8 2 8 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 8 1 1 8 8 2 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8\n1 1 1 1 1 8 8 2 2 8 1 1 8 8 1 1 8 1\n1 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1\n1 8 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\nOutput:\n8 8 8 8 8\n8 2 8 2 8\n8 8 2 8 8\n8 8 2 2 8\n8 8 8 8 8\n\nTest Input:\n1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8\n1 1 1 8 1 1 8 1 1 8 1 1 8 8 2 2 8 8\n1 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 2 8 8 8\n1 1 8 2 2 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 2 8\n1 1 8 2 8 8 8 1 8 1 8 1 1 8 8 8 8 8\n1 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n8 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 8 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 8 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 8 8 1\n1 1 1 1 8 1 8 1 1 8 2 2 8 8 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1 1 8 2 8 8 8 8 1 1 1\n8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 2 8 1 1 1 1\n8 2 2 8 8 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1\n8 2 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n8 8 8 2 8 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 8 1\n8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 8 8 2 2 8 1 1 1 1 8\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 8 2 2 8 1 1 1 8 8\n8 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 2 8 8 8 1 1 1 1 1\n8 1 8 1 1 1 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 1 1 1 1\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 2\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 2 1 1 0 0 0\n2 2 0 1 2 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 0 2 2\n2 2 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 2\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 1 2 2\n0 2 3 3 1 1 0 2\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6\n0 0 2 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2\n1 1 0 0 2 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n0 2 0 1 1 0 0 3 0 5 5\n2 2 0 0 1 0 3 3 0 0 5\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

              "Based on the three examples, it appears that in each case there is an underlying \u201ctile\u201d or motif which is being periodically repeated to fill the entire grid, but in the input some of those repeats are zeroed\u2010out (\u201cmissing\u201d) blocks.
