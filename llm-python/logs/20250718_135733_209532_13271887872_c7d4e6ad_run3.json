    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, there are two examples given. Let me look at them carefully.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 10x10. Let's compare them. The input has some 8s and 5s in certain positions, and the output has some changes. For instance, in the third row of the input, there's an 8 in the first column and a 5 in the sixth column. The output for that row has 8 in the first column and 8 in the sixth. Wait, but in the third row of the input, the sixth column is 5, and in the output, it's 8. Hmm, maybe there's some kind of propagation or replication?\n\nLooking at the third row of the input: the first column is 8, sixth is 5. In the output, the third row has 8 in first column and 8 in sixth. Wait, but the sixth column in the input is 5. So maybe the 5 is being replaced by 8? Or maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled based on neighboring cells?\n\nLooking at the fifth row of the input. The input has 8 in the first column and 5 in the sixth. The output for that row has 8 in first column and 8 in sixth. Wait, but in the fifth row of the input, the sixth column is 5. So maybe the 5 is being replaced by 8? But that's not consistent with the first example. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where if a cell is 5, it's being replaced by 8? But in the first example, the third row has a 5 in the sixth column, and the output has 8 there. But in the fifth row of the input, the sixth column is 5, and in the output, it's 8. So maybe that's part of the pattern.\n\nBut then looking at the fourth row of the input. The input has 8 in first column and 5 in sixth. The output has 8 in first column and 8 in sixth. So maybe whenever there's a 5 in a certain position, it's being replaced by 8? But that seems too simple. But then why in the first example, the third row of the input has a 5 in sixth column, and in the output, it's 8. But in the fifth row of the input, the sixth column is 5, and output is 8. So maybe that's the case.\n\nBut then looking at the second example. Let's check that. In the input of example 2, there are 9s, 5s, 6s, 4s. The output has some changes. For example, in the second row of input, there's a 9 in first column and 5 in sixth. The output has 9 in first column and 9 in sixth. Similarly, in the third row of input, there's 9 in first column and 5 in sixth. The output has 9 in first column and 9 in sixth. So again, the 5 is replaced by 9. So maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a 5 in a certain position, it's being replaced by the value of the cell to the left? Or maybe the value of the cell in the same column but earlier row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being replaced by the value of the cell in the same column but in the first row? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at example 1: in the third row, first column is 8, sixth column is 5. In the output, sixth column is 8. So maybe the sixth column is being set to the value of the first column in the same row? But in the fifth row of input, first column is 8, sixth is 5. Output sixth is 8. So that would fit. But in the third row of input, sixth column is 5, and in the output, it's 8. So that seems to be the case.\n\nBut then in the third row of the input, the sixth column is 5, but the output has 8. So maybe the 5 is being replaced by the value of the first column in that row. But in the third row, the first column is 8. So that would explain it. So perhaps for each row, if there's a 5 in a column, it's being replaced by the value of the first column of that row? But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being replaced by the value of the first column in the same row. But in example 2, looking at the second row of input: the first column is 9, sixth is 5. The output has 9 in sixth column. So that fits. Similarly, in the third row of example 2, the first column is 9, sixth is 5. Output has 9 in sixth. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut then what about other numbers? Let's check example 2's fourth row. Input row is 6 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0. Output is 6 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0. So the fifth column is 5, and in the output, it's 6. Wait, but the first column is 6. So maybe the fifth column is being replaced by the first column's value. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being replaced by the first column's value in that row. But in example 1, the third row has a 5 in sixth column, which is replaced by 8 (the first column's value). Similarly, in example 2, the fifth column in the fourth row is 5, replaced by 6 (the first column's value). So that seems to fit.\n\nBut then in example 1's fifth row: input is 8 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0. Output is 8 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0. So the fourth column is 5, which is replaced by 8 (the first column's value). Similarly, the fifth column is 5, replaced by 8. So that fits.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that any cell with a value of 5 in the input is replaced by the value of the first column in the same row. But what about other numbers?\n\nWait, in example 1's third row, the sixth column is 5. The first column is 8. So the output is 8. Similarly, in example 2's second row, sixth column is 5, first column is 9. Output is 9. So that seems to be the case.\n\nBut what about other numbers? For example, in example 2's fourth row, the fifth column is 5. The first column is 6. So the output fifth column is 6. So that fits.\n\nBut what about other numbers? Let's check example 1's fifth row. The fourth column is 5, replaced by 8. But in that row, the first column is 8. So yes.\n\nBut what about other cells that are not 5? For example, in example 1's third row, the first column is 8. The output is same. So maybe the 5s are being replaced by the first column's value. But what about other numbers?\n\nBut in the output of example 1's third row, the sixth column is 8. But in the input, the sixth column is 5. So that's the replacement. So perhaps the rule is: for any cell in the input that is 5, replace it with the value of the first column of the same row. But what about other numbers?\n\nWait, but in example 1's fifth row, the fourth column is 5. The first column is 8, so it's replaced by 8. But what about other cells that are not 5? For example, in the third row of example 1, the first column is 8. The output is same. So that's not changed. So maybe the rule is that 5s are replaced by the first column's value. But what about other numbers?\n\nBut then in example 2's fifth row, the input is 6 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0. The output is 6 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0. So the fourth column is 5, replaced by 6. Which is the first column's value. So that's the same pattern.\n\nBut then, what about the third row of example 2: input is 9 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0. The output is 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0. So the sixth column is 5, replaced by 9 (the first column's value). So that fits.\n\nBut what about cells that are not 5? For example, in example 1's fifth row, the first column is 8. The output is same. So that's not changed. So maybe the rule is that any cell that is 5 in the input is replaced by the value of the first column in the same row.\n\nBut what about other numbers? For example, in example 2's first row, the input is all 0s. The output is all 0s. So no change. So that's consistent.\n\nBut then, what about other cells that are not 5? For example, in example 1's third row, the first column is 8. The output is same. So no change. So maybe the rule is only for 5s. So the transformation is: for each cell in the grid, if the cell is 5, replace it with the value of the first column of the same row. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nBut let's check example 1's fifth row. The input is 8 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0. The output is 8 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0. So the fourth, fifth, sixth columns are 5s, which are replaced by 8 (the first column's value). So that's correct.\n\nBut what about in example 2's fourth row: input is 6 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0. The output is 6 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0. So fifth and sixth columns are 5s, replaced by 6 (the first column's value). That's correct.\n\nBut what about other cells? Let's check example 2's sixth row. Input is 6 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0. Output is 6 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the fourth column is 5, replaced by 6 (first column's value). The sixth column is 5, replaced by 6. So that's correct.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So the pattern is that any cell with value 5 is replaced by the value of the first column in the same row. But what about other numbers?\n\nBut wait, in example 1's third row, the sixth column is 5. The first column is 8. So replaced by 8. But in example 1's fifth row, the sixth column is 5, replaced by 8. So that's the same.\n\nBut what about other numbers? For example, in example 2's first row, the input is all 0s. The output is same. So no change. So the rule is only for 5s.\n\nBut what about other numbers? For example, in example 1's fifth row, the first column is 8. The output is same. So that's not changed. So the rule is: for each cell in the grid, if the cell is 5, replace it with the value of the first column in the same row. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's third row, the sixth column is 5. The first column is 8. So replaced by 8. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about other cells that are not 5? For example, in example 1's fourth row: input is 8 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0. The output is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0. So the sixth column is 5, replaced by 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So the transformation is to replace every 5 in the grid with the value of the first column in the same row.\n\nBut let's check example 2's second row. Input is 9 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0. Output is 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0. So the sixth column is 5, replaced by 9 (first column's value). Correct.\n\nBut what about in example 2's fifth row? Input is 6 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0. Output is 6 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0. Wait, no. Wait example 2's fifth row input is 6 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0. Output is 6 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0. So the fourth column is 5, replaced by 6 (first column's value). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in example 2's fifth row, the first column is 6. So the fourth column is 5, replaced by 6. Correct.\n\nBut then, what about other numbers? For example, in example 2's sixth row: input is 6 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0. Output is 6 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the fourth column is 5, replaced by 6. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. So the transformation is: for each cell in the grid, if the cell's value is 5, replace it with the value of the first column in the same row. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nBut wait, what about cells that are 5 in other positions? For example, in example 1's fifth row, the fourth, fifth, and sixth columns are 5s. They are replaced by 8 (the first column's value). So that's correct.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. So the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n   for each column in the row:\n\n      if the value is 5, replace it with the value of the first column of that row.\n\nBut what about if the first column is 0? For example, if a row has a 0 in the first column, then any 5 in that row would be replaced by 0.\n\nBut looking at the test input, let's see.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 2 0 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nRow 4: 2 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n\nRow 5: 3 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 6: 3 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 4 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\n\nRow 9: 7 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\nSo for example, row 3: first column is 2. So any 5 in that row would be replaced by 2. Let's look at row 3's input: the fifth and sixth columns are 5. So in the output, they would be replaced by 2. But in the test input, the output is not given. But according to the pattern, that's what would happen.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n\n    transformed = [row.copy() for row in grid]\n\n    for i in range(10):\n\n        first_col_val = grid[i][0]\n\n        for j in range(10):\n\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n\n                transformed[i][j] = first_col_val\n\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the third row's first column is 8, so any 5 in that row is replaced by 8. Which matches the output.\n\nBut let's check example 1's third row in input:\n\nOriginal row: 8 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n\nAfter replacement, the sixth column (5) becomes 8. So the output row is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nSimilarly, in example 1's fifth row, the sixth column is 5. The first column is 8. So replaced by 8. Which matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So the code would be as above.\n\nBut let me check example 2. For example, in example 2's third row, the input is 9 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0. The first column is 9. So the sixth column (5) is replaced by 9. Which matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern.\n\nSo the code is as described. So the function would loop through each row, get the first column's value, and replace any 5 in that row with that value.\n\nBut what about the test input? Let's think. For example, in the test input's third row, the first column is 2. The fifth and sixth columns are 5. So they would be replaced by 2. Similarly, the eighth column is 5, so replaced by 2.\n\nBut in the test input's third row, the original is:\n\n2 0 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nSo after replacement, the fifth, sixth, and eighth columns would be 2.\n\nSo the transformed third row would be:\n\n2 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 0 0\n\nBut the test input's output is not given, but according to the pattern, this would be the case.\n\nSo the code should work for the training examples and the test input.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's fifth row, the fourth, fifth, sixth columns are 5. The first column is 8. So they are replaced by 8. So the output row is 8 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about other numbers? For example, if a cell is 8, it's left as is. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is as described. Now, implement that in Python.\n\nBut the code needs to take a grid as input, which is a list of lists. So for each row in the grid, we can check each cell. So the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(10):\n        first_val = grid[i][0]\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed[i][j] = first_val\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the third row of the input is [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The first_val is 8. So the sixth column (index 5) is 5, replaced by 8. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So this code should handle the training examples correctly.\n\nBut what about when the first column is 0? For example, if a row has a 0 in the first column, then any 5 in that row would be replaced by 0.\n\nBut according to the examples, that's acceptable.\n\nSo this should be the correct transformation.\n"

Let me look at them carefully.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 10x10. Let's compare them. The input has some 8s and 5s in certain positions, and the output has some changes. For instance, in the third row of the input, there's an 8 in the first column and a 5 in the sixth column. The output for that row has 8 in the first column and 8 in the sixth. Wait, but in the third row of the input, the sixth column is 5, and in the output, it's 8. Hmm, maybe there's some kind of propagation or replication?\n\nLooking at the third row of the input: the first column is 8, sixth is 5. In the output, the third row has 8 in first column and 8 in sixth. Wait, but the sixth column in the input is 5. So maybe the 5 is being replaced by 8? Or maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled based on neighboring cells?\n\nLooking at the fifth row of the input. The input has 8 in the first column and 5 in the sixth. The output for that row has 8 in first column and 8 in sixth. Wait, but in the fifth row of the input, the sixth column is 5. So maybe the 5 is being replaced by 8? But that's not consistent with the first example. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where if a cell is 5, it's being replaced by 8? But in the first example, the third row has a 5 in the sixth column, and the output has 8 there. But in the fifth row of the input, the sixth column is 5, and in the output, it's 8. So maybe that's part of the pattern.\n\nBut then looking at the fourth row of the input. The input has 8 in first column and 5 in sixth. The output has 8 in first column and 8 in sixth. So maybe whenever there's a 5 in a certain position, it's being replaced by 8? But that seems too simple. But then why in the first example, the third row of the input has a 5 in sixth column, and in the output, it's 8. But in the fifth row of the input, the sixth column is 5, and output is 8. So maybe that's the case.\n\nBut then looking at the second example. Let's check that. In the input of example 2, there are 9s, 5s, 6s, 4s. The output has some changes. For example, in the second row of input, there's a 9 in first column and 5 in sixth. The output has 9 in first column and 9 in sixth. Similarly, in the third row of input, there's 9 in first column and 5 in sixth. The output has 9 in first column and 9 in sixth. So again, the 5 is replaced by 9. So maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a 5 in a certain position, it's being replaced by the value of the cell to the left? Or maybe the value of the cell in the same column but earlier row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being replaced by the value of the cell in the same column but in the first row? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at example 1: in the third row, first column is 8, sixth column is 5. In the output, sixth column is 8. So maybe the sixth column is being set to the value of the first column in the same row? But in the fifth row of input, first column is 8, sixth is 5. Output sixth is 8. So that would fit. But in the third row of input, sixth column is 5, and in the output, it's 8. So that seems to be the case.\n\nBut then in the third row of the input, the sixth column is 5, but the output has 8. So maybe the 5 is being replaced by the value of the first column in that row. But in the third row, the first column is 8. So that would explain it. So perhaps for each row, if there's a 5 in a column, it's being replaced by the value of the first column of that row? But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being replaced by the value of the first column in the same row. But in example 2, looking at the second row of input: the first column is 9, sixth is 5. The output has 9 in sixth column. So that fits. Similarly, in the third row of example 2, the first column is 9, sixth is 5. Output has 9 in sixth. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut then what about other numbers? Let's check example 2's fourth row. Input row is 6 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0. Output is 6 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0. So the fifth column is 5, and in the output, it's 6. Wait, but the first column is 6. So maybe the fifth column is being replaced by the first column's value. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being replaced by the first column's value in that row. But in example 1, the third row has a 5 in sixth column, which is replaced by 8 (the first column's value). Similarly, in example 2, the fifth column in the fourth row is 5, replaced by 6 (the first column's value). So that seems to fit.\n\nBut then in example 1's fifth row: input is 8 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0. Output is 8 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0. So the fourth column is 5, which is replaced by 8 (the first column's value). Similarly, the fifth column is 5, replaced by 8. So that fits.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that any cell with a value of 5 in the input is replaced by the value of the first column in the same row. But what about other numbers?\n\nWait, in example 1's third row, the sixth column is 5. The first column is 8. So the output is 8. Similarly, in example 2's second row, sixth column is 5, first column is 9. Output is 9. So that seems to be the case.\n\nBut what about other numbers? For example, in example 2's fourth row, the fifth column is 5. The first column is 6. So the output fifth column is 6. So that fits.\n\nBut what about other numbers? Let's check example 1's fifth row. The fourth column is 5, replaced by 8. But in that row, the first column is 8. So yes.\n\nBut what about other cells that are not 5? For example, in example 1's third row, the first column is 8. The output is same. So maybe the 5s are being replaced by the first column's value. But what about other numbers?\n\nBut in the output of example 1's third row, the sixth column is 8. But in the input, the sixth column is 5. So that's the replacement. So perhaps the rule is: for any cell in the input that is 5, replace it with the value of the first column of the same row. But what about other numbers?\n\nWait, but in example 1's fifth row, the fourth column is 5. The first column is 8, so it's replaced by 8. But what about other cells that are not 5? For example, in the third row of example 1, the first column is 8. The output is same. So that's not changed. So maybe the rule is that 5s are replaced by the first column's value. But what about other numbers?\n\nBut then in example 2's fifth row, the input is 6 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0. The output is 6 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0. So the fourth column is 5, replaced by 6. Which is the first column's value. So that's the same pattern.\n\nBut then, what about the third row of example 2: input is 9 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0. The output is 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0. So the sixth column is 5, replaced by 9 (the first column's value). So that fits.\n\nBut what about cells that are not 5? For example, in example 1's fifth row, the first column is 8. The output is same. So that's not changed. So maybe the rule is that any cell that is 5 in the input is replaced by the value of the first column in the same row.\n\nBut what about other numbers? For example, in example 2's first row, the input is all 0s. The output is all 0s. So no change. So that's consistent.\n\nBut then, what about other cells that are not 5? For example, in example 1's third row, the first column is 8. The output is same. So no change. So maybe the rule is only for 5s. So the transformation is: for each cell in the grid, if the cell is 5, replace it with the value of the first column of the same row. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nBut let's check example 1's fifth row. The input is 8 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0. The output is 8 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0. So the fourth, fifth, sixth columns are 5s, which are replaced by 8 (the first column's value). So that's correct.\n\nBut what about in example 2's fourth row: input is 6 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0. The output is 6 0 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 0. So fifth and sixth columns are 5s, replaced by 6 (the first column's value). That's correct.\n\nBut what about other cells? Let's check example 2's sixth row. Input is 6 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0. Output is 6 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the fourth column is 5, replaced by 6 (first column's value). The sixth column is 5, replaced by 6. So that's correct.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So the pattern is that any cell with value 5 is replaced by the value of the first column in the same row. But what about other numbers?\n\nBut wait, in example 1's third row, the sixth column is 5. The first column is 8. So replaced by 8. But in example 1's fifth row, the sixth column is 5, replaced by 8. So that's the same.\n\nBut what about other numbers? For example, in example 2's first row, the input is all 0s. The output is same. So no change. So the rule is only for 5s.\n\nBut what about other numbers? For example, in example 1's fifth row, the first column is 8. The output is same. So that's not changed. So the rule is: for each cell in the grid, if the cell is 5, replace it with the value of the first column in the same row. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's third row, the sixth column is 5. The first column is 8. So replaced by 8. So that's correct.\n\nBut what about other cells that are not 5? For example, in example 1's fourth row: input is 8 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0. The output is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0. So the sixth column is 5, replaced by 8. Which is correct.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So the transformation is to replace every 5 in the grid with the value of the first column in the same row.\n\nBut let's check example 2's second row. Input is 9 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0. Output is 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0. So the sixth column is 5, replaced by 9 (first column's value). Correct.\n\nBut what about in example 2's fifth row? Input is 6 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0. Output is 6 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0. Wait, no. Wait example 2's fifth row input is 6 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0. Output is 6 0 0 6 6 6 0 0 0 0. So the fourth column is 5, replaced by 6 (first column's value). So that's correct.\n\nWait, but in example 2's fifth row, the first column is 6. So the fourth column is 5, replaced by 6. Correct.\n\nBut then, what about other numbers? For example, in example 2's sixth row: input is 6 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0. Output is 6 0 0 6 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the fourth column is 5, replaced by 6. Correct.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. So the transformation is: for each cell in the grid, if the cell's value is 5, replace it with the value of the first column in the same row. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nBut wait, what about cells that are 5 in other positions? For example, in example 1's fifth row, the fourth, fifth, and sixth columns are 5s. They are replaced by 8 (the first column's value). So that's correct.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. So the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n   for each column in the row:\n\n      if the value is 5, replace it with the value of the first column of that row.\n\nBut what about if the first column is 0? For example, if a row has a 0 in the first column, then any 5 in that row would be replaced by 0.\n\nBut looking at the test input, let's see.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 2 0 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nRow 4: 2 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n\nRow 5: 3 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 6: 3 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 4 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\n\nRow 9: 7 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0\n\nSo for example, row 3: first column is 2. So any 5 in that row would be replaced by 2. Let's look at row 3's input: the fifth and sixth columns are 5. So in the output, they would be replaced by 2. But in the test input, the output is not given. But according to the pattern, that's what would happen.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n\n    transformed = [row.copy() for row in grid]\n\n    for i in range(10):\n\n        first_col_val = grid[i][0]\n\n        for j in range(10):\n\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n\n                transformed[i][j] = first_col_val\n\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the third row's first column is 8, so any 5 in that row is replaced by 8. Which matches the output.\n\nBut let's check example 1's third row in input:\n\nOriginal row: 8 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n\nAfter replacement, the sixth column (5) becomes 8. So the output row is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nSimilarly, in example 1's fifth row, the sixth column is 5. The first column is 8. So replaced by 8. Which matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So the code would be as above.\n\nBut let me check example 2. For example, in example 2's third row, the input is 9 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0. The first column is 9. So the sixth column (5) is replaced by 9. Which matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern.\n\nSo the code is as described. So the function would loop through each row, get the first column's value, and replace any 5 in that row with that value.\n\nBut what about the test input? Let's think. For example, in the test input's third row, the first column is 2. The fifth and sixth columns are 5. So they would be replaced by 2. Similarly, the eighth column is 5, so replaced by 2.\n\nBut in the test input's third row, the original is:\n\n2 0 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0\n\nSo after replacement, the fifth, sixth, and eighth columns would be 2.\n\nSo the transformed third row would be:\n\n2 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 0 0\n\nBut the test input's output is not given, but according to the pattern, this would be the case.\n\nSo the code should work for the training examples and the test input.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's fifth row, the fourth, fifth, sixth columns are 5. The first column is 8. So they are replaced by 8. So the output row is 8 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0.\n\nWhich matches the example.\n\nSo the code seems correct.\n\nBut what about other numbers? For example, if a cell is 8, it's left as is. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code is as described. Now, implement that in Python.\n\nBut the code needs to take a grid as input, which is a list of lists. So for each row in the grid, we can check each cell. So the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(10):\n        first_val = grid[i][0]\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed[i][j] = first_val\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the third row of the input is [8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The first_val is 8. So the sixth column (index 5) is 5, replaced by 8. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So this code should handle the training examples correctly.\n\nBut what about when the first column is 0? For example, if a row has a 0 in the first column, then any 5 in that row would be replaced by 0.\n\nBut according to the examples, that's acceptable.\n\nSo this should be the correct transformation.\n"
