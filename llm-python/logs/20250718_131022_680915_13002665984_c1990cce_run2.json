          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 13x13 grid. The output seems to have some kind of symmetry or pattern. Let me look at the first few rows. The input's first row is all zeros except for a 2 in the 7th position. The output's first row is the same. But the second row of the output has a 2 in the 6th and 8th positions. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being mirrored or rotated?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input is a 5x5 grid. The output has more 2s and 1s. The input is 0 0 2 0 0. The output is 0 0 2 0 0, then 0 2 0 2 0, then 2 0 0 0 2, then 0 1 0 0 0, then 0 0 1 0 0. Hmm, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with numbers based on their position. Like, maybe the 2s are placed in a diagonal or symmetric way, and the 1s are in some other pattern.\n\nIn Example 3, the input is a 7x7 grid. The output has more 2s and 1s. The input's first row is all zeros except for a 2 in the 4th position. The output's first row is the same, but then the next rows have 2s and 1s in different positions. For example, the second row of output has 0 0 2 0 2 0 0. So maybe there's a pattern where numbers are placed in a certain way based on their coordinates.\n\nLooking for common patterns. Maybe the transformation involves reflecting or rotating the grid. Or maybe it's about placing numbers in certain positions based on their coordinates. For example, in Example 2, the output seems to have a diagonal pattern of 2s. The first row has a 2 in the third position. The second row has 2s in positions 2 and 4. The third row has 2 in position 1 and 5. That looks like a diagonal pattern where each row has 2s in positions that are symmetric around the center. Wait, maybe the 2s are placed in a way that forms a diamond or a cross.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the transformation involves creating a pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their row and column indices. For example, in Example 2, the output has a 2 in position (0,2), then (1,1) and (1,3), then (2,0) and (2,4), etc. That seems like a diagonal pattern. Maybe the 2s are placed along a diagonal line, and the 1s are placed in some other way.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output. The first row is the same as input. The second row has 2s in positions 6 and 8. The third row has 2 in position 5 and 9. The fourth row has 2 in position 4 and 10. Wait, maybe there's a diagonal pattern where each row's 2s are shifted. Or maybe it's a spiral pattern? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of symmetry. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the 2s are placed in positions that are mirrored or rotated. For example, the first row has a 2 in the middle. Then, the second row has 2s on either side of the center. Then the third row has 2s further out. Maybe it's creating a diamond shape.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where numbers are changed. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in position (0,6). The output has that same 2. But in the second row, there's a 2 in (1,5) and (1,7). Then in row 2, (2,4) and (2,8). Row 3: (3,3) and (3,9). Row 4: (4,2) and (4,10). Row 5: (5,1) and (5,11). Row 6: (6,0) and (6,12). Row 7: (7,1) and (7,11). Row 8: (8,2) and (8,10). Row 9: (9,3) and (9,9). Row 10: (10,4) and (10,8). Row 11: (11,5) and (11,7). Row 12: (12,6). Wait, maybe this is forming a pattern where each row has 2s in positions that are symmetric around the center of the grid. For example, in row 0, the 2 is at position 6 (middle of 13 columns). Then in row 1, positions 5 and 7. Row 2: 4 and 8. So each row's 2s are moving one step left and right. That seems like a diagonal pattern.\n\nBut also, there are 1s in some positions. For example, in row 3 of Example 1, there's a 1 in position (3, 5) and (3, 7). Wait, looking at the output of Example 1's fourth row: 0 0 0 2 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So there's a 2 in position 3, and 1 in position 5. Hmm, maybe the 1s are placed in certain positions based on the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is adding certain numbers based on the position's coordinates. For example, if the row and column indices are such that (row + col) is even or odd, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation that creates a pattern where certain cells are filled with 2s and 1s based on their position. For instance, in Example 2, the output seems to have a pattern where the 2s are placed in a diagonal, and the 1s are placed in a different pattern.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the transformation involves creating a grid where each cell's value depends on its distance from the center. For example, in Example 1, the center is at (6,6). The 2s are placed in positions that are at certain distances from the center. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if the original grid has a 2, then the output has a 2 in certain positions. But in Example 1, the input has a 2 in position (0,6), and the output has that same 2. But other positions in the output have 2s that weren't in the input. So that's not the case.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input is a 5x5 grid. The output has more 2s and 1s. The input's first row is 0 0 2 0 0. The output's first row is same. Then the second row is 0 2 0 2 0. Third row 2 0 0 0 2. Fourth row 0 1 0 0 0. Fifth row 0 0 1 0 0. So maybe the 2s are placed in a diagonal pattern, and the 1s are placed in certain positions. For example, the 2s form a cross or a diamond. The 1s are placed in positions that are further out.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by applying some kind of transformation that creates a symmetric pattern. For example, in Example 2, the output's second row has 2s in positions 1 and 3. The third row has 2s in positions 0 and 4. That looks like a diagonal pattern. Similarly, in the fourth row, there's a 1 in position 1, and fifth row has a 1 in position 2. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are further away from the center.\n\nBut how to translate this into code?\n\nPerhaps the transformation is based on the following steps:\n\n1. For each cell in the grid, determine if it should be a 2 or a 1 based on its position.\n2. The 2s are placed in positions that are symmetric around the center, forming a diamond shape.\n3. The 1s are placed in positions that are further away from the center.\n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where certain positions are filled with 2s and 1s based on their coordinates. For example, if the sum of row and column indices is even, then 2, else 1. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's output. The 2s are placed in positions where row + column is even. Let's check:\n\nFor row 0, column 2: 0+2=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 1, column 1: 1+1=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 1, column 3: 1+3=4 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 2, column 0: 2+0=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 2, column 4: 2+4=6 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 3, column 1: 3+1=4 even \u2192 1? But in the output, row 3, column 1 is 0. Wait, no. In Example 2's output, row 3 is 0 1 0 0 0. So column 1 is 1. But according to row + column, 3+1=4 even. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where row and column are both even, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the positions where 2s are placed in Example 2:\n\nRow 0, column 2 \u2192 (0,2)\nRow 1, columns 1 and 3 \u2192 (1,1), (1,3)\nRow 2, columns 0 and 4 \u2192 (2,0), (2,4)\nRow 3, columns 1 \u2192 (3,1)\nRow 4, columns 2 \u2192 (4,2)\n\nWait, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape centered at (2,2) (the center of a 5x5 grid). For example, in a 5x5 grid, the center is (2,2). The diamond would have positions where the Manhattan distance from the center is 1, 2, etc. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column indices are symmetric in some way. For example, in row i, column j, if j is equal to (center column - (i - center row)), then it's a 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where (row - column) is even. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid that has a pattern where certain cells are filled with 2s and 1s based on their position. For example, in Example 2, the 2s form a cross in the center, and the 1s are placed in certain positions. But how to code that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to create a grid where each cell is filled with 2 if it's part of a certain pattern, and 1 if it's part of another. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, which is a 13x13 grid with a 2 in the middle (position (0,7) perhaps?), but the output is not given. So maybe the test input is a 13x13 grid with a 2 in the middle. But the test input is given as:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, that's 17 elements, but a 13x13 grid has 169 elements. Wait, perhaps the test input is a 13x13 grid, but the input given is a row? Maybe the input is a single row, but that's not clear. Wait, the problem says that the input is a 2D list. So the test input is probably a 13x13 grid. But the given test input seems to be a single row. Maybe that's a mistake. Or maybe the test input is a 1x13 grid? But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nBut perhaps the test input is a 13x13 grid where the middle row has a 2 in the middle. But the actual input is not given, so I can't see. But the problem says that the test input is shown for context, but the actual task is to write the transformation code based on the training examples.\n\nSo, going back to the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape. For example, the first row has a 2 in the middle. Then, the second row has 2s on either side of the center. Then, the third row has 2s further out, and so on. Similarly, the 1s are placed in certain positions.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to create a grid where for each cell (i,j), if the Manhattan distance from the center is even, then it's 2, else 1. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where the cells are filled with 2s and 1s based on their distance from the center. For example, in Example 1, the center is at (6,6). For each cell, the distance from the center is calculated. If the distance is even, then 2, else 1. But in Example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions. For example, the cell (0,6) is at distance 6 from the center (row 6, column 6). The distance is 6 (rows) + 0 (columns) = 6. But that's not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the distance could be the absolute difference between row and center row plus the absolute difference between column and center column. For example, for cell (i,j), distance = |i - center_row| + |j - center_col|. Then, if the distance is even, then 2, else 1. But how does that fit with the examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the center is at (2,2). For cell (0,2), distance is 2 (rows) + 0 (columns) = 2. Even. So 2. Which matches. For cell (1,1), distance is 1+1=2, even \u2192 2. For cell (1,3), distance 1+1=2 \u2192 2. For cell (2,0), distance 0 + 2 = 2 \u2192 2. For cell (2,4), same. For cell (3,1), distance is 1 + 1 = 2 \u2192 even. But in the output, that cell is 1. So this doesn't fit. So that idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAnother idea: the 2s are placed in positions where (i + j) is even. Let's check Example 2's output:\n\nRow 0, column 2: 0+2=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 1, column 1: 1+1=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 1, column 3: 1+3=4 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 2, column 0: 2+0=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 2, column 4: 2+4=6 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 3, column 1: 3+1=4 even \u2192 but in the output, it's 1. So that's a problem. So this idea is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed where (i - j) is even. Let's check for row 3, column 1: 3-1=2 even. But in the output, it's 1. So again, not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in Example 2's output, the 2s form a cross in the center. The 1s are placed in positions that are further out. Maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row or column is equal to the center row or column.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves creating a grid where each cell (i,j) is filled with 2 if i is even or j is even, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, think of the examples as having a pattern where certain positions are filled with 2s and 1s based on their position relative to the center. For example, in Example 1, the center is (6,6). The 2s are placed in positions that are at certain distances from the center. For example, the first row has a 2 in the center. Then, the second row has 2s at positions that are one step away from the center. Then, the third row has 2s two steps away, etc. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column indices are such that (i - 6) + (j - 6) is even. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output differs from the input. In Example 1, the input has a 2 in (0,6). The output has that same 2. But other positions have 2s that weren't in the input. For example, in row 1, columns 5 and 7. So perhaps the transformation is to add new 2s in certain positions based on some rule.\n\nBut how to determine the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if i == j or i + j == 12 (for a 13x13 grid). But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to create a grid where the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape around the center. For example, in a 13x13 grid, the center is (6,6). The diamond would have positions where the Manhattan distance from the center is 0, 1, 2, etc. For example, for distance 0: (6,6). For distance 1: (5,6), (7,6), (6,5), (6,7). For distance 2: (4,6), (8,6), (6,4), (6,8), (5,5), (5,7), (7,5), (7,7), etc. But how to determine which cells are 2 and which are 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the Manhattan distance from the center is even, and the 1s are placed where it's odd. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's output, the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column are both even or both odd. For example, in row 0, column 2 (even, even). Row 1, columns 1 and 3 (odd, odd). Row 2, columns 0 and 4 (even, even). Row 3, column 1 (odd, odd). Row 4, column 2 (even, even). But in the output, row 3, column 1 is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column are both even or both odd. But in row 3, column 1, which is odd and odd, but the value is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape. The first row has a 2 in the center. The next rows have 2s on either side of the center. For example, row 1 has 2s at positions 5 and 7. Row 2 has 2s at 4 and 8. Row 3 has 2s at 3 and 9. Row 4 has 2s at 2 and 10. Row 5 has 2s at 1 and 11. Row 6 has 2s at 0 and 12. Row 7 has 2s at 1 and 11. Row 8 has 2s at 2 and 10. Row 9 has 2s at 3 and 9. Row 10 has 2s at 4 and 8. Row 11 has 2s at 5 and 7. Row 12 has a 2 at 6.\n\nWait, this looks like a diamond shape that expands outward from the center. Each row has 2s at positions that are symmetric around the center. For example, in row i, the 2s are at positions (center_col - (distance)) and (center_col + (distance)), where distance depends on the row.\n\nBut how to calculate this.\n\nIn a 13x13 grid, the center is at (6,6). For each row i, the distance from the center row is |i - 6|. For example, row 0 is 6 rows above the center. For each such row, the 2s are placed at positions that are (6 - distance) and (6 + distance) in the column. Wait, but in row 0, the 2 is at column 6. For row 1, the distance is 5. So columns 6 - 5 = 1 and 6 + 5 = 11? But in the output of Example 1, row 1 has 2s at columns 5 and 7. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance is the row's distance from the center. For example, for row i, the distance is |i - 6|. Then, the 2s are placed at columns 6 - distance and 6 + distance. But in row 0, distance is 6. So columns 6 - 6 = 0 and 6 + 6 = 12. But in the output, row 0 has a 2 at column 6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance is the row's distance from the center, and the 2s are placed at columns that are 6 - (distance) and 6 + (distance). But for row 0, distance is 6. So 6 - 6 = 0 and 6 + 6 = 12. But the output has a 2 at column 6. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the output for Example 1 again.\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 column 6 is 2.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 5 and 7 are 2.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 4 and 8 are 2.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 3 and 9 are 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 \u2192 columns 2 and 10 are 2.\n\nRow 5: 0 2 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 \u2192 columns 1 and 11 are 2.\n\nRow 6: 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 \u2192 columns 0 and 12 are 2.\n\nRow 7: 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 1 and 11 are 2.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 columns 2 and 10 are 2.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 \u2192 columns 3 and 9 are 2.\n\nRow 10: 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 \u2192 columns 4 and 8 are 2.\n\nRow 11: 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 5 and 7 are 2.\n\nRow 12: 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 column 6 is 1? Wait, no. Looking back at the output for Example 1:\n\nThe output for row 12 is: 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 column 2 is 1, column 6 is 1, column 10 is 1. So in row 12, there are 1s in positions 2, 6, 10.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. It seems like there's a pattern where for each row, there are 2s in certain positions and 1s in others. But it's not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape, but the 1s are placed in positions that form another pattern. For example, in row 3, there's a 1 in column 5. In row 4, there's a 1 in column 5. In row 5, there's a 1 in column 5. This suggests that the 1s are placed in certain positions based on their row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if i and j are both even or both odd, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the sum of i and j is even, and the 1s are placed where it's odd. But in Example 1, the cell (0,6) has sum 6, which is even \u2192 2. Correct. Row 1, column 5: 1+5=6 even \u2192 2. Correct. Row 1, column 7: 1+7=8 even \u2192 2. Correct. Row 2, column 4: 2+4=6 even \u2192 2. Correct. Row 2, column 8: 2+8=10 even \u2192 2. Correct. Row 3, column 3: 3+3=6 even \u2192 2. But in the output, row 3 has a 2 at column 3. Then, in row 3, column 5 is 1. 3+5=8 even. So that's a problem. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2 again:\n\nInput is a 5x5 grid. Output has 2s in positions that form a cross. For example, the 2s are in the middle row, middle column, and the diagonals. But the 1s are placed in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if (i == j) or (i + j == 4) (for a 5x5 grid). For example, in row 0, column 2 (i + j = 2, not 4). But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for a 5x5 grid, the center is at (2,2). The 2s are placed in positions where the row or column is equal to the center row or column. For example, row 0, column 2 is part of the center column. Row 1, columns 1 and 3 are part of the diagonals. Row 2, columns 0 and 4 are part of the center row. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to code this for different grid sizes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to create a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if (i + j) is even and (i - j) is even, or something like that.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as adding certain patterns based on the position of the cell.\n\nAnother idea: the output is created by applying a certain pattern that is symmetric in all directions. For example, for each cell, if it's part of a certain symmetry, then it's filled with 2, otherwise 1. But how to determine which cells are part of the symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all cells with 2, but then some cells are replaced with 1 based on some condition.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has some 2s and 0s. The output has more 2s and some 1s. So it's not just replacing all cells with 2.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the input is a 7x7 grid. The output has 2s in positions that form a pattern similar to Example 1. For example, the first row is the same as input. The second row has 0 0 2 0 2 0 0. So the 2s are at columns 2 and 4. The third row has 0 2 0 0 0 2 0. So 2s at columns 1 and 5. Fourth row has 2 0 1 0 0 0 2. So 2s at columns 0 and 6. Fifth row has 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. Sixth row has 1 0 0 0 1 0 0. Seventh row has 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. So the 2s are in the first and last columns for row 4, and 1s in other positions.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation may involve placing 2s in certain positions and 1s in others, based on the row and column indices.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to create a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if i is even or j is even, and 1 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are placed in positions where i + j is even, and 1s where it's odd. But in Example 1, the cell (3,5) is 1, and 3+5=8 even. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I have, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that the transformation adds 2s in certain symmetric positions and 1s in others. For example, in Example 1, the 2s form a diamond shape around the center, and the 1s are placed in certain positions. For Example 2, the 2s form a cross, and the 1s are placed in other positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to create a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the Manhattan distance from the center is even, and 1 if it's odd. Or vice versa.\n\nLet's test this for Example 1. The center is at (6,6). For cell (0,6), distance is 6 (rows) + 0 (columns) = 6. Even \u2192 2. Correct. For cell (1,5): distance is 5 (rows) + 1 (columns) = 6 \u2192 even \u2192 2. Correct. For cell (3,5): distance is 3 + 1 = 4 \u2192 even \u2192 2. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: the 2s are placed in positions where (i - j) is even, and 1s where it's odd. Let's check for Example 1, cell (3,5): 3-5 = -2 even \u2192 2. But the output has 1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed where (i + j) is even and (i - j) is even. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output:\n\nThe 2s are placed in positions where (i + j) is even. Let's check:\n\nRow 0, column 2: 0+2=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 1, column 1: 1+1=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 1, column 3: 1+3=4 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 2, column 0: 2+0=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 2, column 4: 2+4=6 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 3, column 1: 3+1=4 even \u2192 but in the output, it's 1. So this is a problem.\n\nBut in the output, row 3, column 1 is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the 2s are placed where (i + j) is even and (i - j) is even. For example, for row 3, column 1: 3+1=4 even, 3-1=2 even \u2192 2. But the output has 1. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed where (i + j) is even and (i - j) is even. But in this case, it would be the same as (i + j) even, since if (i - j) is even, then (i + j) is also even. So this is the same as before.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAnother approach: look at the test input. The test input is a 13x13 grid with a 2 in the middle of the row. The output is not given, but the task is to write the transformation. Perhaps the test input is a 13x13 grid where the middle row has a 2 in the middle. But without the output, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output seems to have 2s in positions that form a diamond shape around the center. For each row i, the 2s are placed at columns that are symmetric around the center. For example, in row i, the distance from the center row is d = |i - 6|. Then, the columns for 2s are 6 - d and 6 + d. But in row 0, d is 6, so columns 0 and 12. But in the output, row 0 has a 2 at column 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the distance from the center is even. For example, for row i, the distance from the center row is d. If d is even, then the 2s are placed at certain columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column are both even or both odd. For example, in Example 1, row 0 (even), column 6 (even) \u2192 2. Row 1 (odd), column 5 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 1, column 7 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 2 (even), column 4 (even) \u2192 2. Row 2, column 8 (even) \u2192 2. Row 3 (odd), column 3 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 3, column 9 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 4 (even), column 2 (even) \u2192 2. Row 4, column 10 (even) \u2192 2. Row 5 (odd), column 1 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 5, column 11 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 6 (even), column 0 (even) \u2192 2. Row 6, column 12 (even) \u2192 2. Row 7 (odd), column 1 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 7, column 11 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 8 (even), column 2 (even) \u2192 2. Row 8, column 10 (even) \u2192 2. Row 9 (odd), column 3 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 9, column 9 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 10 (even), column 4 (even) \u2192 2. Row 10, column 8 (even) \u2192 2. Row 11 (odd), column 5 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 11, column 7 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 12 (even), column 6 (even) \u2192 2.\n\nBut in the output, row 12 has a 1 in column 6. Wait, no, in the output for Example 1, row 12 is: 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0. So column 6 is 1. But according to this pattern, it should be 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is very confusing. I'm not able to find a clear pattern, but I need to write some code.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace all 0s with 2s, but then replace certain positions with 1s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to create a grid where each cell is 2 if it's in the same row or column as the original 2, and 1 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation involves creating a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of i and j is even, and 1 if it's odd. This would explain some of the examples, even if not all.\n\nBut in Example 1, the cell (3,5) has sum 8 (even), but the output has 1. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to create a grid where each cell is 2 if (i + j) is even and (i - j) is even, and 1 otherwise. But this is the same as (i + j) even.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to create a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if (i - j) is even, and 1 if it's odd. Let's check for Example 1, cell (3,5): 3-5 = -2 even \u2192 2. But in the output, it's 1. So no.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples and write code that creates a grid with 2s in certain positions and 1s in others.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to create a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if (i + j) is even and (i - j) is even, and 1 otherwise. But this is not working.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to create a grid where each cell is 2 if it is in the same row or column as the center, and 1 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell (i,j), if (i + j) is even, then it's 2, else 1. This might not fit all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut in Example 1, cell (3,5) is 3+5=8 even \u2192 2, but the output has 1. So this is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where each cell is 2 if (i - j) is even, and 1 otherwise. Let's check for Example 1, cell (3,5): 3-5 = -2 even \u2192 2. But the output has 1. So no.\n\nAnother approach: the transformation is to create a grid where each cell is 2 if it is part of a certain pattern, like a diamond, and 1 otherwise. For example, in a 13x13 grid, the diamond is formed by cells where the Manhattan distance from the center is even.\n\nBut how to calculate that.\n\nFor a cell (i,j), the Manhattan distance from the center (6,6) is |i-6| + |j-6|. If this distance is even, then 2, else 1.\n\nLet's check for Example 1, cell (0,6): distance is 6 + 0 = 6 (even) \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nCell (1,5): distance is 5 + 1 = 6 (even) \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nCell (3,5): distance is 3 + 1 = 4 (even) \u2192 2. But in the output, it's 1. So this is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This suggests that this pattern is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm forced to make a guess. Given the examples, I'll assume that the transformation involves creating a grid where each cell is 2 if it is part of a certain symmetric pattern, and 1 otherwise. For example, the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column indices are both even or both odd.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), if i % 2 == j % 2, then 2, else 1.\n\nLet's test this for Example 2.\n\nExample 2 is a 5x5 grid. Let's check the output:\n\nRow 0, column 2: i=0 (even), j=2 (even) \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nRow 1, column 1: i=1 (odd), j=1 (odd) \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nRow 1, column 3: i=1 (odd), j=3 (odd) \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nRow 2, column 0: i=2 (even), j=0 (even) \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nRow 2, column 4: i=2 (even), j=4 (even) \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nRow 3, column 1: i=3 (odd), j=1 (odd) \u2192 2. But in the output, it's 1. So this is incorrect.\n\nBut in the output, row 3, column 1 is 1. So this pattern is not correct.\n\nBut maybe the transformation is to create a grid where the cell is 2 if (i + j) is even, and 1 if it's odd. Let's check for Example 2, row 3, column 1: 3+1=4 even \u2192 2. But the output has 1. So this is not correct.\n\nThis is very frustrating. Given the time I have, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell (i,j), if (i + j) is even, then it's 2, else 1. Even though it may not fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has some 1s in positions where (i + j) is even. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 2s and 1s with 1s. But this is not the case.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to create a grid where each cell is 2 if it is in the same row or column as the original 2. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell, if (i + j) is even, then 2, else 1. This is a simple pattern, and it may fit some examples.\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 13x13 grid. The output seems to have some kind of symmetry or pattern. Let me look at the first few rows. The input's first row is all zeros except for a 2 in the 7th position. The output's first row is the same. But the second row of the output has a 2 in the 6th and 8th positions. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being mirrored or rotated?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input is a 5x5 grid. The output has more 2s and 1s. The input is 0 0 2 0 0. The output is 0 0 2 0 0, then 0 2 0 2 0, then 2 0 0 0 2, then 0 1 0 0 0, then 0 0 1 0 0. Hmm, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with numbers based on their position. Like, maybe the 2s are placed in a diagonal or symmetric way, and the 1s are in some other pattern.\n\nIn Example 3, the input is a 7x7 grid. The output has more 2s and 1s. The input's first row is all zeros except for a 2 in the 4th position. The output's first row is the same, but then the next rows have 2s and 1s in different positions. For example, the second row of output has 0 0 2 0 2 0 0. So maybe there's a pattern where numbers are placed in a certain way based on their coordinates.\n\nLooking for common patterns. Maybe the transformation involves reflecting or rotating the grid. Or maybe it's about placing numbers in certain positions based on their coordinates. For example, in Example 2, the output seems to have a diagonal pattern of 2s. The first row has a 2 in the third position. The second row has 2s in positions 2 and 4. The third row has 2 in position 1 and 5. That looks like a diagonal pattern where each row has 2s in positions that are symmetric around the center. Wait, maybe the 2s are placed in a way that forms a diamond or a cross.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the transformation involves creating a pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their row and column indices. For example, in Example 2, the output has a 2 in position (0,2), then (1,1) and (1,3), then (2,0) and (2,4), etc. That seems like a diagonal pattern. Maybe the 2s are placed along a diagonal line, and the 1s are placed in some other way.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output. The first row is the same as input. The second row has 2s in positions 6 and 8. The third row has 2 in position 5 and 9. The fourth row has 2 in position 4 and 10. Wait, maybe there's a diagonal pattern where each row's 2s are shifted. Or maybe it's a spiral pattern? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of symmetry. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the 2s are placed in positions that are mirrored or rotated. For example, the first row has a 2 in the middle. Then, the second row has 2s on either side of the center. Then the third row has 2s further out. Maybe it's creating a diamond shape.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where numbers are changed. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in position (0,6). The output has that same 2. But in the second row, there's a 2 in (1,5) and (1,7). Then in row 2, (2,4) and (2,8). Row 3: (3,3) and (3,9). Row 4: (4,2) and (4,10). Row 5: (5,1) and (5,11). Row 6: (6,0) and (6,12). Row 7: (7,1) and (7,11). Row 8: (8,2) and (8,10). Row 9: (9,3) and (9,9). Row 10: (10,4) and (10,8). Row 11: (11,5) and (11,7). Row 12: (12,6). Wait, maybe this is forming a pattern where each row has 2s in positions that are symmetric around the center of the grid. For example, in row 0, the 2 is at position 6 (middle of 13 columns). Then in row 1, positions 5 and 7. Row 2: 4 and 8. So each row's 2s are moving one step left and right. That seems like a diagonal pattern.\n\nBut also, there are 1s in some positions. For example, in row 3 of Example 1, there's a 1 in position (3, 5) and (3, 7). Wait, looking at the output of Example 1's fourth row: 0 0 0 2 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So there's a 2 in position 3, and 1 in position 5. Hmm, maybe the 1s are placed in certain positions based on the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is adding certain numbers based on the position's coordinates. For example, if the row and column indices are such that (row + col) is even or odd, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation that creates a pattern where certain cells are filled with 2s and 1s based on their position. For instance, in Example 2, the output seems to have a pattern where the 2s are placed in a diagonal, and the 1s are placed in a different pattern.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the transformation involves creating a grid where each cell's value depends on its distance from the center. For example, in Example 1, the center is at (6,6). The 2s are placed in positions that are at certain distances from the center. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if the original grid has a 2, then the output has a 2 in certain positions. But in Example 1, the input has a 2 in position (0,6), and the output has that same 2. But other positions in the output have 2s that weren't in the input. So that's not the case.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input is a 5x5 grid. The output has more 2s and 1s. The input's first row is 0 0 2 0 0. The output's first row is same. Then the second row is 0 2 0 2 0. Third row 2 0 0 0 2. Fourth row 0 1 0 0 0. Fifth row 0 0 1 0 0. So maybe the 2s are placed in a diagonal pattern, and the 1s are placed in certain positions. For example, the 2s form a cross or a diamond. The 1s are placed in positions that are further out.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by applying some kind of transformation that creates a symmetric pattern. For example, in Example 2, the output's second row has 2s in positions 1 and 3. The third row has 2s in positions 0 and 4. That looks like a diagonal pattern. Similarly, in the fourth row, there's a 1 in position 1, and fifth row has a 1 in position 2. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are further away from the center.\n\nBut how to translate this into code?\n\nPerhaps the transformation is based on the following steps:\n\n1. For each cell in the grid, determine if it should be a 2 or a 1 based on its position.\n2. The 2s are placed in positions that are symmetric around the center, forming a diamond shape.\n3. The 1s are placed in positions that are further away from the center.\n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where certain positions are filled with 2s and 1s based on their coordinates. For example, if the sum of row and column indices is even, then 2, else 1. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's output. The 2s are placed in positions where row + column is even. Let's check:\n\nFor row 0, column 2: 0+2=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 1, column 1: 1+1=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 1, column 3: 1+3=4 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 2, column 0: 2+0=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 2, column 4: 2+4=6 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 3, column 1: 3+1=4 even \u2192 1? But in the output, row 3, column 1 is 0. Wait, no. In Example 2's output, row 3 is 0 1 0 0 0. So column 1 is 1. But according to row + column, 3+1=4 even. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where row and column are both even, or something else.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the positions where 2s are placed in Example 2:\n\nRow 0, column 2 \u2192 (0,2)\nRow 1, columns 1 and 3 \u2192 (1,1), (1,3)\nRow 2, columns 0 and 4 \u2192 (2,0), (2,4)\nRow 3, columns 1 \u2192 (3,1)\nRow 4, columns 2 \u2192 (4,2)\n\nWait, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape centered at (2,2) (the center of a 5x5 grid). For example, in a 5x5 grid, the center is (2,2). The diamond would have positions where the Manhattan distance from the center is 1, 2, etc. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column indices are symmetric in some way. For example, in row i, column j, if j is equal to (center column - (i - center row)), then it's a 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where (row - column) is even. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid that has a pattern where certain cells are filled with 2s and 1s based on their position. For example, in Example 2, the 2s form a cross in the center, and the 1s are placed in certain positions. But how to code that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to create a grid where each cell is filled with 2 if it's part of a certain pattern, and 1 if it's part of another. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, which is a 13x13 grid with a 2 in the middle (position (0,7) perhaps?), but the output is not given. So maybe the test input is a 13x13 grid with a 2 in the middle. But the test input is given as:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, that's 17 elements, but a 13x13 grid has 169 elements. Wait, perhaps the test input is a 13x13 grid, but the input given is a row? Maybe the input is a single row, but that's not clear. Wait, the problem says that the input is a 2D list. So the test input is probably a 13x13 grid. But the given test input seems to be a single row. Maybe that's a mistake. Or maybe the test input is a 1x13 grid? But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nBut perhaps the test input is a 13x13 grid where the middle row has a 2 in the middle. But the actual input is not given, so I can't see. But the problem says that the test input is shown for context, but the actual task is to write the transformation code based on the training examples.\n\nSo, going back to the training examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape. For example, the first row has a 2 in the middle. Then, the second row has 2s on either side of the center. Then, the third row has 2s further out, and so on. Similarly, the 1s are placed in certain positions.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to create a grid where for each cell (i,j), if the Manhattan distance from the center is even, then it's 2, else 1. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where the cells are filled with 2s and 1s based on their distance from the center. For example, in Example 1, the center is at (6,6). For each cell, the distance from the center is calculated. If the distance is even, then 2, else 1. But in Example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions. For example, the cell (0,6) is at distance 6 from the center (row 6, column 6). The distance is 6 (rows) + 0 (columns) = 6. But that's not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the distance could be the absolute difference between row and center row plus the absolute difference between column and center column. For example, for cell (i,j), distance = |i - center_row| + |j - center_col|. Then, if the distance is even, then 2, else 1. But how does that fit with the examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the center is at (2,2). For cell (0,2), distance is 2 (rows) + 0 (columns) = 2. Even. So 2. Which matches. For cell (1,1), distance is 1+1=2, even \u2192 2. For cell (1,3), distance 1+1=2 \u2192 2. For cell (2,0), distance 0 + 2 = 2 \u2192 2. For cell (2,4), same. For cell (3,1), distance is 1 + 1 = 2 \u2192 even. But in the output, that cell is 1. So this doesn't fit. So that idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAnother idea: the 2s are placed in positions where (i + j) is even. Let's check Example 2's output:\n\nRow 0, column 2: 0+2=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 1, column 1: 1+1=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 1, column 3: 1+3=4 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 2, column 0: 2+0=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 2, column 4: 2+4=6 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 3, column 1: 3+1=4 even \u2192 but in the output, it's 1. So that's a problem. So this idea is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed where (i - j) is even. Let's check for row 3, column 1: 3-1=2 even. But in the output, it's 1. So again, not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in Example 2's output, the 2s form a cross in the center. The 1s are placed in positions that are further out. Maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row or column is equal to the center row or column.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves creating a grid where each cell (i,j) is filled with 2 if i is even or j is even, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, think of the examples as having a pattern where certain positions are filled with 2s and 1s based on their position relative to the center. For example, in Example 1, the center is (6,6). The 2s are placed in positions that are at certain distances from the center. For example, the first row has a 2 in the center. Then, the second row has 2s at positions that are one step away from the center. Then, the third row has 2s two steps away, etc. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column indices are such that (i - 6) + (j - 6) is even. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output differs from the input. In Example 1, the input has a 2 in (0,6). The output has that same 2. But other positions have 2s that weren't in the input. For example, in row 1, columns 5 and 7. So perhaps the transformation is to add new 2s in certain positions based on some rule.\n\nBut how to determine the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if i == j or i + j == 12 (for a 13x13 grid). But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to create a grid where the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape around the center. For example, in a 13x13 grid, the center is (6,6). The diamond would have positions where the Manhattan distance from the center is 0, 1, 2, etc. For example, for distance 0: (6,6). For distance 1: (5,6), (7,6), (6,5), (6,7). For distance 2: (4,6), (8,6), (6,4), (6,8), (5,5), (5,7), (7,5), (7,7), etc. But how to determine which cells are 2 and which are 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the Manhattan distance from the center is even, and the 1s are placed where it's odd. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's output, the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column are both even or both odd. For example, in row 0, column 2 (even, even). Row 1, columns 1 and 3 (odd, odd). Row 2, columns 0 and 4 (even, even). Row 3, column 1 (odd, odd). Row 4, column 2 (even, even). But in the output, row 3, column 1 is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column are both even or both odd. But in row 3, column 1, which is odd and odd, but the value is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape. The first row has a 2 in the center. The next rows have 2s on either side of the center. For example, row 1 has 2s at positions 5 and 7. Row 2 has 2s at 4 and 8. Row 3 has 2s at 3 and 9. Row 4 has 2s at 2 and 10. Row 5 has 2s at 1 and 11. Row 6 has 2s at 0 and 12. Row 7 has 2s at 1 and 11. Row 8 has 2s at 2 and 10. Row 9 has 2s at 3 and 9. Row 10 has 2s at 4 and 8. Row 11 has 2s at 5 and 7. Row 12 has a 2 at 6.\n\nWait, this looks like a diamond shape that expands outward from the center. Each row has 2s at positions that are symmetric around the center. For example, in row i, the 2s are at positions (center_col - (distance)) and (center_col + (distance)), where distance depends on the row.\n\nBut how to calculate this.\n\nIn a 13x13 grid, the center is at (6,6). For each row i, the distance from the center row is |i - 6|. For example, row 0 is 6 rows above the center. For each such row, the 2s are placed at positions that are (6 - distance) and (6 + distance) in the column. Wait, but in row 0, the 2 is at column 6. For row 1, the distance is 5. So columns 6 - 5 = 1 and 6 + 5 = 11? But in the output of Example 1, row 1 has 2s at columns 5 and 7. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance is the row's distance from the center. For example, for row i, the distance is |i - 6|. Then, the 2s are placed at columns 6 - distance and 6 + distance. But in row 0, distance is 6. So columns 6 - 6 = 0 and 6 + 6 = 12. But in the output, row 0 has a 2 at column 6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the distance is the row's distance from the center, and the 2s are placed at columns that are 6 - (distance) and 6 + (distance). But for row 0, distance is 6. So 6 - 6 = 0 and 6 + 6 = 12. But the output has a 2 at column 6. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the output for Example 1 again.\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 column 6 is 2.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 5 and 7 are 2.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 4 and 8 are 2.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 3 and 9 are 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 \u2192 columns 2 and 10 are 2.\n\nRow 5: 0 2 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 \u2192 columns 1 and 11 are 2.\n\nRow 6: 2 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 \u2192 columns 0 and 12 are 2.\n\nRow 7: 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 1 and 11 are 2.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 columns 2 and 10 are 2.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 \u2192 columns 3 and 9 are 2.\n\nRow 10: 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 \u2192 columns 4 and 8 are 2.\n\nRow 11: 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 5 and 7 are 2.\n\nRow 12: 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 column 6 is 1? Wait, no. Looking back at the output for Example 1:\n\nThe output for row 12 is: 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 column 2 is 1, column 6 is 1, column 10 is 1. So in row 12, there are 1s in positions 2, 6, 10.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. It seems like there's a pattern where for each row, there are 2s in certain positions and 1s in others. But it's not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the 2s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape, but the 1s are placed in positions that form another pattern. For example, in row 3, there's a 1 in column 5. In row 4, there's a 1 in column 5. In row 5, there's a 1 in column 5. This suggests that the 1s are placed in certain positions based on their row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if i and j are both even or both odd, but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the sum of i and j is even, and the 1s are placed where it's odd. But in Example 1, the cell (0,6) has sum 6, which is even \u2192 2. Correct. Row 1, column 5: 1+5=6 even \u2192 2. Correct. Row 1, column 7: 1+7=8 even \u2192 2. Correct. Row 2, column 4: 2+4=6 even \u2192 2. Correct. Row 2, column 8: 2+8=10 even \u2192 2. Correct. Row 3, column 3: 3+3=6 even \u2192 2. But in the output, row 3 has a 2 at column 3. Then, in row 3, column 5 is 1. 3+5=8 even. So that's a problem. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2 again:\n\nInput is a 5x5 grid. Output has 2s in positions that form a cross. For example, the 2s are in the middle row, middle column, and the diagonals. But the 1s are placed in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if (i == j) or (i + j == 4) (for a 5x5 grid). For example, in row 0, column 2 (i + j = 2, not 4). But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for a 5x5 grid, the center is at (2,2). The 2s are placed in positions where the row or column is equal to the center row or column. For example, row 0, column 2 is part of the center column. Row 1, columns 1 and 3 are part of the diagonals. Row 2, columns 0 and 4 are part of the center row. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to code this for different grid sizes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to create a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if (i + j) is even and (i - j) is even, or something like that.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as adding certain patterns based on the position of the cell.\n\nAnother idea: the output is created by applying a certain pattern that is symmetric in all directions. For example, for each cell, if it's part of a certain symmetry, then it's filled with 2, otherwise 1. But how to determine which cells are part of the symmetry.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all cells with 2, but then some cells are replaced with 1 based on some condition.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has some 2s and 0s. The output has more 2s and some 1s. So it's not just replacing all cells with 2.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the input is a 7x7 grid. The output has 2s in positions that form a pattern similar to Example 1. For example, the first row is the same as input. The second row has 0 0 2 0 2 0 0. So the 2s are at columns 2 and 4. The third row has 0 2 0 0 0 2 0. So 2s at columns 1 and 5. Fourth row has 2 0 1 0 0 0 2. So 2s at columns 0 and 6. Fifth row has 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. Sixth row has 1 0 0 0 1 0 0. Seventh row has 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. So the 2s are in the first and last columns for row 4, and 1s in other positions.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation may involve placing 2s in certain positions and 1s in others, based on the row and column indices.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to create a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if i is even or j is even, and 1 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are placed in positions where i + j is even, and 1s where it's odd. But in Example 1, the cell (3,5) is 1, and 3+5=8 even. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time I have, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that the transformation adds 2s in certain symmetric positions and 1s in others. For example, in Example 1, the 2s form a diamond shape around the center, and the 1s are placed in certain positions. For Example 2, the 2s form a cross, and the 1s are placed in other positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to create a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the Manhattan distance from the center is even, and 1 if it's odd. Or vice versa.\n\nLet's test this for Example 1. The center is at (6,6). For cell (0,6), distance is 6 (rows) + 0 (columns) = 6. Even \u2192 2. Correct. For cell (1,5): distance is 5 (rows) + 1 (columns) = 6 \u2192 even \u2192 2. Correct. For cell (3,5): distance is 3 + 1 = 4 \u2192 even \u2192 2. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: the 2s are placed in positions where (i - j) is even, and 1s where it's odd. Let's check for Example 1, cell (3,5): 3-5 = -2 even \u2192 2. But the output has 1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed where (i + j) is even and (i - j) is even. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that fits all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output:\n\nThe 2s are placed in positions where (i + j) is even. Let's check:\n\nRow 0, column 2: 0+2=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 1, column 1: 1+1=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 1, column 3: 1+3=4 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 2, column 0: 2+0=2 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 2, column 4: 2+4=6 even \u2192 2. Correct.\nRow 3, column 1: 3+1=4 even \u2192 but in the output, it's 1. So this is a problem.\n\nBut in the output, row 3, column 1 is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the 2s are placed where (i + j) is even and (i - j) is even. For example, for row 3, column 1: 3+1=4 even, 3-1=2 even \u2192 2. But the output has 1. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed where (i + j) is even and (i - j) is even. But in this case, it would be the same as (i + j) even, since if (i - j) is even, then (i + j) is also even. So this is the same as before.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAnother approach: look at the test input. The test input is a 13x13 grid with a 2 in the middle of the row. The output is not given, but the task is to write the transformation. Perhaps the test input is a 13x13 grid where the middle row has a 2 in the middle. But without the output, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output seems to have 2s in positions that form a diamond shape around the center. For each row i, the 2s are placed at columns that are symmetric around the center. For example, in row i, the distance from the center row is d = |i - 6|. Then, the columns for 2s are 6 - d and 6 + d. But in row 0, d is 6, so columns 0 and 12. But in the output, row 0 has a 2 at column 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the distance from the center is even. For example, for row i, the distance from the center row is d. If d is even, then the 2s are placed at certain columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column are both even or both odd. For example, in Example 1, row 0 (even), column 6 (even) \u2192 2. Row 1 (odd), column 5 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 1, column 7 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 2 (even), column 4 (even) \u2192 2. Row 2, column 8 (even) \u2192 2. Row 3 (odd), column 3 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 3, column 9 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 4 (even), column 2 (even) \u2192 2. Row 4, column 10 (even) \u2192 2. Row 5 (odd), column 1 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 5, column 11 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 6 (even), column 0 (even) \u2192 2. Row 6, column 12 (even) \u2192 2. Row 7 (odd), column 1 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 7, column 11 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 8 (even), column 2 (even) \u2192 2. Row 8, column 10 (even) \u2192 2. Row 9 (odd), column 3 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 9, column 9 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 10 (even), column 4 (even) \u2192 2. Row 10, column 8 (even) \u2192 2. Row 11 (odd), column 5 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 11, column 7 (odd) \u2192 2. Row 12 (even), column 6 (even) \u2192 2.\n\nBut in the output, row 12 has a 1 in column 6. Wait, no, in the output for Example 1, row 12 is: 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0. So column 6 is 1. But according to this pattern, it should be 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is very confusing. I'm not able to find a clear pattern, but I need to write some code.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace all 0s with 2s, but then replace certain positions with 1s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to create a grid where each cell is 2 if it's in the same row or column as the original 2, and 1 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation involves creating a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if the sum of i and j is even, and 1 if it's odd. This would explain some of the examples, even if not all.\n\nBut in Example 1, the cell (3,5) has sum 8 (even), but the output has 1. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to create a grid where each cell is 2 if (i + j) is even and (i - j) is even, and 1 otherwise. But this is the same as (i + j) even.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to create a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if (i - j) is even, and 1 if it's odd. Let's check for Example 1, cell (3,5): 3-5 = -2 even \u2192 2. But in the output, it's 1. So no.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples and write code that creates a grid with 2s in certain positions and 1s in others.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to create a grid where each cell (i,j) is 2 if (i + j) is even and (i - j) is even, and 1 otherwise. But this is not working.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to create a grid where each cell is 2 if it is in the same row or column as the center, and 1 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell (i,j), if (i + j) is even, then it's 2, else 1. This might not fit all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut in Example 1, cell (3,5) is 3+5=8 even \u2192 2, but the output has 1. So this is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to create a grid where each cell is 2 if (i - j) is even, and 1 otherwise. Let's check for Example 1, cell (3,5): 3-5 = -2 even \u2192 2. But the output has 1. So no.\n\nAnother approach: the transformation is to create a grid where each cell is 2 if it is part of a certain pattern, like a diamond, and 1 otherwise. For example, in a 13x13 grid, the diamond is formed by cells where the Manhattan distance from the center is even.\n\nBut how to calculate that.\n\nFor a cell (i,j), the Manhattan distance from the center (6,6) is |i-6| + |j-6|. If this distance is even, then 2, else 1.\n\nLet's check for Example 1, cell (0,6): distance is 6 + 0 = 6 (even) \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nCell (1,5): distance is 5 + 1 = 6 (even) \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nCell (3,5): distance is 3 + 1 = 4 (even) \u2192 2. But in the output, it's 1. So this is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This suggests that this pattern is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm forced to make a guess. Given the examples, I'll assume that the transformation involves creating a grid where each cell is 2 if it is part of a certain symmetric pattern, and 1 otherwise. For example, the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column indices are both even or both odd.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j), if i % 2 == j % 2, then 2, else 1.\n\nLet's test this for Example 2.\n\nExample 2 is a 5x5 grid. Let's check the output:\n\nRow 0, column 2: i=0 (even), j=2 (even) \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nRow 1, column 1: i=1 (odd), j=1 (odd) \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nRow 1, column 3: i=1 (odd), j=3 (odd) \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nRow 2, column 0: i=2 (even), j=0 (even) \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nRow 2, column 4: i=2 (even), j=4 (even) \u2192 2. Correct.\n\nRow 3, column 1: i=3 (odd), j=1 (odd) \u2192 2. But in the output, it's 1. So this is incorrect.\n\nBut in the output, row 3, column 1 is 1. So this pattern is not correct.\n\nBut maybe the transformation is to create a grid where the cell is 2 if (i + j) is even, and 1 if it's odd. Let's check for Example 2, row 3, column 1: 3+1=4 even \u2192 2. But the output has 1. So this is not correct.\n\nThis is very frustrating. Given the time I have, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell (i,j), if (i + j) is even, then it's 2, else 1. Even though it may not fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has some 1s in positions where (i + j) is even. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 2s and 1s with 1s. But this is not the case.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to create a grid where each cell is 2 if it is in the same row or column as the original 2. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell, if (i + j) is even, then 2, else 1. This is a simple pattern, and it may fit some examples.\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n"
