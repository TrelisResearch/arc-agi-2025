          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the transformation seems to involve spreading or propagating certain values (like 3, 4, 7, 8) in a specific pattern. In Example 1, the value 3 is spread from the center to the right and down. In Example 2, the value 4 is spread in a diagonal pattern. In Example 3, the value 7 is spread in a more complex pattern.\n\nFrom these examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading values from their initial positions in a specific pattern, possibly in a diagonal or spreading manner.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is not zero, spread it to neighboring cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value to the right and down\n                for x in range(i, 10):\n                    for y in range(j, 10):\n                        if grid[x][y] == 0:\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is not zero, spread it to neighboring cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value to the right and down\n                for x in range(i, 10):\n                    for y in range(j, 10):\n                        if grid[x][y] == 0:\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
