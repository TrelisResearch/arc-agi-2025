          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at each example one by one.\n\nExample 1:\nInput is a 3x3 grid where the center is 8 and all others are 0. The output has 2s in all positions except the center, which is 0. Wait, the output is:\n0 2 2\n2 0 2\n2 2 2\nSo the center is 0, and all other cells are 2. But the input had 8 in the center. Hmm. Maybe there's some relation between the input value and the output. Like, if the input is 8, maybe the output is 0? But then in example 2, the input has 3s in a diagonal, and the output is 1s and 0s. Not sure yet.\n\nExample 2:\nInput is a diagonal of 3s. Output is a kind of checkerboard pattern with 1s and 0s. The output seems to have 1s in positions where the sum of row and column is even? Let me check. For example, the first row is 1 1 0. So positions (0,0) and (0,1) are 1. (0,2) is 0. Then second row is 1 0 1. So (1,0) is 1, (1,1) 0, (1,2) 1. Third row is 0 1 1. So (2,0) 0, (2,1) 1, (2,2) 1. Hmm, maybe it's based on some parity. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nWait, the input in example 2 has 3s in the diagonal. The output is 1s and 0s. Maybe the output is related to the input's value in some way. For example, if the input is 3, maybe it's converted to 1? But in example 1, the input was 8, which became 0. So maybe there's a mapping from input numbers to output numbers. But how?\n\nLooking at example 3:\nInput is a grid where the first column is 5, then 5, then 5. The second column is 5, 5, 0. Third column is 0, 0, 0. The output is:\n0 4 4\n0 0 4\n0 4 4\nSo the output seems to have 4s in some positions. Maybe the input value is 5, and the output is 4? But in example 1, input was 8, output was 0. That doesn't fit. But maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output depends on the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in a certain position (like center, edge, corner), then the output is different. Let me check the examples again.\n\nLooking at example 1: The input has 8 in the center. The output has 0 in the center, and 2s elsewhere. So maybe the center cell is transformed to 0, and others to 2. But why 2? What's the relation between 8 and 2? Maybe 8 is converted to 0, and others are converted to 2. But then in example 2, the input has 3s in the diagonal. The output is 1s and 0s. So maybe the value is converted to 1 if it's in a certain position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output depends on the sum of the input's value and the position. For example, in example 1, the center cell is 8. The output is 0. Maybe 8 - 8 = 0? But then for other cells, maybe 8 - 6 = 2? But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: look for transformations that involve some kind of symmetry or pattern. For example, in example 1, the output is a 2x2 grid of 2s around the center 0. Maybe the output is determined by the position of the cell relative to the center. Like, if the cell is in the center, it's 0, else 2. But how does that fit with other examples?\n\nLooking at example 5:\nInput is:\n0 8 0\n0 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n0 2 2\nSo the center cell is 8, which becomes 0. The other cells that are 8 are in positions (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). Wait, the output for (0,1) is 0? No. Wait the output for example 5 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 2\nRow 1: 2 0 2\nRow 2: 0 2 2\n\nSo the center cell (1,1) is 0. The cells (0,0) is 2, (0,1) is 0, (0,2) is 2. So the 8s in the input are in positions (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). The output for those positions is 0, 0, 0, 0? Wait, (0,1) is 0 in output, (1,1) is 0, (2,0) is 0, (2,2) is 2? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input for example 5 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0\nRow 1: 0 8 0\nRow 2: 8 0 0\n\nSo the input has 8s at (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)? Wait no. Wait (2,0) is 8? The input for example 5 is:\n\nFirst row: 0 8 0 \u2192 (0,0)=0, (0,1)=8, (0,2)=0.\n\nSecond row: 0 8 0 \u2192 (1,0)=0, (1,1)=8, (1,2)=0.\n\nThird row: 8 0 0 \u2192 (2,0)=8, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0.\n\nSo the 8s are in positions (0,1), (1,1), (2,0). Wait, (2,2) is 0. So the output for example 5 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 2 \u2192 (0,0)=2, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2.\n\nRow 1: 2 0 2 \u2192 (1,0)=2, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2.\n\nRow 2: 0 2 2 \u2192 (2,0)=0, (2,1)=2, (2,2)=2.\n\nSo the 8s in the input are at (0,1), (1,1), (2,0). Their outputs are 0, 0, 0. But (2,0) in input is 8, and output is 0. But (0,0) is 0 in input, and output is 2. Hmm. So maybe the output depends on whether the cell is in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in the center (1,1), it's 0. If it's in the middle of a side, maybe 2? But how does that fit with other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the value of the input cell. For example, if the input is 8, then output is 0. If the input is 3, then output is 1. If input is 5, output is 4. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: input 8 \u2192 output 0. Example 3: input 5 \u2192 output 4. Example 2: input 3 \u2192 output 1. Example 4: input 5 \u2192 output 0. Wait, example 4's input is 5,5,5 in first row, then 0,0,5, then 0,0,0. The output is 0 0 0, 4 4 0, 4 4 4. So the first row is all 0s. The second row has 4s in first two positions and 0 in third. Third row has 4s in first two and 4 in third. So maybe for input 5, output is 4, but for input 0, output is 0. But in example 1, input 8 is 0. So maybe the output is (input value - 8) mod something? For example, 8-8=0, 5-5=0? But that doesn't fit. Or maybe it's 8 - input value. For example, 8-8=0. 5-5=0. But in example 3, the input is 5, and output is 4. So that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the output is 8 - input value if input is 8, but for other values, it's something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the center, then it's 0. If it's in a corner, then 2. But example 1's output has 2s in all positions except the center. So maybe for cells not in the center, the output is 2. But why?\n\nBut in example 2, the output has 1s and 0s. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is determined by the value of the input cell and its position. For example, if the input cell is 8, then output is 0. If it's 3, output is 1. If it's 5, output is 4. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: input is 8 \u2192 output 0. Example 2: input is 3 \u2192 output 1. Example 3: input is 5 \u2192 output 4. Example 4: input is 5 \u2192 output 0. Wait, that's conflicting. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the value's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. If it's in a corner, output is 2. If it's on the edge (but not corner), output is 2. But example 2's output is different. For example, in example 2, the output has 1s and 0s. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the sum of the input cell's value and its position. For example, if the cell is in the center (position (1,1)), then output is 0. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as a transformation that depends on the input's value and the cell's position. For example, in example 1, the input has 8 in the center. The output has 0 in the center and 2 elsewhere. Maybe the output is 2 if the cell is not in the center, and 0 otherwise. But then example 2's output would have to be based on that, but that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the input's value. For example, if the input is 8, the output is 0. If the input is 3, the output is 1. If the input is 5, the output is 4. Then, for example 4, the input is 5 in some positions, and output is 0. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the value of the input cell, but with some transformation. For example, 8 \u2192 0, 3 \u2192 1, 5 \u2192 4, 0 \u2192 0. So maybe the output is (input value - 8) if input is 8, but that doesn't fit. Or maybe it's (input value) mod something. For example, 8 mod 8 is 0, 3 mod 4 is 3, but that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the center, then output is 0. Otherwise, if the cell is in a certain position (like a corner), then output is 2. But how does that fit with example 2?\n\nLooking at example 2's output, which is:\n\n1 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\n0 1 1\n\nSo the center is 0. The corners are 1, 1, 1, 1? Wait, (0,0) is 1, (0,2) is 0, (2,0) is 0, (2,2) is 1. So the corners are 1, 0, 0, 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the parity of the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if (row + column) is even, then output is 1, else 0. But in example 2, the input is 3 in the diagonal. So maybe the output is 1 if the input is 3 and the position is even, else 0. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a transformation that depends on the input's value and the position. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. If the cell is in a corner, output is 2. If it's on the edge (but not corner), output is 2. But example 2's output doesn't fit that. For example, in example 2, the output has 1s and 0s. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to all examples. Let me try to see what the output is for each cell in the input.\n\nLooking at example 1:\n\nInput: 8 0 0\n\n0 8 0\n\n0 0 0\n\nOutput: 0 2 2\n\n2 0 2\n\n2 2 2\n\nSo the center cell (1,1) is 0. All other cells are 2. So maybe the output is 2 for cells not in the center, and 0 for the center. But in example 2, the output is different. Let's check example 2:\n\nInput is:\n\n0 0 3\n\n0 3 0\n\n3 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n1 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\n0 1 1\n\nSo the center cell is 0. The corners are 1, 1, 1, 1? Let me check:\n\n(0,0) is 1, (0,2) is 0, (2,0) is 0, (2,2) is 1. So the corners are 1, 0, 0, 1. Not sure. But the center is 0. So maybe the output is 0 for the center, and something else for others. But how?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell. For example, if the input cell is 8, output is 0. If the input cell is 3, output is 1. If the input cell is 5, output is 4. But how does that fit with example 4?\n\nExample 4's input:\n\n5 5 5\n\n0 0 5\n\n0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n0 0 0\n\n4 4 0\n\n4 4 4\n\nSo the first row is all 0s. The second row has 4s in first two positions and 0 in third. Third row has 4s in first two and 4 in third. So for input 5, the output is 0 in some positions and 4 in others. So maybe it's not directly based on the value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in the first row, then output is 0. But example 1's first row is 8,0,0. Output is 0,2,2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of non-zero cells in the input. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother approach: look for transformations that involve some kind of symmetry or pattern. For example, example 1's output is a cross shape with 0 in the center and 2s around. Example 2's output is a checkerboard pattern with 1s and 0s. Example 3's output is a kind of diagonal pattern. Maybe the transformation is based on the input's value and the cell's position.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a function of the input's value and the cell's position. For example, if the input value is 8, then the output is 0. If the input value is 3, then the output is 1. If the input value is 5, then the output is 4. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1: input 8 \u2192 output 0. Example 2: input 3 \u2192 output 1. Example 3: input 5 \u2192 output 4. Example 4: input 5 \u2192 output 0. Hmm, that's conflicting. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, in example 4, the input has 5 in the first row, and output is 0. So maybe the output is 0 for input 5 if it's in the first row. But that's not consistent with example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the value of the input cell and the position. For example, if the cell is in the center, then output is 0. Otherwise, if the input is 8, output is 2. But that doesn't fit example 2.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to all examples. Let me think of each example's input and output:\n\nExample 1: input has 8 in center. Output has 0 in center, 2 elsewhere.\n\nExample 2: input has 3 in diagonal. Output has 1s and 0s in a checkerboard pattern.\n\nExample 3: input has 5 in first column, then 5, then 5. Output has 0 in first row, 0 in second row first two positions, and 4 in others.\n\nExample 4: input has 5 in first row, 0 in second row, 0 in third. Output has 0 in first row, 4 in second row first two, and 4 in third row.\n\nExample 5: input has 8 in certain positions. Output has 0 in center, 2 elsewhere.\n\nExample 6: input has 8 in a cross shape. Output has 0 in center, 2s in other positions.\n\nSo maybe the output is based on the input's value and the cell's position. For example:\n\n- If the cell is in the center (1,1), output is 0.\n- If the cell is in a corner, output is 2.\n- If the cell is on the edge (but not corner), output is 2.\n- But example 2's output doesn't fit this. Because in example 2, the output has 1s and 0s. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output depends on the input's value. For example:\n\n- If the input value is 8, output is 0.\n- If the input value is 3, output is 1.\n- If the input value is 5, output is 4.\n- If the input value is 0, output is 0.\n\nBut how does that fit with example 4, where input is 5 and output is 0? That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is (input value) mod 8. For example:\n\n- 8 mod 8 = 0.\n- 3 mod 8 = 3. But in example 2, output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is based on the input's value and the cell's position. For example, if the input is 8, the output is 0. If the input is 3, the output is 1. If the input is 5, the output is 4. But how to explain example 4?\n\nWait, example 4's input is:\n\n5 5 5\n\n0 0 5\n\n0 0 0\n\nOutput is:\n\n0 0 0\n\n4 4 0\n\n4 4 4\n\nSo for the first row, all 5s become 0. For the second row, the first two 0s become 4, and the third 5 becomes 0. For the third row, all 0s become 4? Wait, no. The third row is 0 0 0, and output is 4 4 4. So in this case, input 0 becomes 4. But in example 1, input 0 becomes 2. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not directly based on the input value, but on some combination of the value and the cell's position.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is determined by the value of the input cell and the cell's position. For example, if the input cell is 8, then output is 0. If the input cell is 3, then output is 1. If the input cell is 5, then output is 4. If the input cell is 0, then output is 0. But this doesn't explain example 4, where input 0 becomes 4. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and the cell's position. For example, for cells in the first row, if the input is 5, output is 0. For cells in the second row, if input is 5, output is 4. For cells in the third row, if input is 5, output is 4. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a function of the input's value and the position. For example:\n\nIf the cell is in the center (1,1), output is 0.\n\nIf the cell is in a corner (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2), then output is 2.\n\nIf the cell is on the edge (not corner), output is 2.\n\nBut example 2's output is different. For example, in example 2, the output is:\n\n1 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\n0 1 1\n\nSo the center is 0. The corners are 1, 0, 0, 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output depends on the value of the input cell. For example, if the input cell is 8, output is 0. If the input cell is 3, output is 1. If the input cell is 5, output is 4. If the input cell is 0, output is 0. Then for example 4, where the input is 0, output is 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in example 4, the input is 0 in the third row, and output is 4. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the output as a transformation that is based on the input's value and the cell's position. For example:\n\nFor each cell (i, j), the output is:\n\nIf the input value is 8, then 0.\n\nIf the input value is 3, then 1.\n\nIf the input value is 5, then 4.\n\nIf the input value is 0, then 0.\n\nBut this doesn't fit example 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and whether it is in a certain position. For example, if the input cell is 8, then output is 0. If the input cell is 3, then output is 1. If the input cell is 5, then output is 4. If the input cell is 0, then output is 0. But this doesn't explain example 4's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and the sum of its row and column indices. For example, for cell (i,j), output is (input value) - (i + j) mod something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a transformation that depends on the input's value and the cell's position. For example, for the center cell, output is 0. For other cells, if the input value is 8, output is 2. If the input value is 3, output is 1. If the input value is 5, output is 4. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and the cell's position. For example:\n\n- For the center cell (1,1), output is 0.\n- For other cells, if the input value is 8, output is 2.\n- If the input value is 3, output is 1.\n- If the input value is 5, output is 4.\n- If the input value is 0, output is 0.\n\nBut this would explain example 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: center is 8 \u2192 output 0. Others are 0 \u2192 output 2? But in example 1, the input is 0 in other cells, and the output is 2. So that would fit.\n\nExample 2: input is 3 in diagonal. The output is 1 in some positions. So for those cells, output is 1. For others, 0? But example 2's output has 0 in some positions.\n\nBut this seems to be possible. So the transformation would be:\n\nFor each cell (i, j):\n\nif i == 1 and j == 1: output is 0.\n\nelse:\n\nif input cell is 8 \u2192 output is 2.\n\nif input cell is 3 \u2192 output is 1.\n\nif input cell is 5 \u2192 output is 4.\n\nif input cell is 0 \u2192 output is 0.\n\nBut what about other values? For example, in example 4, input is 5 in some positions, and output is 0. So this would not fit.\n\nWait, in example 4, the input has 5 in first row, output is 0. So that's not matching. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me look at example 4 again.\n\nExample 4 input:\n\n5 5 5\n\n0 0 5\n\n0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n0 0 0\n\n4 4 0\n\n4 4 4\n\nSo the first row is all 5s \u2192 output 0s.\n\nSecond row: first two 0s \u2192 output 4, third 5 \u2192 output 0.\n\nThird row: all 0s \u2192 output 4s.\n\nSo for input 5, the output is 0 if it's in the first row, 0 if in the third column of second row, and 4 otherwise. This seems to be based on the position. So maybe the output depends on the cell's position and the input value.\n\nBut how to generalize this? It's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is determined by the input value and the cell's position. For example:\n\nIf the cell is in the first row, then output is 0 if the input is 5.\n\nIf the cell is in the second row, then output is 4 if the input is 0, and 0 if the input is 5.\n\nIf the cell is in the third row, then output is 4 if the input is 0.\n\nBut this seems too specific to example 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of non-zero cells in the input. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a transformation that depends on the input's value and the cell's position. For example:\n\nFor the center cell (1,1), output is 0.\n\nFor other cells, if the input is 8, output is 2.\n\nIf the input is 3, output is 1.\n\nIf the input is 5, output is 4.\n\nIf the input is 0, output is 0.\n\nBut this would explain example 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. But not example 4. However, example 4's input has 5 in first row, which would be output 2, but the output is 0. So this is not matching.\n\nBut maybe there's a different pattern. Let me think of the output for example 4 as follows:\n\nThe first row is all 5s \u2192 output is 0. The second row has 0s and 5. The output for 0s is 4, and for 5 is 0. The third row is all 0s \u2192 output is 4.\n\nSo for input 5, output is 0 if in first row or third column of second row. For input 0, output is 4 if in second row or third row.\n\nThis seems to be based on the position, not the input value. But how?\n\nMaybe the output is determined by the position of the cell. For example:\n\n- If the cell is in the first row, output is 0.\n- If the cell is in the second row, output is 4 if the input is 0, else 0.\n- If the cell is in the third row, output is 4.\n\nBut this is too specific to example 4.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLet me think of the output as a function of the input cell's value and its position. For example:\n\nFor each cell (i, j), the output is:\n\nIf the input value is 8, then output is 0.\n\nIf the input value is 3, then output is 1.\n\nIf the input value is 5, then output is 4.\n\nIf the input value is 0, then output is 0.\n\nBut for example 4, the input is 5, and the output is 0. So this doesn't fit. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and the position's parity. For example, if the cell is in the first row, output is 0. If the cell is in the second row, output is 4 if the input is 0, else 0. But this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and the position. For example, for the center cell, output is 0. For other cells, if the input value is 8, output is 2. If the input value is 3, output is 1. If the input value is 5, output is 4. If the input value is 0, output is 0.\n\nBut this would explain examples 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, but not example 4. However, perhaps example 4's input is special, and the transformation is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and whether it is in a certain position. For example:\n\n- For the center cell, output is 0.\n- For other cells, if the input value is 8, output is 2.\n- If the input value is 3, output is 1.\n- If the input value is 5, output is 4.\n- If the input value is 0, output is 0.\n\nThis would work for examples 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. But for example 4, the input is 5 in first row, which would output 2, but the output is 0. So this is not matching. So maybe this is not the correct pattern.\n\nBut perhaps the output is based on the input value and the position. For example, for the first row, the output is 0 for input 5. For other rows, it's 4 for input 0. But this is too specific.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for the examples I can see.\n\nLooking at example 1 and 5, both have 8 in certain positions and output 0 in the center and 2 elsewhere. Example 2 has 3 in diagonal and output 1 in some positions. Example 3 has 5 in some positions and output 4 in others. Example 4 has 5 in some positions and output 0 in some and 4 in others.\n\nMaybe the output is determined by the input value and the cell's position. For example:\n\nFor each cell (i, j), the output is:\n\nif the input value is 8 \u2192 0 if it's the center, else 2.\n\nif the input value is 3 \u2192 1 if it's on the diagonal, else 0.\n\nif the input value is 5 \u2192 4 if it's in certain positions, else 0.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and the position's parity. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. Otherwise, if the input value is 8, output is 2. If the input value is 3, output is 1. If the input value is 5, output is 4. If the input value is 0, output is 0.\n\nThis would explain example 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. For example 4, it's not matching, but maybe it's an exception. Or perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and the position. For example:\n\nFor each cell (i, j), the output is (input value) - 8 if input value is 8, else (input value) - 3 if input value is 3, else (input value) - 5 if input value is 5, else 0.\n\nBut this would give:\n\nExample 1: 8 \u2192 0, others 0 \u2192 0-8= -8? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is (input value) mod 8. For example:\n\n8 mod 8 = 0.\n\n3 mod 8 = 3. But in example 2, the output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe I should think of the output as a transformation that depends on the input value and the cell's position. For example, for the center cell, output is 0. For other cells, if the input is 8, output is 2. If the input is 3, output is 1. If the input is 5, output is 4. If the input is 0, output is 0.\n\nThis would explain examples 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. For example 4, it's not matching, but maybe it's a special case. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with this hypothesis. The code would check for each cell if it's the center, then output 0. Otherwise, based on the input value, output 2, 1, or 4, or 0.\n\nBut how to handle other values? For example, if the input is 0, output is 0. If input is 5, output is 4. If input is 3, output is 1. If input is 8, output is 2. But wait, in example 1, the input is 0 in other cells, and the output is 2. So for input 0, the output is 2? But in example 4, input is 0 and output is 4.\n\nThis is conflicting. So this approach is not working.\n\nMaybe I should think of the output as a function of the input value and the position. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. For other cells, if the input value is 8, output is 2. If the input value is 3, output is 1. If the input value is 5, output is 4. If the input value is 0, output is 0.\n\nBut this would not explain example 4. However, perhaps the example 4 is an exception, or there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the value of the input cell and the cell's position. For example:\n\nFor each cell (i, j), the output is:\n\nif the cell is in the center \u2192 0.\n\nelse:\n\nif the input value is 8 \u2192 2.\n\nif the input value is 3 \u2192 1.\n\nif the input value is 5 \u2192 4.\n\nelse \u2192 0.\n\nBut this would explain example 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. For example 4, the input is 5 in first row, which would output 2, but the output is 0. So this is not matching.\n\nBut maybe example 4 is a special case. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the input value and the cell's position. For example, for the first row, output is 0 if input is 5. For other rows, output is 4 if input is 0, and 0 if input is 5.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples that fit, even if it's not perfect.\n\nThe pattern that seems to hold for some examples is:\n\n- The center cell is always 0.\n- For other cells, if the input is 8, output is 2.\n- If the input is 3, output is 1.\n- If the input is 5, output is 4.\n- If the input is 0, output is 0.\n\nThis would explain examples 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. For example 4, it's not matching, but maybe the input in example 4 has other values.\n\nBut in example 4, the input has 5 in first row, which would output 2, but the output is 0. So this is conflicting. But maybe the example 4 is an exception, or there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the input value and the cell's position. For example, for cells in the first row, output is 0 if input is 5. For cells in the second row, output is 4 if input is 0, and 0 if input is 5. For cells in the third row, output is 4 if input is 0.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the examples I've seen, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the center cell is 0, and other cells are transformed based on their input value as follows: 8 \u2192 2, 3 \u2192 1, 5 \u2192 4, 0 \u2192 0. For other values, perhaps it's 0 or something else.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if i == 1 and j == 1:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                val = grid[i][j]\n                if val == 8:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif val == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                elif val == 5:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 4\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not explain example 4. Let's test it with example 4:\n\nInput for example 4 is:\n\n5 5 5\n\n0 0 5\n\n0 0 0\n\nOutput according to this code:\n\nFor each cell not in center:\n\ni=0, j=0: val 5 \u2192 4.\n\ni=0, j=1: 5 \u2192 4.\n\ni=0, j=2: 5 \u2192 4.\n\ni=1, j=0: 0 \u2192 0.\n\ni=1, j=1: 0.\n\ni=1, j=2: 5 \u2192 4.\n\ni=2, j=0: 0 \u2192 0.\n\ni=2, j=1: 0 \u2192 0.\n\ni=2, j=2: 0 \u2192 0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n4 4 4\n\n0 0 4\n\n0 0 0\n\nBut the example 4's output is:\n\n0 0 0\n\n4 4 0\n\n4 4 4\n\nSo this doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe the code should handle other values. For example, for input 0, output is 0 in some cases and 4 in others.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not based on the input value, but on the position. For example, for cells in the first row, output is 0 if input is 5. For cells in the second row, output is 4 if input is 0, and 0 if input is 5. For cells in the third row, output is 4 if input is 0.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the position. For example, for cells in the first row, output is 0. For cells in the second row, output is 4 if the input is 0, else 0. For cells in the third row, output is 4.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different hypothesis. Let me look for patterns in the outputs.\n\nExample 1's output is a 2x2 grid of 2s around the center 0.\n\nExample 2's output is a checkerboard pattern with 1s and 0s.\n\nExample 3's output is a diagonal pattern of 4s and 0s.\n\nExample 4's output is a mix of 0s and 4s.\n\nExample 5's output is similar to example 1.\n\nExample 6's output is similar to example 1.\n\nSo perhaps the output is based on the input's value and the cell's position. For example, if the input is 8, the output is 0 in the center and 2 elsewhere. If the input is 3, the output is 1 in certain positions and 0 elsewhere. If the input is 5, the output is 4 in certain positions and 0 elsewhere.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother idea: the output is based on the input's value and the cell's position in terms of being in a certain pattern. For example, for input 8, the output is 0 in the center and 2 elsewhere. For input 3, the output is 1 in the positions where the input is 3, and 0 elsewhere. But this doesn't fit example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the input's value and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. Otherwise, if the input value is 8, output is 2. If the input value is 3, output is 1. If the input value is 5, output is 4. If the input value is 0, output is 0.\n\nBut this would not explain example 4. However, perhaps the example 4 is a special case where the input is 5 in certain positions, and the output is 0. But why?\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that the center is 0, and other cells are transformed based on their input value as follows: 8 \u2192 2, 3 \u2192 1, 5 \u2192 4, 0 \u2192 0. For other values, it's 0. Even if this doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if i == 1 and j == 1:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                val = grid[i][j]\n                if val == 8:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif val == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                elif val == 5:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 4\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not work for example 4. However, perhaps the example 4's input is different. Let me check example 4 again:\n\nInput is:\n\n5 5 5\n\n0 0 5\n\n0 0 0\n\nOutput is:\n\n0 0 0\n\n4 4 0\n\n4 4 4\n\nSo for the first row, all 5s are transformed to 0. But according to the code, they should be 4. So this is not matching. So this suggests that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nBut perhaps the code should handle other values. For example, if the input is 5 and the cell is in the first row, output is 0. But how to determine that?\n\nMaybe the output is based on the input value and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in the first row, and the input is 5, output is 0. If the cell is in the second row, and input is 0, output is 4. If the cell is in the third row, and input is 0, output is 4.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different approach. Let me look at the output of example 4 again. The output is:\n\n0 0 0\n\n4 4 0\n\n4 4 4\n\nSo the first row is all 0s, the second row has 4s in first two positions and 0 in third, and the third row has 4s in all positions.\n\nSo for the first row, output is 0 regardless of input. For the second row, output is 4 if the cell is in (1,0) or (1,1), and 0 if (1,2). For the third row, output is 4.\n\nSo maybe the output is based on the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in the first row, output is 0. If the cell is in the third row, output is 4. For the second row, if the cell is in (1,0) or (1,1), output is 4, else 0.\n\nBut this is too specific to example 4.\n\nGiven that, I think the best I can do is to write a function that handles the center cell as 0, and for other cells, if the input is 8, output is 2, if input is 3, output is 1, if input is 5, output is 4, else 0. Even though this doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be as above. Even if it doesn't fit example 4, it's the best I can do based on the examples I have.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at each example one by one.\n\nExample 1:\nInput is a 3x3 grid where the center is 8 and all others are 0. The output has 2s in all positions except the center, which is 0. Wait, the output is:\n0 2 2\n2 0 2\n2 2 2\nSo the center is 0, and all other cells are 2. But the input had 8 in the center. Hmm. Maybe there's some relation between the input value and the output. Like, if the input is 8, maybe the output is 0? But then in example 2, the input has 3s in a diagonal, and the output is 1s and 0s. Not sure yet.\n\nExample 2:\nInput is a diagonal of 3s. Output is a kind of checkerboard pattern with 1s and 0s. The output seems to have 1s in positions where the sum of row and column is even? Let me check. For example, the first row is 1 1 0. So positions (0,0) and (0,1) are 1. (0,2) is 0. Then second row is 1 0 1. So (1,0) is 1, (1,1) 0, (1,2) 1. Third row is 0 1 1. So (2,0) 0, (2,1) 1, (2,2) 1. Hmm, maybe it's based on some parity. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nWait, the input in example 2 has 3s in the diagonal. The output is 1s and 0s. Maybe the output is related to the input's value in some way. For example, if the input is 3, maybe it's converted to 1? But in example 1, the input was 8, which became 0. So maybe there's a mapping from input numbers to output numbers. But how?\n\nLooking at example 3:\nInput is a grid where the first column is 5, then 5, then 5. The second column is 5, 5, 0. Third column is 0, 0, 0. The output is:\n0 4 4\n0 0 4\n0 4 4\nSo the output seems to have 4s in some positions. Maybe the input value is 5, and the output is 4? But in example 1, input was 8, output was 0. That doesn't fit. But maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output depends on the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in a certain position (like center, edge, corner), then the output is different. Let me check the examples again.\n\nLooking at example 1: The input has 8 in the center. The output has 0 in the center, and 2s elsewhere. So maybe the center cell is transformed to 0, and others to 2. But why 2? What's the relation between 8 and 2? Maybe 8 is converted to 0, and others are converted to 2. But then in example 2, the input has 3s in the diagonal. The output is 1s and 0s. So maybe the value is converted to 1 if it's in a certain position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output depends on the sum of the input's value and the position. For example, in example 1, the center cell is 8. The output is 0. Maybe 8 - 8 = 0? But then for other cells, maybe 8 - 6 = 2? But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: look for transformations that involve some kind of symmetry or pattern. For example, in example 1, the output is a 2x2 grid of 2s around the center 0. Maybe the output is determined by the position of the cell relative to the center. Like, if the cell is in the center, it's 0, else 2. But how does that fit with other examples?\n\nLooking at example 5:\nInput is:\n0 8 0\n0 8 0\n8 0 0\nOutput:\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n0 2 2\nSo the center cell is 8, which becomes 0. The other cells that are 8 are in positions (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). Wait, the output for (0,1) is 0? No. Wait the output for example 5 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 2\nRow 1: 2 0 2\nRow 2: 0 2 2\n\nSo the center cell (1,1) is 0. The cells (0,0) is 2, (0,1) is 0, (0,2) is 2. So the 8s in the input are in positions (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). The output for those positions is 0, 0, 0, 0? Wait, (0,1) is 0 in output, (1,1) is 0, (2,0) is 0, (2,2) is 2? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input for example 5 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0\nRow 1: 0 8 0\nRow 2: 8 0 0\n\nSo the input has 8s at (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2)? Wait no. Wait (2,0) is 8? The input for example 5 is:\n\nFirst row: 0 8 0 \u2192 (0,0)=0, (0,1)=8, (0,2)=0.\n\nSecond row: 0 8 0 \u2192 (1,0)=0, (1,1)=8, (1,2)=0.\n\nThird row: 8 0 0 \u2192 (2,0)=8, (2,1)=0, (2,2)=0.\n\nSo the 8s are in positions (0,1), (1,1), (2,0). Wait, (2,2) is 0. So the output for example 5 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 2 \u2192 (0,0)=2, (0,1)=0, (0,2)=2.\n\nRow 1: 2 0 2 \u2192 (1,0)=2, (1,1)=0, (1,2)=2.\n\nRow 2: 0 2 2 \u2192 (2,0)=0, (2,1)=2, (2,2)=2.\n\nSo the 8s in the input are at (0,1), (1,1), (2,0). Their outputs are 0, 0, 0. But (2,0) in input is 8, and output is 0. But (0,0) is 0 in input, and output is 2. Hmm. So maybe the output depends on whether the cell is in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in the center (1,1), it's 0. If it's in the middle of a side, maybe 2? But how does that fit with other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the value of the input cell. For example, if the input is 8, then output is 0. If the input is 3, then output is 1. If input is 5, output is 4. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: input 8 \u2192 output 0. Example 3: input 5 \u2192 output 4. Example 2: input 3 \u2192 output 1. Example 4: input 5 \u2192 output 0. Wait, example 4's input is 5,5,5 in first row, then 0,0,5, then 0,0,0. The output is 0 0 0, 4 4 0, 4 4 4. So the first row is all 0s. The second row has 4s in first two positions and 0 in third. Third row has 4s in first two and 4 in third. So maybe for input 5, output is 4, but for input 0, output is 0. But in example 1, input 8 is 0. So maybe the output is (input value - 8) mod something? For example, 8-8=0, 5-5=0? But that doesn't fit. Or maybe it's 8 - input value. For example, 8-8=0. 5-5=0. But in example 3, the input is 5, and output is 4. So that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the output is 8 - input value if input is 8, but for other values, it's something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the center, then it's 0. If it's in a corner, then 2. But example 1's output has 2s in all positions except the center. So maybe for cells not in the center, the output is 2. But why?\n\nBut in example 2, the output has 1s and 0s. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is determined by the value of the input cell and its position. For example, if the input cell is 8, then output is 0. If it's 3, output is 1. If it's 5, output is 4. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: input is 8 \u2192 output 0. Example 2: input is 3 \u2192 output 1. Example 3: input is 5 \u2192 output 4. Example 4: input is 5 \u2192 output 0. Wait, that's conflicting. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the value's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. If it's in a corner, output is 2. If it's on the edge (but not corner), output is 2. But example 2's output is different. For example, in example 2, the output has 1s and 0s. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the sum of the input cell's value and its position. For example, if the cell is in the center (position (1,1)), then output is 0. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as a transformation that depends on the input's value and the cell's position. For example, in example 1, the input has 8 in the center. The output has 0 in the center and 2 elsewhere. Maybe the output is 2 if the cell is not in the center, and 0 otherwise. But then example 2's output would have to be based on that, but that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the input's value. For example, if the input is 8, the output is 0. If the input is 3, the output is 1. If the input is 5, the output is 4. Then, for example 4, the input is 5 in some positions, and output is 0. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the value of the input cell, but with some transformation. For example, 8 \u2192 0, 3 \u2192 1, 5 \u2192 4, 0 \u2192 0. So maybe the output is (input value - 8) if input is 8, but that doesn't fit. Or maybe it's (input value) mod something. For example, 8 mod 8 is 0, 3 mod 4 is 3, but that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the center, then output is 0. Otherwise, if the cell is in a certain position (like a corner), then output is 2. But how does that fit with example 2?\n\nLooking at example 2's output, which is:\n\n1 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\n0 1 1\n\nSo the center is 0. The corners are 1, 1, 1, 1? Wait, (0,0) is 1, (0,2) is 0, (2,0) is 0, (2,2) is 1. So the corners are 1, 0, 0, 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the parity of the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if (row + column) is even, then output is 1, else 0. But in example 2, the input is 3 in the diagonal. So maybe the output is 1 if the input is 3 and the position is even, else 0. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a transformation that depends on the input's value and the position. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. If the cell is in a corner, output is 2. If it's on the edge (but not corner), output is 2. But example 2's output doesn't fit that. For example, in example 2, the output has 1s and 0s. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to all examples. Let me try to see what the output is for each cell in the input.\n\nLooking at example 1:\n\nInput: 8 0 0\n\n0 8 0\n\n0 0 0\n\nOutput: 0 2 2\n\n2 0 2\n\n2 2 2\n\nSo the center cell (1,1) is 0. All other cells are 2. So maybe the output is 2 for cells not in the center, and 0 for the center. But in example 2, the output is different. Let's check example 2:\n\nInput is:\n\n0 0 3\n\n0 3 0\n\n3 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n1 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\n0 1 1\n\nSo the center cell is 0. The corners are 1, 1, 1, 1? Let me check:\n\n(0,0) is 1, (0,2) is 0, (2,0) is 0, (2,2) is 1. So the corners are 1, 0, 0, 1. Not sure. But the center is 0. So maybe the output is 0 for the center, and something else for others. But how?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell. For example, if the input cell is 8, output is 0. If the input cell is 3, output is 1. If the input cell is 5, output is 4. But how does that fit with example 4?\n\nExample 4's input:\n\n5 5 5\n\n0 0 5\n\n0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n0 0 0\n\n4 4 0\n\n4 4 4\n\nSo the first row is all 0s. The second row has 4s in first two positions and 0 in third. Third row has 4s in first two and 4 in third. So for input 5, the output is 0 in some positions and 4 in others. So maybe it's not directly based on the value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in the first row, then output is 0. But example 1's first row is 8,0,0. Output is 0,2,2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of non-zero cells in the input. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother approach: look for transformations that involve some kind of symmetry or pattern. For example, example 1's output is a cross shape with 0 in the center and 2s around. Example 2's output is a checkerboard pattern with 1s and 0s. Example 3's output is a kind of diagonal pattern. Maybe the transformation is based on the input's value and the cell's position.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a function of the input's value and the cell's position. For example, if the input value is 8, then the output is 0. If the input value is 3, then the output is 1. If the input value is 5, then the output is 4. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1: input 8 \u2192 output 0. Example 2: input 3 \u2192 output 1. Example 3: input 5 \u2192 output 4. Example 4: input 5 \u2192 output 0. Hmm, that's conflicting. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, in example 4, the input has 5 in the first row, and output is 0. So maybe the output is 0 for input 5 if it's in the first row. But that's not consistent with example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the value of the input cell and the position. For example, if the cell is in the center, then output is 0. Otherwise, if the input is 8, output is 2. But that doesn't fit example 2.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to all examples. Let me think of each example's input and output:\n\nExample 1: input has 8 in center. Output has 0 in center, 2 elsewhere.\n\nExample 2: input has 3 in diagonal. Output has 1s and 0s in a checkerboard pattern.\n\nExample 3: input has 5 in first column, then 5, then 5. Output has 0 in first row, 0 in second row first two positions, and 4 in others.\n\nExample 4: input has 5 in first row, 0 in second row, 0 in third. Output has 0 in first row, 4 in second row first two, and 4 in third row.\n\nExample 5: input has 8 in certain positions. Output has 0 in center, 2 elsewhere.\n\nExample 6: input has 8 in a cross shape. Output has 0 in center, 2s in other positions.\n\nSo maybe the output is based on the input's value and the cell's position. For example:\n\n- If the cell is in the center (1,1), output is 0.\n- If the cell is in a corner, output is 2.\n- If the cell is on the edge (but not corner), output is 2.\n- But example 2's output doesn't fit this. Because in example 2, the output has 1s and 0s. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output depends on the input's value. For example:\n\n- If the input value is 8, output is 0.\n- If the input value is 3, output is 1.\n- If the input value is 5, output is 4.\n- If the input value is 0, output is 0.\n\nBut how does that fit with example 4, where input is 5 and output is 0? That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is (input value) mod 8. For example:\n\n- 8 mod 8 = 0.\n- 3 mod 8 = 3. But in example 2, output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is based on the input's value and the cell's position. For example, if the input is 8, the output is 0. If the input is 3, the output is 1. If the input is 5, the output is 4. But how to explain example 4?\n\nWait, example 4's input is:\n\n5 5 5\n\n0 0 5\n\n0 0 0\n\nOutput is:\n\n0 0 0\n\n4 4 0\n\n4 4 4\n\nSo for the first row, all 5s become 0. For the second row, the first two 0s become 4, and the third 5 becomes 0. For the third row, all 0s become 4? Wait, no. The third row is 0 0 0, and output is 4 4 4. So in this case, input 0 becomes 4. But in example 1, input 0 becomes 2. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not directly based on the input value, but on some combination of the value and the cell's position.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is determined by the value of the input cell and the cell's position. For example, if the input cell is 8, then output is 0. If the input cell is 3, then output is 1. If the input cell is 5, then output is 4. If the input cell is 0, then output is 0. But this doesn't explain example 4, where input 0 becomes 4. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and the cell's position. For example, for cells in the first row, if the input is 5, output is 0. For cells in the second row, if input is 5, output is 4. For cells in the third row, if input is 5, output is 4. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a function of the input's value and the position. For example:\n\nIf the cell is in the center (1,1), output is 0.\n\nIf the cell is in a corner (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2), then output is 2.\n\nIf the cell is on the edge (not corner), output is 2.\n\nBut example 2's output is different. For example, in example 2, the output is:\n\n1 1 0\n\n1 0 1\n\n0 1 1\n\nSo the center is 0. The corners are 1, 0, 0, 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output depends on the value of the input cell. For example, if the input cell is 8, output is 0. If the input cell is 3, output is 1. If the input cell is 5, output is 4. If the input cell is 0, output is 0. Then for example 4, where the input is 0, output is 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in example 4, the input is 0 in the third row, and output is 4. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the output as a transformation that is based on the input's value and the cell's position. For example:\n\nFor each cell (i, j), the output is:\n\nIf the input value is 8, then 0.\n\nIf the input value is 3, then 1.\n\nIf the input value is 5, then 4.\n\nIf the input value is 0, then 0.\n\nBut this doesn't fit example 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and whether it is in a certain position. For example, if the input cell is 8, then output is 0. If the input cell is 3, then output is 1. If the input cell is 5, then output is 4. If the input cell is 0, then output is 0. But this doesn't explain example 4's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and the sum of its row and column indices. For example, for cell (i,j), output is (input value) - (i + j) mod something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a transformation that depends on the input's value and the cell's position. For example, for the center cell, output is 0. For other cells, if the input value is 8, output is 2. If the input value is 3, output is 1. If the input value is 5, output is 4. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and the cell's position. For example:\n\n- For the center cell (1,1), output is 0.\n- For other cells, if the input value is 8, output is 2.\n- If the input value is 3, output is 1.\n- If the input value is 5, output is 4.\n- If the input value is 0, output is 0.\n\nBut this would explain example 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: center is 8 \u2192 output 0. Others are 0 \u2192 output 2? But in example 1, the input is 0 in other cells, and the output is 2. So that would fit.\n\nExample 2: input is 3 in diagonal. The output is 1 in some positions. So for those cells, output is 1. For others, 0? But example 2's output has 0 in some positions.\n\nBut this seems to be possible. So the transformation would be:\n\nFor each cell (i, j):\n\nif i == 1 and j == 1: output is 0.\n\nelse:\n\nif input cell is 8 \u2192 output is 2.\n\nif input cell is 3 \u2192 output is 1.\n\nif input cell is 5 \u2192 output is 4.\n\nif input cell is 0 \u2192 output is 0.\n\nBut what about other values? For example, in example 4, input is 5 in some positions, and output is 0. So this would not fit.\n\nWait, in example 4, the input has 5 in first row, output is 0. So that's not matching. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let me look at example 4 again.\n\nExample 4 input:\n\n5 5 5\n\n0 0 5\n\n0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n0 0 0\n\n4 4 0\n\n4 4 4\n\nSo the first row is all 5s \u2192 output 0s.\n\nSecond row: first two 0s \u2192 output 4, third 5 \u2192 output 0.\n\nThird row: all 0s \u2192 output 4s.\n\nSo for input 5, the output is 0 if it's in the first row, 0 if in the third column of second row, and 4 otherwise. This seems to be based on the position. So maybe the output depends on the cell's position and the input value.\n\nBut how to generalize this? It's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is determined by the input value and the cell's position. For example:\n\nIf the cell is in the first row, then output is 0 if the input is 5.\n\nIf the cell is in the second row, then output is 4 if the input is 0, and 0 if the input is 5.\n\nIf the cell is in the third row, then output is 4 if the input is 0.\n\nBut this seems too specific to example 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of non-zero cells in the input. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a transformation that depends on the input's value and the cell's position. For example:\n\nFor the center cell (1,1), output is 0.\n\nFor other cells, if the input is 8, output is 2.\n\nIf the input is 3, output is 1.\n\nIf the input is 5, output is 4.\n\nIf the input is 0, output is 0.\n\nBut this would explain example 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. But not example 4. However, example 4's input has 5 in first row, which would be output 2, but the output is 0. So this is not matching.\n\nBut maybe there's a different pattern. Let me think of the output for example 4 as follows:\n\nThe first row is all 5s \u2192 output is 0. The second row has 0s and 5. The output for 0s is 4, and for 5 is 0. The third row is all 0s \u2192 output is 4.\n\nSo for input 5, output is 0 if in first row or third column of second row. For input 0, output is 4 if in second row or third row.\n\nThis seems to be based on the position, not the input value. But how?\n\nMaybe the output is determined by the position of the cell. For example:\n\n- If the cell is in the first row, output is 0.\n- If the cell is in the second row, output is 4 if the input is 0, else 0.\n- If the cell is in the third row, output is 4.\n\nBut this is too specific to example 4.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLet me think of the output as a function of the input cell's value and its position. For example:\n\nFor each cell (i, j), the output is:\n\nIf the input value is 8, then output is 0.\n\nIf the input value is 3, then output is 1.\n\nIf the input value is 5, then output is 4.\n\nIf the input value is 0, then output is 0.\n\nBut for example 4, the input is 5, and the output is 0. So this doesn't fit. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and the position's parity. For example, if the cell is in the first row, output is 0. If the cell is in the second row, output is 4 if the input is 0, else 0. But this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and the position. For example, for the center cell, output is 0. For other cells, if the input value is 8, output is 2. If the input value is 3, output is 1. If the input value is 5, output is 4. If the input value is 0, output is 0.\n\nBut this would explain examples 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, but not example 4. However, perhaps example 4's input is special, and the transformation is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and whether it is in a certain position. For example:\n\n- For the center cell, output is 0.\n- For other cells, if the input value is 8, output is 2.\n- If the input value is 3, output is 1.\n- If the input value is 5, output is 4.\n- If the input value is 0, output is 0.\n\nThis would work for examples 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. But for example 4, the input is 5 in first row, which would output 2, but the output is 0. So this is not matching. So maybe this is not the correct pattern.\n\nBut perhaps the output is based on the input value and the position. For example, for the first row, the output is 0 for input 5. For other rows, it's 4 for input 0. But this is too specific.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for the examples I can see.\n\nLooking at example 1 and 5, both have 8 in certain positions and output 0 in the center and 2 elsewhere. Example 2 has 3 in diagonal and output 1 in some positions. Example 3 has 5 in some positions and output 4 in others. Example 4 has 5 in some positions and output 0 in some and 4 in others.\n\nMaybe the output is determined by the input value and the cell's position. For example:\n\nFor each cell (i, j), the output is:\n\nif the input value is 8 \u2192 0 if it's the center, else 2.\n\nif the input value is 3 \u2192 1 if it's on the diagonal, else 0.\n\nif the input value is 5 \u2192 4 if it's in certain positions, else 0.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and the position's parity. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. Otherwise, if the input value is 8, output is 2. If the input value is 3, output is 1. If the input value is 5, output is 4. If the input value is 0, output is 0.\n\nThis would explain example 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. For example 4, it's not matching, but maybe it's an exception. Or perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the input cell and the position. For example:\n\nFor each cell (i, j), the output is (input value) - 8 if input value is 8, else (input value) - 3 if input value is 3, else (input value) - 5 if input value is 5, else 0.\n\nBut this would give:\n\nExample 1: 8 \u2192 0, others 0 \u2192 0-8= -8? No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is (input value) mod 8. For example:\n\n8 mod 8 = 0.\n\n3 mod 8 = 3. But in example 2, the output is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe I should think of the output as a transformation that depends on the input value and the cell's position. For example, for the center cell, output is 0. For other cells, if the input is 8, output is 2. If the input is 3, output is 1. If the input is 5, output is 4. If the input is 0, output is 0.\n\nThis would explain examples 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. For example 4, it's not matching, but maybe it's a special case. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with this hypothesis. The code would check for each cell if it's the center, then output 0. Otherwise, based on the input value, output 2, 1, or 4, or 0.\n\nBut how to handle other values? For example, if the input is 0, output is 0. If input is 5, output is 4. If input is 3, output is 1. If input is 8, output is 2. But wait, in example 1, the input is 0 in other cells, and the output is 2. So for input 0, the output is 2? But in example 4, input is 0 and output is 4.\n\nThis is conflicting. So this approach is not working.\n\nMaybe I should think of the output as a function of the input value and the position. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. For other cells, if the input value is 8, output is 2. If the input value is 3, output is 1. If the input value is 5, output is 4. If the input value is 0, output is 0.\n\nBut this would not explain example 4. However, perhaps the example 4 is an exception, or there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the value of the input cell and the cell's position. For example:\n\nFor each cell (i, j), the output is:\n\nif the cell is in the center \u2192 0.\n\nelse:\n\nif the input value is 8 \u2192 2.\n\nif the input value is 3 \u2192 1.\n\nif the input value is 5 \u2192 4.\n\nelse \u2192 0.\n\nBut this would explain example 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. For example 4, the input is 5 in first row, which would output 2, but the output is 0. So this is not matching.\n\nBut maybe example 4 is a special case. Or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the input value and the cell's position. For example, for the first row, output is 0 if input is 5. For other rows, output is 4 if input is 0, and 0 if input is 5.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples that fit, even if it's not perfect.\n\nThe pattern that seems to hold for some examples is:\n\n- The center cell is always 0.\n- For other cells, if the input is 8, output is 2.\n- If the input is 3, output is 1.\n- If the input is 5, output is 4.\n- If the input is 0, output is 0.\n\nThis would explain examples 1, 2, 3, 5, 6. For example 4, it's not matching, but maybe the input in example 4 has other values.\n\nBut in example 4, the input has 5 in first row, which would output 2, but the output is 0. So this is conflicting. But maybe the example 4 is an exception, or there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the input value and the cell's position. For example, for cells in the first row, output is 0 if input is 5. For cells in the second row, output is 4 if input is 0, and 0 if input is 5. For cells in the third row, output is 4 if input is 0.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the examples I've seen, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the center cell is 0, and other cells are transformed based on their input value as follows: 8 \u2192 2, 3 \u2192 1, 5 \u2192 4, 0 \u2192 0. For other values, perhaps it's 0 or something else.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if i == 1 and j == 1:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                val = grid[i][j]\n                if val == 8:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif val == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                elif val == 5:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 4\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not explain example 4. Let's test it with example 4:\n\nInput for example 4 is:\n\n5 5 5\n\n0 0 5\n\n0 0 0\n\nOutput according to this code:\n\nFor each cell not in center:\n\ni=0, j=0: val 5 \u2192 4.\n\ni=0, j=1: 5 \u2192 4.\n\ni=0, j=2: 5 \u2192 4.\n\ni=1, j=0: 0 \u2192 0.\n\ni=1, j=1: 0.\n\ni=1, j=2: 5 \u2192 4.\n\ni=2, j=0: 0 \u2192 0.\n\ni=2, j=1: 0 \u2192 0.\n\ni=2, j=2: 0 \u2192 0.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n4 4 4\n\n0 0 4\n\n0 0 0\n\nBut the example 4's output is:\n\n0 0 0\n\n4 4 0\n\n4 4 4\n\nSo this doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe the code should handle other values. For example, for input 0, output is 0 in some cases and 4 in others.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not based on the input value, but on the position. For example, for cells in the first row, output is 0 if input is 5. For cells in the second row, output is 4 if input is 0, and 0 if input is 5. For cells in the third row, output is 4 if input is 0.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the position. For example, for cells in the first row, output is 0. For cells in the second row, output is 4 if the input is 0, else 0. For cells in the third row, output is 4.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different hypothesis. Let me look for patterns in the outputs.\n\nExample 1's output is a 2x2 grid of 2s around the center 0.\n\nExample 2's output is a checkerboard pattern with 1s and 0s.\n\nExample 3's output is a diagonal pattern of 4s and 0s.\n\nExample 4's output is a mix of 0s and 4s.\n\nExample 5's output is similar to example 1.\n\nExample 6's output is similar to example 1.\n\nSo perhaps the output is based on the input's value and the cell's position. For example, if the input is 8, the output is 0 in the center and 2 elsewhere. If the input is 3, the output is 1 in certain positions and 0 elsewhere. If the input is 5, the output is 4 in certain positions and 0 elsewhere.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother idea: the output is based on the input's value and the cell's position in terms of being in a certain pattern. For example, for input 8, the output is 0 in the center and 2 elsewhere. For input 3, the output is 1 in the positions where the input is 3, and 0 elsewhere. But this doesn't fit example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the input's value and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. Otherwise, if the input value is 8, output is 2. If the input value is 3, output is 1. If the input value is 5, output is 4. If the input value is 0, output is 0.\n\nBut this would not explain example 4. However, perhaps the example 4 is a special case where the input is 5 in certain positions, and the output is 0. But why?\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that the center is 0, and other cells are transformed based on their input value as follows: 8 \u2192 2, 3 \u2192 1, 5 \u2192 4, 0 \u2192 0. For other values, it's 0. Even if this doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if i == 1 and j == 1:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                val = grid[i][j]\n                if val == 8:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif val == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                elif val == 5:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 4\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not work for example 4. However, perhaps the example 4's input is different. Let me check example 4 again:\n\nInput is:\n\n5 5 5\n\n0 0 5\n\n0 0 0\n\nOutput is:\n\n0 0 0\n\n4 4 0\n\n4 4 4\n\nSo for the first row, all 5s are transformed to 0. But according to the code, they should be 4. So this is not matching. So this suggests that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nBut perhaps the code should handle other values. For example, if the input is 5 and the cell is in the first row, output is 0. But how to determine that?\n\nMaybe the output is based on the input value and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in the first row, and the input is 5, output is 0. If the cell is in the second row, and input is 0, output is 4. If the cell is in the third row, and input is 0, output is 4.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different approach. Let me look at the output of example 4 again. The output is:\n\n0 0 0\n\n4 4 0\n\n4 4 4\n\nSo the first row is all 0s, the second row has 4s in first two positions and 0 in third, and the third row has 4s in all positions.\n\nSo for the first row, output is 0 regardless of input. For the second row, output is 4 if the cell is in (1,0) or (1,1), and 0 if (1,2). For the third row, output is 4.\n\nSo maybe the output is based on the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in the first row, output is 0. If the cell is in the third row, output is 4. For the second row, if the cell is in (1,0) or (1,1), output is 4, else 0.\n\nBut this is too specific to example 4.\n\nGiven that, I think the best I can do is to write a function that handles the center cell as 0, and for other cells, if the input is 8, output is 2, if input is 3, output is 1, if input is 5, output is 4, else 0. Even though this doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be as above. Even if it doesn't fit example 4, it's the best I can do based on the examples I have.\n"
