          "Let's analyze the training examples carefully:\n\n- The input grids have multiple colored dots scattered.\n- The output grids have the colored dots stacked vertically on the left side (first 4 columns).\n- The colors in the output are only from the colors present in the input but arranged in vertical columns.\n- If we look closely:\n  - In Output 1 & 2, the left columns represent sorted or grouped colors in vertical stacks.\n  - The stacks correspond roughly to all occurrences of that color or number found in the input.\n  - The order of the columns seems consistent: blue(1), red(2), green(3), yellow(4) \u2014 but color indexes might map arbitrarily in these ARC tasks.\n- The vertical stacks build upwards from bottom rows (seen in example 1 and 2).\n- Extra cells are zero-filled.\n- Output grids are always 10x10.\n\n**Hypothesis for transformation:**\n\n1. Extract all nonzero values from the input.\n2. For values 1 to 4 (seen in training):\n   - Count how many times each color appears.\n3. On output grid:\n   - For each color/value 1 to 4:\n     - Fill a vertical column with that color starting near the bottom, stacking upwards.\n4. Place columns for colors 1,2,3,4 in order from left to right in output.\n5. Cells outside these stacks are zero.\n\nThis fits all training: the output is a left-aligned block of vertically stacked colors 1..4 representing all occurrences combined.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation details:**\n\n- Initialize a 10x10 grid of zeros.\n- Count occurrences of each color 1..4 in input.\n- For i in (0 to 3) corresponding to color (1 to 4):\n  - Fill from bottom row (row 9) upwards (row 9 - count + 1 to 9).\n- The column index in output is i (0-based).\n- If count is zero, that column remains zero.\n\nLet's implement this logic:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize output grid 10x10 with zeros\n    output = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Count occurrences of colors 1 to 4\n    counts = [0,0,0,0]  # index 0 for color 1, index 1 for color 2, etc.\n    \n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            if 1 <= val <= 4:\n                counts[val-1] +=1\n    \n    # Fill output columns for colors 1 to 4 with vertical stacks\n    for i, count in enumerate(counts):\n        col = i\n        for j in range(count):\n            output[9 - j][col] = i + 1  # color value\n    \n    return output\n```"

              "Let's analyze the training examples carefully:\n\n- The input grids have multiple colored dots scattered.\n- The output grids have the colored dots stacked vertically on the left side (first 4 columns).\n- The colors in the output are only from the colors present in the input but arranged in vertical columns.\n- If we look closely:\n  - In Output 1 & 2, the left columns represent sorted or grouped colors in vertical stacks.\n  - The stacks correspond roughly to all occurrences of that color or number found in the input.\n  - The order of the columns seems consistent: blue(1), red(2), green(3), yellow(4) \u2014 but color indexes might map arbitrarily in these ARC tasks.\n- The vertical stacks build upwards from bottom rows (seen in example 1 and 2).\n- Extra cells are zero-filled.\n- Output grids are always 10x10.\n\n**Hypothesis for transformation:**\n\n1. Extract all nonzero values from the input.\n2. For values 1 to 4 (seen in training):\n   - Count how many times each color appears.\n3. On output grid:\n   - For each color/value 1 to 4:\n     - Fill a vertical column with that color starting near the bottom, stacking upwards.\n4. Place columns for colors 1,2,3,4 in order from left to right in output.\n5. Cells outside these stacks are zero.\n\nThis fits all training: the output is a left-aligned block of vertically stacked colors 1..4 representing all occurrences combined.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation details:**\n\n- Initialize a 10x10 grid of zeros.\n- Count occurrences of each color 1..4 in input.\n- For i in (0 to 3) corresponding to color (1 to 4):\n  - Fill from bottom row (row 9) upwards (row 9 - count + 1 to 9).\n- The column index in output is i (0-based).\n- If count is zero, that column remains zero.\n\nLet's implement this logic:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize output grid 10x10 with zeros\n    output = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Count occurrences of colors 1 to 4\n    counts = [0,0,0,0]  # index 0 for color 1, index 1 for color 2, etc.\n    \n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            if 1 <= val <= 4:\n                counts[val-1] +=1\n    \n    # Fill output columns for colors 1 to 4 with vertical stacks\n    for i, count in enumerate(counts):\n        col = i\n        for j in range(count):\n            output[9 - j][col] = i + 1  # color value\n    \n    return output\n```"
