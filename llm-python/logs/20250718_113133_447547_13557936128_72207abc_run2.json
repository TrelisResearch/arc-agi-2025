Let's look at the patterns:\n\n1. In Example 1, the second row of the input is [2, 3, 0, 0, ...], and the output has [2, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 3, 0, ...]. It looks like the value 2 is repeated at positions 3 and 7, and the value 3 is repeated at position 7.\n\n2. In Example 2, the second row of the input is [6, 8, 0, 1, ...], and the output has [6, 8, 0, 1, 0, 0, 6, 0, ...]. It looks like the value 6 is repeated at position 6, and the value 8 is repeated at position 9.\n\n3. In Example 3, the second row of the input is [1, 2, 0, 0, ...], and the output has [1, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 2, 0, ...]. It looks like the value 1 is repeated at position 4, and the value 2 is repeated at position 7.\n\nFrom these examples, I observe that the transformation seems to be replicating certain values in specific positions. It looks like the value at position (row, col) is being replicated at positions (row, col+3) and (row, col+6), but this pattern is not consistent across all examples.\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that replicates certain values in specific positions. I'll assume that the value at position (row, col) is being replicated at positions (row, col+3) and (row, col+6), but this is just an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for row in range(len(grid)):\n        for col in range(len(grid[0])):\n            # If the cell is not 0, replicate it at positions (row, col+3) and (row, col+6)\n            if grid[row][col] != 0:\n                # Replicate at position (row, col+3)\n                if col + 3 < len(grid[0]):\n                    transformed_grid[row][col + 3] = grid[row][col]\n                # Replicate at position (row, col+6)\n                if col + 6 < len(grid[0]):\n                    transformed_grid[row][col + 6] = grid[row][col]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
