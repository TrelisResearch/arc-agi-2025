There's a pattern where values in the first few columns are being shifted or replaced in a way that creates a \"wave\" effect.\n3. In some examples, values in the first few columns are being replaced with values from the right side of the grid.\n4. There's a pattern where values in the first few columns are being replaced with values from the right side of the grid, creating a kind of \"mirror\" or \"shift\" effect.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that shifts values in the first few columns to the right, creating a wave-like pattern.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the number of columns to shift\n    shift_count = 3\n    \n    # Shift values in the first few columns to the right\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        # Shift the first 'shift_count' columns to the right\n        for j in range(shift_count):\n            # Move value from column j to column j+1\n            transformed_grid[i][j+1] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            # Move value from column j+shift_count to column j\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = transformed_grid[i][j+shift_count]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the number of columns to shift\n    shift_count = 3\n    \n    # Shift values in the first few columns to the right\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        # Shift the first 'shift_count' columns to the right\n        for j in range(shift_count):\n            # Move value from column j to column j+1\n            transformed_grid[i][j+1] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            # Move value from column j+shift_count to column j\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = transformed_grid[i][j+shift_count]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
