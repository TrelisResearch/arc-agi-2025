There appears to be a consistent pattern of values propagating through the grid in a specific way, especially in the later rows.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Copies the first three rows as-is\n- For the remaining rows, we'll apply a transformation that seems to propagate values in a specific pattern\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

The third row is also copied verbatim.\n3. From row 4 onwards, there seems to be a pattern where certain values are replaced or transformed in a specific way, but the exact pattern is not immediately clear.\n4. There appears to be a consistent pattern of values propagating through the grid in a specific way, especially in the later rows.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Copies the first three rows as-is\n- For the remaining rows, we'll apply a transformation that seems to propagate values in a specific pattern\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Copy the first three rows as-is\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid[:3]]\n    \n    # For the remaining rows, apply a transformation\n    for i in range(3, 28):\n        for j in range(28):\n            # This is a placeholder for the actual transformation logic\n            # Based on the patterns observed in the training examples\n            # We'll propagate values in a specific pattern\n            if i == 3 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n            elif i == 4 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 5 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 6 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 7 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 8 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 9 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 10 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 11 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 12 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 13 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 14 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 15 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 16 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 17 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 18 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 19 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 20 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 21 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 22 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 23 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 24 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 25 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 26 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            elif i == 27 and j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n            else:\n                #
