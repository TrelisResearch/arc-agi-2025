The transformation seems to involve spreading or expanding certain values (like 1, 2, 8) in the input grid to adjacent cells in the output grid.\n2.

The values 1 and 8 seem to be spread out in a pattern, with 1s appearing in a line and 8s appearing in a more scattered pattern.\n4. The transformation appears to be a form of \"expansion\" or \"spread\" of certain values to adjacent cells.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads certain values (1, 2, 8) to adjacent cells in the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(13)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # Spread value 2 to adjacent cells\n            if value == 2:\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        new_row = row + dr\n                        new_col = col + dc\n                        if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 10:\n                            output[new_row][new_col] = value\n            \n            # Spread value 1 to adjacent cells\n            if value == 1:\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        new_row = row + dr\n                        new_col = col + dc\n                        if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 10:\n                            output[new_row][new_col] = value\n            \n            # Spread value 8 to adjacent cells\n            if value == 8:\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        new_row = row + dr\n                        new_col = col + dc\n                        if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 10:\n                            output[new_row][new_col] = value\n    \n    return output\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(13)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # Spread value 2 to adjacent cells\n            if value == 2:\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        new_row = row + dr\n                        new_col = col + dc\n                        if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 10:\n                            output[new_row][new_col] = value\n            \n            # Spread value 1 to adjacent cells\n            if value == 1:\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        new_row = row + dr\n                        new_col = col + dc\n                        if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 10:\n                            output[new_row][new_col] = value\n            \n            # Spread value 8 to adjacent cells\n            if value == 8:\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        new_row = row + dr\n                        new_col = col + dc\n                        if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 10:\n                            output[new_row][new_col] = value\n    \n    return output\n```",

The value 2 in the input seems to be expanded to a single cell in the output.\n3. The values 1 and 8 seem to be spread out in a pattern, with 1s appearing in a line and 8s appearing in a more scattered pattern.\n4. The transformation appears to be a form of \"expansion\" or \"spread\" of certain values to adjacent cells.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads certain values (1, 2, 8) to adjacent cells in the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(13)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # Spread value 2 to adjacent cells\n            if value == 2:\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        new_row = row + dr\n                        new_col = col + dc\n                        if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 10:\n                            output[new_row][new_col] = value\n            \n            # Spread value 1 to adjacent cells\n            if value == 1:\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        new_row = row + dr\n                        new_col = col + dc\n                        if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 10:\n                            output[new_row][new_col] = value\n            \n            # Spread value 8 to adjacent cells\n            if value == 8:\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        new_row = row + dr\n                        new_col = col + dc\n                        if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 10:\n                            output[new_row][new_col] = value\n    \n    return output\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(13)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # Spread value 2 to adjacent cells\n            if value == 2:\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        new_row = row + dr\n                        new_col = col + dc\n                        if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 10:\n                            output[new_row][new_col] = value\n            \n            # Spread value 1 to adjacent cells\n            if value == 1:\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        new_row = row + dr\n                        new_col = col + dc\n                        if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 10:\n                            output[new_row][new_col] = value\n            \n            # Spread value 8 to adjacent cells\n            if value == 8:\n                for dr in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dc in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dr == 0 and dc == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        new_row = row + dr\n                        new_col = col + dc\n                        if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 10:\n                            output[new_row][new_col] = value\n    \n    return output\n```",
