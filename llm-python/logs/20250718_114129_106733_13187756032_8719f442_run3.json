          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find a pattern that maps input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the output grids have a 15x15 structure with a specific pattern of 5s and 0s. The input grids are 3x3, and the output grids are 15x15. This suggests that the input is being expanded or transformed in some way to create the 15x15 output.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n1. The 5s in the input seem to be expanding into larger patterns in the output\n2. The 0s are acting as fillers or boundaries\n3. The pattern seems to be symmetric and has a specific structure\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves expanding each 5 in the input grid into a 3x3 block of 5s in the output grid, with 0s filling in the surrounding areas.\n\nHere's my implementation of this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize a 15x15 grid with all 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]\n    \n    # Define the size of the expansion block\n    block_size = 3\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # Check if the cell has a value of 5\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Calculate the starting position in the output grid\n                start_row = i * block_size\n                start_col = j * block_size\n                \n                # Fill a 3x3 block of 5s in the output grid\n                for x in range(start_row, start_row + block_size):\n                    for y in range(start_col, start_col + block_size):\n                        transformed_grid[x][y] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize a 15x15 grid with all 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]\n    \n    # Define the size of the expansion block\n    block_size = 3\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # Check if the cell has a value of 5\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Calculate the starting position in the output grid\n                start_row = i * block_size\n                start_col = j * block_size\n                \n                # Fill a 3x3 block of 5s in the output grid\n                for x in range(start_row, start_row + block_size):\n                    for y in range(start_col, start_col + block_size):\n                        transformed_grid[x][y] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
