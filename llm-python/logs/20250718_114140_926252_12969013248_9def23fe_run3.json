The transformation seems to involve expanding or propagating certain values (like 2s and 8s) to fill regions\n2. Values like 4 and 3 appear to be \"anchors\" that influence the spread of other values\n3. There's a pattern where certain values (like 2s) spread out from their positions to fill adjacent cells\n4. Values like 8 seem to be \"sources\" that influence the spread of 2s\n5. The output grid always has a specific structure with 21 rows and 25 columns\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Expands values like 2s and 8s to fill adjacent cells\n- Preserves the original values where they are\n- Ensures the output grid is always 21x25\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Ensure the grid is 21x25\n    if len(grid) != 21 or len(grid[0]) != 25:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input grid must be 21x25\")\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Create a queue for BFS\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    # Define the directions we can move (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    \n    # Find all source cells (values that need to influence others)\n    sources = []\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if grid[i][j] in [2, 8]:\n                sources.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Perform BFS from each source to spread values\n    for i, j in sources:\n        queue = deque()\n        queue.append((i, j))\n        visited = set()\n        visited.add((i, j))\n        \n        while queue:\n            x, y = queue.popleft()\n            \n            # Check all four directions\n            for dx, dy in directions:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                \n                # Check if the new position is within bounds\n                if 0 <= nx < 21 and 0 <= ny < 25:\n                    # If the new position hasn't been visited and the value is 0\n                    if (nx, ny) not in visited and grid[nx][ny] == 0:\n                        # Spread the value from the source\n                        transformed_grid[nx][ny] = grid[x][y]\n                        visited.add((nx, ny))\n                        queue.append((nx, ny))\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve expanding or propagating certain values (like 2s and 8s) to fill regions\n2. Values like 4 and 3 appear to be \"anchors\" that influence the spread of other values\n3. There's a pattern where certain values (like 2s) spread out from their positions to fill adjacent cells\n4. Values like 8 seem to be \"sources\" that influence the spread of 2s\n5. The output grid always has a specific structure with 21 rows and 25 columns\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Expands values like 2s and 8s to fill adjacent cells\n- Preserves the original values where they are\n- Ensures the output grid is always 21x25\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Ensure the grid is 21x25\n    if len(grid) != 21 or len(grid[0]) != 25:\n        raise ValueError(\"Input grid must be 21x25\")\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Create a queue for BFS\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    # Define the directions we can move (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    \n    # Find all source cells (values that need to influence others)\n    sources = []\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if grid[i][j] in [2, 8]:\n                sources.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Perform BFS from each source to spread values\n    for i, j in sources:\n        queue = deque()\n        queue.append((i, j))\n        visited = set()\n        visited.add((i, j))\n        \n        while queue:\n            x, y = queue.popleft()\n            \n            # Check all four directions\n            for dx, dy in directions:\n                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                \n                # Check if the new position is within bounds\n                if 0 <= nx < 21 and 0 <= ny < 25:\n                    # If the new position hasn't been visited and the value is 0\n                    if (nx, ny) not in visited and grid[nx][ny] == 0:\n                        # Spread the value from the source\n                        transformed_grid[nx][ny] = grid[x][y]\n                        visited.add((nx, ny))\n                        queue.append((nx, ny))\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
