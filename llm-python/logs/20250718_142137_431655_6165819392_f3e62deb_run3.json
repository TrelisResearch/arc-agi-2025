          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, the input and output grids have some changes. Let me look at each example to see what's happening.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some 8s in the third row, starting at column 2. The output moves those 8s to columns 7 and 8. Wait, looking at the output, the third row has 0s except for columns 7,8,9 which are 8s. Similarly, the fourth row in input has 8s in columns 2,4, and the output has 8s in columns 7,8,9? Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait Example 1's input is:\n\nRow 2 (third row) is 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8. So the 8s are shifted to the right. Similarly, row 3 (fourth row) in input is 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 8. So the 8s are moved to columns 7 and 9. Hmm, but how?\n\nLooking at the output, the 8s are moving to the right side. But in example 2, the input has 4s in the third row, columns 3-5. The output has those 4s in the 8th row, columns 3-5. Wait, no. Example 2's output has the 4s in row 7 (the 8th row?), but maybe that's not the case. Wait example 2's input is:\n\nRow 2 (third row) is 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. But in the output, the 4s are in row 7 (the 8th row?), but looking at example 2's output, the 4s are in row 7 (the 8th row?), but the output for example 2 shows that the 4s are in row 7 (the 8th row?), but maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nWait example 2's output is:\n\nRow 3 (third row) is all zeros. Then row 4 (fourth row) is all zeros. Then row 7 (the 8th row) is 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0. So the 4s are moved to the 8th row. So in example 1, the 8s are moved to the right side of the grid, but in example 2, the 4s are moved to the 8th row. Wait, but example 3's input has 8s in row 3 (fourth row?), and the output moves them to columns 7-9. So maybe the pattern is that any non-zero values in the input are moved to the right side of the grid, but in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are moved to the rightmost columns, but only in certain rows. Or perhaps the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only in certain positions.\n\nLooking at example 1, the input has 8s in rows 2 (third row?), but the output has them in the rightmost columns. But in example 2, the 4s are moved to the 8th row. Wait, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the rightmost columns, but only in certain rows. Or maybe the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but their positions are shifted in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only in certain rows. For example, in example 1, the 8s are in rows 2 and 3 (third and fourth rows) of the input. The output has them in the rightmost columns of those rows. But in example 2, the 4s are in row 2 (third row) of the input, but in the output, they are in row 7 (the 8th row). So that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only in certain positions. For example, in example 1, the 8s are in the middle of the grid, and in the output, they are moved to the right side. But in example 2, the 4s are in the middle of the grid and in the output, they are moved to the bottom.

For example, in example 1, the 8s in row 2 (third row) are moved to the rightmost columns. In example 2, the 4s are moved to the rightmost columns of row 7.

But how?\n\nLooking at example 3, the input has 8s in row 3 (fourth row) of the input, and the output moves them to the right side. So maybe the pattern is that any non-zero value in the input is moved to the rightmost columns of the grid, but only in certain rows. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only in the rows where they are in the middle. For example, in example 1, the 8s are in rows 2 and 3 of the input, and in the output, they are in the rightmost columns. But in example 2, the 4s are in row 2 of the input, and in the output, they are in row 7. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only in the rows where they are in the middle.

For example, in example 1, the 8s are moved to the rightmost columns. In example 2, the 4s are moved to the rightmost columns of row 7. But how?\n\nWait looking at example 2's input and output:\n\nInput row 2 (third row) is 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. But in the output, the 4s are in row 7 (the 8th row?), which is the 7th row. So that's not matching. So maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only in certain rows. For example, in example 2, the 4s are moved to the rightmost columns of row 7 (the 8th row?), but why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only in the rows where they are in the middle. For example, in example 1, the 8s are in the middle of the grid and are moved to the right. In example 2, the 4s are in the middle of the grid and are moved to the right. But in example 2's output, the 4s are in row 7 (the 8th row), but that's not the rightmost columns. Wait, in example 2's output, the 4s are in row 7 (the 8th row?), but the output for that row is 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0. So the 4s are in columns 3-5, which is the middle of the row. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look for a different pattern. Let's look at the test input. The test input has 4s in row 4 (fifth row?), columns 4-6. The output is supposed to be transformed. But since I don't have the output, maybe I can look for patterns in the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1 and 3, the input has 8s in the middle of the grid, and the output moves them to the right side. In example 2, the 4s are in the middle of the grid, but in the output, they are moved to the bottom. So maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but in different positions based on their original position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the rightmost columns, but only in certain rows. For example, in example 1, the 8s are in rows 2 and 3 (third and fourth rows) of the input. The output has them in the rightmost columns of those rows. In example 2, the 4s are in row 2 (third row) of the input, but in the output, they are in row 7 (the 8th row) of the output. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but their positions are shifted in a certain way.

But in example 2's output, the 4s are in the middle of the row. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's look at the outputs for all examples.\n\nIn example 1, the input has 8s in rows 2 and 3 (third and fourth rows) of the input. The output for those rows has the 8s in the rightmost columns. So the 8s are moved to the right side of the grid.\n\nIn example 2, the input has 4s in row 2 (third row), but the output has them in row 7 (the 8th row). So the 4s are moved to the bottom. But why?\n\nIn example 3, the input has 8s in row 3 (fourth row) of the input. The output has them in the rightmost columns of that row.\n\nIn example 4, the input has 6s in row 3 (fourth row) of the input. The output has them in the rightmost columns of that row.\n\nIn example 5, the input has 6s in row 4 (fifth row) of the input. The output has them in the rightmost columns of that row.\n\nIn example 6, the input has 8s in row 5 (sixth row) of the input. The output has them in the rightmost columns of that row.\n\nSo looking at examples 1, 3,4,5,6, the non-zero values are moved to the rightmost columns of the same row. But in example 2, the 4s are moved to row 7 (the 8th row). So that's different.\n\nWait example 2's input has 4s in row 2 (third row) of the input. The output has them in row 7 (the 8th row) of the output. So that's a different row. But in the other examples, the non-zero values are moved to the same row.\n\nSo why is example 2 different?\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output:\n\nInput:\nRow 2 (third row) is 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0.\n\nOutput:\nRow 7 (the 8th row) is 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0.\n\nSo the 4s are moved from row 2 to row 7. But in other examples, the non-zero values are moved to the same row.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in example 2, the 4s are in the middle of the grid and are moved to the bottom. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only if they are in the middle of the grid.

In example 2, the non-zero values are in row 2, and in the output, they are moved to row 7. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let me think of another approach.

For example, if the non-zero values are in row i, they are moved to row i + some value. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but their rows are shifted based on their original position. For example, in example 2, the 4s are in row 2, and in the output, they are moved to row 7, which is 5 rows below. But why?\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to think of the test input and see what the output should be. The test input has 4s in row 4 (fifth row?), columns 4-6. If the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the same row, then the output would have those 4s in columns 7-9 of row 4. But if the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the bottom, then they would be in row 9.\n\nBut since I don't have the output, I have to guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at examples 1,3,4,5,6, the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the same row. So maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the same row. But why is example 2 different?\n\nMaybe example 2 is a special case, but that's unlikely. Or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but their rows are shifted to the bottom. For example, in example 2, the 4s are moved to the bottom row. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, if they are in the middle of the grid, they are moved to the right side of the same row. If they are in the bottom, they are moved to the right side of the same row. But example 2's 4s are in the middle of the grid and are moved to the bottom.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the same row, and see if that works for the examples.\n\nLet's try to implement that. For each row, find the non-zero values and move them to the rightmost columns.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the input row 2 has 8s in columns 2-4. In the output, those 8s are moved to columns 7-9. So the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the same row.\n\nIn example 2, the input row 2 has 4s in columns 3-5. In the output, those 4s are moved to row 7, columns 3-5. So that would be moving them to the same row, but why is the output row 7?\n\nWait, but in example 2's output, the 4s are in row 7. So that's not the same row. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but their rows are shifted based on their original position. For example, if the non-zero values are in the middle of the grid, they are moved to the bottom row. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but their rows are shifted to the bottom. For example, in example 2, the 4s are in the middle of the grid and are moved to the bottom row. But in other examples, they are moved to the same row.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should proceed with the assumption that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the same row, and see if that works for most examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Collect all the non-zero values in that row.\n\n- Replace the row with zeros, then add the non-zero values to the end of the row.\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the input row 2 has 8s in columns 2-4. The output for that row has 8s in columns 7-9. So the non-zero values are moved to the end of the row. So for each row, the non-zero values are moved to the end of the row.\n\nSo for each row, we can collect the non-zero values and then set the row to all zeros, then add the non-zero values to the end.\n\nBut in example 2, the input row 2 has 4s in columns 3-5. The output for that row is all zeros, but the 4s are in row 7. So this approach would not work for example 2.\n\nBut maybe example 2 is an exception, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only if they are in certain rows. For example, if they are in rows 2-5, they are moved to the right side of the same row. But in example 2, the 4s are in row 2, which is part of that range, but they are moved to row 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the correct approach is to move the non-zero values to the right side of the same row, and see if that works for most examples.\n\nSo, for each row, we can collect all the non-zero values, then replace the row with zeros, then add the non-zero values to the end of the row.\n\nLet's test this with example 1:\n\nInput row 2 is [0, 0, 8, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The non-zero values are [8,8,8]. So the output row would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,8,8]. Which matches the example 1's output.\n\nExample 2's input row 2 is [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The non-zero values are [4,4,4]. So the output row would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the example 2's output has the 4s in row 7. So this approach would not work for example 2.\n\nBut maybe the example 2's output is different because of a different pattern. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only if they are in certain rows. For example, if they are in rows 2-5, they are moved to the right side of the same row. If they are in rows 6-9, they are moved to the right side of the same row. But in example 2, the 4s are in row 2, which is part of 2-5, but they are moved to row 7.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe the correct approach is to move the non-zero values to the right side of the same row, and see if that works for the examples, even if it doesn't for example 2.\n\nBut example 2's output is different. So perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only if they are in the middle of the grid. For example, in example 2, the 4s are in the middle of the grid and are moved to the right side of the same row, but the example shows them in a different row. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only if they are in the middle of the grid. For example, in example 2, the 4s are in the middle of the grid and are moved to the right side of the same row. But the example shows them in a different row. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to proceed with the assumption that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the same row, and see if that works for most examples. Even if it doesn't for example 2, maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Collect all non-zero values in that row.\n\n- Replace the row with all zeros.\n\n- Append the non-zero values to the end of the row.\n\nBut in example 2, this would result in the 4s being moved to the end of row 2, but the example shows them in row 7. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only if they are in certain rows. For example, in example 2, the 4s are moved to the bottom row. But why?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but their rows are shifted based on their original position. For example, if the non-zero values are in row i, they are moved to row i + some value. But I don't know what that value is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but their rows are shifted to the bottom. For example, in example 2, the 4s are in row 2 and are moved to row 7. So that's 5 rows below. But why?\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look at the examples again.\n\nExample 2's input has 4s in row 2 (third row), and the output has them in row 7 (the 8th row). So the row index increases by 5. But why?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the bottom of the grid, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, if they are in the middle of the grid, they are moved to the bottom. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but their rows are shifted to the bottom. For example, in example 2, the 4s are moved to the bottom row. But why?\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the assumption that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the same row, even if it doesn't work for example 2. Because that works for most examples, and maybe example 2 is a special case or there's a different pattern.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        non_zero = [x for x in row if x != 0]\n        # Create a new row with zeros, then append the non-zero values\n        new_row = [0]*10\n        new_row[-len(non_zero):] = non_zero\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut let's test this with example 2.\n\nExample 2's input row 2 is [0,0,0,4,4,4,0,0,0,0]. The non-zero values are [4,4,4]. The new_row would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output for example 2 has the 4s in row 7. So this code would not produce the correct output for example 2. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut the other examples work. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only if they are in certain rows. For example, if they are in rows 2-5, they are moved to the right side of the same row. If they are in rows 6-9, they are moved to the right side of the same row. But in example 2, the 4s are in row 2, which is part of 2-5, but the output has them in row 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but their rows are shifted based on their original position. For example, if the non-zero values are in row i, they are moved to row i + some value.\n\nBut without knowing the pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only in certain rows. For example, in example 2, the 4s are in row 2, and in the output, they are moved to row 7. So that's 5 rows below. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but their rows are shifted based on their original position. For example, if the non-zero values are in row i, they are moved to row i + (some value). But I don't know.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that works for most examples, even if it doesn't work for all. Given that examples 1,3,4,5,6 have the non-zero values moved to the right side of the same row, I'll proceed with that approach, and assume that example 2 is an exception or that I'm missing something.\n\nSo the code would be as above. Let's see what the test input would look like.\n\nTest input:\nRow 4 (fifth row) is 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0.\n\nUsing the code, the non-zero values are [4,4,4], and the new row would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4]. So the output would have the 4s in columns 7-9 of row 4.\n\nBut I don't know the correct output, so I can't be sure. But based on the examples, this seems like the most plausible pattern.\n\nSo the final code would be as above.\n"

Let me look at each example to see what's happening.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some 8s in the third row, starting at column 2. The output moves those 8s to columns 7 and 8. Wait, looking at the output, the third row has 0s except for columns 7,8,9 which are 8s. Similarly, the fourth row in input has 8s in columns 2,4, and the output has 8s in columns 7,8,9? Wait, no. Let me check again.\n\nWait Example 1's input is:\n\nRow 2 (third row) is 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8. So the 8s are shifted to the right. Similarly, row 3 (fourth row) in input is 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 8. So the 8s are moved to columns 7 and 9. Hmm, but how?\n\nLooking at the output, the 8s are moving to the right side. But in example 2, the input has 4s in the third row, columns 3-5. The output has those 4s in the 8th row, columns 3-5. Wait, no. Example 2's output has the 4s in row 7 (the 8th row?), but maybe that's not the case. Wait example 2's input is:\n\nRow 2 (third row) is 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.

That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to look for a different pattern. Let's look at the test input. The test input has 4s in row 4 (fifth row?), columns 4-6. The output is supposed to be transformed. But since I don't have the output, maybe I can look for patterns in the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1 and 3, the input has 8s in the middle of the grid, and the output moves them to the right side. In example 2, the 4s are in the middle of the grid, but in the output, they are moved to the bottom. So maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but in different positions based on their original position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the rightmost columns, but only in certain rows. For example, in example 1, the 8s are in rows 2 and 3 (third and fourth rows) of the input. The output has them in the rightmost columns of those rows. In example 2, the 4s are in row 2 (third row) of the input, but in the output, they are in row 7 (the 8th row) of the output. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but their positions are shifted in a certain way. For example, in example 1, the 8s are in the middle of the grid and are moved to the right. In example 2, the 4s are in the middle of the grid and are moved to the bottom. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only in certain rows.

But in example 2's output, the 4s are in the middle of the row. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's look at the outputs for all examples.\n\nIn example 1, the input has 8s in rows 2 and 3 (third and fourth rows) of the input. The output for those rows has the 8s in the rightmost columns. So the 8s are moved to the right side of the grid.\n\nIn example 2, the input has 4s in row 2 (third row), but the output has them in row 7 (the 8th row). So the 4s are moved to the bottom. But why?\n\nIn example 3, the input has 8s in row 3 (fourth row) of the input. The output has them in the rightmost columns of that row.\n\nIn example 4, the input has 6s in row 3 (fourth row) of the input. The output has them in the rightmost columns of that row.\n\nIn example 5, the input has 6s in row 4 (fifth row) of the input. The output has them in the rightmost columns of that row.\n\nIn example 6, the input has 8s in row 5 (sixth row) of the input. The output has them in the rightmost columns of that row.\n\nSo looking at examples 1, 3,4,5,6, the non-zero values are moved to the rightmost columns of the same row. But in example 2, the 4s are moved to row 7 (the 8th row). So that's different.\n\nWait example 2's input has 4s in row 2 (third row) of the input. The output has them in row 7 (the 8th row) of the output. So that's a different row. But in the other examples, the non-zero values are moved to the same row.\n\nSo why is example 2 different?\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output:\n\nInput:\nRow 2 (third row) is 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0.\n\nOutput:\nRow 7 (the 8th row) is 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0.\n\nSo the 4s are moved from row 2 to row 7. But in other examples, the non-zero values are moved to the same row.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only if they are in certain positions.

The non-zero values are [4,4,4]. The new_row would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0], but the output for example 2 has the 4s in row 7. So this code would not produce the correct output for example 2. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut the other examples work. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only if they are in certain rows. For example, if they are in rows 2-5, they are moved to the right side of the same row. If they are in rows 6-9, they are moved to the right side of the same row. But in example 2, the 4s are in row 2, which is part of 2-5, but the output has them in row 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but their rows are shifted based on their original position. For example, if the non-zero values are in row i, they are moved to row i + some value.\n\nBut without knowing the pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but only in certain rows. For example, in example 2, the 4s are in row 2, and in the output, they are moved to row 7. So that's 5 rows below. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the non-zero values are moved to the right side of the grid, but their rows are shifted based on their original position. For example, if the non-zero values are in row i, they are moved to row i + (some value). But I don't know.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that works for most examples, even if it doesn't work for all. Given that examples 1,3,4,5,6 have the non-zero values moved to the right side of the same row, I'll proceed with that approach, and assume that example 2 is an exception or that I'm missing something.\n\nSo the code would be as above. Let's see what the test input would look like.\n\nTest input:\nRow 4 (fifth row) is 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0.\n\nUsing the code, the non-zero values are [4,4,4], and the new row would be [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,4,4,4]. So the output would have the 4s in columns 7-9 of row 4.\n\nBut I don't know the correct output, so I can't be sure. But based on the examples, this seems like the most plausible pattern.\n\nSo the final code would be as above.\n"
