          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a row of 1s in the fifth row. The output has the same row of 1s. But looking at other rows, like the third row of the input is all zeros except for a 2 in the fifth column. In the output, that row has a 3 in the fifth column. Wait, maybe there's some kind of transformation based on the position or some pattern in the grid.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has some 8s and 1s. The output seems to have some 8s and 1s but with some changes. For instance, in the third row of input, there's an 8 in column 9 and 10. The output has 8s in columns 3 and 4, but maybe that's a reflection or some kind of mirroring?\n\nWait, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the input has 2s and 3s in certain positions. The output has 3s and 2s in different positions. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are transformed based on their location.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers with others based on their surrounding cells. For example, in Example 3, there's a row of 1s in the ninth row, and in the output, that row remains the same. But other rows have numbers that change. For instance, the input has a row with 5,6,6,5 in the 11th row, and the output has 6,5,5,6. So maybe that's a reversal or some kind of mirroring.\n\nLooking at Example 2 again, the third row of input has 8s in columns 9 and 10, and the output has 8s in columns 3 and 4. Wait, maybe the positions are mirrored? Like, the original positions are mirrored across the vertical axis. For example, in the third row of Example 2, the input has 8s in column 9 and 10. The output has 8s in columns 3 and 4. But that's a bit confusing because the grid is 12x9. Wait, the input is 12 rows and 9 columns? Wait, the test input is 12 rows and 15 columns? Wait, no, the test input is given as 12 rows, each with 15 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 12x9. Wait, maybe the input is 12x9, and the output is 12x9. But the test input is 12 rows with 15 elements. Wait, maybe the test input is part of a different problem, but the training examples have 12 rows and 9 columns. Let me check the examples again.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: each row is 9 elements. The output is also 9 elements. So the input and output are 12x9 grids. So the test input must be 12 rows, each with 15 elements? Wait, but the problem says that the output must be 12x9. So perhaps the test input is a 12x15 grid, but the output is 12x9. But that's not part of the training examples. So maybe the test input is part of a different problem, but the task is to process the input grid (which is 12x9) into a 12x9 output grid.\n\nSo back to the training examples. Let me look at Example 1 again. The input has a row with 0s except for a 2 in column 4 and 6. The output has 3s in those positions. Wait, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on some pattern. For example, in the first row of input, there are 0s except for 2s in columns 4 and 6. The output has 3s in those positions. But in the second row of input, there's a 2 in column 3 and 5, and the output has 3 in column 3 and 2 in column 5? Or maybe not. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 1's input row 1: 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 \u2192 output row 1: 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0. So the 2s are replaced with 3s. Then in row 2 of input: 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 0 0 3 2 3 3 0 0 0. So the 2 in column 3 is replaced with 3, and the 3 in column 4 is replaced with 2? That seems inconsistent. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are transformed based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the fifth row is all 1s, which remains the same. But other rows have changes. Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced with others based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a different value.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has 1s in certain positions, and the output has 1s in the same positions. But there are also 8s and 4s in the input, which are transformed into 8s and 4s in the output. For example, in the third row of input, there's an 8 in column 9 and 10. The output has 8s in columns 3 and 4. That seems like a mirrored position. Wait, maybe the columns are mirrored. For example, in the third row of input, the 8 is in column 9 and 10. The output has 8s in columns 3 and 4. But that's not possible if the grid is 9 columns. Wait, the input is 9 columns. So columns are 0-8. So for example, column 8 is the last column. So maybe the transformation is that certain positions are mirrored across the vertical axis. For example, column i is mirrored to column (8 - i). But in Example 2, the third row has an 8 in column 8 (assuming 0-based index) and maybe another position. Let me check the input and output.\n\nWait, the input for Example 2 is 12 rows, each with 12 elements? Wait, the input for Example 2 is written as:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 8 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n... and so on.\n\nSo each row is 12 elements. But according to the problem statement, the input and output grids are 12x9. Wait, this is confusing. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 12x9. But in the training examples, the input for Example 2 has 12 elements per row. That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps the examples are not in the correct format. Maybe the input for Example 2 is actually 12 rows of 9 elements. But the way it's written, the input for Example 2 is 12 rows, each with 12 elements. That's a problem. Wait, maybe the examples are written with some formatting issues. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nEach line is 9 elements. So that's 12 rows of 9 columns. The output is also 12 rows of 9 columns. So the input and output are 12x9 grids.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input is written as:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 8 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nEach line has 12 elements. But that would be 12 columns. But according to the problem statement, the output must be 12x9. So there's a contradiction here. Wait, maybe the examples are not written correctly, or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem description. Alternatively, perhaps the test input is 12x15, but the output is 12x9. But that's not part of the training examples. Maybe the training examples have different dimensions. But according to the problem statement, the output must be 12x9. So the input for the training examples must be 12x9. Therefore, the input for Example 2 must be 12 rows of 9 elements. But the way it's written seems to have 12 elements per row. That's confusing. Maybe there's a formatting error. Alternatively, maybe the input for Example 2 is 12 rows of 9 elements, but the way it's written is with some extra elements. For example, perhaps the input for Example 2 is 12 rows of 9 elements, but when written, they are separated into 12 elements per row, but that's not possible. This is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are written with some formatting issues. For example, maybe the input for Example 2 is 12 rows of 9 elements, but the way it's written has 12 elements per row. That would be impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a mistake. However, the test input is given as 12 rows with 15 elements each. So the test input is 12x15, but the output is 12x9. Therefore, the transformation is from 12x15 to 12x9. But the training examples have inputs that are 12x9. Therefore, perhaps the training examples are not in the same format as the test input. But that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the input for the training examples is 12x9. So in Example 2, the input has 12 rows of 9 elements. But the way it's written seems to have 12 elements per row. That's a problem. Maybe the input for Example 2 is 12 rows of 9 elements, and the way it's written is with some formatting issues. For example, maybe the input for Example 2 is:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 9 elements.\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 9 elements.\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 \u2192 9 elements.\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 9 elements.\nBut then the next rows would have 9 elements. But in the given input for Example 2, the rows have more elements. This is confusing. Maybe the problem is that the examples are written with some formatting issues, and I need to focus on the patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input for the training examples is 12x9, and the output is 12x9. So the input for Example 2 is 12 rows of 9 elements. Let's assume that for the purpose of solving the problem.\n\nSo, going back to the training examples. Let me try to find patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nThe input has a row with 0s except for 2s in columns 3 and 5 (assuming 0-based index). The output has 3s in those positions. Then in the second row of input, there's a 2 in column 2, and a 3 in column 3. The output has 3 in column 2 and 2 in column 3. Wait, that seems like a swap. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a different number. For instance, in the fifth row of Example 1, all cells are 1s, and they remain the same. So that's a fixed row.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 1s in certain positions. The output has the same 1s. But there are 8s and 4s in the input. In the third row of input, there's an 8 in column 8 (assuming 0-based index), and in the output, there's an 8 in column 3. So maybe there's a mirroring across the vertical axis. For example, column i is mirrored to column (8 - i). Let's check:\n\nIn the third row of input for Example 2, the 8 is in column 8 (assuming 0-based index). The mirrored position would be column 0 (since 8 - 8 = 0). But the output has an 8 in column 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's mirrored across the vertical axis, but in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe certain positions are transformed based on their position in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 2s in positions 3 and 5 (assuming 0-based). The output has 3s in those positions. Then in the second row, there's a 2 in column 2 and a 3 in column 3. The output has 3 in column 2 and 2 in column 3. So it seems like swapping 2 and 3 in certain positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are replaced based on their value. For example, if a cell has a 2, it becomes 3 if it's in a certain row or column. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput has a row with 5,6,6,5 in the 11th row. The output has 6,5,5,6 in that row. So it's a reversal of the numbers. Similarly, in the 12th row of input, there's 6,0,0,6. The output has 5,0,0,5. So again, a reversal of the numbers. Also, in the 9th row of input, there's 1s, which remain the same. So maybe the transformation is that certain rows have their numbers reversed. Or maybe the numbers are replaced based on their position in the row.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the input has a row with 5,6,6,5 in columns 10-13 (assuming 0-based), but the output has 6,5,5,6. So the numbers are reversed. So perhaps the transformation is that certain rows have their values reversed. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain positions are replaced with other numbers based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row, it's replaced with a different number. For example, the fifth row in Example 1 is all 1s, which remain the same. But other rows have changes.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the first row, it's replaced with a certain value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are replaced based on their value and their position. For example, in Example 1, the 2s in certain positions are replaced with 3s. But why?\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the third row has 8s in columns 3 and 4. The input for that row has 8s in columns 8 and 9. Wait, but if the grid is 9 columns, then columns are 0-8. So if the input has 8 in column 8 (the last column), then the output has 8 in column 3. That seems like a mirroring across the vertical axis. For example, column i is mapped to column (8 - i). Let's check:\n\nFor column 8: 8 - 8 = 0. So the mirrored column would be 0. But in the output, the 8 is in column 3. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's mirrored across the vertical axis, but in a different way. For example, if the input has a value in column i, it's replaced with the value from column (8 - i). But in Example 2, the third row of input has an 8 in column 8 (the last column), and the output has an 8 in column 3. So 8 - i = 3 \u2192 i = 5. So that would mean that the original column is 5. But in the input, the 8 is in column 8. So that doesn't fit. Maybe the transformation is not a simple mirroring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain positions are replaced based on their row. For example, in Example 1, the first two rows have 2s and 3s, which are transformed into 3s and 2s. Maybe the transformation is swapping 2 and 3 in certain positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain positions are replaced with a value based on their row and column. For example, if a cell is in row i and column j, then the value is transformed based on some formula. But without more examples, it's hard to find a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 3 again. The input has a row with 5,6,6,5 in columns 10-13 (assuming 0-based index, but the grid is 9 columns). Wait, that's not possible. So perhaps the input is 12 rows of 9 columns. So for example, in the 11th row of input (assuming 0-based, row 10), the input is 0 0 5 6 6 5 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 6 5 5 6 0 0 0. So the numbers are reversed. So the first and last elements are swapped, and the middle elements are swapped. So the entire row is reversed. But why?\n\nIn the 12th row of input, the input is 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0. So the numbers are changed from 6 to 5. But why?\n\nIn the 9th row of input, the input is 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1. The output is the same. So that row remains unchanged.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that certain rows are reversed, and others are changed based on their values. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain rows have their values replaced based on their position. For example, rows 0-3 are transformed in a certain way, rows 4-6 are unchanged, and rows 7-11 are transformed in another way. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the input has a row with 5,6,6,5 in columns 2-5 (assuming 0-based index), and the output has 6,5,5,6. So the values are reversed. Similarly, in the 12th row of input, the values are 6,6,6,6 and become 5,5,5,5. So maybe the transformation is that certain rows are reversed and the values are replaced based on some rule.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are affected? Maybe the rows that are not all 1s are reversed, and then their values are replaced with certain numbers. For example, in the 11th row of input, the values are 5,6,6,5. After reversing, it's 5,6,6,5. But the output is 6,5,5,6. So that's not a simple reversal. Wait, the original row is 0 0 5 6 6 5 0 0 0. After reversing, it would be 0 0 0 5 6 6 5 0 0. But the output is 0 0 6 5 5 6 0 0 0. So that's not the same. So maybe the reversal is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain positions are replaced based on their value and their position. For example, in the 11th row of input, the 5s are replaced with 6s and the 6s are replaced with 5s. But why?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the test input. The test input is 12 rows, each with 15 elements. But the output must be 12x9. So the transformation for the test input is to reduce the number of columns from 15 to 9. But how?\n\nBut the training examples have 12x9 inputs and outputs. So the test input is different. But the problem says that the test input is shown for context. So the test input is 12 rows of 15 elements, and the output is 12x9. So the transformation is to process a 12x15 grid into a 12x9 grid. But the training examples are 12x9 inputs and outputs. So perhaps the transformation is different for different inputs. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain columns are selected or transformed based on their position. For example, in the test input, the first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. But the output must be 12x9. So the test input is 12x15, and the output is 12x9. So the transformation must take the input and produce a 12x9 grid. But how?\n\nBut the training examples have 12x9 inputs and outputs. So the transformation for the training examples is to take a 12x9 grid and produce a 12x9 grid. The test input is 12x15, and the output is 12x9. So the transformation for the test input is different.\n\nBut the problem says that the function must take a 2D list (grid) and return a 12x9 grid. So the function must work for both training examples and the test input. But how?\n\nThis is getting very confusing. Let's try to focus on the training examples and find a pattern that can be applied to them.\n\nLooking back at Example 1:\n\nThe input has a row with 0s except for 2s in columns 3 and 5. The output has 3s in those positions. Then in the second row, the 2 in column 2 is replaced with 3, and the 3 in column 3 is replaced with 2. So it's like swapping 2 and 3 in certain positions.\n\nIn the third row of input, there's a 2 in column 4. The output has a 3 in column 4. So maybe the transformation is that certain positions are replaced with a value based on their row.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother observation: the fifth row in all examples has 1s, and it remains the same. So that's a fixed row.\n\nIn Example 2, the third row of input has 8s in columns 8 and 9 (assuming 0-based), but the output has 8s in columns 3 and 4. So maybe the columns are mirrored. For example, column i is mapped to column (8 - i). Let's see:\n\nFor column 8, 8 - 8 = 0. So the mirrored column would be 0. But in the output, it's in column 3. That doesn't fit. So maybe it's not a simple mirroring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different pattern. For example, in Example 2, the third row of input has 8s in columns 8 and 9 (assuming 0-based), but the output has 8s in columns 3 and 4. That's a shift of 5 positions. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the values are replaced based on their position. For example, in the first two rows of Example 1, the values are replaced with 3s and 2s. But why?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that the value in a cell is replaced with a value that depends on the row and column. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, then the new value is some function of i and j.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother idea: looking at Example 3, the input has a row with 5,6,6,5 in columns 2-5 (assuming 0-based), and the output has 6,5,5,6. So the values are swapped. So maybe the transformation is that certain rows have their values swapped. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain rows are transformed based on their position. For example, rows 0-3 have certain transformations, rows 4-6 are unchanged, and rows 7-11 have other transformations.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their value and their position. For example, if a cell has a 2 in a certain row, it becomes 3, and if it has a 3 in that row, it becomes 2. But why?\n\nIn Example 1, the first row has 2s replaced with 3s. The second row has 2 and 3 swapped. The third row has 2 replaced with 3. The fourth row is all zeros. The fifth row is all 1s. The sixth row is all zeros. The seventh row is all zeros. And so on.\n\nThis suggests that there's a pattern where certain rows have their values transformed, but it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are replaced based on their position. For example, in the first two rows, the values are transformed into 3 and 2, but why?\n\nThis is very challenging. Given the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLet me try to think of possible transformations:\n\n1. Reversing certain rows.\n2. Replacing certain values based on their position.\n3. Mirroring certain columns.\n4. Replacing values based on their row or column.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a row with 5,6,6,5 and the output has 6,5,5,6. This suggests that the values are reversed. So maybe the transformation is to reverse the values in certain rows. But how to determine which rows?\n\nIn Example 1, the first two rows have their values transformed. For example, the first row has 2s replaced with 3s. The second row has 2 and 3 swapped. This doesn't fit a simple reversal.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for row 2 has 3 in column 2 and 2 in column 3. This suggests that the values are swapped between certain columns. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value in a cell is replaced with a value based on its row and column. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, then the new value is some function of i and j.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. In Example 1, the output has 3s in positions where the input had 2s. In Example 2, the output has 8s in positions where the input had 8s. But in some cases, the values change. For example, in Example 2, the third row of input has 8 in column 8 (assuming 0-based), and the output has 8 in column 3. This suggests that the column is mirrored. Let's check:\n\nIf the input column is i, then the output column is (8 - i). For example, in the third row of Example 2, the input has 8 in column 8. The output has 8 in column 3. 8 - 8 = 0, but the output is in column 3. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's mirrored across the middle of the grid. For example, the middle column is 4 (since 9 columns, 0-based 0-8, middle is 4). So for column i, the mirrored column is 8 - i. For example, column 0 \u2192 8, column 1 \u2192 7, column 2 \u2192 6, column 3 \u2192 5, column 4 \u2192 4.\n\nSo for the third row of Example 2, the input has an 8 in column 8 (which is mirrored to column 0). But the output has 8 in column 3. That doesn't fit. Unless there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the values are replaced with their mirrored values. For example, in Example 2, the third row has 8 in column 8 and 9 (but that's not possible in 9 columns). So this is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in Example 3, the input has a row with 5,6,6,5 in columns 2-5. The output has 6,5,5,6. So the values are reversed. So maybe the transformation is to reverse the row. But in Example 1, the first row has 2s in columns 3 and 5. The output has 3s in those positions, but not reversed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain rows are reversed, and others are not. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAnother idea: in Example 3, the input has a row with 5,6,6,5 in columns 2-5. The output has 6,5,5,6. So it's a reversal of the values. So maybe the transformation is to reverse the values in certain rows. For example, rows that have certain patterns are reversed.\n\nBut how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for rows where the value is not all 1s, the row is reversed and the values are replaced based on some rule. For example, in the 11th row of Example 3, the values are 5,6,6,5. After reversing, it becomes 5,6,6,5. But the output is 6,5,5,6. So that's not a simple reversal. But if the values are replaced with their opposites, like 5 becomes 6 and 6 becomes 5. So perhaps the transformation is to reverse the row and then swap 5 and 6.\n\nBut this is getting too specific.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make a hypothesis. Let's assume that the transformation involves reversing certain rows and swapping certain values.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for row 2 is 0 0 3 2 3 3 0 0 0. The input for row 2 is 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0. So the 2 in column 2 is replaced with 3, and the 3 in column 3 is replaced with 2. This suggests that the values are swapped between certain positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the values are replaced with their opposite values. For example, 2 becomes 3 and 3 becomes 2.\n\nBut why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the values are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the first two rows, then 2 becomes 3, and 3 becomes 2.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns are affected.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that for certain rows, the values are replaced with a value based on their row and column. For example, if the cell is in row 0, then the value is replaced with 3 if it's a 2, and 2 if it's a 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll try to write a function that for each row, if the row is not all 1s, it reverses the row and replaces certain values.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that certain values are replaced based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are replaced with 3s in certain rows. In Example 2, the 8s are replaced with 8s in certain positions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output of the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has 3s where the input had 2s, and 2s where the input had 3s. This suggests that the values are swapped between 2 and 3 in certain rows.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 8s in certain positions. So maybe the values are not changed in some cases.\n\nIn Example 3, the values are swapped between 5 and 6 in certain rows.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is that certain values are swapped based on their position in the grid.\n\nBut how to determine which values and which positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the values are swapped between 2 and 3, and for other rows, between 5 and 6.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that for rows 0-3, the values are replaced with certain values, and for other rows, it's different.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll have to make a hypothesis based on the examples.\n\nLet me try to write a function that for each row, if the row is not all 1s, then it reverses the row and replaces certain values. For example, in Example 1, the first two rows are not all 1s, and their values are reversed and some values are swapped.\n\nBut this is not concrete.\n\nAlternatively, the function could check if the row is in a certain range and apply transformations.\n\nAlternatively, the function could replace certain values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in row 0, then replace 2 with 3. If it's in row 1, replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that for each row, if it's not all 1s, it reverses the row and replaces 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. This might not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input has a row with 5,6,6,5, which is not all 1s. The output has 6,5,5,6. So this suggests that the row is reversed and the values are swapped between 5 and 6.\n\nSo perhaps the function is to reverse the row and swap values based on their original value.\n\nBut how to determine which values to swap.\n\nAlternatively, the function could reverse the row and then replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2, and replace 5 with 6 and 6 with 5.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, the function could check if the row is in a certain range and apply transformations.\n\nBut given the time, I'll try to write a function that for each row, if the row is not all 1s, it reverses the row and replaces 2 with 3 and 3 with 2, and replaces 5 with 6 and 6 with 5.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the function could check if the row is in the first two rows and apply certain transformations.\n\nBut this is not reliable.\n\nAlternatively, the function could replace certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, if the column is even, replace 2 with 3, and if it's odd, replace 3 with 2.\n\nBut this is also a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that for each row, if it's not all 1s, it reverses the row and replaces 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. This might not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut in Example 1, the first row is 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. Reversing it gives 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 \u2192 same as original. But the output is 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0. So this suggests that the values are replaced with 3s.\n\nSo maybe the function is to replace 2 with 3 in certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, the function could replace 2 with 3 in rows 0-3, and 3 with 2 in rows 4-6, and so on.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll have to proceed with a function that replaces 2 with 3 and 3 with 2 in certain rows, and reverses the row in others. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the function could replace 2 with 3 in the first two rows, and 3 with 2 in the second row, and so on.\n\nBut this is not reliable.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that for each row, if it's not all 1s, it replaces 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. This might not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input has 5 and 6 in certain rows, which are replaced with 6 and 5. So the function should also handle those.\n\nSo, perhaps the function is to replace 2 with 3, 3 with 2, 5 with 6, and 6 with 5, in certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, the function could check if the row is in the first two rows and apply the 2-3 swap, and for other rows, apply 5-6 swap.\n\nBut this is not reliable.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that for each cell, if the value is 2, replace with 3, if it's 3, replace with 2, if it's 5, replace with 6, and if it's 6, replace with 5. This might not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 3s where the input had 2s, and 2s where the input had 3s. So this would work for that.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 8s and 4s, but the output has 8s and 4s. So this function would not change those values. But in the third row of Example 2, the input has 8s and the output has 8s. So this suggests that the function is not applicable to those values.\n\nSo this approach might not work for all cases.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 2 with 3 and 3 with 2, and 5 with 6 and 6 with 5, and leaves other values unchanged. This might not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to apply this.\n\nAlternatively, the function could apply this transformation to all rows, but this might not work for all examples.\n\nIn Example 1, this would work for the first two rows. For the third row, the input has 2 in column 4, which would be replaced with 3. The output has 3 in that position. So this would work.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 5 and 6 in certain rows, which would be replaced with 6 and 5. This would work for the 11th row.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input has 8s, which are not replaced, so this would work.\n\nSo this function might work for the examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 2:\n                new_row.append(3)\n            elif val == 3:\n                new_row.append(2)\n            elif val == 5:\n                new_row.append(6)\n            elif val == 6:\n                new_row.append(5)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not handle the example where the third row of Example 2 has 8s in columns 8 and 9 (but in 9 columns, it's column 8). The output has 8s in column 3. So this function would not change the 8s, but the output has 8s in column 3. So this suggests that the function is not correct.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input has 8s in columns 8 and 9 (but that's not possible in 9 columns). So perhaps this function is not correct.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this function and see.\n\nHowever, this function would not handle the mirroring in Example 2. So it's not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to reverse the row if it's not all 1s, and then replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2, and 5 with 6 and 6 with 5.\n\nSo for each row, if it's not all 1s, reverse it and apply the value swaps.\n\nBut in Example 1, the first row is 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. Reversing it gives 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. Then replacing 2 with 3 gives 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0, which matches the output.\n\nFor the second row of Example 1: 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0. Reversing gives 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0. Then replacing 2 with 3 and 3 with 2 gives 0 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0, but the output is 0 0 3 2 3 3 0 0 0. So this doesn't match.\n\nSo this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to replace 2 with 3 in certain positions, and 3 with 2 in others, based on their row.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the function that replaces 2 with 3 and 3 with 2, and 5 with 6 and 6 with 5, and leaves others unchanged. This might not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n"

Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a row of 1s in the fifth row. The output has the same row of 1s. But looking at other rows, like the third row of the input is all zeros except for a 2 in the fifth column. In the output, that row has a 3 in the fifth column. Wait, maybe there's some kind of transformation based on the position or some pattern in the grid.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has some 8s and 1s. The output seems to have some 8s and 1s but with some changes. For instance, in the third row of input, there's an 8 in column 9 and 10. The output has 8s in columns 3 and 4, but maybe that's a reflection or some kind of mirroring?\n\nWait, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the input has 2s and 3s in certain positions. The output has 3s and 2s in different positions. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are transformed based on their location.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers with others based on their surrounding cells. For example, in Example 3, there's a row of 1s in the ninth row, and in the output, that row remains the same. But other rows have numbers that change. For instance, the input has a row with 5,6,6,5 in the 11th row, and the output has 6,5,5,6. So maybe that's a reversal or some kind of mirroring.\n\nLooking at Example 2 again, the third row of input has 8s in columns 9 and 10, and the output has 8s in columns 3 and 4. Wait, maybe the positions are mirrored? Like, the original positions are mirrored across the vertical axis. For example, in the third row of Example 2, the input has 8s in column 9 and 10. The output has 8s in columns 3 and 4. But that's a bit confusing because the grid is 12x9. Wait, the input is 12 rows and 9 columns? Wait, the test input is 12 rows and 15 columns? Wait, no, the test input is given as 12 rows, each with 15 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 12x9. Wait, maybe the input is 12x9, and the output is 12x9. But the test input is 12 rows with 15 elements. Wait, maybe the test input is part of a different problem, but the training examples have 12 rows and 9 columns. Let me check the examples again.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input: each row is 9 elements. The output is also 9 elements. So the input and output are 12x9 grids. So the test input must be 12 rows, each with 15 elements? Wait, but the problem says that the output must be 12x9. So perhaps the test input is a 12x15 grid, but the output is 12x9. But that's not part of the training examples. So maybe the test input is part of a different problem, but the task is to process the input grid (which is 12x9) into a 12x9 output grid.\n\nSo back to the training examples. Let me look at Example 1 again. The input has a row with 0s except for a 2 in column 4 and 6. The output has 3s in those positions. Wait, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on some pattern. For example, in the first row of input, there are 0s except for 2s in columns 4 and 6. The output has 3s in those positions. But in the second row of input, there's a 2 in column 3 and 5, and the output has 3 in column 3 and 2 in column 5? Or maybe not. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 1's input row 1: 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 \u2192 output row 1: 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0. So the 2s are replaced with 3s. Then in row 2 of input: 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 0 0 3 2 3 3 0 0 0. So the 2 in column 3 is replaced with 3, and the 3 in column 4 is replaced with 2? That seems inconsistent. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are transformed based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the fifth row is all 1s, which remains the same. But other rows have changes. Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced with others based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a different value.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has 1s in certain positions, and the output has 1s in the same positions. But there are also 8s and 4s in the input, which are transformed into 8s and 4s in the output. For example, in the third row of input, there's an 8 in column 9 and 10. The output has 8s in columns 3 and 4. That seems like a mirrored position. Wait, maybe the columns are mirrored. For example, in the third row of input, the 8 is in column 9 and 10. The output has 8s in columns 3 and 4. But that's not possible if the grid is 9 columns. Wait, the input is 9 columns. So columns are 0-8. So for example, column 8 is the last column. So maybe the transformation is that certain positions are mirrored across the vertical axis. For example, column i is mirrored to column (8 - i). But in Example 2, the third row has an 8 in column 8 (assuming 0-based index) and maybe another position. Let me check the input and output.\n\nWait, the input for Example 2 is 12 rows, each with 12 elements? Wait, the input for Example 2 is written as:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 8 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n... and so on.\n\nSo each row is 12 elements. But according to the problem statement, the input and output grids are 12x9. Wait, this is confusing. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 12x9. But in the training examples, the input for Example 2 has 12 elements per row. That's conflicting. Wait, perhaps the examples are not in the correct format. Maybe the input for Example 2 is actually 12 rows of 9 elements. But the way it's written, the input for Example 2 is 12 rows, each with 12 elements. That's a problem. Wait, maybe the examples are written with some formatting issues. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nEach line is 9 elements. So that's 12 rows of 9 columns. The output is also 12 rows of 9 columns. So the input and output are 12x9 grids.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input is written as:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 8 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 8 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nEach line has 12 elements. But that would be 12 columns. But according to the problem statement, the output must be 12x9. So there's a contradiction here. Wait, maybe the examples are not written correctly, or perhaps there's a mistake in the problem description. Alternatively, perhaps the test input is 12x15, but the output is 12x9. But that's not part of the training examples. Maybe the training examples have different dimensions. But according to the problem statement, the output must be 12x9. So the input for the training examples must be 12x9. Therefore, the input for Example 2 must be 12 rows of 9 elements. But the way it's written seems to have 12 elements per row. That's confusing. Maybe there's a formatting error. Alternatively, maybe the input for Example 2 is 12 rows of 9 elements, but the way it's written is with some extra elements. For example, perhaps the input for Example 2 is 12 rows of 9 elements, but when written, they are separated into 12 elements per row, but that's not possible. This is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are written with some formatting issues. For example, maybe the input for Example 2 is 12 rows of 9 elements, but the way it's written has 12 elements per row. That would be impossible. Therefore, perhaps the problem has a mistake. However, the test input is given as 12 rows with 15 elements each. So the test input is 12x15, but the output is 12x9. Therefore, the transformation is from 12x15 to 12x9. But the training examples have inputs that are 12x9. Therefore, perhaps the training examples are not in the same format as the test input. But that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the input for the training examples is 12x9. So in Example 2, the input has 12 rows of 9 elements. But the way it's written seems to have 12 elements per row. That's a problem. Maybe the input for Example 2 is 12 rows of 9 elements, and the way it's written is with some formatting issues. For example, maybe the input for Example 2 is:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 9 elements.\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 9 elements.\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 \u2192 9 elements.\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 \u2192 9 elements.\nBut then the next rows would have 9 elements. But in the given input for Example 2, the rows have more elements. This is confusing. Maybe the problem is that the examples are written with some formatting issues, and I need to focus on the patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input for the training examples is 12x9, and the output is 12x9. So the input for Example 2 is 12 rows of 9 elements. Let's assume that for the purpose of solving the problem.\n\nSo, going back to the training examples. Let me try to find patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nThe input has a row with 0s except for 2s in columns 3 and 5 (assuming 0-based index). The output has 3s in those positions. Then in the second row of input, there's a 2 in column 2, and a 3 in column 3. The output has 3 in column 2 and 2 in column 3. Wait, that seems like a swap. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a different number. For instance, in the fifth row of Example 1, all cells are 1s, and they remain the same. So that's a fixed row.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 1s in certain positions. The output has the same 1s. But there are 8s and 4s in the input. In the third row of input, there's an 8 in column 8 (assuming 0-based index), and in the output, there's an 8 in column 3. So maybe there's a mirroring across the vertical axis. For example, column i is mirrored to column (8 - i). Let's check:\n\nIn the third row of input for Example 2, the 8 is in column 8 (assuming 0-based index). The mirrored position would be column 0 (since 8 - 8 = 0). But the output has an 8 in column 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's mirrored across the vertical axis, but in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe certain positions are transformed based on their position in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 2s in positions 3 and 5 (assuming 0-based). The output has 3s in those positions. Then in the second row, there's a 2 in column 2 and a 3 in column 3. The output has 3 in column 2 and 2 in column 3. So it seems like swapping 2 and 3 in certain positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are replaced based on their value. For example, if a cell has a 2, it becomes 3 if it's in a certain row or column. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput has a row with 5,6,6,5 in the 11th row. The output has 6,5,5,6 in that row. So it's a reversal of the numbers. Similarly, in the 12th row of input, there's 6,0,0,6. The output has 5,0,0,5. So again, a reversal of the numbers. Also, in the 9th row of input, there's 1s, which remain the same. So maybe the transformation is that certain rows have their numbers reversed. Or maybe the numbers are replaced based on their position in the row.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the input has a row with 5,6,6,5 in columns 10-13 (assuming 0-based), but the output has 6,5,5,6. So the numbers are reversed. So perhaps the transformation is that certain rows have their values reversed. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain positions are replaced with other numbers based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row, it's replaced with a different number. For example, the fifth row in Example 1 is all 1s, which remain the same. But other rows have changes.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the first row, it's replaced with a certain value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are replaced based on their value and their position. For example, in Example 1, the 2s in certain positions are replaced with 3s. But why?\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the third row has 8s in columns 3 and 4. The input for that row has 8s in columns 8 and 9. Wait, but if the grid is 9 columns, then columns are 0-8. So if the input has 8 in column 8 (the last column), then the output has 8 in column 3. That seems like a mirroring across the vertical axis. For example, column i is mapped to column (8 - i). Let's check:\n\nFor column 8: 8 - 8 = 0. So the mirrored column would be 0. But in the output, the 8 is in column 3. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's mirrored across the vertical axis, but in a different way. For example, if the input has a value in column i, it's replaced with the value from column (8 - i). But in Example 2, the third row of input has an 8 in column 8 (the last column), and the output has an 8 in column 3. So 8 - i = 3 \u2192 i = 5. So that would mean that the original column is 5. But in the input, the 8 is in column 8. So that doesn't fit. Maybe the transformation is not a simple mirroring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain positions are replaced based on their row. For example, in Example 1, the first two rows have 2s and 3s, which are transformed into 3s and 2s. Maybe the transformation is swapping 2 and 3 in certain positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain positions are replaced with a value based on their row and column. For example, if a cell is in row i and column j, then the value is transformed based on some formula. But without more examples, it's hard to find a pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 3 again. The input has a row with 5,6,6,5 in columns 10-13 (assuming 0-based index, but the grid is 9 columns). Wait, that's not possible. So perhaps the input is 12 rows of 9 columns. So for example, in the 11th row of input (assuming 0-based, row 10), the input is 0 0 5 6 6 5 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 6 5 5 6 0 0 0. So the numbers are reversed. So the first and last elements are swapped, and the middle elements are swapped. So the entire row is reversed. But why?\n\nIn the 12th row of input, the input is 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0. So the numbers are changed from 6 to 5. But why?\n\nIn the 9th row of input, the input is 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1. The output is the same. So that row remains unchanged.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that certain rows are reversed, and others are changed based on their values. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain rows have their values replaced based on their position. For example, rows 0-3 are transformed in a certain way, rows 4-6 are unchanged, and rows 7-11 are transformed in another way. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the input has a row with 5,6,6,5 in columns 2-5 (assuming 0-based index), and the output has 6,5,5,6. So the values are reversed. Similarly, in the 12th row of input, the values are 6,6,6,6 and become 5,5,5,5. So maybe the transformation is that certain rows are reversed and the values are replaced based on some rule.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are affected? Maybe the rows that are not all 1s are reversed, and then their values are replaced with certain numbers. For example, in the 11th row of input, the values are 5,6,6,5. After reversing, it's 5,6,6,5. But the output is 6,5,5,6. So that's not a simple reversal. Wait, the original row is 0 0 5 6 6 5 0 0 0. After reversing, it would be 0 0 0 5 6 6 5 0 0. But the output is 0 0 6 5 5 6 0 0 0. So that's not the same. So maybe the reversal is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain positions are replaced based on their value and their position. For example, in the 11th row of input, the 5s are replaced with 6s and the 6s are replaced with 5s. But why?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the test input. The test input is 12 rows, each with 15 elements. But the output must be 12x9. So the transformation for the test input is to reduce the number of columns from 15 to 9. But how?\n\nBut the training examples have 12x9 inputs and outputs. So the test input is different. But the problem says that the test input is shown for context. So the test input is 12 rows of 15 elements, and the output is 12x9. So the transformation is to process a 12x15 grid into a 12x9 grid. But the training examples are 12x9 inputs and outputs. So perhaps the transformation is different for different inputs. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain columns are selected or transformed based on their position. For example, in the test input, the first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. But the output must be 12x9. So the test input is 12x15, and the output is 12x9. So the transformation must take the input and produce a 12x9 grid. But how?\n\nBut the training examples have 12x9 inputs and outputs. So the transformation for the training examples is to take a 12x9 grid and produce a 12x9 grid. The test input is 12x15, and the output is 12x9. So the transformation for the test input is different.\n\nBut the problem says that the function must take a 2D list (grid) and return a 12x9 grid. So the function must work for both training examples and the test input. But how?\n\nThis is getting very confusing. Let's try to focus on the training examples and find a pattern that can be applied to them.\n\nLooking back at Example 1:\n\nThe input has a row with 0s except for 2s in columns 3 and 5. The output has 3s in those positions. Then in the second row, the 2 in column 2 is replaced with 3, and the 3 in column 3 is replaced with 2. So it's like swapping 2 and 3 in certain positions.\n\nIn the third row of input, there's a 2 in column 4. The output has a 3 in column 4. So maybe the transformation is that certain positions are replaced with a value based on their row.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother observation: the fifth row in all examples has 1s, and it remains the same. So that's a fixed row.\n\nIn Example 2, the third row of input has 8s in columns 8 and 9 (assuming 0-based), but the output has 8s in columns 3 and 4. So maybe the columns are mirrored. For example, column i is mapped to column (8 - i). Let's see:\n\nFor column 8, 8 - 8 = 0. So the mirrored column would be 0. But in the output, it's in column 3. That doesn't fit. So maybe it's not a simple mirroring.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a different pattern. For example, in Example 2, the third row of input has 8s in columns 8 and 9 (assuming 0-based), but the output has 8s in columns 3 and 4. That's a shift of 5 positions. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the values are replaced based on their position. For example, in the first two rows of Example 1, the values are replaced with 3s and 2s. But why?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that the value in a cell is replaced with a value that depends on the row and column. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, then the new value is some function of i and j.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother idea: looking at Example 3, the input has a row with 5,6,6,5 in columns 2-5 (assuming 0-based), and the output has 6,5,5,6. So the values are swapped. So maybe the transformation is that certain rows have their values swapped. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain rows are transformed based on their position. For example, rows 0-3 have certain transformations, rows 4-6 are unchanged, and rows 7-11 have other transformations.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their value and their position. For example, if a cell has a 2 in a certain row, it becomes 3, and if it has a 3 in that row, it becomes 2. But why?\n\nIn Example 1, the first row has 2s replaced with 3s. The second row has 2 and 3 swapped. The third row has 2 replaced with 3. The fourth row is all zeros. The fifth row is all 1s. The sixth row is all zeros. The seventh row is all zeros. And so on.\n\nThis suggests that there's a pattern where certain rows have their values transformed, but it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are replaced based on their position. For example, in the first two rows, the values are transformed into 3 and 2, but why?\n\nThis is very challenging. Given the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLet me try to think of possible transformations:\n\n1. Reversing certain rows.\n2. Replacing certain values based on their position.\n3. Mirroring certain columns.\n4. Replacing values based on their row or column.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a row with 5,6,6,5 and the output has 6,5,5,6. This suggests that the values are reversed. So maybe the transformation is to reverse the values in certain rows. But how to determine which rows?\n\nIn Example 1, the first two rows have their values transformed. For example, the first row has 2s replaced with 3s. The second row has 2 and 3 swapped. This doesn't fit a simple reversal.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for row 2 has 3 in column 2 and 2 in column 3. This suggests that the values are swapped between certain columns. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value in a cell is replaced with a value based on its row and column. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, then the new value is some function of i and j.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. In Example 1, the output has 3s in positions where the input had 2s. In Example 2, the output has 8s in positions where the input had 8s. But in some cases, the values change. For example, in Example 2, the third row of input has 8 in column 8 (assuming 0-based), and the output has 8 in column 3. This suggests that the column is mirrored. Let's check:\n\nIf the input column is i, then the output column is (8 - i). For example, in the third row of Example 2, the input has 8 in column 8. The output has 8 in column 3. 8 - 8 = 0, but the output is in column 3. That doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's mirrored across the middle of the grid. For example, the middle column is 4 (since 9 columns, 0-based 0-8, middle is 4). So for column i, the mirrored column is 8 - i. For example, column 0 \u2192 8, column 1 \u2192 7, column 2 \u2192 6, column 3 \u2192 5, column 4 \u2192 4.\n\nSo for the third row of Example 2, the input has an 8 in column 8 (which is mirrored to column 0). But the output has 8 in column 3. That doesn't fit. Unless there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the values are replaced with their mirrored values. For example, in Example 2, the third row has 8 in column 8 and 9 (but that's not possible in 9 columns). So this is confusing.\n\nMaybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in Example 3, the input has a row with 5,6,6,5 in columns 2-5. The output has 6,5,5,6. So the values are reversed. So maybe the transformation is to reverse the row. But in Example 1, the first row has 2s in columns 3 and 5. The output has 3s in those positions, but not reversed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain rows are reversed, and others are not. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAnother idea: in Example 3, the input has a row with 5,6,6,5 in columns 2-5. The output has 6,5,5,6. So it's a reversal of the values. So maybe the transformation is to reverse the values in certain rows. For example, rows that have certain patterns are reversed.\n\nBut how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for rows where the value is not all 1s, the row is reversed and the values are replaced based on some rule. For example, in the 11th row of Example 3, the values are 5,6,6,5. After reversing, it becomes 5,6,6,5. But the output is 6,5,5,6. So that's not a simple reversal. But if the values are replaced with their opposites, like 5 becomes 6 and 6 becomes 5. So perhaps the transformation is to reverse the row and then swap 5 and 6.\n\nBut this is getting too specific.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make a hypothesis. Let's assume that the transformation involves reversing certain rows and swapping certain values.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for row 2 is 0 0 3 2 3 3 0 0 0. The input for row 2 is 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0. So the 2 in column 2 is replaced with 3, and the 3 in column 3 is replaced with 2. This suggests that the values are swapped between certain positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the values are replaced with their opposite values. For example, 2 becomes 3 and 3 becomes 2.\n\nBut why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the values are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the first two rows, then 2 becomes 3, and 3 becomes 2.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns are affected.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that for certain rows, the values are replaced with a value based on their row and column. For example, if the cell is in row 0, then the value is replaced with 3 if it's a 2, and 2 if it's a 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll try to write a function that for each row, if the row is not all 1s, it reverses the row and replaces certain values.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that certain values are replaced based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are replaced with 3s in certain rows. In Example 2, the 8s are replaced with 8s in certain positions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output of the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has 3s where the input had 2s, and 2s where the input had 3s. This suggests that the values are swapped between 2 and 3 in certain rows.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 8s in certain positions. So maybe the values are not changed in some cases.\n\nIn Example 3, the values are swapped between 5 and 6 in certain rows.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is that certain values are swapped based on their position in the grid.\n\nBut how to determine which values and which positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the values are swapped between 2 and 3, and for other rows, between 5 and 6.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that for rows 0-3, the values are replaced with certain values, and for other rows, it's different.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll have to make a hypothesis based on the examples.\n\nLet me try to write a function that for each row, if the row is not all 1s, then it reverses the row and replaces certain values. For example, in Example 1, the first two rows are not all 1s, and their values are reversed and some values are swapped.\n\nBut this is not concrete.\n\nAlternatively, the function could check if the row is in a certain range and apply transformations.\n\nAlternatively, the function could replace certain values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in row 0, then replace 2 with 3. If it's in row 1, replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that for each row, if it's not all 1s, it reverses the row and replaces 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. This might not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input has a row with 5,6,6,5, which is not all 1s. The output has 6,5,5,6. So this suggests that the row is reversed and the values are swapped between 5 and 6.\n\nSo perhaps the function is to reverse the row and swap values based on their original value.\n\nBut how to determine which values to swap.\n\nAlternatively, the function could reverse the row and then replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2, and replace 5 with 6 and 6 with 5.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, the function could check if the row is in a certain range and apply transformations.\n\nBut given the time, I'll try to write a function that for each row, if the row is not all 1s, it reverses the row and replaces 2 with 3 and 3 with 2, and replaces 5 with 6 and 6 with 5.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the function could check if the row is in the first two rows and apply certain transformations.\n\nBut this is not reliable.\n\nAlternatively, the function could replace certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, if the column is even, replace 2 with 3, and if it's odd, replace 3 with 2.\n\nBut this is also a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that for each row, if it's not all 1s, it reverses the row and replaces 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. This might not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut in Example 1, the first row is 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. Reversing it gives 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 \u2192 same as original. But the output is 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0. So this suggests that the values are replaced with 3s.\n\nSo maybe the function is to replace 2 with 3 in certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, the function could replace 2 with 3 in rows 0-3, and 3 with 2 in rows 4-6, and so on.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll have to proceed with a function that replaces 2 with 3 and 3 with 2 in certain rows, and reverses the row in others. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the function could replace 2 with 3 in the first two rows, and 3 with 2 in the second row, and so on.\n\nBut this is not reliable.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that for each row, if it's not all 1s, it replaces 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. This might not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input has 5 and 6 in certain rows, which are replaced with 6 and 5. So the function should also handle those.\n\nSo, perhaps the function is to replace 2 with 3, 3 with 2, 5 with 6, and 6 with 5, in certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, the function could check if the row is in the first two rows and apply the 2-3 swap, and for other rows, apply 5-6 swap.\n\nBut this is not reliable.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that for each cell, if the value is 2, replace with 3, if it's 3, replace with 2, if it's 5, replace with 6, and if it's 6, replace with 5. This might not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 3s where the input had 2s, and 2s where the input had 3s. So this would work for that.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 8s and 4s, but the output has 8s and 4s. So this function would not change those values. But in the third row of Example 2, the input has 8s and the output has 8s. So this suggests that the function is not applicable to those values.\n\nSo this approach might not work for all cases.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 2 with 3 and 3 with 2, and 5 with 6 and 6 with 5, and leaves other values unchanged. This might not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to apply this.\n\nAlternatively, the function could apply this transformation to all rows, but this might not work for all examples.\n\nIn Example 1, this would work for the first two rows. For the third row, the input has 2 in column 4, which would be replaced with 3. The output has 3 in that position. So this would work.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 5 and 6 in certain rows, which would be replaced with 6 and 5. This would work for the 11th row.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input has 8s, which are not replaced, so this would work.\n\nSo this function might work for the examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 2:\n                new_row.append(3)\n            elif val == 3:\n                new_row.append(2)\n            elif val == 5:\n                new_row.append(6)\n            elif val == 6:\n                new_row.append(5)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not handle the example where the third row of Example 2 has 8s in columns 8 and 9 (but in 9 columns, it's column 8). The output has 8s in column 3. So this function would not change the 8s, but the output has 8s in column 3. So this suggests that the function is not correct.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input has 8s in columns 8 and 9 (but that's not possible in 9 columns). So perhaps this function is not correct.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this function and see.\n\nHowever, this function would not handle the mirroring in Example 2. So it's not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to reverse the row if it's not all 1s, and then replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2, and 5 with 6 and 6 with 5.\n\nSo for each row, if it's not all 1s, reverse it and apply the value swaps.\n\nBut in Example 1, the first row is 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. Reversing it gives 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. Then replacing 2 with 3 gives 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0, which matches the output.\n\nFor the second row of Example 1: 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0. Reversing gives 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0. Then replacing 2 with 3 and 3 with 2 gives 0 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0, but the output is 0 0 3 2 3 3 0 0 0. So this doesn't match.\n\nSo this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to replace 2 with 3 in certain positions, and 3 with 2 in others, based on their row.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the function that replaces 2 with 3 and 3 with 2, and 5 with 6 and 6 with 5, and leaves others unchanged. This might not work for all examples, but it's a starting point.\n"
