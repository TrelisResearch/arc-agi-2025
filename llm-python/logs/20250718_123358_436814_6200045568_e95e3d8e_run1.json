          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by looking at Example 1. The input and output grids are both 22x22. The input seems to have some repeating patterns. For instance, looking at the first few rows of the input and output:\n\nInput row 0: 1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3\nOutput row 0: 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3\n\nHmm, the output seems to have a pattern where certain elements are shifted or transformed. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are mirrored or rotated. Let me check another row. For example, the third row of input is 4 0 0 2 4 4 2 3 2 4 4 2 3 2 4 4 2 0 0 4 4 2. The output for that row is 4 2 3 2 4 4 2 3 2 4 4 2 3 2 4 4 2 3 2 4 4 2. So it looks like the third row in the input is transformed by shifting elements in some way. Wait, maybe the output is a shifted version of the input? Or perhaps there's a pattern where certain elements are replaced based on their position.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input's first row is 1 3 3 1 0 0 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1. The output is the same as the input. Wait, that's strange. But in the second example, the output is the same as the input? Or maybe not. Let me check again. Oh, no, the output for example 2 is the same as the input? Wait, looking at the input and output for example 2, the output seems to be the same as the input. But that can't be right. Wait, no, looking at the input and output for example 2, the output is exactly the same as the input. But that's not possible because the problem says that the output is different. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at example 2's input and output. The input is given, and the output is the same as the input. But that would imply that the transformation is identity. But that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong examples. Let me check again. For example 2, the input and output are the same. But that's not possible because the problem says that the output is different. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the examples. Let me check the example 2 again.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input is:\n\nInput:\n1 3 3 1 0 0 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1\n3 1 5 3 0 0 3 1 5 3 1 5 3 1 5 3 1 5 3 1 5 3\n3 5 3 3 5 3 3 5 3 3 5 3 3 5 3 3 5 3 3 5 3 3\n1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1\n3 1 5 3 1 5 3 1 5 3 1 5 3 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 3\n3 5 3 3 5 3 3 5 3 3 5 3 3 5 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3\n... and so on.\n\nThe output for example 2 is the same as the input. But that would imply that the transformation is identity. But that's not possible because the test input is different. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check again. Oh, maybe the output for example 2 is not the same as the input. Wait, looking at the output for example 2, the first row is:\n\n1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1\n\nWait, but the input's first row is:\n\n1 3 3 1 0 0 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1\n\nSo the output's first row is different. Oh, I see. The output for example 2's first row is 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1. So the input's first row has 0s in positions 4 and 5 (assuming zero-based or one-based?), but the output has 3s there. So there's a transformation happening here.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output. The input's first row starts with 1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3. The output is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. So the output seems to have some elements replaced. For example, the second element in the input is 0, but in the output it's 3. The third element is 0, which becomes 4. Then the fourth element is 4, which remains 4. Then the fifth is 3, which remains 3. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is a rotation or reflection. Let me think. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have the same elements but in a different order. For instance, looking at the first row of the input and output:\n\nInput row 0: 1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3\nOutput row 0: 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3\n\nSo the output seems to have a pattern where certain elements are shifted. For example, the first element is 1, then the next elements are 3, 4, 4, 3, etc. It looks like the output is a shifted version of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a mirror image. Let me check. For example, the first row of input is 1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3. The output is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. So the first element is 1, then 3, then 4, 4, 3, etc. It seems that the output is taking elements from the input in a certain way. Maybe the output is a shifted version where certain positions are replaced with values from other positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions based on their position. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where elements in even positions are replaced with certain values. Or maybe the output is a combination of the input and some other pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. The input's first row is 1 3 2 5 5 2 3 1 3 2 5 5 2 3 1 3 2 5 5 2 3 1. The output is the same as the input. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, looking at example 3's output, the first row is the same as the input. But that's not possible. Wait, maybe the output is the same as the input. But that would imply that the transformation is identity. However, the test input is different. But maybe the transformation is identity for some examples, but not others. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain elements with values from other positions. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have some elements that are the same as the input, but others are changed. For instance, the first row of the input has 0s in positions 1 and 2, but in the output, those positions are 3 and 4. Maybe the transformation is based on some pattern like replacing 0s with certain values based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace elements in certain positions with values from other positions. For example, in the first row of example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where every third element is replaced. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1's output, the first row is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. This seems to have a repeating pattern of 1 3 4 4 3, repeated multiple times. The input's first row is 1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3. So the output seems to have a pattern where certain elements are replaced with 3 and 4. Maybe the transformation is to replace elements in even positions with certain values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace elements based on their position in a way that depends on their row and column. For example, for each cell (i,j), the value is determined by some formula involving i and j. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. Let's see the positions. The first element is 1. Then 3, 4, 4, 3, 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, etc. So the pattern seems to be that the elements alternate between 3 and 4 in certain positions. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a rotation or reflection of the input. For example, if the input is rotated 90 degrees, but that would change the grid's orientation. However, the input and output are both 22x22, so that's possible. But how to check that?\n\nAnother approach: look for the same pattern in all examples. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have a pattern that is a shifted version of the input. For instance, the first row of the output is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. The input's first row is 1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3. So the output seems to have 3 and 4 in the positions where the input had 0s. So maybe the transformation replaces 0s with 3 and 4 based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain elements with values based on their position. For example, if the position (i,j) is in a certain row or column, then the value is determined by some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace elements in certain positions with values from other positions. For example, in example 1's first row, the elements at positions 1 and 2 (0s) are replaced with 3 and 4, and the elements at positions 17 and 18 (0s) are replaced with 4 and 3. This could suggest that the transformation is to replace 0s with certain values based on their position.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 based on their position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2's input and output. The input's first row has 0s in positions 4 and 5 (assuming 0-based). The output's first row has 3 and 3 in those positions. Wait, looking at example 2's input and output:\n\nInput row 0: 1 3 3 1 0 0 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1\nOutput row 0: 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1\n\nSo the input's positions 4 and 5 (0-based) are 0, but in the output, they are 3 and 3. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 3s in certain positions. But why those positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with values based on their row and column. For example, if the position is in a certain row or column, then replace 0 with 3 or 4. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace elements with values that are determined by their position in a way that depends on whether they are in even or odd rows or columns. But this is too vague.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. The input's first row is 1 3 2 5 5 2 3 1 3 2 5 5 2 3 1 3 2 5 5 2 3 1. The output is the same as the input. So that suggests that the transformation is identity for this example. But that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong example. Let me check again.\n\nWait, example 3's input and output are the same. But that would mean the transformation is identity. But that's not possible. However, the problem says that the output is generated by some transformation. So perhaps the transformation is identity for some examples but not others. But that seems unlikely. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace elements in certain positions based on their position in the grid. For example, if the row number is even, then certain elements are replaced. Or if the column is even, replace with certain values.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output of example 1. The output seems to have a repeating pattern of 1 3 4 4 3. For example, the first row of the output is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. This suggests that the pattern is 1 3 4 4 3 repeated multiple times. But how does this relate to the input?\n\nIn the input's first row, the elements are 1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3. The output seems to have 3 and 4 in the positions where the input had 0s. For example, the input's positions 1 and 2 (0s) are replaced with 3 and 4. Then, positions 17 and 18 (0s) are replaced with 4 and 3. This could suggest that the transformation replaces 0s with 3 and 4 based on their position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 in a certain way. For example, in even columns, replace with 3, and in odd columns, replace with 4. Or something like that. But how to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2's input and output. The output's first row has 3s in positions where the input had 0s. For example, in the input's first row, positions 4 and 5 are 0, and in the output, they are 3 and 3. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 3s. But why in example 1, the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4?\n\nThis suggests that there's no consistent pattern, which is confusing. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 or 4 based on their position. For example, in even rows, replace 0 with 3, and in odd rows, replace with 4. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with values based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even, replace 0 with 3, and if the column is even, replace with 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the first row seems to have a pattern where every third element is 3, then 4, then 4, then 3, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: look for the same pattern in all examples. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the first row is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. This is a repeating pattern of 1 3 4 4 3, which is 5 elements long. The input's first row has 0s in positions 1 and 2. So perhaps the transformation is to replace those 0s with 3 and 4, and then the rest of the elements are kept as is. But this is just for the first row.\n\nBut how to generalize this for all rows and columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace elements in certain positions with values based on their position. For example, if the row is even, then certain elements are replaced. Or if the column is even, replace with certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace elements with values that are determined by their position in the grid. For example, if the position (i,j) is in a certain row or column, then the value is determined by some formula.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern. However, given the examples, I need to find a pattern that works for at least some of them.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the first row is 1 followed by 3, 4, 4, 3, and so on. This suggests that the transformation is to replace certain elements with values that depend on their position. For example, if the column is even, replace with 3 or 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace elements in the input with values based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even, then the value is determined by the column, and if the row is odd, then it's determined by the column in another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace elements in the input with values that are determined by their position in a way that depends on the row and column. For example, for even rows, replace 0s with 3, and for odd rows, replace with 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to think of a possible transformation.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row seems to have a pattern where the elements are 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, etc. This looks like a repeating pattern of 1 3 4 4 3. The input's first row has 0s in positions 1 and 2. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4, and the other elements are kept as is.\n\nBut how to determine what values to replace with. For example, in the first row, the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4. Then, the next 0s are replaced with 4 and 3. This could suggest that the replacement is based on the position's parity. For example, if the column is even, replace with 3, and if odd, replace with 4.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's test it with example 1's first row.\n\nIn the input's first row, the positions 1 and 2 are 0. Column indices are 0-based? Assuming so, position 1 is column 1 (odd), so replaced with 4? But in the output, it's 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the row's parity. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 3, and in odd rows, replace with 4. But example 1's first row is row 0 (even), and the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the column's position. For example, if the column is even, replace with 3, and if odd, replace with 4. Let's check:\n\nIn the input's first row, columns 1 and 2 are 0. Column 1 is odd (1), so replaced with 4. Column 2 is even (2), replaced with 3. But in the output, the first row has 3 and 4 in those positions. So that would fit: column 1 (odd) \u2192 4, column 2 (even) \u2192 3. But the output for those positions is 3 and 4. So that would not fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the column's position modulo 3. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the first row is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. This can be seen as the pattern 1 3 4 4 3 repeated multiple times. The input's first row has 0s in positions 1 and 2. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 based on their position in the row. For example, in the first row, the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4 in the order of 3 then 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 in a way that alternates between them. But again, this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I have, I need to make a hypothesis. Let's think about the following: in example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the first row is a repetition of 1 3 4 4 3. This suggests that the transformation is to replace certain elements with values that form this pattern. Perhaps the transformation is to replace elements in the input with values based on their position in a way that creates this pattern.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe the transformation is to replace elements in the input with values based on their row and column, such that for each cell (i,j), the value is determined by some formula involving i and j.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 based on their position. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 3, and in odd rows, replace with 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 if the column is even, and with 4 if the column is odd. Let's check example 1's first row. The input's first row has 0s in columns 1 and 2. Column 1 is odd \u2192 replace with 4. Column 2 is even \u2192 replace with 3. So the output would have 4 and 3, which matches the output. But in the output, the first row has 3 and 4 in those positions. Wait, the first row of the output is 1 3 4 4 3 ... So the first two elements after 1 are 3 and 4. So for column 1, it's 3, and column 2 is 4. But according to the hypothesis, column 1 (odd) would be replaced with 4, but the output has 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 based on their position in the row. For example, in even columns, replace with 3, and odd columns with 4. But this would mean that in the first row, columns 1 (odd) would be 4, but the output has 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the row number. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 3, and in odd rows, replace with 4. In example 1's first row (row 0, even), the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4. But that would mean that the first 0 is replaced with 3, and the next with 4. This could be a pattern. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 in a way that alternates between them. For example, in the first row, the first 0 is replaced with 3, the next with 4, then 3, etc. This would fit the example. But how to generalize this.\n\nBut this is just for 0s. What about other values? For example, in example 1's input, there are other numbers like 1, 3, 4, etc. Are they unchanged?\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row has 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, 1, 3, etc. So the original elements are kept, but 0s are replaced with 3 and 4. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 based on their position.\n\nBut how to determine which value to replace with. Maybe the replacement is based on the column's position modulo 2. For example, if the column is even, replace with 3, and if odd, replace with 4. But in the first row, column 1 is odd (1), so replaced with 4. But in the output, it's 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the row's position. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 3, and in odd rows, replace with 4. In example 1's first row (even), the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4. But that would mean that the first 0 is replaced with 3, and the next with 4. This could be a pattern.\n\nBut how to determine which 0 to replace with what. Maybe the replacement alternates between 3 and 4 for each 0 in the row.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Given the time, I need to make a decision. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 in a certain pattern, and other values are left as is. But how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 if the column is even, and with 4 if the column is odd. Let's see for example 1's first row:\n\nColumns 1 and 2 are 0. Column 1 is odd \u2192 replace with 4. Column 2 is even \u2192 replace with 3. But in the output, those positions are 3 and 4. So that would mean that the replacement is reversed. Maybe it's the other way around: column even \u2192 4, odd \u2192 3.\n\nBut in that case, for column 1 (odd), replace with 3, and column 2 (even) replace with 4. Which matches the output. So this could be the pattern.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with example 1's first row:\n\nInput row 0: 1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3\n\nColumns 1 and 2 are 0. Column 1 is odd \u2192 replaced with 3. Column 2 is even \u2192 replaced with 4. So the output for those positions would be 3 and 4, which matches the output.\n\nThen, in the input's row 0, columns 17 and 18 are 0. Column 17 is odd (17 is odd), so replaced with 3. Column 18 is even, replaced with 4. In the output, those positions are 4 and 3. Wait, the output's row 0 is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. So columns 17 and 18 are 4 and 3. But according to the hypothesis, column 17 (odd) would be 3, and column 18 (even) 4. But in the output, it's 4 and 3. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the column's position modulo 4. Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the row's parity. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 3, and in odd rows, replace with 4. Let's check example 1's first row (even row), and the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4. But this would mean that the first 0 is replaced with 3, and the next with 4. Which matches the output. For the later 0s in the row, columns 17 and 18 (even row), replaced with 3 and 4. But in the output, those positions are 4 and 3. So this would not fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at example 2's input and output. The input's first row has 0s in positions 4 and 5. The output's first row has 3 and 3 in those positions. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3. But in example 1, the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 if the column is even, and 4 if odd, but in example 1's first row, the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4, but in the later 0s, it's 4 and 3. This suggests that the replacement depends on the row's parity.\n\nMaybe the replacement is based on the row's parity. For even rows, replace 0s with 3 and 4 in alternating fashion, and for odd rows, replace with 4 and 3.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 if the column is even and the row is even, and with 4 if the column is odd and the row is even. For odd rows, it's the opposite.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 based on the position's coordinates. For example, if (i + j) is even, replace with 3, else 4. Let's test this for example 1's first row.\n\nFor the first 0 in column 1 (i=0, j=1): i+j = 1 (odd) \u2192 replaced with 4. But in the output, it's 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if (i + j) is even, replace with 3, else 4. For j=1, i=0: 0+1=1 (odd) \u2192 replaced with 4, but output is 3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (i - j) is even. For j=1, i=0: 0-1 = -1 (odd) \u2192 replaced with 4. Still no.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe the pattern is not based on 0s, but on other elements.\n\nLooking back at example 1's input and output, the output seems to have a pattern where every third element is 3, then 4, then 4, then 3, etc. This suggests that the transformation is to replace certain elements with values based on their position in the row.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace each element with the value from the input at a certain offset. For example, in the first row of example 1, the output is the input's first row with some elements shifted. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Given the time, I'll have to make an educated guess. Let's consider that the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 in a way that depends on the column's position. For example, in even columns, replace with 3, and in odd columns, replace with 4. This would fit example 1's first row's first two 0s. But in the later 0s, it would replace with 4 and 3, which matches the output.\n\nSo the hypothesis is: for each cell in the grid, if the value is 0, replace it with 3 if the column is even, and 4 if the column is odd. For other values, leave them as is.\n\nLet's test this with example 1's first row. The input has 0s at columns 1 and 2. Column 1 is odd \u2192 replace with 4. Column 2 is even \u2192 replace with 3. But in the output, the first 0 is replaced with 3, and the second with 4. This would contradict the hypothesis. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the other way around: even columns replaced with 4, odd with 3. For column 1 (odd), replaced with 3. Column 2 (even) replaced with 4. This would match the first two 0s in the first row of example 1. But for the later 0s in the row, columns 17 and 18: column 17 is odd (17 is odd), so replaced with 3. Column 18 is even, replaced with 4. But in the output, those positions are 4 and 3. So this would not fit.\n\nHmm. This is very confusing.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the first row seems to have a pattern where the elements are 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, etc. This looks like the pattern is repeating every 5 elements. So the transformation might be to replace certain elements based on their position in the row. For example, if the position is 1, replace with 3; position 2, replace with 4; position 3, replace with 4; position 4, replace with 3; and so on.\n\nBut this is too specific to the first row.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3\n3 7 1 1 7 3 5 5 3 7 1 1 7 3 5 5 3 7 1 1 7 3\n1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 0 0 0 7 5 5 7 3 1 1 3 7 5 5 7 3 1 1 3 7 5\n1 7 1 7 1 0 0 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 0 0 0 7 1 7 1 7\n3 3 1 5 7 0 0 1 3 3 1 5 7 7 0 0 0 3 1 5 7 7\n1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 0 0 0 5 1 5 1 5\n3 5 1 7 7 1 5 3 3 5 1 7 7 1 0 0 0 5 1 7 7 1\n1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3\n3 7 1 1 7 3 5 5 3 0 0 0 7 3 5 5 3 7 1 1 7 3\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 1 1 3 7 5 5 7 3 0 0 0 7 5 5 7 3 1 1 3 7 5\n1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7\n3 3 1 5 7 7 5 1 3 3 1 5 7 7 5 1 3 3 1 5 7 7\n1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 0 0 0 5 1 5 1 5\n3 5 1 7 7 1 5 3 3 5 1 7 7 1 0 0 0 5 1 7 7 1\n1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 0 0 0 3 1 3 1 3\n3 7 1 1 7 3 5 5 3 7 1 1 7 3 0 0 0 7 1 1 7 3\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n3 1 1 3 7 5 5 7 3 1 1 3 7 5 5 7 3 1 1 3 7 5\n1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7\n3 3 1 5 7 7 5 1 3 3 1 5 7 7 5 1 3 3 1 5 7 7\n\nLooking at the test input's third row: 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1. The output for this row is not provided, but the transformation should be applied. If the pattern is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 based on column parity, then for this row, the 0s are in columns 1, 2, 3. Columns 1 (odd) \u2192 3, column 2 (even) \u2192 4, column 3 (odd) \u2192 3. So the row would become 1 3 4 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1. But I don't know the actual output.\n\nBut without knowing the actual output, it's hard to verify.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 based on the column's parity. So, for each cell in the grid, if the value is 0, replace it with 3 if the column is even, and 4 if the column is odd. For other values, leave them as is.\n\nThis would explain some of the examples, like example 1's first row. Let's see:\n\nFor the first row, columns 1 (odd) \u2192 4, column 2 (even) \u2192 3. But in the output, those positions are 3 and 4. So this would not fit. But maybe the hypothesis is reversed: replace with 3 if column is even, and 4 if odd. Then, for column 1 (odd), replace with 4, column 2 (even) replace with 3. But in the output, the first two 0s are 3 and 4, which would fit if the first 0 is in column 1 (odd) replaced with 4, and the next in column 2 (even) replaced with 3. But in the output, the first 0 is replaced with 3, which would mean that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and implement it, even if it may not fit all examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for i, val in enumerate(row):\n            if val == 0:\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    new_row.append(3)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(4)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not work for all examples. For example, in example 1's first row, this would replace the 0s at columns 1 and 2 with 4 and 3, which would match the output's 3 and 4? No, because column 1 is odd (i=1, which is odd), so replaced with 4. Column 2 is even (i=2), replaced with 3. So the new_row would have 3 and 4 in those positions. But in the output, the first row is 1 3 4 4 3 ... So the first 0 is replaced with 3, which would mean that the code is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the code above, for i=1 (column 1), which is odd, it appends 4. But the output has 3 in that position. So this suggests that the code is wrong.\n\nHmm. Maybe the replacement is based on the row's parity. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 3 if column is even, and 4 if odd. In odd rows, it's the opposite.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the row's parity and column's parity. For example, if the row is even and column is even, replace with 3. If row is even and column is odd, replace with 4. If row is odd and column is even, replace with 4. If row is odd and column is odd, replace with 3. This would create a checkerboard pattern.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this for example 1's first row (row 0, even). Columns 1 (odd) and 2 (even). For even row, column 1 (odd) \u2192 4, column 2 (even) \u2192 3. So the first 0s are replaced with 4 and 3, which would match the output's 3 and 4? No, because in the output, the first 0 is replaced with 3. So this would not fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0s with 3 and 4 based on column parity, even if it may not fit all examples. This is the best I can do given the time.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by looking at Example 1. The input and output grids are both 22x22. The input seems to have some repeating patterns. For instance, looking at the first few rows of the input and output:\n\nInput row 0: 1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3\nOutput row 0: 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3\n\nHmm, the output seems to have a pattern where certain elements are shifted or transformed. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are mirrored or rotated. Let me check another row. For example, the third row of input is 4 0 0 2 4 4 2 3 2 4 4 2 3 2 4 4 2 0 0 4 4 2. The output for that row is 4 2 3 2 4 4 2 3 2 4 4 2 3 2 4 4 2 3 2 4 4 2. So it looks like the third row in the input is transformed by shifting elements in some way. Wait, maybe the output is a shifted version of the input? Or perhaps there's a pattern where certain elements are replaced based on their position.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input's first row is 1 3 3 1 0 0 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1. The output is the same as the input. Wait, that's strange. But in the second example, the output is the same as the input? Or maybe not. Let me check again. Oh, no, the output for example 2 is the same as the input? Wait, looking at the input and output for example 2, the output seems to be the same as the input. But that can't be right. Wait, no, looking at the input and output for example 2, the output is exactly the same as the input. But that's not possible because the problem says that the output is different. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at example 2's input and output. The input is given, and the output is the same as the input. But that would imply that the transformation is identity. But that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong examples. Let me check again. For example 2, the input and output are the same. But that's not possible because the problem says that the output is different. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading the examples. Let me check the example 2 again.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input is:\n\nInput:\n1 3 3 1 0 0 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1\n3 1 5 3 0 0 3 1 5 3 1 5 3 1 5 3 1 5 3 1 5 3\n3 5 3 3 5 3 3 5 3 3 5 3 3 5 3 3 5 3 3 5 3 3\n1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1\n3 1 5 3 1 5 3 1 5 3 1 5 3 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 3\n3 5 3 3 5 3 3 5 3 3 5 3 3 5 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3\n... and so on.\n\nThe output for example 2 is the same as the input. But that would imply that the transformation is identity. But that's not possible because the test input is different. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check again. Oh, maybe the output for example 2 is not the same as the input. Wait, looking at the output for example 2, the first row is:\n\n1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1\n\nWait, but the input's first row is:\n\n1 3 3 1 0 0 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1\n\nSo the output's first row is different. Oh, I see. The output for example 2's first row is 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1. So the input's first row has 0s in positions 4 and 5 (assuming zero-based or one-based?), but the output has 3s there. So there's a transformation happening here.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output. The input's first row starts with 1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3. The output is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. So the output seems to have some elements replaced. For example, the second element in the input is 0, but in the output it's 3. The third element is 0, which becomes 4. Then the fourth element is 4, which remains 4. Then the fifth is 3, which remains 3. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is a rotation or reflection. Let me think. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have the same elements but in a different order. For instance, looking at the first row of the input and output:\n\nInput row 0: 1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3\nOutput row 0: 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3\n\nSo the output seems to have a pattern where certain elements are shifted. For example, the first element is 1, then the next elements are 3, 4, 4, 3, etc. It looks like the output is a shifted version of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a mirror image. Let me check. For example, the first row of input is 1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3. The output is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. So the first element is 1, then 3, then 4, 4, 3, etc. It seems that the output is taking elements from the input in a certain way. Maybe the output is a shifted version where certain positions are replaced with values from other positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions based on their position. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where elements in even positions are replaced with certain values. Or maybe the output is a combination of the input and some other pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. The input's first row is 1 3 2 5 5 2 3 1 3 2 5 5 2 3 1 3 2 5 5 2 3 1. The output is the same as the input. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, looking at example 3's output, the first row is the same as the input. But that's not possible. Wait, maybe the output is the same as the input. But that would imply that the transformation is identity. However, the test input is different. But maybe the transformation is identity for some examples, but not others. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain elements with values from other positions. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have some elements that are the same as the input, but others are changed. For instance, the first row of the input has 0s in positions 1 and 2, but in the output, those positions are 3 and 4. Maybe the transformation is based on some pattern like replacing 0s with certain values based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace elements in certain positions with values from other positions. For example, in the first row of example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where every third element is replaced. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1's output, the first row is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. This seems to have a repeating pattern of 1 3 4 4 3, repeated multiple times. The input's first row is 1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3. So the output seems to have a pattern where certain elements are replaced with 3 and 4. Maybe the transformation is to replace elements in even positions with certain values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace elements based on their position in a way that depends on their row and column. For example, for each cell (i,j), the value is determined by some formula involving i and j. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. Let's see the positions. The first element is 1. Then 3, 4, 4, 3, 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, etc. So the pattern seems to be that the elements alternate between 3 and 4 in certain positions. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a rotation or reflection of the input. For example, if the input is rotated 90 degrees, but that would change the grid's orientation. However, the input and output are both 22x22, so that's possible. But how to check that?\n\nAnother approach: look for the same pattern in all examples. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have a pattern that is a shifted version of the input. For instance, the first row of the output is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. The input's first row is 1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3. So the output seems to have 3 and 4 in the positions where the input had 0s. So maybe the transformation replaces 0s with 3 and 4 based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain elements with values based on their position. For example, if the position (i,j) is in a certain row or column, then the value is determined by some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace elements in certain positions with values from other positions. For example, in example 1's first row, the elements at positions 1 and 2 (0s) are replaced with 3 and 4, and the elements at positions 17 and 18 (0s) are replaced with 4 and 3. This could suggest that the transformation is to replace 0s with certain values based on their position.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 based on their position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2's input and output. The input's first row has 0s in positions 4 and 5 (assuming 0-based). The output's first row has 3 and 3 in those positions. Wait, looking at example 2's input and output:\n\nInput row 0: 1 3 3 1 0 0 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1\nOutput row 0: 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 1\n\nSo the input's positions 4 and 5 (0-based) are 0, but in the output, they are 3 and 3. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 3s in certain positions. But why those positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with values based on their row and column. For example, if the position is in a certain row or column, then replace 0 with 3 or 4. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace elements with values that are determined by their position in a way that depends on whether they are in even or odd rows or columns. But this is too vague.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. The input's first row is 1 3 2 5 5 2 3 1 3 2 5 5 2 3 1 3 2 5 5 2 3 1. The output is the same as the input. So that suggests that the transformation is identity for this example. But that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong example. Let me check again.\n\nWait, example 3's input and output are the same. But that would mean the transformation is identity. But that's not possible. However, the problem says that the output is generated by some transformation. So perhaps the transformation is identity for some examples but not others. But that seems unlikely. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace elements in certain positions based on their position in the grid. For example, if the row number is even, then certain elements are replaced. Or if the column is even, replace with certain values.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output of example 1. The output seems to have a repeating pattern of 1 3 4 4 3. For example, the first row of the output is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. This suggests that the pattern is 1 3 4 4 3 repeated multiple times. But how does this relate to the input?\n\nIn the input's first row, the elements are 1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3. The output seems to have 3 and 4 in the positions where the input had 0s. For example, the input's positions 1 and 2 (0s) are replaced with 3 and 4. Then, positions 17 and 18 (0s) are replaced with 4 and 3. This could suggest that the transformation replaces 0s with 3 and 4 based on their position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 in a certain way. For example, in even columns, replace with 3, and in odd columns, replace with 4. Or something like that. But how to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2's input and output. The output's first row has 3s in positions where the input had 0s. For example, in the input's first row, positions 4 and 5 are 0, and in the output, they are 3 and 3. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 3s. But why in example 1, the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4?\n\nThis suggests that there's no consistent pattern, which is confusing. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 or 4 based on their position. For example, in even rows, replace 0 with 3, and in odd rows, replace with 4. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with values based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even, replace 0 with 3, and if the column is even, replace with 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the first row seems to have a pattern where every third element is 3, then 4, then 4, then 3, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: look for the same pattern in all examples. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the first row is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. This is a repeating pattern of 1 3 4 4 3, which is 5 elements long. The input's first row has 0s in positions 1 and 2. So perhaps the transformation is to replace those 0s with 3 and 4, and then the rest of the elements are kept as is. But this is just for the first row.\n\nBut how to generalize this for all rows and columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace elements in certain positions with values based on their position. For example, if the row is even, then certain elements are replaced. Or if the column is even, replace with certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace elements with values that are determined by their position in the grid. For example, if the position (i,j) is in a certain row or column, then the value is determined by some formula.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern. However, given the examples, I need to find a pattern that works for at least some of them.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the first row is 1 followed by 3, 4, 4, 3, and so on. This suggests that the transformation is to replace certain elements with values that depend on their position. For example, if the column is even, replace with 3 or 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace elements in the input with values based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even, then the value is determined by the column, and if the row is odd, then it's determined by the column in another way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace elements in the input with values that are determined by their position in a way that depends on the row and column. For example, for even rows, replace 0s with 3, and for odd rows, replace with 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to think of a possible transformation.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row seems to have a pattern where the elements are 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, etc. This looks like a repeating pattern of 1 3 4 4 3. The input's first row has 0s in positions 1 and 2. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4, and the other elements are kept as is.\n\nBut how to determine what values to replace with. For example, in the first row, the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4. Then, the next 0s are replaced with 4 and 3. This could suggest that the replacement is based on the position's parity. For example, if the column is even, replace with 3, and if odd, replace with 4.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's test it with example 1's first row.\n\nIn the input's first row, the positions 1 and 2 are 0. Column indices are 0-based? Assuming so, position 1 is column 1 (odd), so replaced with 4? But in the output, it's 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the row's parity. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 3, and in odd rows, replace with 4. But example 1's first row is row 0 (even), and the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the column's position. For example, if the column is even, replace with 3, and if odd, replace with 4. Let's check:\n\nIn the input's first row, columns 1 and 2 are 0. Column 1 is odd (1), so replaced with 4. Column 2 is even (2), replaced with 3. But in the output, the first row has 3 and 4 in those positions. So that would fit: column 1 (odd) \u2192 4, column 2 (even) \u2192 3. But the output for those positions is 3 and 4. So that would not fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the column's position modulo 3. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the first row is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. This can be seen as the pattern 1 3 4 4 3 repeated multiple times. The input's first row has 0s in positions 1 and 2. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 based on their position in the row. For example, in the first row, the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4 in the order of 3 then 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 in a way that alternates between them. But again, this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I have, I need to make a hypothesis. Let's think about the following: in example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the first row is a repetition of 1 3 4 4 3. This suggests that the transformation is to replace certain elements with values that form this pattern. Perhaps the transformation is to replace elements in the input with values based on their position in a way that creates this pattern.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe the transformation is to replace elements in the input with values based on their row and column, such that for each cell (i,j), the value is determined by some formula involving i and j.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 based on their position. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 3, and in odd rows, replace with 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 if the column is even, and with 4 if the column is odd. Let's check example 1's first row. The input's first row has 0s in columns 1 and 2. Column 1 is odd \u2192 replace with 4. Column 2 is even \u2192 replace with 3. So the output would have 4 and 3, which matches the output. But in the output, the first row has 3 and 4 in those positions. Wait, the first row of the output is 1 3 4 4 3 ... So the first two elements after 1 are 3 and 4. So for column 1, it's 3, and column 2 is 4. But according to the hypothesis, column 1 (odd) would be replaced with 4, but the output has 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 based on their position in the row. For example, in even columns, replace with 3, and odd columns with 4. But this would mean that in the first row, columns 1 (odd) would be 4, but the output has 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the row number. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 3, and in odd rows, replace with 4. In example 1's first row (row 0, even), the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4. But that would mean that the first 0 is replaced with 3, and the next with 4. This could be a pattern. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 in a way that alternates between them. For example, in the first row, the first 0 is replaced with 3, the next with 4, then 3, etc. This would fit the example. But how to generalize this.\n\nBut this is just for 0s. What about other values? For example, in example 1's input, there are other numbers like 1, 3, 4, etc. Are they unchanged?\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row has 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, 1, 3, etc. So the original elements are kept, but 0s are replaced with 3 and 4. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 based on their position.\n\nBut how to determine which value to replace with. Maybe the replacement is based on the column's position modulo 2. For example, if the column is even, replace with 3, and if odd, replace with 4. But in the first row, column 1 is odd (1), so replaced with 4. But in the output, it's 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the row's position. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 3, and in odd rows, replace with 4. In example 1's first row (even), the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4. But that would mean that the first 0 is replaced with 3, and the next with 4. This could be a pattern.\n\nBut how to determine which 0 to replace with what. Maybe the replacement alternates between 3 and 4 for each 0 in the row.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. Given the time, I need to make a decision. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 in a certain pattern, and other values are left as is. But how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 if the column is even, and with 4 if the column is odd. Let's see for example 1's first row:\n\nColumns 1 and 2 are 0. Column 1 is odd \u2192 replace with 4. Column 2 is even \u2192 replace with 3. But in the output, those positions are 3 and 4. So that would mean that the replacement is reversed. Maybe it's the other way around: column even \u2192 4, odd \u2192 3.\n\nBut in that case, for column 1 (odd), replace with 3, and column 2 (even) replace with 4. Which matches the output. So this could be the pattern.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with example 1's first row:\n\nInput row 0: 1 0 0 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 0 0 3 1 3\n\nColumns 1 and 2 are 0. Column 1 is odd \u2192 replaced with 3. Column 2 is even \u2192 replaced with 4. So the output for those positions would be 3 and 4, which matches the output.\n\nThen, in the input's row 0, columns 17 and 18 are 0. Column 17 is odd (17 is odd), so replaced with 3. Column 18 is even, replaced with 4. In the output, those positions are 4 and 3. Wait, the output's row 0 is 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3 4 4 3 1 3. So columns 17 and 18 are 4 and 3. But according to the hypothesis, column 17 (odd) would be 3, and column 18 (even) 4. But in the output, it's 4 and 3. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the column's position modulo 4. Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the row's parity. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 3, and in odd rows, replace with 4. Let's check example 1's first row (even row), and the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4. But this would mean that the first 0 is replaced with 3, and the next with 4. Which matches the output. For the later 0s in the row, columns 17 and 18 (even row), replaced with 3 and 4. But in the output, those positions are 4 and 3. So this would not fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at example 2's input and output. The input's first row has 0s in positions 4 and 5. The output's first row has 3 and 3 in those positions. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3. But in example 1, the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 if the column is even, and 4 if odd, but in example 1's first row, the 0s are replaced with 3 and 4, but in the later 0s, it's 4 and 3. This suggests that the replacement depends on the row's parity.\n\nMaybe the replacement is based on the row's parity. For even rows, replace 0s with 3 and 4 in alternating fashion, and for odd rows, replace with 4 and 3.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 if the column is even and the row is even, and with 4 if the column is odd and the row is even. For odd rows, it's the opposite.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 based on the position's coordinates. For example, if (i + j) is even, replace with 3, else 4. Let's test this for example 1's first row.\n\nFor the first 0 in column 1 (i=0, j=1): i+j = 1 (odd) \u2192 replaced with 4. But in the output, it's 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if (i + j) is even, replace with 3, else 4. For j=1, i=0: 0+1=1 (odd) \u2192 replaced with 4, but output is 3. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe (i - j) is even. For j=1, i=0: 0-1 = -1 (odd) \u2192 replaced with 4. Still no.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe the pattern is not based on 0s, but on other elements.\n\nLooking back at example 1's input and output, the output seems to have a pattern where every third element is 3, then 4, then 4, then 3, etc. This suggests that the transformation is to replace certain elements with values based on their position in the row.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace each element with the value from the input at a certain offset. For example, in the first row of example 1, the output is the input's first row with some elements shifted. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Given the time, I'll have to make an educated guess. Let's consider that the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 in a way that depends on the column's position. For example, in even columns, replace with 3, and in odd columns, replace with 4. This would fit example 1's first row's first two 0s. But in the later 0s, it would replace with 4 and 3, which matches the output.\n\nSo the hypothesis is: for each cell in the grid, if the value is 0, replace it with 3 if the column is even, and 4 if the column is odd. For other values, leave them as is.\n\nLet's test this with example 1's first row. The input has 0s at columns 1 and 2. Column 1 is odd \u2192 replace with 4. Column 2 is even \u2192 replace with 3. But in the output, the first 0 is replaced with 3, and the second with 4. This would contradict the hypothesis. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the other way around: even columns replaced with 4, odd with 3. For column 1 (odd), replaced with 3. Column 2 (even) replaced with 4. This would match the first two 0s in the first row of example 1. But for the later 0s in the row, columns 17 and 18: column 17 is odd (17 is odd), so replaced with 3. Column 18 is even, replaced with 4. But in the output, those positions are 4 and 3. So this would not fit.\n\nHmm. This is very confusing.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the first row seems to have a pattern where the elements are 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, 1, 3, 4, 4, 3, etc. This looks like the pattern is repeating every 5 elements. So the transformation might be to replace certain elements based on their position in the row. For example, if the position is 1, replace with 3; position 2, replace with 4; position 3, replace with 4; position 4, replace with 3; and so on.\n\nBut this is too specific to the first row.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3\n3 7 1 1 7 3 5 5 3 7 1 1 7 3 5 5 3 7 1 1 7 3\n1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 0 0 0 7 5 5 7 3 1 1 3 7 5 5 7 3 1 1 3 7 5\n1 7 1 7 1 0 0 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 0 0 0 7 1 7 1 7\n3 3 1 5 7 0 0 1 3 3 1 5 7 7 0 0 0 3 1 5 7 7\n1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 0 0 0 5 1 5 1 5\n3 5 1 7 7 1 5 3 3 5 1 7 7 1 0 0 0 5 1 7 7 1\n1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3\n3 7 1 1 7 3 5 5 3 0 0 0 7 3 5 5 3 7 1 1 7 3\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 1 1 3 7 5 5 7 3 0 0 0 7 5 5 7 3 1 1 3 7 5\n1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7\n3 3 1 5 7 7 5 1 3 3 1 5 7 7 5 1 3 3 1 5 7 7\n1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 1 5 0 0 0 5 1 5 1 5\n3 5 1 7 7 1 5 3 3 5 1 7 7 1 0 0 0 5 1 7 7 1\n1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 0 0 0 3 1 3 1 3\n3 7 1 1 7 3 5 5 3 7 1 1 7 3 0 0 0 7 1 1 7 3\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n3 1 1 3 7 5 5 7 3 1 1 3 7 5 5 7 3 1 1 3 7 5\n1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7 1 7\n3 3 1 5 7 7 5 1 3 3 1 5 7 7 5 1 3 3 1 5 7 7\n\nLooking at the test input's third row: 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1. The output for this row is not provided, but the transformation should be applied. If the pattern is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 based on column parity, then for this row, the 0s are in columns 1, 2, 3. Columns 1 (odd) \u2192 3, column 2 (even) \u2192 4, column 3 (odd) \u2192 3. So the row would become 1 3 4 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1. But I don't know the actual output.\n\nBut without knowing the actual output, it's hard to verify.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 3 and 4 based on the column's parity. So, for each cell in the grid, if the value is 0, replace it with 3 if the column is even, and 4 if the column is odd. For other values, leave them as is.\n\nThis would explain some of the examples, like example 1's first row. Let's see:\n\nFor the first row, columns 1 (odd) \u2192 4, column 2 (even) \u2192 3. But in the output, those positions are 3 and 4. So this would not fit. But maybe the hypothesis is reversed: replace with 3 if column is even, and 4 if odd. Then, for column 1 (odd), replace with 4, column 2 (even) replace with 3. But in the output, the first two 0s are 3 and 4, which would fit if the first 0 is in column 1 (odd) replaced with 4, and the next in column 2 (even) replaced with 3. But in the output, the first 0 is replaced with 3, which would mean that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and implement it, even if it may not fit all examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for i, val in enumerate(row):\n            if val == 0:\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    new_row.append(3)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(4)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not work for all examples. For example, in example 1's first row, this would replace the 0s at columns 1 and 2 with 4 and 3, which would match the output's 3 and 4? No, because column 1 is odd (i=1, which is odd), so replaced with 4. Column 2 is even (i=2), replaced with 3. So the new_row would have 3 and 4 in those positions. But in the output, the first row is 1 3 4 4 3 ... So the first 0 is replaced with 3, which would mean that the code is incorrect.\n\nWait, in the code above, for i=1 (column 1), which is odd, it appends 4. But the output has 3 in that position. So this suggests that the code is wrong.\n\nHmm. Maybe the replacement is based on the row's parity. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 3 if column is even, and 4 if odd. In odd rows, it's the opposite.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the row's parity and column's parity. For example, if the row is even and column is even, replace with 3. If row is even and column is odd, replace with 4. If row is odd and column is even, replace with 4. If row is odd and column is odd, replace with 3. This would create a checkerboard pattern.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this for example 1's first row (row 0, even). Columns 1 (odd) and 2 (even). For even row, column 1 (odd) \u2192 4, column 2 (even) \u2192 3. So the first 0s are replaced with 4 and 3, which would match the output's 3 and 4? No, because in the output, the first 0 is replaced with 3. So this would not fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0s with 3 and 4 based on column parity, even if it may not fit all examples. This is the best I can do given the time.\n"
