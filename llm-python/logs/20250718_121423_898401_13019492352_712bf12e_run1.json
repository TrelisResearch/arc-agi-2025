          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. Let's take a look at Example 1 first.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid is 12x13, and the output is also 12x13. The input has some 5s and 0s, and the output has some 2s and 5s. Hmm. Let me compare some positions.\n\nLooking at the first row of input and output. Input first row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. Output is 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0. So the third column in input is 0, and in output it's 2. The fourth column in input is 0, output is 2. The fifth is 0, output is 0. Wait, but the output has 2 in the fourth column. So maybe there's some pattern where certain positions are being replaced with 2s based on some condition.\n\nLooking at the first row of input, the 5s are at positions 1 and 9 (assuming 0-based index). In the output, the 5s are still there, but there are new 2s in positions 3 and 10. Maybe the 2s are introduced in certain positions related to the 5s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are appearing where there's a 5 in the input. But looking at the first row, the 5s are at positions 1 and 9. The output has 2s at positions 3 and 10. Wait, maybe there's some kind of pattern where 2s are placed in positions that are adjacent to the 5s? Or maybe in certain columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values based on their positions. For example, in the first row of input, the 5s are at columns 1 and 9. The output has 2s in columns 3 and 10. Maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are two columns away from the 5s? Let's check: 1 + 2 = 3, 9 + 1 = 10? Not sure. Maybe not.\n\nLooking at the third row of input: 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0. Output is 5 0 0 2 0 0 2 5 0 2 0 5 0. So in the input, there are 5s at positions 0, 7, and 12. The output has 2s at positions 3, 6, and 9. Hmm. Maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are three columns away from the 5s? For example, position 0 (5) has a 2 at position 3 (0+3=3). Position 7 (5) has a 2 at position 6 (7-1=6?), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in certain columns, like columns 3, 6, 9. Wait, in the third row, the output has 2s at columns 3, 6, 9. The input has 5s at positions 0, 7, 12. Maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are multiples of 3? Like 3, 6, 9. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the 2s seem to be in columns 3, 6, 9, etc. Maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are multiples of 3? But in the first row, the output has 2 in column 3. In the third row, 2 in columns 3, 6, 9. Maybe that's a pattern. But then in the second row of input, the output has 2s in column 3 and 10. Wait, column 3 is 3, and column 10 is 10. Maybe that's not a multiple of 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column index is even? Or some other pattern. Alternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are in certain rows or columns based on the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original input has a 5 in the same row or column. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has some 5s and 0s, and the output has 2s and 5s. For instance, in the first row of input, the output has 2s in columns 4 and 13 (assuming 0-based index). Wait, the first row of input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 2 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 2. So the 2s are at column 4 and 13. The input has a 5 at column 6 and 10. So maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are adjacent to the 5s? For example, column 4 is next to column 6 (difference of 2), but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in certain positions based on the original grid's structure. For example, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, but shifted by a certain amount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are in the same column as a 5 in the input. For example, in the first row of input, the 5 is at column 6. The output has a 2 at column 4 (which is two columns to the left) and column 13 (which is two columns to the right of column 11? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in certain columns. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s in columns 3, 6, 9, etc. Maybe columns that are multiples of 3. Let's check:\n\nIn example 1, first row output has 2 at column 3 (3 is multiple of 3). Third row output has 2 at columns 3, 6, 9 (all multiples of 3). Second row output has 2 at column 3 and 10. Wait, 10 is not a multiple of 3. Hmm, that breaks the pattern. Maybe not.\n\nLooking at example 2's first row output: columns 4 and 13. 4 is not a multiple of 3, 13 is not. So that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original input has a 5 in the same row, but shifted by a certain number of columns. For example, in example 1's first row, the input has 5s at columns 1 and 9. The output has 2s at columns 3 and 10. So 1 + 2 = 3, 9 + 1 = 10. Maybe adding 2 and 1 respectively. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in certain positions based on the original grid's 5s. For example, in the first row of example 1, the 5s are at positions (0,1) and (0,9). The output has 2s at (0,3) and (0,10). So 1 + 2 = 3, 9 + 1 = 10. Maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are two columns to the right of the 5s in the first case, and one column to the right in the second case. That seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even. For example, in example 1's first row, columns 3 (odd), 10 (even). But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, and the column is in a certain range. For example, in the first row of example 1, the 5s are at columns 1 and 9. The output has 2s at columns 3 and 10. So perhaps the 2s are placed in columns that are between the 5s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are in certain columns based on the original grid's structure. For example, columns 3, 6, 9, etc., which are every third column. Let's check example 2's first row output: columns 4 and 13. 4 is not a multiple of 3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, and the column is in the same column as the 5's position plus or minus some value. For example, in example 1's first row, the 5 is at column 1. The output has a 2 at column 3 (which is 1 + 2). The other 5 is at column 9, and the output has a 2 at column 10 (which is 9 + 1). That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in certain positions based on the row number. For example, in row 0, the 2s are in columns 3 and 10. Row 1 has 2s in columns 3 and 10. Row 2 has 2s in columns 3, 6, 9. Maybe there's a pattern based on the row index. For example, row 0: 3, 10. Row 1: 3, 10. Row 2: 3, 6, 9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column index is (row + column) mod something. But without more data, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 3. The input has some 5s and 2s. The output has 2s and 5s. For example, in the first row of input, the output has 2s in columns 3, 6, 9. Maybe that's a pattern. But the input in example 3's first row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output is 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 5 0 2 0 0 2 5 5. So the 2s are in columns 5, 6, 9, 12. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, and the column is in the same column as the 5's position plus some value. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same column, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 2s seem to be in columns that are 3, 6, 9, etc. For example, in the third row, output has 2s in columns 3, 6, 9. In the first row, 3 and 10. Maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are multiples of 3, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are even numbers. For example, in the first row, 3 is odd, 10 is even. That's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in certain columns based on the row. For example, in even rows, columns 3, 6, 9; in odd rows, columns 3 and 10. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column index is in the same row as a 5 in the input. For example, if there's a 5 in the input, then the output has a 2 in certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original input has a 5 in the same row, but shifted by a certain number of columns. For example, in example 1, the first row has 5s at columns 1 and 9. The output has 2s at columns 3 and 10. So 1 + 2 = 3, 9 + 1 = 10. Maybe for each 5, the 2 is placed two columns to the right, but for the second 5, one column to the right. That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are in the same column as the 5s in the input. For example, if a 5 is in column x, then the output has a 2 in column x. But that doesn't fit the examples. For example, in example 1's first row, the input has a 5 at column 1, but the output has a 2 at column 3. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions, and the 5s are still there. Maybe the 2s are replacing certain 0s based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row and column. For example, if a 5 is in the input, then the output has a 2 in the same column. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, but in certain columns. For example, in example 1's first row, the 5s are at columns 1 and 9. The output has 2s at columns 3 and 10. So maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are two columns to the right of the first 5 and one column to the right of the second 5. That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are in the same column as the 5s in the input, but shifted. For example, if there's a 5 in column x, then the output has a 2 in column x + some value. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 3. The input has a 5 in column 12 (third row, input is 0 5 5 2 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 5 5 0). The output has a 2 in column 12? Wait, the third row of output is 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 5 0 2 0 0 2 5 5. So column 12 is 2. The input's third row has a 5 at column 12 (assuming 0-based). So the output has a 2 there. So maybe when there's a 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the same column. But that's not the case. For example, in example 1's first row, the input has a 5 at column 1, but the output has a 2 at column 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in certain columns based on the row. For example, in even rows, certain columns are filled with 2s. But I need to find a pattern that works across all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid's value is 5, but that's not the case. For example, in example 1's first row, the 5s are at columns 1 and 9, and the output has 2s at columns 3 and 10.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 2s in columns 3, 6, 9, etc. Maybe those are columns that are multiples of 3. Let's check:\n\nIn example 1's first row, column 3 is 3 (multiple of 3). Column 10 is not. But in the third row, columns 3, 6, 9 are multiples of 3. In the second row of example 1, the output has 2s at columns 3 and 10. 3 is a multiple of 3, but 10 is not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are even. For example, column 3 is odd, column 10 is even. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column index is in the same row as a 5 in the input. For example, in example 1's first row, there are 5s in columns 1 and 9. The output has 2s in columns 3 and 10. Maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are between the 5s. Like, between 1 and 9, there are columns 2-8. But the 2s are in columns 3 and 10. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, and the column is in a certain range. For example, if a 5 is in column x, then the output has a 2 in column x+2. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the test input. The test input is 12x13. Let's look at the test input's first row: 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output is not given, but the task is to write the transformation function. However, the test input is just for context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values based on their positions. For example, if the original grid has a 5 in column x, then the output has a 2 in column x+2. Or some other formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are in the same column as the 5s in the input, but shifted by a certain amount. For example, if there's a 5 in column x, then the output has a 2 in column x+2. But in example 1's first row, the 5 is at column 1, and the output has a 2 at column 3 (1+2=3). The other 5 is at column 9, and the output has a 2 at column 10 (9+1=10). That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even. For example, column 3 is odd, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is a multiple of 3. For example, in the third row of example 1, the output has 2s at columns 3, 6, 9 (all multiples of 3). In the first row, the output has a 2 at column 3 (multiple of 3) and 10 (not). So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are in certain positions based on the row. For example, in even rows, columns 3, 6, 9, etc. But I need to find a consistent pattern.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 2s are placed in columns that are 3, 6, 9, etc., but only in certain rows. For example, in row 0, columns 3 and 10. In row 1, columns 3 and 10. In row 2, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 3, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 4, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 5, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 6, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 7, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 8, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 9, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 10, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 11, columns 3, 6, 9. Wait, but in example 1's output, row 0 has 2s at columns 3 and 10. That doesn't fit. So maybe this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. For example, in example 1's first row, column 3 is 3, column 10 is not. But in row 2, columns 3, 6, 9. So maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are multiples of 3. But why in row 0, the 2 is at column 3 and 10?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Perhaps the 2s are placed in certain positions based on the original grid's structure. For example, the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, and the column is in a certain range. Or maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, and the column is in the same column as the 5's position plus some offset. For example, in example 1's first row, the 5 is at column 1. The output has a 2 at column 3 (1 + 2). The other 5 is at column 9, and the output has a 2 at column 10 (9 + 1). So the offset varies.\n\nThis seems too arbitrary. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at the output of example 1's third row. Input is 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0. Output is 5 0 0 2 0 0 2 5 0 2 0 5 0. So the 2s are at columns 3, 6, 9. The input has 5s at columns 0, 7, 12. The output has 2s at columns 3, 6, 9. These are three columns apart. Maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are three columns away from the 5s in the input. For example, column 0 (5) has a 2 at column 3 (0+3=3). Column 7 (5) has a 2 at column 6 (7-1=6). Column 12 (5) has a 2 at column 9 (12-3=9). Not sure. But this seems like a possible pattern.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each 5 in the input, we look for a 2 in columns that are 3 columns to the right, or some other offset. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are 3 columns away from the 5s in the input. For example, if a 5 is at column x, then the 2 is at x+3. But in example 1's third row, the 5 at column 0 has a 2 at column 3 (0+3=3). The 5 at column 7 has a 2 at column 6 (7-1=6). That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are 3 columns to the right of the 5s in the input. For example, column 0+3=3. Column 7+3=10. But in the third row of example 1, the output has 2 at column 6, which is 7-1=6. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's third row, the output has 2s at columns 3, 6, 9. These are three columns apart. So maybe for each row, the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, etc., but only if there are 5s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are multiples of 3, and the 5s are still present. But this seems like a possible pattern.\n\nLet me check example 2's output. In example 2's first row, the output has 2s at columns 4 and 13. 4 is not a multiple of 3, 13 is not. So that breaks the pattern.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's think about the output of example 1's first row: 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0. The 2s are at columns 3 and 10. The input's first row has 5s at columns 1 and 9. So maybe the 2s are placed at columns that are (column of 5) + 2 and (column of 5) + 1. For example, 1+2=3, 9+1=10. That's a possible pattern. But why?\n\nIf that's the case, then for each 5 in the input, we add 2 to its column to get a 2 in the output. But for the second 5 in the first row, adding 1 to its column gives 10. So this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is the same as the column of the 5 plus 2, or minus 1, depending on the row.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Maybe the pattern is that 2s are placed in certain columns based on the row. For example, in even rows, columns 3, 6, 9, and in odd rows, columns 3 and 10. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are in the same column as the 5s in the input, but shifted by a certain number of columns. For example, if a 5 is in column x, then the output has a 2 in column x+2. But in example 1's first row, the 5 at column 1 has a 2 at column 3 (1+2=3), and the 5 at column 9 has a 2 at column 10 (9+1=10). So this is inconsistent.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are even numbers. For example, column 3 is odd, but that doesn't fit. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, and the column is in a certain range. For example, if the 5 is in column x, then the output has a 2 in column x+2. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. But since I need to write a Python function, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that the output has 2s in certain columns, and the 5s are still present. Maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are multiples of 3. For example, in example 1's third row, columns 3, 6, 9. In example 1's first row, column 3 is a multiple of 3, but column 10 is not. So maybe this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are 3, 6, 9, etc., and the 5s are still present. For example, in example 1's third row, the 2s are in columns 3, 6, 9. So perhaps for each row, the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, etc., but only if there are 5s in the input.\n\nBut how to implement that. Maybe for each row, we check if there are 5s, and if so, replace certain columns with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. Let's check:\n\nIn example 1's third row, columns 3, 6, 9 are 2s. In the second row, columns 3 and 10 are 2s. But 10 is not a multiple of 3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are 3, 6, 9, 12, etc., but for some rows, it's different.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are in the same column as the 5s in the input, but shifted by a certain amount. For example, in example 1's first row, the 5s are at columns 1 and 9. The output has 2s at columns 3 and 10. So maybe the 2s are placed at columns 1+2=3 and 9+1=10. So for each 5, we add 2 to its column for the first one, and add 1 for the second. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are the same as the column of the 5 plus 2. So for the first 5, column 1 + 2 = 3. For the second 5, column 9 + 1 = 10. But why add 1?\n\nThis is not helpful. Maybe the pattern is that for each 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the same column as the 5 plus 2, but only if that column is within the grid.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the 5 is at column 1. Adding 2 gives column 3. The 5 is at column 9. Adding 2 gives 11, but in the output, it's 10. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are two columns to the right of the 5's column. So for example, if the 5 is at column x, then the 2 is at x+2. But in example 1's first row, the 5 at column 9 would have a 2 at column 11. But the output has a 2 at column 10. So that's not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at the test input. The test input has a row like 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output is not known, but the task is to write the transformation.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in column 3, 6, 9, or 12, then replace it with 2 if the original value is 5. Or some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, etc., and the 5s are kept. For example, in example 1's third row, the 2s are in columns 3, 6, 9. So perhaps for each row, the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. Let's check example 1's first row: the output has 2s at columns 3 and 10. Column 10 is not in the 3,6,9,12 sequence. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are in the same row as the 5s in the input. For example, if a 5 is in the input, then the output has a 2 in the same column. But in example 1's first row, the 5 is at column 1, but the output has a 2 at column 3. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even. For example, in example 1's first row, column 3 is odd, but 10 is even. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are 3, 6, 9, 12, etc., but for some rows, it's different. For example, in even rows, columns 3, 6, 9, and in odd rows, columns 3 and 10. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Let's assume that the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, etc., and that the 5s are kept. So for each row, we check if the column is in [3, 6, 9, 12], and replace the value with 2 if it's 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, and the 5s are kept. So for example, in the first row of example 1, the output has 2s in columns 3 and 10. But 10 is not in the list. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, and 12, and the 5s are kept. So in example 1's first row, the 2 is at column 3, and the other 2 is at column 10, which is not in the list. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to write a function that replaces certain columns with 2s based on the rows. For example, for each row, if it's even, replace columns 3, 6, 9, 12 with 2. If it's odd, replace columns 3 and 10 with 2. This is a guess, but it might work for the examples.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with example 1:\n\nExample 1's first row is row 0 (even). So replace columns 3, 6, 9, 12 with 2. But in the output, the first row has 2 at columns 3 and 10. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each row, replace columns 3, 6, 9, 12 with 2. But in example 1's first row, the output has 2 at column 3 and 10. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, and 12, and the 5s are kept. So for example, in the third row of example 1, the output has 2s at 3, 6, 9, which fits. But in the first row, the output has 2 at 3 and 10, which doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe the pattern is that in each row, the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, and 12, but only if the original value is 0. For example, in the first row of example 1, the input has 0 at column 3, so it's replaced with 2. But the input has 0 at column 10, so it's replaced with 2. But why?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to look for a pattern where the 2s are placed in certain columns based on the row and column indices.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the 2s are placed in columns that are 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. For example, in row 2, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 3, columns 3, 6, 9. So maybe for rows 0-11, the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12. But why in the first row, the output has 2 at column 10?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each row, the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12. So for example, in row 0, columns 3, 6, 9, 12 are replaced with 2. But in the first row of example 1, the output has 2 at column 3 and 10. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are 3, 6, 9, 12, and 13. But that's not possible.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. I'll have to make an assumption and proceed. Let's assume that the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, and the 5s are kept. So, for each row, we replace the value at columns 3, 6, 9, 12 with 2 if the original value is 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, and the 5s are kept. So, for each row, the 2s are placed in these columns, regardless of the original value. But this would mean that in example 1's first row, the output has 2s in columns 3, 6, 9, 12. But the actual output has 2s in columns 3 and 10. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, and the 5s are kept. So, for each row, replace the value at these columns with 2. This might not fit all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in [3, 6, 9, 12]:\n            transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace all columns 3, 6, 9, 12 with 2, regardless of the original value. Let's test this against example 1's first row. The first row of the input is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The output should have 2s at columns 3, 6, 9, 12. So transformed[0][3] = 2, transformed[0][6] = 2, transformed[0][9] = 2, transformed[0][12] = 2. But the actual output in example 1's first row is 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0. So the 2s are at columns 3 and 10. This doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, but only if the original value is 0. So, for example, in the first row of example 1, the original value at column 3 is 0, so it's replaced with 2. The original value at column 6 is 0, replaced with 2. Column 9 is 5, so it's not replaced. Column 12 is 0, replaced with 2. But the output has a 2 at column 10, which is not in this list. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for another pattern. Maybe the 2s are placed in certain positions based on the row and column indices. For example, for each row i and column j, if (i + j) is even, then replace with 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is 3, 6, 9, 12, and the row is even. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of example 1's first row. The 2s are at columns 3 and 10. 3 is 3, 10 is 10. 3 is 3, 10 is 3 + 7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are 3, 6, 9, 12, and for some rows, it's different. For example, in even rows, columns 3, 6, 9, 12; in odd rows, columns 3, 6, 9, 12. But this is the same as before.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, and 10. But 10 is not in the list. So this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to write a function that replaces certain columns with 2s based on the row. For example, for each row, replace columns 3, 6, 9, 12 with 2. This might not fit all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut since the examples don't match, I need to think of another approach. Maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are in the same row as the 5s in the input. For example, if a row has a 5 in column x, then the output has a 2 in column x+2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are 3, 6, 9, 12, and the 5s are kept. So the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in [3, 6, 9, 12]:\n            transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace all those columns with 2, which may not match the examples. However, in example 1's third row, the output has 2s at columns 3, 6, 9, which fits. In the first row, the output has 2 at column 3 and 10. So this doesn't fit. But maybe the test input has other patterns.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with this code and see if it passes the examples. But this is likely incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, but only if the original value is 0. So:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in [3, 6, 9, 12]:\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the original value at column 3 is 0, so it's replaced with 2. At column 6, it's 0, replaced with 2. At column 9, it's 5, so not replaced. At column 12, it's 0, replaced with 2. So the transformed row would be 0 5 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 5 0 0 2. But the actual output is 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0. So this doesn't match. The column 6 is 2 in the transformed row, but in the output it's 0. So this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different assumption. Maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, and the column is in a certain range. For example, for each 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the same column plus 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed[i][j+2] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would add 2 to the column of each 5. However, this might cause out-of-bounds errors. For example, if j is 11, then j+2 is 13, which is out of bounds (since columns are 0-12). So this needs to be handled.\n\nLet's test this with example 1's first row. The input has 5 at column 1 and 9. So transformed[i][3] = 2 and transformed[i][11] = 2. But in the output, the first row has 2 at column 3 and 10. So this is not matching.\n\nBut in the first row of example 1, the output has 2 at column 10. So this would require that j+2 = 10, so j=8. But the input has a 5 at column 9, so j+2=11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess. Perhaps the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, and the 5s are kept. So, the code is as follows:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in [3, 6, 9, 12]:\n            transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nEven though this doesn't match the examples, it's the best I can do based on the patterns I observed. However, this is likely incorrect. But given the time constraints, this is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. Let's take a look at Example 1 first.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid is 12x13, and the output is also 12x13. The input has some 5s and 0s, and the output has some 2s and 5s. Hmm. Let me compare some positions.\n\nLooking at the first row of input and output. Input first row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. Output is 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0. So the third column in input is 0, and in output it's 2. The fourth column in input is 0, output is 2. The fifth is 0, output is 0. Wait, but the output has 2 in the fourth column. So maybe there's some pattern where certain positions are being replaced with 2s based on some condition.\n\nLooking at the first row of input, the 5s are at positions 1 and 9 (assuming 0-based index). In the output, the 5s are still there, but there are new 2s in positions 3 and 10. Maybe the 2s are introduced in certain positions related to the 5s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are appearing where there's a 5 in the input. But looking at the first row, the 5s are at positions 1 and 9. The output has 2s at positions 3 and 10. Wait, maybe there's some kind of pattern where 2s are placed in positions that are adjacent to the 5s? Or maybe in certain columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values based on their positions. For example, in the first row of input, the 5s are at columns 1 and 9. The output has 2s in columns 3 and 10. Maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are two columns away from the 5s? Let's check: 1 + 2 = 3, 9 + 1 = 10? Not sure. Maybe not.\n\nLooking at the third row of input: 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0. Output is 5 0 0 2 0 0 2 5 0 2 0 5 0. So in the input, there are 5s at positions 0, 7, and 12. The output has 2s at positions 3, 6, and 9. Hmm. Maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are three columns away from the 5s? For example, position 0 (5) has a 2 at position 3 (0+3=3). Position 7 (5) has a 2 at position 6 (7-1=6?), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in certain columns, like columns 3, 6, 9. Wait, in the third row, the output has 2s at columns 3, 6, 9. The input has 5s at positions 0, 7, 12. Maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are multiples of 3? Like 3, 6, 9. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the 2s seem to be in columns 3, 6, 9, etc. Maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are multiples of 3? But in the first row, the output has 2 in column 3. In the third row, 2 in columns 3, 6, 9. Maybe that's a pattern. But then in the second row of input, the output has 2s in column 3 and 10. Wait, column 3 is 3, and column 10 is 10. Maybe that's not a multiple of 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column index is even? Or some other pattern. Alternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are in certain rows or columns based on the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original input has a 5 in the same row or column. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has some 5s and 0s, and the output has 2s and 5s. For instance, in the first row of input, the output has 2s in columns 4 and 13 (assuming 0-based index). Wait, the first row of input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 2 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 2. So the 2s are at column 4 and 13. The input has a 5 at column 6 and 10. So maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are adjacent to the 5s? For example, column 4 is next to column 6 (difference of 2), but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in certain positions based on the original grid's structure. For example, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, but shifted by a certain amount.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are in the same column as a 5 in the input. For example, in the first row of input, the 5 is at column 6. The output has a 2 at column 4 (which is two columns to the left) and column 13 (which is two columns to the right of column 11? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in certain columns. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s in columns 3, 6, 9, etc. Maybe columns that are multiples of 3. Let's check:\n\nIn example 1, first row output has 2 at column 3 (3 is multiple of 3). Third row output has 2 at columns 3, 6, 9 (all multiples of 3). Second row output has 2 at column 3 and 10. Wait, 10 is not a multiple of 3. Hmm, that breaks the pattern. Maybe not.\n\nLooking at example 2's first row output: columns 4 and 13. 4 is not a multiple of 3, 13 is not. So that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original input has a 5 in the same row, but shifted by a certain number of columns. For example, in example 1's first row, the input has 5s at columns 1 and 9. The output has 2s at columns 3 and 10. So 1 + 2 = 3, 9 + 1 = 10. Maybe adding 2 and 1 respectively. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in certain positions based on the original grid's 5s. For example, in the first row of example 1, the 5s are at positions (0,1) and (0,9). The output has 2s at (0,3) and (0,10). So 1 + 2 = 3, 9 + 1 = 10. Maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are two columns to the right of the 5s in the first case, and one column to the right in the second case. That seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even. For example, in example 1's first row, columns 3 (odd), 10 (even). But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, and the column is in a certain range. For example, in the first row of example 1, the 5s are at columns 1 and 9. The output has 2s at columns 3 and 10. So perhaps the 2s are placed in columns that are between the 5s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are in certain columns based on the original grid's structure. For example, columns 3, 6, 9, etc., which are every third column. Let's check example 2's first row output: columns 4 and 13. 4 is not a multiple of 3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, and the column is in the same column as the 5's position plus or minus some value. For example, in example 1's first row, the 5 is at column 1. The output has a 2 at column 3 (which is 1 + 2). The other 5 is at column 9, and the output has a 2 at column 10 (which is 9 + 1). That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in certain positions based on the row number. For example, in row 0, the 2s are in columns 3 and 10. Row 1 has 2s in columns 3 and 10. Row 2 has 2s in columns 3, 6, 9. Maybe there's a pattern based on the row index. For example, row 0: 3, 10. Row 1: 3, 10. Row 2: 3, 6, 9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column index is (row + column) mod something. But without more data, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 3. The input has some 5s and 2s. The output has 2s and 5s. For example, in the first row of input, the output has 2s in columns 3, 6, 9. Maybe that's a pattern. But the input in example 3's first row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output is 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 5 0 2 0 0 2 5 5. So the 2s are in columns 5, 6, 9, 12. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, and the column is in the same column as the 5's position plus some value. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same column, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 2s seem to be in columns that are 3, 6, 9, etc. For example, in the third row, output has 2s in columns 3, 6, 9. In the first row, 3 and 10. Maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are multiples of 3, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are even numbers. For example, in the first row, 3 is odd, 10 is even. That's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in certain columns based on the row. For example, in even rows, columns 3, 6, 9; in odd rows, columns 3 and 10. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column index is in the same row as a 5 in the input. For example, if there's a 5 in the input, then the output has a 2 in certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original input has a 5 in the same row, but shifted by a certain number of columns. For example, in example 1, the first row has 5s at columns 1 and 9. The output has 2s at columns 3 and 10. So 1 + 2 = 3, 9 + 1 = 10. Maybe for each 5, the 2 is placed two columns to the right, but for the second 5, one column to the right. That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are in the same column as the 5s in the input. For example, if a 5 is in column x, then the output has a 2 in column x. But that doesn't fit the examples. For example, in example 1's first row, the input has a 5 at column 1, but the output has a 2 at column 3. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions, and the 5s are still there. Maybe the 2s are replacing certain 0s based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row and column. For example, if a 5 is in the input, then the output has a 2 in the same column. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, but in certain columns. For example, in example 1's first row, the 5s are at columns 1 and 9. The output has 2s at columns 3 and 10. So maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are two columns to the right of the first 5 and one column to the right of the second 5. That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are in the same column as the 5s in the input, but shifted. For example, if there's a 5 in column x, then the output has a 2 in column x + some value. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 3. The input has a 5 in column 12 (third row, input is 0 5 5 2 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 5 5 0). The output has a 2 in column 12? Wait, the third row of output is 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 5 0 2 0 0 2 5 5. So column 12 is 2. The input's third row has a 5 at column 12 (assuming 0-based). So the output has a 2 there. So maybe when there's a 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the same column. But that's not the case. For example, in example 1's first row, the input has a 5 at column 1, but the output has a 2 at column 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in certain columns based on the row. For example, in even rows, certain columns are filled with 2s. But I need to find a pattern that works across all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid's value is 5, but that's not the case. For example, in example 1's first row, the 5s are at columns 1 and 9, and the output has 2s at columns 3 and 10.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 2s in columns 3, 6, 9, etc. Maybe those are columns that are multiples of 3. Let's check:\n\nIn example 1's first row, column 3 is 3 (multiple of 3). Column 10 is not. But in the third row, columns 3, 6, 9 are multiples of 3. In the second row of example 1, the output has 2s at columns 3 and 10. 3 is a multiple of 3, but 10 is not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are even. For example, column 3 is odd, column 10 is even. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column index is in the same row as a 5 in the input. For example, in example 1's first row, there are 5s in columns 1 and 9. The output has 2s in columns 3 and 10. Maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are between the 5s. Like, between 1 and 9, there are columns 2-8. But the 2s are in columns 3 and 10. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, and the column is in a certain range. For example, if a 5 is in column x, then the output has a 2 in column x+2. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the test input. The test input is 12x13. Let's look at the test input's first row: 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output is not given, but the task is to write the transformation function. However, the test input is just for context.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values based on their positions. For example, if the original grid has a 5 in column x, then the output has a 2 in column x+2. Or some other formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are in the same column as the 5s in the input, but shifted by a certain amount. For example, if there's a 5 in column x, then the output has a 2 in column x+2. But in example 1's first row, the 5 is at column 1, and the output has a 2 at column 3 (1+2=3). The other 5 is at column 9, and the output has a 2 at column 10 (9+1=10). That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even. For example, column 3 is odd, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is a multiple of 3. For example, in the third row of example 1, the output has 2s at columns 3, 6, 9 (all multiples of 3). In the first row, the output has a 2 at column 3 (multiple of 3) and 10 (not). So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are in certain positions based on the row. For example, in even rows, columns 3, 6, 9, etc. But I need to find a consistent pattern.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 2s are placed in columns that are 3, 6, 9, etc., but only in certain rows. For example, in row 0, columns 3 and 10. In row 1, columns 3 and 10. In row 2, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 3, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 4, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 5, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 6, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 7, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 8, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 9, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 10, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 11, columns 3, 6, 9. Wait, but in example 1's output, row 0 has 2s at columns 3 and 10. That doesn't fit. So maybe this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. For example, in example 1's first row, column 3 is 3, column 10 is not. But in row 2, columns 3, 6, 9. So maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are multiples of 3. But why in row 0, the 2 is at column 3 and 10?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Perhaps the 2s are placed in certain positions based on the original grid's structure. For example, the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, and the column is in a certain range. Or maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, and the column is in the same column as the 5's position plus some offset. For example, in example 1's first row, the 5 is at column 1. The output has a 2 at column 3 (1 + 2). The other 5 is at column 9, and the output has a 2 at column 10 (9 + 1). So the offset varies.\n\nThis seems too arbitrary. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at the output of example 1's third row. Input is 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0. Output is 5 0 0 2 0 0 2 5 0 2 0 5 0. So the 2s are at columns 3, 6, 9. The input has 5s at columns 0, 7, 12. The output has 2s at columns 3, 6, 9. These are three columns apart. Maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are three columns away from the 5s in the input. For example, column 0 (5) has a 2 at column 3 (0+3=3). Column 7 (5) has a 2 at column 6 (7-1=6). Column 12 (5) has a 2 at column 9 (12-3=9). Not sure. But this seems like a possible pattern.\n\nIf that's the case, then for each 5 in the input, we look for a 2 in columns that are 3 columns to the right, or some other offset. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are 3 columns away from the 5s in the input. For example, if a 5 is at column x, then the 2 is at x+3. But in example 1's third row, the 5 at column 0 has a 2 at column 3 (0+3=3). The 5 at column 7 has a 2 at column 6 (7-1=6). That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are 3 columns to the right of the 5s in the input. For example, column 0+3=3. Column 7+3=10. But in the third row of example 1, the output has 2 at column 6, which is 7-1=6. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's third row, the output has 2s at columns 3, 6, 9. These are three columns apart. So maybe for each row, the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, etc., but only if there are 5s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are multiples of 3, and the 5s are still present. But this seems like a possible pattern.\n\nLet me check example 2's output. In example 2's first row, the output has 2s at columns 4 and 13. 4 is not a multiple of 3, 13 is not. So that breaks the pattern.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's think about the output of example 1's first row: 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0. The 2s are at columns 3 and 10. The input's first row has 5s at columns 1 and 9. So maybe the 2s are placed at columns that are (column of 5) + 2 and (column of 5) + 1. For example, 1+2=3, 9+1=10. That's a possible pattern. But why?\n\nIf that's the case, then for each 5 in the input, we add 2 to its column to get a 2 in the output. But for the second 5 in the first row, adding 1 to its column gives 10. So this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is the same as the column of the 5 plus 2, or minus 1, depending on the row.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Maybe the pattern is that 2s are placed in certain columns based on the row. For example, in even rows, columns 3, 6, 9, and in odd rows, columns 3 and 10. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are in the same column as the 5s in the input, but shifted by a certain number of columns. For example, if a 5 is in column x, then the output has a 2 in column x+2. But in example 1's first row, the 5 at column 1 has a 2 at column 3 (1+2=3), and the 5 at column 9 has a 2 at column 10 (9+1=10). So this is inconsistent.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are even numbers. For example, column 3 is odd, but that doesn't fit. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, and the column is in a certain range. For example, if the 5 is in column x, then the output has a 2 in column x+2. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. But since I need to write a Python function, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that the output has 2s in certain columns, and the 5s are still present. Maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are multiples of 3. For example, in example 1's third row, columns 3, 6, 9. In example 1's first row, column 3 is a multiple of 3, but column 10 is not. So maybe this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are 3, 6, 9, etc., and the 5s are still present. For example, in example 1's third row, the 2s are in columns 3, 6, 9. So perhaps for each row, the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, etc., but only if there are 5s in the input.\n\nBut how to implement that. Maybe for each row, we check if there are 5s, and if so, replace certain columns with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. Let's check:\n\nIn example 1's third row, columns 3, 6, 9 are 2s. In the second row, columns 3 and 10 are 2s. But 10 is not a multiple of 3. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are 3, 6, 9, 12, etc., but for some rows, it's different.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are in the same column as the 5s in the input, but shifted by a certain amount. For example, in example 1's first row, the 5s are at columns 1 and 9. The output has 2s at columns 3 and 10. So maybe the 2s are placed at columns 1+2=3 and 9+1=10. So for each 5, we add 2 to its column for the first one, and add 1 for the second. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are the same as the column of the 5 plus 2. So for the first 5, column 1 + 2 = 3. For the second 5, column 9 + 1 = 10. But why add 1?\n\nThis is not helpful. Maybe the pattern is that for each 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the same column as the 5 plus 2, but only if that column is within the grid.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the 5 is at column 1. Adding 2 gives column 3. The 5 is at column 9. Adding 2 gives 11, but in the output, it's 10. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are two columns to the right of the 5's column. So for example, if the 5 is at column x, then the 2 is at x+2. But in example 1's first row, the 5 at column 9 would have a 2 at column 11. But the output has a 2 at column 10. So that's not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at the test input. The test input has a row like 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output is not known, but the task is to write the transformation.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in column 3, 6, 9, or 12, then replace it with 2 if the original value is 5. Or some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, etc., and the 5s are kept. For example, in example 1's third row, the 2s are in columns 3, 6, 9. So perhaps for each row, the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. Let's check example 1's first row: the output has 2s at columns 3 and 10. Column 10 is not in the 3,6,9,12 sequence. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are in the same row as the 5s in the input. For example, if a 5 is in the input, then the output has a 2 in the same column. But in example 1's first row, the 5 is at column 1, but the output has a 2 at column 3. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is even. For example, in example 1's first row, column 3 is odd, but 10 is even. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are 3, 6, 9, 12, etc., but for some rows, it's different. For example, in even rows, columns 3, 6, 9, and in odd rows, columns 3 and 10. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Let's assume that the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, etc., and that the 5s are kept. So for each row, we check if the column is in [3, 6, 9, 12], and replace the value with 2 if it's 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, and the 5s are kept. So for example, in the first row of example 1, the output has 2s in columns 3 and 10. But 10 is not in the list. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, and 12, and the 5s are kept. So in example 1's first row, the 2 is at column 3, and the other 2 is at column 10, which is not in the list. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to write a function that replaces certain columns with 2s based on the rows. For example, for each row, if it's even, replace columns 3, 6, 9, 12 with 2. If it's odd, replace columns 3 and 10 with 2. This is a guess, but it might work for the examples.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with example 1:\n\nExample 1's first row is row 0 (even). So replace columns 3, 6, 9, 12 with 2. But in the output, the first row has 2 at columns 3 and 10. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each row, replace columns 3, 6, 9, 12 with 2. But in example 1's first row, the output has 2 at column 3 and 10. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, and 12, and the 5s are kept. So for example, in the third row of example 1, the output has 2s at 3, 6, 9, which fits. But in the first row, the output has 2 at 3 and 10, which doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe the pattern is that in each row, the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, and 12, but only if the original value is 0. For example, in the first row of example 1, the input has 0 at column 3, so it's replaced with 2. But the input has 0 at column 10, so it's replaced with 2. But why?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to look for a pattern where the 2s are placed in certain columns based on the row and column indices.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the 2s are placed in columns that are 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. For example, in row 2, columns 3, 6, 9. In row 3, columns 3, 6, 9. So maybe for rows 0-11, the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12. But why in the first row, the output has 2 at column 10?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each row, the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12. So for example, in row 0, columns 3, 6, 9, 12 are replaced with 2. But in the first row of example 1, the output has 2 at column 3 and 10. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are 3, 6, 9, 12, and 13. But that's not possible.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. I'll have to make an assumption and proceed. Let's assume that the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, and the 5s are kept. So, for each row, we replace the value at columns 3, 6, 9, 12 with 2 if the original value is 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, and the 5s are kept. So, for each row, the 2s are placed in these columns, regardless of the original value. But this would mean that in example 1's first row, the output has 2s in columns 3, 6, 9, 12. But the actual output has 2s in columns 3 and 10. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, and the 5s are kept. So, for each row, replace the value at these columns with 2. This might not fit all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in [3, 6, 9, 12]:\n            transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace all columns 3, 6, 9, 12 with 2, regardless of the original value. Let's test this against example 1's first row. The first row of the input is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The output should have 2s at columns 3, 6, 9, 12. So transformed[0][3] = 2, transformed[0][6] = 2, transformed[0][9] = 2, transformed[0][12] = 2. But the actual output in example 1's first row is 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0. So the 2s are at columns 3 and 10. This doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, but only if the original value is 0. So, for example, in the first row of example 1, the original value at column 3 is 0, so it's replaced with 2. The original value at column 6 is 0, replaced with 2. Column 9 is 5, so it's not replaced. Column 12 is 0, replaced with 2. But the output has a 2 at column 10, which is not in this list. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for another pattern. Maybe the 2s are placed in certain positions based on the row and column indices. For example, for each row i and column j, if (i + j) is even, then replace with 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is 3, 6, 9, 12, and the row is even. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of example 1's first row. The 2s are at columns 3 and 10. 3 is 3, 10 is 10. 3 is 3, 10 is 3 + 7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are 3, 6, 9, 12, and for some rows, it's different. For example, in even rows, columns 3, 6, 9, 12; in odd rows, columns 3, 6, 9, 12. But this is the same as before.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, and 10. But 10 is not in the list. So this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to write a function that replaces certain columns with 2s based on the row. For example, for each row, replace columns 3, 6, 9, 12 with 2. This might not fit all examples, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut since the examples don't match, I need to think of another approach. Maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are in the same row as the 5s in the input. For example, if a row has a 5 in column x, then the output has a 2 in column x+2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are 3, 6, 9, 12, and the 5s are kept. So the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in [3, 6, 9, 12]:\n            transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace all those columns with 2, which may not match the examples. However, in example 1's third row, the output has 2s at columns 3, 6, 9, which fits. In the first row, the output has 2 at column 3 and 10. So this doesn't fit. But maybe the test input has other patterns.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with this code and see if it passes the examples. But this is likely incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, but only if the original value is 0. So:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in [3, 6, 9, 12]:\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the original value at column 3 is 0, so it's replaced with 2. At column 6, it's 0, replaced with 2. At column 9, it's 5, so not replaced. At column 12, it's 0, replaced with 2. So the transformed row would be 0 5 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 5 0 0 2. But the actual output is 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0. So this doesn't match. The column 6 is 2 in the transformed row, but in the output it's 0. So this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different assumption. Maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 5 in the same row, and the column is in a certain range. For example, for each 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the same column plus 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed[i][j+2] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would add 2 to the column of each 5. However, this might cause out-of-bounds errors. For example, if j is 11, then j+2 is 13, which is out of bounds (since columns are 0-12). So this needs to be handled.\n\nLet's test this with example 1's first row. The input has 5 at column 1 and 9. So transformed[i][3] = 2 and transformed[i][11] = 2. But in the output, the first row has 2 at column 3 and 10. So this is not matching.\n\nBut in the first row of example 1, the output has 2 at column 10. So this would require that j+2 = 10, so j=8. But the input has a 5 at column 9, so j+2=11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess. Perhaps the 2s are placed in columns 3, 6, 9, 12, and the 5s are kept. So, the code is as follows:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in [3, 6, 9, 12]:\n            transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nEven though this doesn't match the examples, it's the best I can do based on the patterns I observed. However, this is likely incorrect. But given the time constraints, this is the best I can do.\n"
