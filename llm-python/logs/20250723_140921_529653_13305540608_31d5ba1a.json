              "content": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the training examples and identify patterns that map the input grid to the output grid. Let's examine the examples closely:\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The input grid contains numbers from 0 to 9.\n   - The output grid contains the number 6 in place of certain numbers from the input grid.\n   - The numbers that are replaced by 6 are typically surrounded by other numbers, forming specific patterns.\n\n2. **Pattern Observation:**\n   - The number 9 is often replaced by 6.\n   - The number 4 is often replaced by 6.\n   - The number 0 is often replaced by 6.\n\n3. **Transformation Logic:**\n   - We need to replace 9, 4, and 0 with 6 in the input grid.\n   - The replacement should be done based on their positions and the surrounding numbers.\n\nLet's implement this logic in a Python function:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]  # Create a copy of the input grid\n    \n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if grid[i][j] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each cell in the input grid and replaces 9, 4, and 0 with 6. The transformed grid is then returned.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]  # Create a copy of the input grid\n    \n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if grid[i][j] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
