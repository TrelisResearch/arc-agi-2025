          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find a pattern that maps input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe that:\n1. The transformation seems to involve spreading or expanding certain values (like 1s and 2s) in a specific pattern\n2. The values 1 and 2 seem to be the ones that are being transformed, while 0 remains unchanged\n3. The transformation appears to be a kind of \"expansion\" or \"spread\" of the values in certain directions\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading the values 1 and 2 in a specific pattern, possibly in a diagonal or directional spread.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is 1 or 2, spread it to adjacent cells\n            if grid[i][j] in [1, 2]:\n                # Spread to the right\n                for k in range(j+1, 10):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break  # Stop if we hit a non-zero value\n                # Spread down\n                for k in range(i+1, 10):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break  # Stop if we hit a non-zero value\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is 1 or 2, spread it to adjacent cells\n            if grid[i][j] in [1, 2]:\n                # Spread to the right\n                for k in range(j+1, 10):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break  # Stop if we hit a non-zero value\n                # Spread down\n                for k in range(i+1, 10):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break  # Stop if we hit a non-zero value\n    \n    return transformed\n```",

It seems like the transformation is spreading values in a way that creates a \"fan\" or \"spreading\" effect from the original positions.\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that:\n1. Values like 1 and 2 seem to spread out from their original positions in a diagonal pattern\n2. The spreading pattern seems to be in a specific direction (probably diagonally)\n3. The spreading seems to be limited to a certain number of steps\n\nBased on this, I'll implement a transformation that spreads values in a diagonal pattern from their original positions.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            if grid[row][col] != 0:\n                # Spread the value diagonally in both directions\n                for i in range(-2, 3):\n                    for j in range(-2, 3):\n                        if i == 0 and j == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the original position\n                        if 0 <= row + i < 10 and 0 <= col + j < 10:\n                            transformed[row + i][col + j] = grid[row][col]\n    \n    return transformed\n```",
