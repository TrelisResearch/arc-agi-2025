          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to find a transformation rule that maps the input grids in the training examples to the output grids. Let me start by analyzing each example to see the patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput has 5s in certain positions. Output has 2s and 1s. The main difference is the color transformation from 5 to 2 and 1. But wait, in the output, some cells have 1s and others 2s. How does that happen?\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 5s are grouped in diagonals. The output has 1s and 2s in different regions. Maybe the output color depends on the number of 5s in their diagonals? For example, if a cell is on a diagonal where there are multiple 5s, it might get a different color.\n\nWait, looking at the output coordinates for example 1:\nFor example, the cell (7, 2) in output is 1. But in input, (7, 2) was 5. So maybe the color is determined based on the number of 5s in the diagonal that the cell belongs to. Let me check more cells.\n\nIn Example 3's output, some output cells are 1 and some are 2. How does that relate to the input's 5s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is determined by the minimum number of 5s in the cells along the anti-diagonal that the current cell is on. For example, if the anti-diagonal has one 5 and the current cell is not directly on it, then it's 1. If it's on a diagonal with two 5s, then it's 2. But I need to verify this.\n\nLet me take example 1's output. The output has cells with 1s in certain positions. For instance, cell (7, 2) in output is 1. The input cell (7, 2) was 5. But how does that relate to the anti-diagonal?\n\nThe anti-diagonal for a cell (r, c) is r - c = k. Let's see for example 1's input. For example, the cells in the input that are 5 are on certain anti-diagonals. For instance, the first few 5s in example 1's input are on anti-diagonals with k = 5 - 0 = 5, 5 - 1 = 4, 5 - 2 = 3, etc. Wait, but that's not correct. Wait, for example, cell (2, 3) is 5. Then k = 2-3 = -1. Wait, maybe I need to think about the main diagonals or anti-diagonals differently. For example, the anti-diagonal is r + c = constant. Wait, actually, the main diagonals are r - c = constant, and anti-diagonals are r + c = constant.\n\nBut in example 1, the output for cell (7, 2) is 1. Let's check the anti-diagonal sum for that cell: 7 + 2 = 9. What's the input for that cell? It was 5. But the output is 1. So maybe the output value is determined by the number of 5s along that anti-diagonal. For example, if the anti-diagonal has a certain number of 5s, then the output is 1 or 2 based on that count.\n\nLet me check for example 1's output. The output for cell (7, 2) is 1. The input has 5s on the anti-diagonal r + c = 9. Let's count how many 5s are on that anti-diagonal in example 1's input. Looking at the input grid for example 1:\n\nInput grid rows are from 0 to 9. For anti-diagonal 9, the cells are (r, c) where r + c = 9. So possible cells are (9, 0), (8, 1), (7, 2), (6, 3), (5, 4), (4, 5), (3, 6), (2, 7), (1, 8), (0, 9). But in the input grid for example 1, the cells (7,2), (6,3), (5,4), (4,5), (3,6), (2,7), (1,8), (0,9) are all 5. Wait, but looking at the input grid for example 1:\n\nRow 3 is 0,0,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,0. So c=2,3,4 for row 3 (r=3) is 5. Wait, but r + c for (3,2) is 5, which is not 9. So maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, in example 1's input grid, the first few rows have 5s in certain columns. For example, in row 2 (r=2), columns 2,3,4 are 5. So for r=2, c=2: r + c = 4. For r=2, c=3: 5. For r=2, c=4: 6. Similarly, for r=1, c=7 is 8. Hmm, maybe the anti-diagonal sum is not the right factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the color is determined by the number of 5s in the main diagonal (r - c = k) that the current cell is on. Let's try that.\n\nFor example, cell (7, 2) in example 1's output is 1. The main diagonal k is 7 - 2 = 5. Let's count how many 5s are on this main diagonal in the input grid.\n\nMain diagonal k=5: cells where r - c =5. Possible r and c values:\n\nr =5, c=0 (since 5-0=5)\nr=6, c=1\nr=7, c=2\nr=8, c=3\nr=9, c=4\nLooking at the input grid for example 1, which is:\n\nRow 0: all 0.\nRow 1: all 0.\nRow 2: columns 2,3,4 are 5.\nRow 3: columns 2,3,4 are 5.\nRow 4: all 0.\nRow 5: columns 0-5 are 0, but in the input, row 5 has 0s except for columns 5-6? Wait the input for example 1 is:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0. So for r=5, c=6 is 5. So r=5, c=6: r-c = 5-6 = -1. So that's not on the main diagonal k=5.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output, the color is 1 or 2 based on whether the input cell is on a main diagonal with more 5s. For example, the cells with 1 in the output may be those that are on a main diagonal with exactly one 5, and the 2s are those with more than one 5.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let me check.\n\nIn example 1's output, cell (7, 2) is 1. The input cell (7,2) is 5. The main diagonal k = 7-2=5. How many 5s are on this main diagonal in the input?\n\nLooking at the input:\n\nFor main diagonal k=5: cells (5,0), (6,1), (7,2), (8,3), (9,4). Let's check each:\n\n(5,0): input grid row 5, column 0: 0.\n(6,1): row 6, column 1: 0.\n(7,2): 5.\n(8,3): row 8, column 3: input grid for row 8 is 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0. So c=3 is 5.\n(9,4): row 9, column 4: 0.\nSo on this main diagonal (k=5), there are two 5s: (7,2) and (8,3). Therefore, the count is 2. But the output cell is 1. This contradicts the hypothesis that 2s are for count >=2.\n\nSo maybe this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: the output color is determined by the minimum number of 5s in the main diagonals that the cell is on. Or maybe based on the nearest 5 in some direction.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output values in example 1, the 2s are in cells that are part of a longer diagonal line of 5s.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output in example 1, the 2s are in diagonals where the input has 5s that are contiguous. For example, the 5s in the input for example 1 form a diagonal from (2"
