          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some 2s, 8s, and 3s in certain positions. The output has 8s and 0s arranged in a sort of diamond or cross shape. For instance, in the input, there's a 2 in the fourth row, fifth column, and then 8s in the fifth row, fifth column. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross in the middle. Wait, maybe the 8s are being spread out in a symmetrical pattern?\n\nIn Example 2, the input has some 8s and 2s. The output seems to have a more complex pattern. For example, the third row in the input has an 8 in the sixth column, but the output has 8s in positions that form a sort of spiral or concentric shapes. Hmm, maybe the 8s are being expanded into a grid with certain spacing?\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 2 in row 5, column 5, and 8s in row 7, column 4. The output has 8s arranged in a vertical line, but also some horizontal lines. Wait, maybe the 8s are being spread out in a way that depends on their original positions. Like, if there's an 8 in a certain spot, it's being mirrored or expanded in some way.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is about creating a pattern where certain numbers (like 2, 8, 3) are being replaced with 8s in a symmetrical way. Let's think about the positions where the 8s are in the outputs. \n\nIn Example 1, the input has 2 and 8 in positions (row 3, col 4), (row 4, col 5), etc. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross. For example, the fourth row of the output has 8s in columns 4 and 5, but maybe that's not the case. Wait, looking at the output for example 1:\n\nThe output has 8s in positions (row 3, col 5), (row 4, col 4), (row 4, col 6), (row 5, col 5), etc. It seems like there's a diamond shape expanding from the center. Maybe the 8s are being spread out in a way that depends on their original positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are being mirrored in certain ways. For example, if there's an 8 in a certain position, it's being mirrored across the center of the grid. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 8s are in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are symmetric around the center. Like, if there's an 8 in (row 3, col 5), then there's another in (row 5, col 3), etc. Wait, maybe the 8s are being mirrored across the vertical and horizontal axes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are being expanded into a grid where they form a pattern based on their original positions. For instance, if there's a 2 in the input, it might generate 8s in certain positions. But how?\n\nLooking at example 3, the input has a 2 in row 5, column 5. The output has 8s in row 3, column 5, and then in rows 4 and 5, columns 4-6. Maybe there's a pattern where numbers in the input are being expanded into a cross or diamond shape. \n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that any non-zero value in the input is being replaced with 8s in a certain pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the output are generated based on the positions of the original 8s and 2s. For example, in example 1, the input has 2 and 8 in certain positions. The output has 8s in positions that form a diamond. For example, the 2 in row 3, column 4 (input) might be generating 8s in positions that are symmetrically placed around it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original 8s. For example, if there's an 8 in (row, col), then 8s are placed in positions that are mirrored across the center. \n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of the grid as 13x13. The center is at (6,6) perhaps. \n\nLooking at example 1, the input has 8s in row 4, col 5 (input row 4, col 5 is 8?), but the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. For example, in the output, row 3, col 5 is 8, row 4, col 4 is 8, row 4, col 6 is 8, row 5, col 5 is 8. So maybe the original 8s are being expanded into a diamond shape. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, we create a diamond shape around it. For example, if there's a 2 in position (i,j), then in the output, positions (i-1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i+1,j), (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j+1) are set to 8. But that might not fit all examples. \n\nWait, in example 1, the input has 2 in row 3, column 4. The output has 8s in row 3, column 5, and row 4, column 4, etc. Maybe the 2 is generating 8s in positions that are adjacent. But that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the output are generated based on the positions of the original 8s and 2s. For example, if there's a 2 in the input, it's generating 8s in positions that are in a certain pattern. \n\nLooking at example 3, the input has a 2 in row 5, column 5. The output has 8s in row 3, column 5, and then in rows 4 and 5, columns 4-6. So maybe the 2 is generating a vertical line of 8s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any non-zero value in the input is being replaced with 8s in a way that depends on their position. For example, if there's a 2 in the input, then in the output, the same position is 8, and then adjacent positions are also 8s. \n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original non-zero values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but with certain spacing. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the 8s in the outputs. For example, in example 1, the output has 8s in positions that form a cross in the middle. The input has 8s in positions that are in the middle of the grid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the original non-zero values into a grid where each non-zero value in the input is replaced with a cross or diamond shape. \n\nBut how to code this? Let's think of the steps:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid, if the value is not zero, then in the output grid, certain cells around it are set to 8. \n\nFor example, in example 1, the input has 8s in row 4, column 5 (input row 4, column 5 is 8?), and the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original non-zero values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all non-zero values with 8s, but in a way that creates a certain pattern. \n\nBut looking at example 2, the input has some 8s and 2s, and the output has a more complex pattern. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but with a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the original non-zero values and expanding them into a grid where each non-zero value is part of a larger pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original non-zero values. \n\nBut how to model this? For example, for each non-zero value in the input, we might generate 8s in positions that are mirrored across the center. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but with certain spacing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in a diamond shape around the original non-zero values. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's think of the test input. The test input has 2 in row 3, column 3 (assuming rows are 0-based?), and 8s in other positions. The output for the test input would be generated based on the same pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all non-zero values with 8s in the output grid, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values. \n\nBut how to determine this? \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of 8s in the output grids. For example, in example 1, the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. Let's see: \n\nIn example 1's output, the 8s are in positions (row 3, col 5), (row 4, col 4), (row 4, col 6), (row 5, col 5). So maybe it's a cross that's centered around the original 8s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original non-zero values. \n\nAnother idea: for each non-zero value in the input, create a diamond shape around it. For example, if there's a value in (i,j), then in the output, positions (i-1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i+1,j), (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j+1) are set to 8. But this would create a diamond shape. \n\nBut in example 1, the input has 8s in row 4, column 5 (input row 4, column 5 is 8?), and the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. Maybe that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where each non-zero value in the input is replaced with 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero value, but with certain spacing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the original non-zero values and creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but with a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAnother idea: looking at example 3, the input has a 2 in row 5, column 5. The output has 8s in row 3, column 5, and then rows 4 and 5, columns 4-6. So maybe the 2 is generating a vertical line of 8s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that depends on the original value. For example, if the original value is 2, then the output has 8s in positions that form a vertical line, and if the original value is 8, then the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input grid, if the value is non-zero, then in the output grid, the same cell is 8, and then adjacent cells are also 8. \n\nBut that would not explain example 1, where the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where all non-zero values are replaced with 8s, and then some additional 8s are added based on their positions. \n\nBut how to determine that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original non-zero values. \n\nFor example, if there's an 8 in the input at (i,j), then in the output, there's an 8 at (i, j), (i+1, j), (i-1, j), (i, j+1), (i, j-1), and also at (i+1, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i-1, j+1), (i-1, j-1). \n\nBut this would create a diamond shape around each original non-zero value. \n\nBut in example 1, the input has 8s in row 4, column 5 (assuming rows are 0-based?), and the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each non-zero value into a cross shape. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother idea: looking at example 1, the output has 8s in positions that form a cross in the middle. The input has 8s in positions that are in the middle of the grid. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that all non-zero values are replaced with 8s, but then the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that form a cross. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original non-zero values. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nPerhaps the best approach is to try to find a pattern that works for all three examples. \n\nLooking at example 1: the input has 2 and 8 in certain positions. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross. \n\nIn example 2, the output has a more complex pattern. \n\nIn example 3, the output has 8s in a vertical line. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that any non-zero value in the input is replaced with 8s in the output, but the 8s are placed in positions that form a cross or diamond shape around the original non-zero values. \n\nBut how to implement that. \n\nAnother approach: think of the output as a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, and also in the same diagonal positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but with a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where for each non-zero value, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original value, but with a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but only if they are within a certain range. \n\nBut how to code this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but with a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but with a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where for each non-zero value in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original value, but with a certain distance. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAnother idea: look for the positions of 8s in the output and see if they are symmetric. \n\nIn example 1, the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. For example, in the middle of the grid. \n\nIn example 2, the output has 8s in positions that form a spiral or concentric shapes. \n\nIn example 3, the output has 8s in a vertical line. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original value, but with certain spacing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, and also in the same diagonal positions. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, and also in the same diagonal positions, but only if the original value is 2 or 8. \n\nBut how to determine this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where all non-zero values are replaced with 8s, and then some additional 8s are added based on their positions. \n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nMaybe the best approach is to try to code a function that replaces non-zero values with 8s, but also adds 8s in certain positions. \n\nFor example, for each cell (i,j) in the input grid, if the value is non-zero, then in the output grid, set (i,j) to 8, and also set (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j+1) to 8. \n\nBut this would create a diamond shape around each non-zero value. \n\nLet's test this against example 1. \n\nIn example 1, the input has a 2 in row 3, column 4 (assuming rows are 0-based). So the output would have 8s in positions (3,4), (2,4), (4,4), (3,3), (3,5), (2,3), (2,5), (4,3), (4,5). \n\nBut in the output of example 1, the 8s are in positions that form a cross. For example, row 3, column 5 is 8, row 4, column 4 is 8, row 4, column 6 is 8, row 5, column 5 is 8. So this might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero value, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but only if they are within a certain distance. \n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAnother idea: looking at example 3, the input has a 2 in row 5, column 5. The output has 8s in row 3, column 5, and then rows 4 and 5, columns 4-6. So maybe the 2 is generating 8s in positions that are in the same column, but with a certain distance. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original value, but with a certain distance. \n\nBut how to code this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original value, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nBut this is too vague. \n\nAnother approach: think about the test input. The test input has 2 in row 3, column 3 (assuming rows are 0-based). The output would be generated based on the same pattern. \n\nBut since I don't have the output for the test input, I can't check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original non-zero values. \n\nFor example, if there's a non-zero value at (i,j), then in the output, there are 8s at (i,j), (i+1,j), (i-1,j), (i,j+1), (i,j-1), (i+1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i-1,j-1). \n\nBut this would create a diamond shape around each non-zero value. \n\nLet's try this for example 1. \n\nIn example 1, the input has 8 in row 4, column 5. So the output would have 8s in positions (4,5), (3,5), (5,5), (4,4), (4,6), (3,4), (3,6), (5,4), (5,6). \n\nBut the output of example 1 has 8s in positions like (3,5), (4,4), (4,6), (5,5), etc. Which matches this. \n\nSo maybe this is the pattern. \n\nIn example 1's output, the 8s are in positions that form a cross. But according to this pattern, it would create a diamond shape. \n\nBut perhaps the output is generated by this pattern. \n\nLet's check example 3. The input has a 2 in row 5, column 5. The output has 8s in row 3, column 5, and in rows 4 and 5, columns 4-6. \n\nSo for the input value at (5,5), the output would have 8s in (5,5), (4,5), (6,5), (5,4), (5,6), (4,4), (4,6), (6,4), (6,6). \n\nBut the output of example 3 has 8s in row 3, column 5, and in rows 4 and 5, columns 4-6. \n\nWait, this doesn't match. So maybe this pattern isn't correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original value, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each non-zero value, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original value, but only if they are within a certain distance. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but only if the original value is 2 or 8. \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where all non-zero values are replaced with 8s, and then additional 8s are added in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original non-zero values. \n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to implement a function that for each non-zero value in the input, adds 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original value, and also in the diagonals. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\nif grid[i][j] != 0:\n\n   for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n\n      for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n\n          if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n\n              continue\n\n          new_i = i + dx\n\n          new_j = j + dy\n\n          if 0 <= new_i < 13 and 0 <= new_j < 13:\n\n              transformed[new_i][new_j] = 8\n\nBut this would set 8s in all adjacent positions, including diagonals. \n\nBut this may not be correct, but it's a possible approach. \n\nWait, but in example 1, the input has 8 in row 4, column 5. According to this code, the output would have 8s in positions (4,5), (3,5), (5,5), (4,4), (4,6), (3,4), (3,6), (5,4), (5,6). \n\nIn the output of example 1, the 8s are in positions that include these. For example, the output has 8s in row 3, column 5 (which is (3,5)), row 4, column 4 (4,4), row 4, column 6 (4,6), row 5, column 5 (5,5). \n\nSo this matches. \n\nBut what about the other positions like (3,4), (3,6), (5,4), (5,6)? The output of example 1 may not have those. \n\nWait, looking at example 1's output:\n\nThe output has:\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo for row 3, column 4 is 0, but row 3, column 5 is 8. \n\nSo the code above would set (3,4) to 8, but in the output, it's 0. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the pattern is not this. \n\nSo this approach is incorrect. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row or column as the original non-zero values, but not in the diagonals. \n\nBut this is just guessing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nGiven the time, perhaps I should try to code a function that for each non-zero value in the input, sets the same position to 8, and also sets the positions directly above, below, left, and right to 8. \n\nSo, for each non-zero value at (i,j), set (i,j) to 8, and also set (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) to 8. \n\nThis would create a cross shape around each non-zero value. \n\nLet's see if this works for example 1. \n\nIn example 1, the input has 8 in row 4, column 5. So the output would have 8 in (4,5), (3,5), (5,5), (4,4), (4,6). \n\nIn the output of example 1, these positions are 8. \n\nFor example, row 3, column 5 is 8, row 4, column 4 is 8, row 4, column 6 is 8, row 5, column 5 is 8. \n\nSo this matches. \n\nIn example 3, the input has a 2 in row 5, column 5. So the output would have 8 in (5,5), (4,5), (6,5), (5,4), (5,6). \n\nBut in the output of example 3, the 8s are in row 3, column 5, and rows 4 and 5, columns 4-6. \n\nSo this doesn't match. \n\nHmm, this suggests that this approach is not correct. \n\nBut maybe the example 3's input has other non-zero values that contribute to the output. \n\nIn example 3's input, the input has 2 in row 5, column 5, 8 in row 6, column 4, and other values. \n\nSo perhaps the output is generated by combining the effects of multiple non-zero values. \n\nFor example, the 8 in row 6, column 4 would generate 8s in (6,4), (5,4), (7,4), (6,3), (6,5). \n\nSo in the output of example 3, row 5, column 4 is 8, row 5, column 5 is 8, row 5, column 6 is 8, and row 4, column 5 is 8. \n\nThis might explain the output of example 3. \n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, the output has 8s in the same position, and directly above, below, left, and right. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nInitialize a 13x13 grid with all 0s.\n\nFor each i in 0-12:\n\n   for each j in 0-12:\n\n       if input_grid[i][j] != 0:\n\n           transformed[i][j] = 8\n\n           if i > 0:\n\n               transformed[i-1][j] = 8\n\n           if i < 12:\n\n               transformed[i+1][j] = 8\n\n           if j > 0:\n\n               transformed[i][j-1] = 8\n\n           if j < 12:\n\n               transformed[i][j+1] = 8\n\nBut this would set the same position to 8, and the adjacent positions. \n\nLet's test this for example 1. \n\nIn example 1, the input has 8 in row 4, column 5. So the output would have 8 in (4,5), (3,5), (5,5), (4,4), (4,6). \n\nIn the output of example 1, these positions are 8. \n\nBut what about other non-zero values in the input? \n\nIn example 1, the input has 2 in row 3, column 4. So the output would have 8 in (3,4), (2,4), (4,4), (3,3), (3,5). \n\nSo (3,5) is already set by the 8 in row 4, column 5. \n\nBut in the output of example 1, (3,5) is 8, which is correct. \n\nBut in the output of example 1, row 3, column 5 is 8, and row 4, column 4 is 8, row 4, column 6 is 8, row 5, column 5 is 8. \n\nSo this seems to match. \n\nIn example 3, the input has a 2 in row 5, column 5. So the output would have 8 in (5,5), (4,5), (6,5), (5,4), (5,6). \n\nBut the output of example 3 has 8s in row 3, column 5, and rows 4 and 5, columns 4-6. \n\nSo this suggests that there's another non-zero value in the input that contributes to this. \n\nLooking at example 3's input:\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 9: 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 10: 0 0 8 8 3 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the input has 8 in row 7, column 4 (assuming rows are 0-based). \n\nSo for this 8, the code would set (7,4) to 8, and also (6,4), (8,4), (7,3), (7,5). \n\nSo (6,4) is 8, (7,3) is 8, (7,5) is 8, (8,4) is 8. \n\nIn the output of example 3, row 3, column 5 is 8. How does this happen? \n\nMaybe there's another non-zero value in the input that contributes to this. \n\nFor example, the input has 8 in row 7, column 4. This would generate 8 in (7,4), (6,4), (8,4), (7,3), (7,5). \n\nBut the output has 8 in row 3, column 5. This suggests that there's another non-zero value that contributes to this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is not sufficient, and the transformation is more complex. \n\nBut given the time, perhaps this is the best approach. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nInitialize a 13x13 grid with all zeros.\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\n   if the cell is not zero:\n\n       set transformed[i][j] = 8\n\n       if i > 0:\n\n           transformed[i-1][j] = 8\n\n       if i < 12:\n\n           transformed[i+1][j] = 8\n\n       if j > 0:\n\n           transformed[i][j-1] = 8\n\n       if j < 12:\n\n           transformed[i][j+1] = 8\n\nBut this may not capture all cases, but it's a possible approach. \n\nLet's test this for example 3. \n\nIn example 3's input, the 8 in row 7, column 4 would generate 8s in (7,4), (6,4), (8,4), (7,3), (7,5). \n\nThe 2 in row 5, column 5 would generate 8s in (5,5), (4,5), (6,5), (5,4), (5,6). \n\nSo in the output, row 4, column 5 is 8 (from the 2 in row 5, column 5), and row 5, column 5 is 8. \n\nRow 6, column 4 is 8 (from the 8 in row 7, column 4). \n\nSo the output of example 3 has 8s in row 3, column 5? How? \n\nMaybe there's another non-zero value in the input that contributes. \n\nLooking at example 3's input, there's an 8 in row 7, column 4. \n\nBut how does that lead to row 3, column 5 being 8? \n\nMaybe this approach is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nBut given the time, I think this is the best I can do. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Set current cell to 8\n                transformed[i][j] = 8\n                # Check up\n                if i > 0:\n                    transformed[i-1][j] = 8\n                # Check down\n                if i < 12:\n                    transformed[i+1][j] = 8\n                # Check left\n                if j > 0:\n                    transformed[i][j-1] = 8\n                # Check right\n                if j < 12:\n                    transformed[i][j+1] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, this would set the current cell to 8, and then the adjacent cells. But in example 1, the input has 8 in row 4, column 5, which would set (4,5) to 8, and then the adjacent cells. \n\nBut in the output of example 1, the 8s are in positions that include these. \n\nBut in example 3, the output has 8s in row 3, column 5, which may not be set by this code. \n\nBut maybe this is the best I can do based on the examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should also set the diagonals. \n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some 2s, 8s, and 3s in certain positions. The output has 8s and 0s arranged in a sort of diamond or cross shape. For instance, in the input, there's a 2 in the fourth row, fifth column, and then 8s in the fifth row, fifth column. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross in the middle. Wait, maybe the 8s are being spread out in a symmetrical pattern?\n\nIn Example 2, the input has some 8s and 2s. The output seems to have a more complex pattern. For example, the third row in the input has an 8 in the sixth column, but the output has 8s in positions that form a sort of spiral or concentric shapes. Hmm, maybe the 8s are being expanded into a grid with certain spacing?\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 2 in row 5, column 5, and 8s in row 7, column 4. The output has 8s arranged in a vertical line, but also some horizontal lines. Wait, maybe the 8s are being spread out in a way that depends on their original positions. Like, if there's an 8 in a certain spot, it's being mirrored or expanded in some way.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is about creating a pattern where certain numbers (like 2, 8, 3) are being replaced with 8s in a symmetrical way. Let's think about the positions where the 8s are in the outputs. \n\nIn Example 1, the input has 2 and 8 in positions (row 3, col 4), (row 4, col 5), etc. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross. For example, the fourth row of the output has 8s in columns 4 and 5, but maybe that's not the case. Wait, looking at the output for example 1:\n\nThe output has 8s in positions (row 3, col 5), (row 4, col 4), (row 4, col 6), (row 5, col 5), etc. It seems like there's a diamond shape expanding from the center. Maybe the 8s are being spread out in a way that depends on their original positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are being mirrored in certain ways. For example, if there's an 8 in a certain position, it's being mirrored across the center of the grid. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 8s are in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are symmetric around the center. Like, if there's an 8 in (row 3, col 5), then there's another in (row 5, col 3), etc. Wait, maybe the 8s are being mirrored across the vertical and horizontal axes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are being expanded into a grid where they form a pattern based on their original positions. For instance, if there's a 2 in the input, it might generate 8s in certain positions. But how?\n\nLooking at example 3, the input has a 2 in row 5, column 5. The output has 8s in row 3, column 5, and then in rows 4 and 5, columns 4-6. Maybe there's a pattern where numbers in the input are being expanded into a cross or diamond shape. \n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that any non-zero value in the input is being replaced with 8s in a certain pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the output are generated based on the positions of the original 8s and 2s. For example, in example 1, the input has 2 and 8 in certain positions. The output has 8s in positions that form a diamond. For example, the 2 in row 3, column 4 (input) might be generating 8s in positions that are symmetrically placed around it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original 8s. For example, if there's an 8 in (row, col), then 8s are placed in positions that are mirrored across the center. \n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of the grid as 13x13. The center is at (6,6) perhaps. \n\nLooking at example 1, the input has 8s in row 4, col 5 (input row 4, col 5 is 8?), but the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. For example, in the output, row 3, col 5 is 8, row 4, col 4 is 8, row 4, col 6 is 8, row 5, col 5 is 8. So maybe the original 8s are being expanded into a diamond shape. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, we create a diamond shape around it. For example, if there's a 2 in position (i,j), then in the output, positions (i-1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i+1,j), (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j+1) are set to 8. But that might not fit all examples. \n\nWait, in example 1, the input has 2 in row 3, column 4. The output has 8s in row 3, column 5, and row 4, column 4, etc. Maybe the 2 is generating 8s in positions that are adjacent. But that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the output are generated based on the positions of the original 8s and 2s. For example, if there's a 2 in the input, it's generating 8s in positions that are in a certain pattern. \n\nLooking at example 3, the input has a 2 in row 5, column 5. The output has 8s in row 3, column 5, and then in rows 4 and 5, columns 4-6. So maybe the 2 is generating a vertical line of 8s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any non-zero value in the input is being replaced with 8s in a way that depends on their position. For example, if there's a 2 in the input, then in the output, the same position is 8, and then adjacent positions are also 8s. \n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original non-zero values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but with certain spacing. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the 8s in the outputs. For example, in example 1, the output has 8s in positions that form a cross in the middle. The input has 8s in positions that are in the middle of the grid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the original non-zero values into a grid where each non-zero value in the input is replaced with a cross or diamond shape. \n\nBut how to code this? Let's think of the steps:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid, if the value is not zero, then in the output grid, certain cells around it are set to 8. \n\nFor example, in example 1, the input has 8s in row 4, column 5 (input row 4, column 5 is 8?), and the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original non-zero values. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all non-zero values with 8s, but in a way that creates a certain pattern. \n\nBut looking at example 2, the input has some 8s and 2s, and the output has a more complex pattern. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but with a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the original non-zero values and expanding them into a grid where each non-zero value is part of a larger pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original non-zero values. \n\nBut how to model this? For example, for each non-zero value in the input, we might generate 8s in positions that are mirrored across the center. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but with certain spacing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in a diamond shape around the original non-zero values. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's think of the test input. The test input has 2 in row 3, column 3 (assuming rows are 0-based?), and 8s in other positions. The output for the test input would be generated based on the same pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all non-zero values with 8s in the output grid, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values. \n\nBut how to determine this? \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of 8s in the output grids. For example, in example 1, the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. Let's see: \n\nIn example 1's output, the 8s are in positions (row 3, col 5), (row 4, col 4), (row 4, col 6), (row 5, col 5). So maybe it's a cross that's centered around the original 8s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original non-zero values. \n\nAnother idea: for each non-zero value in the input, create a diamond shape around it. For example, if there's a value in (i,j), then in the output, positions (i-1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i+1,j), (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j+1) are set to 8. But this would create a diamond shape. \n\nBut in example 1, the input has 8s in row 4, column 5 (input row 4, column 5 is 8?), and the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. Maybe that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where each non-zero value in the input is replaced with 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero value, but with certain spacing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the original non-zero values and creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but with a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAnother idea: looking at example 3, the input has a 2 in row 5, column 5. The output has 8s in row 3, column 5, and then rows 4 and 5, columns 4-6. So maybe the 2 is generating a vertical line of 8s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are generated in a way that depends on the original value. For example, if the original value is 2, then the output has 8s in positions that form a vertical line, and if the original value is 8, then the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input grid, if the value is non-zero, then in the output grid, the same cell is 8, and then adjacent cells are also 8. \n\nBut that would not explain example 1, where the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where all non-zero values are replaced with 8s, and then some additional 8s are added based on their positions. \n\nBut how to determine that? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original non-zero values. \n\nFor example, if there's an 8 in the input at (i,j), then in the output, there's an 8 at (i, j), (i+1, j), (i-1, j), (i, j+1), (i, j-1), and also at (i+1, j+1), (i+1, j-1), (i-1, j+1), (i-1, j-1). \n\nBut this would create a diamond shape around each original non-zero value. \n\nBut in example 1, the input has 8s in row 4, column 5 (assuming rows are 0-based?), and the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each non-zero value into a cross shape. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother idea: looking at example 1, the output has 8s in positions that form a cross in the middle. The input has 8s in positions that are in the middle of the grid. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that all non-zero values are replaced with 8s, but then the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that form a cross. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original non-zero values. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nPerhaps the best approach is to try to find a pattern that works for all three examples. \n\nLooking at example 1: the input has 2 and 8 in certain positions. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross. \n\nIn example 2, the output has a more complex pattern. \n\nIn example 3, the output has 8s in a vertical line. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that any non-zero value in the input is replaced with 8s in the output, but the 8s are placed in positions that form a cross or diamond shape around the original non-zero values. \n\nBut how to implement that. \n\nAnother approach: think of the output as a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, and also in the same diagonal positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but with a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where for each non-zero value, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original value, but with a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but only if they are within a certain range. \n\nBut how to code this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but with a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but with a certain distance. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where for each non-zero value in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original value, but with a certain distance. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAnother idea: look for the positions of 8s in the output and see if they are symmetric. \n\nIn example 1, the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. For example, in the middle of the grid. \n\nIn example 2, the output has 8s in positions that form a spiral or concentric shapes. \n\nIn example 3, the output has 8s in a vertical line. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original value, but with certain spacing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, and also in the same diagonal positions. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, and also in the same diagonal positions, but only if the original value is 2 or 8. \n\nBut how to determine this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where all non-zero values are replaced with 8s, and then some additional 8s are added based on their positions. \n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nMaybe the best approach is to try to code a function that replaces non-zero values with 8s, but also adds 8s in certain positions. \n\nFor example, for each cell (i,j) in the input grid, if the value is non-zero, then in the output grid, set (i,j) to 8, and also set (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), (i-1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i+1,j+1) to 8. \n\nBut this would create a diamond shape around each non-zero value. \n\nLet's test this against example 1. \n\nIn example 1, the input has a 2 in row 3, column 4 (assuming rows are 0-based). So the output would have 8s in positions (3,4), (2,4), (4,4), (3,3), (3,5), (2,3), (2,5), (4,3), (4,5). \n\nBut in the output of example 1, the 8s are in positions that form a cross. For example, row 3, column 5 is 8, row 4, column 4 is 8, row 4, column 6 is 8, row 5, column 5 is 8. So this might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero value, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but only if they are within a certain distance. \n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAnother idea: looking at example 3, the input has a 2 in row 5, column 5. The output has 8s in row 3, column 5, and then rows 4 and 5, columns 4-6. So maybe the 2 is generating 8s in positions that are in the same column, but with a certain distance. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original value, but with a certain distance. \n\nBut how to code this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original value, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nBut this is too vague. \n\nAnother approach: think about the test input. The test input has 2 in row 3, column 3 (assuming rows are 0-based). The output would be generated based on the same pattern. \n\nBut since I don't have the output for the test input, I can't check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original non-zero values. \n\nFor example, if there's a non-zero value at (i,j), then in the output, there are 8s at (i,j), (i+1,j), (i-1,j), (i,j+1), (i,j-1), (i+1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), (i-1,j-1). \n\nBut this would create a diamond shape around each non-zero value. \n\nLet's try this for example 1. \n\nIn example 1, the input has 8 in row 4, column 5. So the output would have 8s in positions (4,5), (3,5), (5,5), (4,4), (4,6), (3,4), (3,6), (5,4), (5,6). \n\nBut the output of example 1 has 8s in positions like (3,5), (4,4), (4,6), (5,5), etc. Which matches this. \n\nSo maybe this is the pattern. \n\nIn example 1's output, the 8s are in positions that form a cross. But according to this pattern, it would create a diamond shape. \n\nBut perhaps the output is generated by this pattern. \n\nLet's check example 3. The input has a 2 in row 5, column 5. The output has 8s in row 3, column 5, and in rows 4 and 5, columns 4-6. \n\nSo for the input value at (5,5), the output would have 8s in (5,5), (4,5), (6,5), (5,4), (5,6), (4,4), (4,6), (6,4), (6,6). \n\nBut the output of example 3 has 8s in row 3, column 5, and in rows 4 and 5, columns 4-6. \n\nWait, this doesn't match. So maybe this pattern isn't correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original value, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each non-zero value, the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original value, but only if they are within a certain distance. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but only if the original value is 2 or 8. \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where all non-zero values are replaced with 8s, and then additional 8s are added in positions that are symmetrically placed around the original non-zero values. \n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to implement a function that for each non-zero value in the input, adds 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original value, and also in the diagonals. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\nif grid[i][j] != 0:\n\n   for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n\n      for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n\n          if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n\n              continue\n\n          new_i = i + dx\n\n          new_j = j + dy\n\n          if 0 <= new_i < 13 and 0 <= new_j < 13:\n\n              transformed[new_i][new_j] = 8\n\nBut this would set 8s in all adjacent positions, including diagonals. \n\nBut this may not be correct, but it's a possible approach. \n\nWait, but in example 1, the input has 8 in row 4, column 5. According to this code, the output would have 8s in positions (4,5), (3,5), (5,5), (4,4), (4,6), (3,4), (3,6), (5,4), (5,6). \n\nIn the output of example 1, the 8s are in positions that include these. For example, the output has 8s in row 3, column 5 (which is (3,5)), row 4, column 4 (4,4), row 4, column 6 (4,6), row 5, column 5 (5,5). \n\nSo this matches. \n\nBut what about the other positions like (3,4), (3,6), (5,4), (5,6)? The output of example 1 may not have those. \n\nWait, looking at example 1's output:\n\nThe output has:\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo for row 3, column 4 is 0, but row 3, column 5 is 8. \n\nSo the code above would set (3,4) to 8, but in the output, it's 0. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the pattern is not this. \n\nSo this approach is incorrect. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that the output has 8s in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row or column as the original non-zero values, but not in the diagonals. \n\nBut this is just guessing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nGiven the time, perhaps I should try to code a function that for each non-zero value in the input, sets the same position to 8, and also sets the positions directly above, below, left, and right to 8. \n\nSo, for each non-zero value at (i,j), set (i,j) to 8, and also set (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) to 8. \n\nThis would create a cross shape around each non-zero value. \n\nLet's see if this works for example 1. \n\nIn example 1, the input has 8 in row 4, column 5. So the output would have 8 in (4,5), (3,5), (5,5), (4,4), (4,6). \n\nIn the output of example 1, these positions are 8. \n\nFor example, row 3, column 5 is 8, row 4, column 4 is 8, row 4, column 6 is 8, row 5, column 5 is 8. \n\nSo this matches. \n\nIn example 3, the input has a 2 in row 5, column 5. So the output would have 8 in (5,5), (4,5), (6,5), (5,4), (5,6). \n\nBut in the output of example 3, the 8s are in row 3, column 5, and rows 4 and 5, columns 4-6. \n\nSo this doesn't match. \n\nHmm, this suggests that this approach is not correct. \n\nBut maybe the example 3's input has other non-zero values that contribute to the output. \n\nIn example 3's input, the input has 2 in row 5, column 5, 8 in row 6, column 4, and other values. \n\nSo perhaps the output is generated by combining the effects of multiple non-zero values. \n\nFor example, the 8 in row 6, column 4 would generate 8s in (6,4), (5,4), (7,4), (6,3), (6,5). \n\nSo in the output of example 3, row 5, column 4 is 8, row 5, column 5 is 8, row 5, column 6 is 8, and row 4, column 5 is 8. \n\nThis might explain the output of example 3. \n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, the output has 8s in the same position, and directly above, below, left, and right. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nInitialize a 13x13 grid with all 0s.\n\nFor each i in 0-12:\n\n   for each j in 0-12:\n\n       if input_grid[i][j] != 0:\n\n           transformed[i][j] = 8\n\n           if i > 0:\n\n               transformed[i-1][j] = 8\n\n           if i < 12:\n\n               transformed[i+1][j] = 8\n\n           if j > 0:\n\n               transformed[i][j-1] = 8\n\n           if j < 12:\n\n               transformed[i][j+1] = 8\n\nBut this would set the same position to 8, and the adjacent positions. \n\nLet's test this for example 1. \n\nIn example 1, the input has 8 in row 4, column 5. So the output would have 8 in (4,5), (3,5), (5,5), (4,4), (4,6). \n\nIn the output of example 1, these positions are 8. \n\nBut what about other non-zero values in the input? \n\nIn example 1, the input has 2 in row 3, column 4. So the output would have 8 in (3,4), (2,4), (4,4), (3,3), (3,5). \n\nSo (3,5) is already set by the 8 in row 4, column 5. \n\nBut in the output of example 1, (3,5) is 8, which is correct. \n\nBut in the output of example 1, row 3, column 5 is 8, and row 4, column 4 is 8, row 4, column 6 is 8, row 5, column 5 is 8. \n\nSo this seems to match. \n\nIn example 3, the input has a 2 in row 5, column 5. So the output would have 8 in (5,5), (4,5), (6,5), (5,4), (5,6). \n\nBut the output of example 3 has 8s in row 3, column 5, and rows 4 and 5, columns 4-6. \n\nSo this suggests that there's another non-zero value in the input that contributes to this. \n\nLooking at example 3's input:\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 9: 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 10: 0 0 8 8 3 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the input has 8 in row 7, column 4 (assuming rows are 0-based). \n\nSo for this 8, the code would set (7,4) to 8, and also (6,4), (8,4), (7,3), (7,5). \n\nSo (6,4) is 8, (7,3) is 8, (7,5) is 8, (8,4) is 8. \n\nIn the output of example 3, row 3, column 5 is 8. How does this happen? \n\nMaybe there's another non-zero value in the input that contributes to this. \n\nFor example, the input has 8 in row 7, column 4. This would generate 8 in (7,4), (6,4), (8,4), (7,3), (7,5). \n\nBut the output has 8 in row 3, column 5. This suggests that there's another non-zero value that contributes to this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code is not sufficient, and the transformation is more complex. \n\nBut given the time, perhaps this is the best approach. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nInitialize a 13x13 grid with all zeros.\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\n   if the cell is not zero:\n\n       set transformed[i][j] = 8\n\n       if i > 0:\n\n           transformed[i-1][j] = 8\n\n       if i < 12:\n\n           transformed[i+1][j] = 8\n\n       if j > 0:\n\n           transformed[i][j-1] = 8\n\n       if j < 12:\n\n           transformed[i][j+1] = 8\n\nBut this may not capture all cases, but it's a possible approach. \n\nLet's test this for example 3. \n\nIn example 3's input, the 8 in row 7, column 4 would generate 8s in (7,4), (6,4), (8,4), (7,3), (7,5). \n\nThe 2 in row 5, column 5 would generate 8s in (5,5), (4,5), (6,5), (5,4), (5,6). \n\nSo in the output, row 4, column 5 is 8 (from the 2 in row 5, column 5), and row 5, column 5 is 8. \n\nRow 6, column 4 is 8 (from the 8 in row 7, column 4). \n\nSo the output of example 3 has 8s in row 3, column 5? How? \n\nMaybe there's another non-zero value in the input that contributes. \n\nLooking at example 3's input, there's an 8 in row 7, column 4. \n\nBut how does that lead to row 3, column 5 being 8? \n\nMaybe this approach is not correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by creating a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row and column as the original non-zero values, but only if they are in certain positions. \n\nBut given the time, I think this is the best I can do. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Set current cell to 8\n                transformed[i][j] = 8\n                # Check up\n                if i > 0:\n                    transformed[i-1][j] = 8\n                # Check down\n                if i < 12:\n                    transformed[i+1][j] = 8\n                # Check left\n                if j > 0:\n                    transformed[i][j-1] = 8\n                # Check right\n                if j < 12:\n                    transformed[i][j+1] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, this would set the current cell to 8, and then the adjacent cells. But in example 1, the input has 8 in row 4, column 5, which would set (4,5) to 8, and then the adjacent cells. \n\nBut in the output of example 1, the 8s are in positions that include these. \n\nBut in example 3, the output has 8s in row 3, column 5, which may not be set by this code. \n\nBut maybe this is the best I can do based on the examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should also set the diagonals. \n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code.\n"
