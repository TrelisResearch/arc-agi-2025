              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the output grid is always 4 rows by 20 columns, which is double the size of the input grid (which is 4 rows by 10 columns). This suggests that the transformation involves some kind of expansion or repetition of the input grid.\n\nLooking at the first example:\nInput (4x10):\n2 2 2 2\n8 2 2 2\n2 2 8 2\n8 2 8 8\nOutput (4x20):\n2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n8 2 2 2 2 2 2 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 8 8 2 2 2\n2 2 8 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2\n8 2 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 2 8 8 8 8 2 8 8 2 8 8\n\nThe output seems to be the input grid repeated twice in each row. For example, the first row of the input is \"2 2 2 2\", and the first row of the output is \"2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\", which is the input row repeated twice.\n\nLooking at the second example:\nInput (4x10):\n9 5 1 5\n1 5 9 1\n9 1 5 5\n5 5 5 1\nOutput (4x20):\n9 5 1 5 5 1 5 9 9 5 1 5 5 1 5 9 9 5 1 5\n1 5 9 1 1 9 5 1 1 5 9 1 1 9 5 1 1 5 9 1\n9 1 5 5 5 5 1 9 9 1 5 5 5 5 1 9 9 1 5 5\n5 5 5 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 5 1 1 5 5 5 5 5 5 1\n\nAgain, it seems like the input grid is repeated twice in each row.\n\nLooking at the third example:\nInput (4x10):\n5 5 2 5\n2 3 3 2\n5 2 5 3\n3 5 3 2\nOutput (4x20):\n5 5 2 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 2 5\n2 3 3 2 2 3 3 2 2 3 3 2 2 3 3 2 2 3 3 2\n5 2 5 3 3 5 2 5 5 2 5 3 3 5 2 5 5 2 5 3\n3 5 3 2 2 3 5 3 3 5 3 2 2 3 5 3 3 5 3 2\n\nAgain, the pattern seems to be that the input grid is repeated twice in each row.\n\nLooking at the fourth example:\nInput (4x10):\n4 1 1 4\n7 7 4 7\n1 4 1 1\n4 1 1 1\nOutput (4x20):\n4 1 1 4 4 1 1 4 4 1 1 4 4 1 1 4 4 1 1 4\n7 7 4 7 7 4 7 7 7 7 4 7 7 4 7 7 7 7 4 7\n1 4 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 4 1 1\n4 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 4 1 1 1\n\nAgain, the pattern seems to be that the input grid is repeated twice in each row.\n\nBased on this pattern, the transformation appears to be: repeat each row of the input grid twice to form the output grid.\n\nHere's the Python function that implements this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new grid with double the number of columns\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Repeat each row twice\n        transformed_row = row + row\n        transformed_grid.append(transformed_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
