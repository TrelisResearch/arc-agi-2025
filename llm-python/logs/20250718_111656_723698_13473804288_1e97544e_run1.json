Specifically, it seems like there's a pattern where certain values are being replaced with others in a systematic way, possibly based on their position in the grid.\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that:\n1. Values in the first few columns are being replaced with values from the rightmost columns.\n2. There seems to be a pattern where values in the input grid are being shifted or replaced based on their position.\n3. The transformation appears to involve some kind of \"sliding\" or \"shifting\" of values within the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves a pattern where values in the input grid are being replaced based on their position and value. Specifically, it seems like there's a pattern where certain values are being replaced with others in a systematic way.\n\nHere's my best guess at the transformation logic:\n\n- For each cell in the grid, if the value is 0, it's being replaced with the value from the corresponding position in the rightmost column.\n- For other values, it seems like they're being replaced with the value from the corresponding position in the rightmost column, but with some offset.\n\nBased on this, I'll write a Python function that implements this pattern.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the number of rows and columns\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    \n    # For each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # If the value is 0, replace it with the value from the corresponding position in the rightmost column\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][cols-1]\n            # Otherwise, replace it with the value from the corresponding position in the rightmost column\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][cols-1]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

There seems to be a pattern where values in the input grid are being shifted or replaced based on their position.\n3. The transformation appears to involve some kind of \"sliding\" or \"shifting\" of values within the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves a pattern where values in the input grid are being replaced based on their position and value. Specifically, it seems like there's a pattern where certain values are being replaced with others in a systematic way.\n\nHere's my best guess at the transformation logic:\n\n- For each cell in the grid, if the value is 0, it's being replaced with the value from the corresponding position in the rightmost column.\n- For other values, it seems like they're being replaced with the value from the corresponding position in the rightmost column, but with some offset.\n\nBased on this, I'll write a Python function that implements this pattern.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the number of rows and columns\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    \n    # For each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # If the value is 0, replace it with the value from the corresponding position in the rightmost column\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][cols-1]\n            # Otherwise, replace it with the value from the corresponding position in the rightmost column\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][cols-1]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
