          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids to the output grids in the examples provided. Let's start by looking at the first example.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input is a 12x13 grid, and the output is also 12x13. Let me check some positions. For instance, in the first row of the input, there's a 5 in the second column. In the output, the first row has a 5 in the second column as well. But wait, the output's first row has a 2 in the fourth column. Hmm, maybe there's some kind of transformation based on positions or values.\n\nWait, maybe looking at the positions where numbers are placed. Let me check some specific cells. For example, in the input's first row, the fifth column is 0. In the output, the fifth column is 0. But in the output's first row, the fourth column is 2. Where does that 2 come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their original values. For instance, maybe numbers are being replaced with other numbers based on some rule. Let me check the first example's input and output again.\n\nIn the input's first row, the fifth column is 0, and in the output, it's 0. But in the fourth column, input is 0 and output is 2. Maybe the 2 comes from a different position. Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking at the third row of the input: 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0. The output for this row is 5 0 0 2 0 0 2 5 0 2 0 5 0. So the fourth column in input is 0, and in output it's 2. The seventh column in input is 0, and in output it's 2. Also, the fourth column in the output is 2. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being set to 2 based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values with others based on their positions. For example, maybe numbers are being replaced with 2 if they are in certain positions. Or perhaps there's a pattern where the output is derived from the input by applying some mathematical operation.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output has 2s. In example 1, the output has 2s in positions that might be related to the input's 5s or other numbers. For instance, in the first row of the output, the fourth column is 2. In the input's first row, the fifth column is 0, but maybe that's not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s in positions that are diagonally aligned or in certain rows and columns. Let me check the first example's output for the 2s.\n\nLooking at the first example's output:\n\nRow 1: 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0\nRow 2: 0 5 0 2 0 5 5 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 3: 5 0 0 2 0 0 2 5 0 2 0 5 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 0 5 2 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2 5 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 5\nRow 6: 0 0 0 2 5 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 7: 5 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 5 5\nRow 8: 0 0 5 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 5 2 0 5 2 0 5 2 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 5 2 2 5 2 2 5 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 2 0 0 2 5 5 0 2 5 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n\nLooking at the positions where 2s appear, maybe they are in certain columns. For example, in the first example, the fourth column in the output has a 2 in rows 1-12. Wait, in row 1, column 4 is 2. Row 2, column 4 is 2. Row 3, column 4 is 2. Row 4, column 4 is 2. Row 5, column 4 is 2. Row 6, column 4 is 2. Row 7, column 4 is 2. Row 8, column 4 is 2. Row 9, column 4 is 2. Row 10, column 4 is 2. Row 11, column 4 is 0. Row 12, column 4 is 0. Wait, that's not consistent. Hmm. So maybe not all columns have 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are related to the original input's 5s. For example, in the input's first row, there are 5s in positions 2 and 11. In the output, there are 2s in positions that might be near those 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in the first example's input, the output has 2s in positions that are in columns 4, 7, 10, etc. But I need to find a pattern that applies across all examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. Let me check a few positions. For example, in the input's first row, there's a 5 in column 7. The output's first row has a 5 in column 7. But in the output, there's a 2 in column 4. Maybe the 2s are in certain positions that are determined by some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values with 2s based on their positions. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column seems to have 2s in most rows. Let me check that.\n\nIn example 1's output, column 4 (index 3 if starting from 0) has 2s in rows 1-7, but row 8 has 2, row 9 has 2, row 10 has 2, row 11 has 0, row 12 has 0. Wait, maybe not. Let me check the first example's output again. For row 11, column 4 is 0. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain cells based on some condition. For instance, if a cell is in a certain row or column, then it's replaced with 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell has a 5, then in the output, it's replaced with 2. But in example 1's input, there are 5s in the first row, and the output has 5s in the same positions. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of certain cells. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s where the sum of certain cells in the input is even or something like that. But that seems complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output has 2s. For example, in example 1's output, the 2s are in positions (row, column) like (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3), (10,4), (11,4), etc. Wait, maybe the 2s are in certain columns. For example, column 3 (index 3) in rows 0-9, but not in row 10 and 11. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are related to the original grid's 5s. For example, in the input, there are 5s in certain positions, and the output has 2s in positions that are adjacent to those 5s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, if a cell is in row i and column j, then the output cell is determined by some function of i and j. For example, maybe if (i + j) is even, then it's replaced with 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row (row 0) has 2 in column 3 (index 3). The sum of row 0 and column 3 is 0+3=3, which is odd. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the sum is even. But 0+3 is 3, odd. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in certain columns. For example, column 3 (index 3) in the first example's output has 2s in rows 0-9, but not in rows 10 and 11. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, in the first example's input, the output has 2s in positions where the original grid had 0s. But that's not the case because in the first row of input, there are 0s and the output has 2s in some positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values with 2s based on their positions. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column (index 3) seems to have 2s in most rows. Let me check the input's fourth column. In the first example's input, the fourth column (index 3) has 0s in most rows. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where certain cells are set to 2 based on their position. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column (index 3) has 2s in rows 0-9. Maybe that's a pattern. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, the output is a copy of the input, but with certain cells modified. For example, in the first example, the output's fourth column (index 3) is set to 2 for rows 0-9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if the original grid has a 5 in a certain position, then the output has a 2 in a certain position. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's input and output. Let's check some positions. For example, in the input's third row, the first column is 5. In the output's third row, the first column is 5. But in the output's third row, the fourth column is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, in the output, certain positions are filled with 2s where the original grid has 0s. But that's not the case in example 1's first row, where the fourth column is 0 in the input and 2 in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions and the values. For example, in the output, certain cells are set to 2 if the original grid has a 5 in a certain position. But I need to find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values based on their positions. For example, in the first example, the output's fourth column (index 3) is set to 2 in most rows. Let's check the input's fourth column for that row. For example, row 0's fourth column is 0. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column is filled with 2s. Maybe this is a pattern that's consistent across examples. Let me check example 2's output. In example 2's output, the fourth column (index 3) has 2s in rows 0-2, then 0s in row 3, and then 2s again in rows 4-7, and so on. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain cells with 2s based on the original grid's values. For example, if the original grid has a 5 in a certain position, then the output has a 2 in a certain position. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where the output is a modified version of the input with certain cells replaced. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s in certain columns, which might be a fixed pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column (index 3) is filled with 2s. Let's check the input's fourth column. In the first example's input, the fourth column (index 3) is 0 in most rows. So that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the fourth column has 2s in rows 0-9, but not in rows 10 and 11. Maybe that's a pattern. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, in the output, certain positions are set to 2 if the original grid has a 5 in a certain position. For example, in the first example's input, the first row has a 5 in column 1 (index 1). In the output, the first row has a 5 in column 1, but also a 2 in column 3. Maybe there's a relationship between the 5s and the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain cells with 2s based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell is 0, then it's replaced with 2. But in example 1's first row, there are 0s and 2s in the output. However, in the first row of the input, the fifth column is 0 and in the output it's 0. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s in certain positions that are determined by the original grid's positions. For example, in row 0, column 3 (index 3) is 2. In row 1, column 3 is 2. In row 2, column 3 is 2. This seems to be a pattern. Maybe the fourth column is being filled with 2s in rows 0-9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, the fourth column in the output is filled with 2s for rows 0-9, but not in rows 10 and 11. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, in the first example's input, there are 5s in certain positions, and the output has 2s in positions that are adjacent to those 5s. For example, the input's first row has a 5 in column 1 (index 1), and the output has a 2 in column 3 (index 3). That's two columns away. Maybe that's a pattern. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, the output's fourth column (index 3) is filled with 2s for certain rows. For example, in example 1, rows 0-9 have 2s in column 3. Maybe this is a fixed pattern that is applied across all examples.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe the fourth column is always filled with 2s. But in example 2's output, looking at the fourth column (index 3), it has 0s in some rows. For example, in example 2's output, row 3 (index 3) has 0 in column 3. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm, this is challenging. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at example 3's input and output. The input has a 5 in certain positions, and the output has 2s in certain positions. For example, in the input's first row, there's a 5 in column 1 (index 1). In the output's first row, there's a 5 in column 1, but also a 2 in column 3. So again, similar to example 1.\n\nAnother observation: in all three examples, the output has 2s in certain columns, possibly column 3 (index 3). For example, in example 1's output, column 3 has 2s in rows 0-9. In example 2's output, column 3 has 2s in rows 0-2, then 0 in row 3, then 2s again in rows 4-7, and then 0 in rows 8-11. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output has 2s in positions where the original grid has 0s in certain positions. But in example 1's input, the fourth column is 0 in most rows, and the output has 2s there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell is 0, then it's replaced with 2. But in example 1's first row, the fifth column is 0 and in the output it's 0. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column (index 3) is filled with 2s for rows 0-9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, the fourth column is filled with 2s for all rows except for certain rows. But why?\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that applies to all examples. Let me think of other possibilities.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions, and for each cell, if it's in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 2. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column (index 3) has 2s in rows 0-9. Maybe that's a fixed pattern. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell is 5, then it's replaced with 2. But in example 1's input, the first row has 5 in column 1, and the output has 5 in column 1. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output has 2s and see if they are related to the input's positions. For example, in example 1's output, the fourth column (index 3) has 2s in rows 0-9. Let's check the input's fourth column for those rows. In the input's first row, the fourth column is 0. In the second row, it's 0. Third row, 0. Fourth row, 0. Fifth row, 0. Sixth row, 0. Seventh row, 0. Eighth row, 0. Ninth row, 0. Tenth row, 0. Eleventh row, 0. Twelfth row, 0. So the input's fourth column is 0 in all rows. So why the output has 2s there?\n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if the original grid has a 0 in a certain position, then the output has 2. But in example 1's first row, the fifth column is 0 and the output has 0 there. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions. For example, for certain positions, the output is 2 if the original grid has a 5 in a certain position. For example, in the first example's input, the first row has a 5 in column 1 (index 1). The output has a 2 in column 3 (index 3). Maybe the distance between the 5 and the 2 is two columns. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions. For example, if the original grid has a 5 in column j, then the output has a 2 in column j+2. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain cells with 2s based on the original grid's values. For example, if the original grid has a 5 in column j, then the output has a 2 in column j+2. Let's test this with example 1's input. In the first row, there's a 5 in column 1 (index 1). So j+2 is 3, which is column 3 (index 3), which is where the 2 is in the output. That fits. Let's check another 5 in the input. For example, in the first example's input, row 0 has a 5 in column 1 and column 10 (index 10). The output's row 0 has a 2 in column 3 (index 3) and column 11 (index 11). So that fits. So this seems to be a possible pattern.\n\nLet's check another example. In example 1's input, row 2 has a 5 in column 0 (index 0) and column 10 (index 10). The output's row 2 has a 2 in column 2 (index 2) and column 12 (index 12). Wait, the input's row 2 is 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0. So the 5s are at column 0 and column 7 (index 7) and column 11 (index 11). Wait, in the input's row 2, the 5 is at column 0, column 7, and column 11. So according to the hypothesis, the output would have 2s at column 0+2=2, column 7+2=9, and column 11+2=13. But the output's row 2 is 5 0 0 2 0 0 2 5 0 2 0 5 0. So the 2s are at column 3 (index 3), column 6 (index 6), and column 9 (index 9). Hmm, this doesn't fit the hypothesis. So maybe the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the same column plus 2. But in the input's row 2, column 7 is 5. Adding 2 gives column 9, which is where there's a 2 in the output. But in the input's row 2, column 0 is 5. Adding 2 gives column 2, but the output's row 2 has a 2 in column 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right. But in example 1's input, row 0 has a 5 in column 1 (index 1), and the output has a 2 in column 3 (index 3). So that's correct. But for row 2, column 7 (index 7), the output has a 2 in column 9 (index 9). So that fits. But the input's row 2 has a 5 in column 0 (index 0), and the output's row 2 has a 2 in column 3 (index 3). That would be adding 3, not 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, but only if the column is within the grid. For example, in row 2, column 0 (index 0) would have 2 in column 2 (index 2). But in the output, row 2, column 2 is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's check example 2's input and output.\n\nIn example 2's input, the first row has 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 2. So in the input's first row, there's a 5 in column 6 (index 6), and the output has a 5 in column 6. But the output has a 2 in column 4 (index 4). So maybe the 2 is in column 4, which is two positions to the left of the 5 in column 6. So 6-2=4. That fits.\n\nAnother example: in example 2's input, the first row has a 5 in column 10 (index 10). The output's first row has a 5 in column 10, and a 2 in column 12 (index 12). So 10 + 2 = 12. That fits.\n\nSo this seems to be a pattern. For every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right of the 5's column. But what about the 5 in column 6 (index 6)? The output has a 2 in column 4 (index 4), which is two positions to the left. Hmm, that contradicts the previous idea.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the left or right. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the left. For example, in example 2's input, the first row's 5 in column 6 (index 6) has a 2 in column 4 (index 4), which is two positions to the left. The 5 in column 10 (index 10) has a 2 in column 12 (index 12), which is two positions to the right. So this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the left if the column is even, and two positions to the right if the column is odd. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right of the 5's column. But in example 2's first row, the 5 in column 6 (index 6) has a 2 in column 4 (index 4), which is two positions to the left. So that's not consistent.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by replacing certain cells with 2s based on their position relative to the original grid's 5s. For example, for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the cell that is two columns to the right. But this seems to work for some cases.\n\nIn example 1's first row, the 5 in column 1 (index 1) has a 2 in column 3 (index 3), which is two positions to the right. The 5 in column 10 (index 10) has a 2 in column 12 (index 12), which is two positions to the right. That fits. For the 5 in column 7 (index 7) in row 2, the output has a 2 in column 9 (index 9), which is two positions to the right. That fits. So maybe this is the pattern.\n\nBut in example 2's first row, the 5 in column 6 (index 6) has a 2 in column 4 (index 4), which is two positions to the left. That contradicts the pattern. So why is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right if the column is less than 11, and two positions to the left otherwise. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, but if that column is beyond the grid, then it's placed two positions to the left. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, but if that's out of bounds, then it's placed in a different way. For example, in example 2's first row, the 5 in column 6 (index 6) is in a row where the output has a 2 in column 4. But 6+2=8, which is within the grid. So why is there a 2 in column 4 instead of 8?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by replacing certain cells with 2s based on their row and column indices. For example, if the row is even, then certain columns are set to 2. Or if the column is even.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing cells in certain columns based on their row. For example, in example 1's output, column 3 (index 3) has 2s in rows 0-9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions. For example, the output is a copy of the input, but with certain cells replaced with 2s where the original grid has 0s. But in example 1's first row, the fifth column is 0 and the output is 0, so that's not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for the examples I have.\n\nLet me try to think of the first example's input and output again. The output has 2s in certain positions that are two columns to the right of the 5s in the input. For example, in the first row, the 5 in column 1 (index 1) has a 2 in column 3 (index 3). The 5 in column 10 (index 10) has a 2 in column 12 (index 12). So this seems to fit. For row 2, the 5 in column 7 (index 7) has a 2 in column 9 (index 9). That fits. So maybe this is the pattern: for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right of the 5's column.\n\nBut in example 2's first row, the 5 in column 6 (index 6) has a 2 in column 4 (index 4), which is two positions to the left. So this contradicts the pattern. But maybe there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, but if that column is beyond the grid, then it's placed in the column two positions to the left. For example, in example 2's first row, the 5 is in column 6 (index 6). Adding 2 gives 8, which is within the grid (since the grid is 13 columns). But in the output, the 2 is in column 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the left. But in example 1's first row, the 5 in column 1 has a 2 in column 3, which is two positions to the right. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, but only if the column is even. Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, but if that column is not present, then it's placed in a different way. But this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for other patterns in the examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. For example, the input's first row has 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output is 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 5 0 2 0 0 2 5 5. So there are 2s in column 5 (index 5) and column 9 (index 9). Let's see where the 5s are in the input. The input's first row has 5s at column 1 (index 1), column 7 (index 7), and column 13 (index 13). The output has 2s at column 5 (index 5) and column 9 (index 9). So for the 5 at column 1, adding 4 gives 5. For the 5 at column 7, adding 2 gives 9. For the 5 at column 13, adding -4 gives 9. This doesn't fit any pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are related to the 5s in some other way.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by replacing certain cells with 2s based on the original grid's values and positions. For example, if the original grid has a 5 in a certain position, then the output has a 2 in a certain position that is determined by some rule.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, the output is a copy of the input, but with certain cells replaced with 2s based on their row and column. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column (index 3) is filled with 2s for rows 0-9. This might be a fixed pattern, but why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and the positions. For example, if the original grid has a 0 in column 3, then the output has 2. But this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Maybe I should try to write a function that replaces certain cells with 2s based on the presence of 5s in the input.\n\nFor example, for every cell in the input that is a 5, we replace the cell two columns to the right with 2. If that column is out of bounds, we skip it. Let's see if this works.\n\nIn example 1's input, the first row has 5 in column 1. Adding 2 gives column 3, which is valid. So output's row 0, column 3 is 2. Similarly, the 5 in column 10 (index 10) gives column 12 (index 12), which is valid. So that's correct.\n\nIn example 2's first row, the 5 is in column 6 (index 6). Adding 2 gives column 8 (index 8), but the output's first row has a 2 in column 4. So this doesn't fit. But maybe there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the left. For example, in example 2's first row, the 5 in column 6 (index 6) has a 2 in column 4 (index 4), which is two positions to the left. But for example 1's first row, the 5 in column 1 (index 1) has a 2 in column 3 (index 3), which is two positions to the right. So this is inconsistent.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, but if the column is even, then it's two positions to the right, and if it's odd, two positions to the left. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, but if that column is beyond the grid, then it's placed in the column two positions to the left. For example, in example 2's first row, the 5 is in column 6 (index 6). Adding 2 gives 8, which is within the grid. So why is there a 2 in column 4?\n\nThis is not making sense. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of example 1, the fourth column (index 3) has 2s in rows 0-9. This might be a fixed pattern. Maybe the fourth column is always filled with 2s for rows 0-9, and other columns are filled based on other rules.\n\nBut why would that be the case? It's possible that this is a pattern that is part of the transformation, but I need to find a way to generalize it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions, and the output is generated by replacing certain cells with 2s based on their positions. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column is filled with 2s for rows 0-9. This might be a fixed pattern, but how to determine it.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll try to implement a function that replaces certain cells with 2s based on the presence of 5s in the input, adding two columns to the right, and see if it works for the examples.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid, if the cell is 5, then in the output grid, the cell two columns to the right is set to 2. If the column is out of bounds, we skip it.\n\nBut this may not work for all examples, but let's try.\n\nFor example 1's input, this would work for the 5s in column 1, 7, 11, etc. Let's see.\n\nIn example 1's input, row 0 has 5 in column 1. So in output, column 3 is set to 2. That's correct.\n\nRow 0 also has a 5 in column 10 (index 10). Adding 2 gives column 12 (index 12), which is valid. So output row 0, column 12 is 2. But in the example 1's output, row 0, column 12 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in example 1's output, row 0 is:\n\n0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0\n\nSo column 12 is 0. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is not working. I'm stuck.\n\nMaybe I should look for other patterns. Let me look at the test input and see if I can find any patterns.\n\nTest input is:\n\n0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 5 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5\n0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0\n0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0\n5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 2 5 5 0\n\nThe output for this test input is not provided, but the task is to write a function that transforms the input to the output. But since I don't have the output, I have to rely on the training examples.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to think of a different approach. Perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's positions, and for each cell, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 2. For example, the fourth column (index 3) is filled with 2s in rows 0-9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions. For example, the output is generated by replacing all 0s with 2s in certain columns. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions. For example, if the original grid has a 5 in a certain position, then the output has a 2 in a certain position that is determined by some rule.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the patterns I've observed in the training examples. The most consistent pattern I've seen is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, maybe it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each cell in the input grid, if it is 5, then in the output grid, the cell two columns to the right is set to 2. If the column is out of bounds, we skip it.\n\nLet's implement this.\n\nBut in example 1's input, row 0 has a 5 in column 10 (index 10). Adding 2 gives column 12 (index 12), which is valid. So the output should have 2 in column 12. But in the example 1's output, row 0, column 12 is 0. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe the 5 in column 10 is not part of the pattern. Maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions, and the output has 2s in certain positions based on the original grid's 5s. For example, in the first example's input, the 5 in column 1 (index 1) has a 2 in column 3 (index 3). The 5 in column 7 (index 7) has a 2 in column 9 (index 9). The 5 in column 11 (index 11) has a 2 in column 13 (index 13), which is out of bounds (since the grid is 13 columns, indexes 0-12). So maybe it's not set.\n\nBut in the example 1's output, row 2 has a 5 in column 7 (index 7), and the output has a 2 in column 9 (index 9). That fits. So this suggests that the pattern is to add two columns to the right.\n\nBut in example 1's input, the 5 in column 10 (index 10) is in row 0. Adding two columns gives index 12, which is valid. So the output should have a 2 in column 12. But in the example 1's output, row 0, column 12 is 0. So this is a contradiction.\n\nMaybe the 5 in column 10 is not part of the pattern. Or maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern, but I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, and implement that.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Iterate over each cell\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Try to set the cell two columns to the right\n                new_j = j + 2\n                if new_j < 13:\n                    transformed[i][new_j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not work for all examples. Let's test it on example 1's input.\n\nIn example 1's input, row 0, column 1 is 5. So new_j = 3, which is valid. So transformed[0][3] = 2. This matches the output.\n\nRow 0, column 10 is 5. new_j = 12, which is valid. So transformed[0][12] = 2. But in the example 1's output, row 0, column 12 is 0. So this would be incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps this is a mistake in my analysis. Let me check the example 1's output again.\n\nExample 1's output for row 0 is: 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0. So column 12 is 0. So the code would set it to 2, but the output is 0. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThis is a problem. So perhaps the pattern is not as simple as that.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern, but I'll proceed with the code based on the hypothesis that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right. Even though it may not work for all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions, and the output has 2s in certain positions based on the original grid's 5s. For example, in example 1's input, the 5 in column 10 (index 10) is not part of the pattern, but the 5 in column 11 (index 11) is. Let me check.\n\nIn example 1's input, row 2 has a 5 in column 11 (index 11). Adding 2 gives 13, which is out of bounds. So no change. In the output, row 2 has a 5 in column 11, and the output has 5 in that position. So no change.\n\nBut in the output, there's a 2 in column 9 (index 9), which is two positions to the left of the 5 in column 11 (index 11). So this is two positions to the left.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 5s with 2s in the column two positions to the right, and see if it passes the examples.\n\nBut since it doesn't pass example 1, I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions, and the output has 2s in positions that are two columns to the right of the original grid's 5s, but only if the original grid's cell is 5 and the new column is within the grid. Otherwise, it's not set.\n\nBut this is what the code does, and it fails for example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions, and the output has 2s in positions that are two columns to the left of the original grid's 5s.\n\nFor example, in example 1's first row, the 5 in column 1 (index 1) has a 2 in column 3 (index 3), which is two positions to the right. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's two positions to the left for some 5s and two positions to the right for others.\n\nThis is too ambiguous.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 5s with 2s in the column two positions to the right, and see if it passes the examples, even if it doesn't. Perhaps the examples have other patterns that I'm not seeing.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                new_j = j + 2\n                if new_j < 13:\n                    transformed[i][new_j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not work for all examples. However, given the time I've spent and the lack of a better idea, I'll proceed with this.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids to the output grids in the examples provided. Let's start by looking at the first example.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input is a 12x13 grid, and the output is also 12x13. Let me check some positions. For instance, in the first row of the input, there's a 5 in the second column. In the output, the first row has a 5 in the second column as well. But wait, the output's first row has a 2 in the fourth column. Hmm, maybe there's some kind of transformation based on positions or values.\n\nWait, maybe looking at the positions where numbers are placed. Let me check some specific cells. For example, in the input's first row, the fifth column is 0. In the output, the fifth column is 0. But in the output's first row, the fourth column is 2. Where does that 2 come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their original values. For instance, maybe numbers are being replaced with other numbers based on some rule. Let me check the first example's input and output again.\n\nIn the input's first row, the fifth column is 0, and in the output, it's 0. But in the fourth column, input is 0 and output is 2. Maybe the 2 comes from a different position. Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking at the third row of the input: 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0. The output for this row is 5 0 0 2 0 0 2 5 0 2 0 5 0. So the fourth column in input is 0, and in output it's 2. The seventh column in input is 0, and in output it's 2. Also, the fourth column in the output is 2. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being set to 2 based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values with others based on their positions. For example, maybe numbers are being replaced with 2 if they are in certain positions. Or perhaps there's a pattern where the output is derived from the input by applying some mathematical operation.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output has 2s. In example 1, the output has 2s in positions that might be related to the input's 5s or other numbers. For instance, in the first row of the output, the fourth column is 2. In the input's first row, the fifth column is 0, but maybe that's not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s in positions that are diagonally aligned or in certain rows and columns. Let me check the first example's output for the 2s.\n\nLooking at the first example's output:\n\nRow 1: 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0\nRow 2: 0 5 0 2 0 5 5 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 3: 5 0 0 2 0 0 2 5 0 2 0 5 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 0 5 2 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2 5 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 5\nRow 6: 0 0 0 2 5 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 7: 5 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 5 5\nRow 8: 0 0 5 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 5 2 0 5 2 0 5 2 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 5 2 2 5 2 2 5 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 2 0 0 2 5 5 0 2 5 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n\nLooking at the positions where 2s appear, maybe they are in certain columns. For example, in the first example, the fourth column in the output has a 2 in rows 1-12. Wait, in row 1, column 4 is 2. Row 2, column 4 is 2. Row 3, column 4 is 2. Row 4, column 4 is 2. Row 5, column 4 is 2. Row 6, column 4 is 2. Row 7, column 4 is 2. Row 8, column 4 is 2. Row 9, column 4 is 2. Row 10, column 4 is 2. Row 11, column 4 is 0. Row 12, column 4 is 0. Wait, that's not consistent. Hmm. So maybe not all columns have 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are related to the original input's 5s. For example, in the input's first row, there are 5s in positions 2 and 11. In the output, there are 2s in positions that might be near those 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in the first example's input, the output has 2s in positions that are in columns 4, 7, 10, etc. But I need to find a pattern that applies across all examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. Let me check a few positions. For example, in the input's first row, there's a 5 in column 7. The output's first row has a 5 in column 7. But in the output, there's a 2 in column 4. Maybe the 2s are in certain positions that are determined by some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values with 2s based on their positions. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column seems to have 2s in most rows. Let me check that.\n\nIn example 1's output, column 4 (index 3 if starting from 0) has 2s in rows 1-7, but row 8 has 2, row 9 has 2, row 10 has 2, row 11 has 0, row 12 has 0. Wait, maybe not. Let me check the first example's output again. For row 11, column 4 is 0. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain cells based on some condition. For instance, if a cell is in a certain row or column, then it's replaced with 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell has a 5, then in the output, it's replaced with 2. But in example 1's input, there are 5s in the first row, and the output has 5s in the same positions. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of certain cells. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s where the sum of certain cells in the input is even or something like that. But that seems complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output has 2s. For example, in example 1's output, the 2s are in positions (row, column) like (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3), (8,3), (9,3), (10,4), (11,4), etc. Wait, maybe the 2s are in certain columns. For example, column 3 (index 3) in rows 0-9, but not in row 10 and 11. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are related to the original grid's 5s. For example, in the input, there are 5s in certain positions, and the output has 2s in positions that are adjacent to those 5s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, if a cell is in row i and column j, then the output cell is determined by some function of i and j. For example, maybe if (i + j) is even, then it's replaced with 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row (row 0) has 2 in column 3 (index 3). The sum of row 0 and column 3 is 0+3=3, which is odd. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the sum is even. But 0+3 is 3, odd. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in certain columns. For example, column 3 (index 3) in the first example's output has 2s in rows 0-9, but not in rows 10 and 11. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, in the first example's input, the output has 2s in positions where the original grid had 0s. But that's not the case because in the first row of input, there are 0s and the output has 2s in some positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values with 2s based on their positions. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column (index 3) seems to have 2s in most rows. Let me check the input's fourth column. In the first example's input, the fourth column (index 3) has 0s in most rows. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where certain cells are set to 2 based on their position. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column (index 3) has 2s in rows 0-9. Maybe that's a pattern. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, the output is a copy of the input, but with certain cells modified. For example, in the first example, the output's fourth column (index 3) is set to 2 for rows 0-9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if the original grid has a 5 in a certain position, then the output has a 2 in a certain position. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's input and output. Let's check some positions. For example, in the input's third row, the first column is 5. In the output's third row, the first column is 5. But in the output's third row, the fourth column is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, in the output, certain positions are filled with 2s where the original grid has 0s. But that's not the case in example 1's first row, where the fourth column is 0 in the input and 2 in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions and the values. For example, in the output, certain cells are set to 2 if the original grid has a 5 in a certain position. But I need to find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values based on their positions. For example, in the first example, the output's fourth column (index 3) is set to 2 in most rows. Let's check the input's fourth column for that row. For example, row 0's fourth column is 0. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column is filled with 2s. Maybe this is a pattern that's consistent across examples. Let me check example 2's output. In example 2's output, the fourth column (index 3) has 2s in rows 0-2, then 0s in row 3, and then 2s again in rows 4-7, and so on. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain cells with 2s based on the original grid's values. For example, if the original grid has a 5 in a certain position, then the output has a 2 in a certain position. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where the output is a modified version of the input with certain cells replaced. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s in certain columns, which might be a fixed pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column (index 3) is filled with 2s. Let's check the input's fourth column. In the first example's input, the fourth column (index 3) is 0 in most rows. So that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the fourth column has 2s in rows 0-9, but not in rows 10 and 11. Maybe that's a pattern. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, in the output, certain positions are set to 2 if the original grid has a 5 in a certain position. For example, in the first example's input, the first row has a 5 in column 1 (index 1). In the output, the first row has a 5 in column 1, but also a 2 in column 3. Maybe there's a relationship between the 5s and the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain cells with 2s based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell is 0, then it's replaced with 2. But in example 1's first row, there are 0s and 2s in the output. However, in the first row of the input, the fifth column is 0 and in the output it's 0. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, in the first example, the output has 2s in certain positions that are determined by the original grid's positions. For example, in row 0, column 3 (index 3) is 2. In row 1, column 3 is 2. In row 2, column 3 is 2. This seems to be a pattern. Maybe the fourth column is being filled with 2s in rows 0-9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, the fourth column in the output is filled with 2s for rows 0-9, but not in rows 10 and 11. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, in the first example's input, there are 5s in certain positions, and the output has 2s in positions that are adjacent to those 5s. For example, the input's first row has a 5 in column 1 (index 1), and the output has a 2 in column 3 (index 3). That's two columns away. Maybe that's a pattern. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, the output's fourth column (index 3) is filled with 2s for certain rows. For example, in example 1, rows 0-9 have 2s in column 3. Maybe this is a fixed pattern that is applied across all examples.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe the fourth column is always filled with 2s. But in example 2's output, looking at the fourth column (index 3), it has 0s in some rows. For example, in example 2's output, row 3 (index 3) has 0 in column 3. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm, this is challenging. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at example 3's input and output. The input has a 5 in certain positions, and the output has 2s in certain positions. For example, in the input's first row, there's a 5 in column 1 (index 1). In the output's first row, there's a 5 in column 1, but also a 2 in column 3. So again, similar to example 1.\n\nAnother observation: in all three examples, the output has 2s in certain columns, possibly column 3 (index 3). For example, in example 1's output, column 3 has 2s in rows 0-9. In example 2's output, column 3 has 2s in rows 0-2, then 0 in row 3, then 2s again in rows 4-7, and then 0 in rows 8-11. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output has 2s in positions where the original grid has 0s in certain positions. But in example 1's input, the fourth column is 0 in most rows, and the output has 2s there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell is 0, then it's replaced with 2. But in example 1's first row, the fifth column is 0 and in the output it's 0. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column (index 3) is filled with 2s for rows 0-9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, the fourth column is filled with 2s for all rows except for certain rows. But why?\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that applies to all examples. Let me think of other possibilities.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions, and for each cell, if it's in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 2. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column (index 3) has 2s in rows 0-9. Maybe that's a fixed pattern. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell is 5, then it's replaced with 2. But in example 1's input, the first row has 5 in column 1, and the output has 5 in column 1. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output has 2s and see if they are related to the input's positions. For example, in example 1's output, the fourth column (index 3) has 2s in rows 0-9. Let's check the input's fourth column for those rows. In the input's first row, the fourth column is 0. In the second row, it's 0. Third row, 0. Fourth row, 0. Fifth row, 0. Sixth row, 0. Seventh row, 0. Eighth row, 0. Ninth row, 0. Tenth row, 0. Eleventh row, 0. Twelfth row, 0. So the input's fourth column is 0 in all rows. So why the output has 2s there?\n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if the original grid has a 0 in a certain position, then the output has 2. But in example 1's first row, the fifth column is 0 and the output has 0 there. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions. For example, for certain positions, the output is 2 if the original grid has a 5 in a certain position. For example, in the first example's input, the first row has a 5 in column 1 (index 1). The output has a 2 in column 3 (index 3). Maybe the distance between the 5 and the 2 is two columns. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions. For example, if the original grid has a 5 in column j, then the output has a 2 in column j+2. But this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain cells with 2s based on the original grid's values. For example, if the original grid has a 5 in column j, then the output has a 2 in column j+2. Let's test this with example 1's input. In the first row, there's a 5 in column 1 (index 1). So j+2 is 3, which is column 3 (index 3), which is where the 2 is in the output. That fits. Let's check another 5 in the input. For example, in the first example's input, row 0 has a 5 in column 1 and column 10 (index 10). The output's row 0 has a 2 in column 3 (index 3) and column 11 (index 11). So that fits. So this seems to be a possible pattern.\n\nLet's check another example. In example 1's input, row 2 has a 5 in column 0 (index 0) and column 10 (index 10). The output's row 2 has a 2 in column 2 (index 2) and column 12 (index 12). Wait, the input's row 2 is 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0. So the 5s are at column 0 and column 7 (index 7) and column 11 (index 11). Wait, in the input's row 2, the 5 is at column 0, column 7, and column 11. So according to the hypothesis, the output would have 2s at column 0+2=2, column 7+2=9, and column 11+2=13. But the output's row 2 is 5 0 0 2 0 0 2 5 0 2 0 5 0. So the 2s are at column 3 (index 3), column 6 (index 6), and column 9 (index 9). Hmm, this doesn't fit the hypothesis. So maybe the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the same column plus 2. But in the input's row 2, column 7 is 5. Adding 2 gives column 9, which is where there's a 2 in the output. But in the input's row 2, column 0 is 5. Adding 2 gives column 2, but the output's row 2 has a 2 in column 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right. But in example 1's input, row 0 has a 5 in column 1 (index 1), and the output has a 2 in column 3 (index 3). So that's correct. But for row 2, column 7 (index 7), the output has a 2 in column 9 (index 9). So that fits. But the input's row 2 has a 5 in column 0 (index 0), and the output's row 2 has a 2 in column 3 (index 3). That would be adding 3, not 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, but only if the column is within the grid. For example, in row 2, column 0 (index 0) would have 2 in column 2 (index 2). But in the output, row 2, column 2 is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's check example 2's input and output.\n\nIn example 2's input, the first row has 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 2. So in the input's first row, there's a 5 in column 6 (index 6), and the output has a 5 in column 6. But the output has a 2 in column 4 (index 4). So maybe the 2 is in column 4, which is two positions to the left of the 5 in column 6. So 6-2=4. That fits.\n\nAnother example: in example 2's input, the first row has a 5 in column 10 (index 10). The output's first row has a 5 in column 10, and a 2 in column 12 (index 12). So 10 + 2 = 12. That fits.\n\nSo this seems to be a pattern. For every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right of the 5's column. But what about the 5 in column 6 (index 6)? The output has a 2 in column 4 (index 4), which is two positions to the left. Hmm, that contradicts the previous idea.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the left or right. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the left. For example, in example 2's input, the first row's 5 in column 6 (index 6) has a 2 in column 4 (index 4), which is two positions to the left. The 5 in column 10 (index 10) has a 2 in column 12 (index 12), which is two positions to the right. So this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the left if the column is even, and two positions to the right if the column is odd. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right of the 5's column. But in example 2's first row, the 5 in column 6 (index 6) has a 2 in column 4 (index 4), which is two positions to the left. So that's not consistent.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by replacing certain cells with 2s based on their position relative to the original grid's 5s. For example, for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the cell that is two columns to the right. But this seems to work for some cases.\n\nIn example 1's first row, the 5 in column 1 (index 1) has a 2 in column 3 (index 3), which is two positions to the right. The 5 in column 10 (index 10) has a 2 in column 12 (index 12), which is two positions to the right. That fits. For the 5 in column 7 (index 7) in row 2, the output has a 2 in column 9 (index 9), which is two positions to the right. That fits. So maybe this is the pattern.\n\nBut in example 2's first row, the 5 in column 6 (index 6) has a 2 in column 4 (index 4), which is two positions to the left. That contradicts the pattern. So why is that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right if the column is less than 11, and two positions to the left otherwise. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, but if that column is beyond the grid, then it's placed two positions to the left. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, but if that's out of bounds, then it's placed in a different way. For example, in example 2's first row, the 5 in column 6 (index 6) is in a row where the output has a 2 in column 4. But 6+2=8, which is within the grid. So why is there a 2 in column 4 instead of 8?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by replacing certain cells with 2s based on their row and column indices. For example, if the row is even, then certain columns are set to 2. Or if the column is even.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing cells in certain columns based on their row. For example, in example 1's output, column 3 (index 3) has 2s in rows 0-9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions. For example, the output is a copy of the input, but with certain cells replaced with 2s where the original grid has 0s. But in example 1's first row, the fifth column is 0 and the output is 0, so that's not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for the examples I have.\n\nLet me try to think of the first example's input and output again. The output has 2s in certain positions that are two columns to the right of the 5s in the input. For example, in the first row, the 5 in column 1 (index 1) has a 2 in column 3 (index 3). The 5 in column 10 (index 10) has a 2 in column 12 (index 12). So this seems to fit. For row 2, the 5 in column 7 (index 7) has a 2 in column 9 (index 9). That fits. So maybe this is the pattern: for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right of the 5's column.\n\nBut in example 2's first row, the 5 in column 6 (index 6) has a 2 in column 4 (index 4), which is two positions to the left. So this contradicts the pattern. But maybe there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, but if that column is beyond the grid, then it's placed in the column two positions to the left. For example, in example 2's first row, the 5 is in column 6 (index 6). Adding 2 gives 8, which is within the grid (since the grid is 13 columns). But in the output, the 2 is in column 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the left. But in example 1's first row, the 5 in column 1 has a 2 in column 3, which is two positions to the right. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, but only if the column is even. Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, but if that column is not present, then it's placed in a different way. But this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for other patterns in the examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. For example, the input's first row has 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output is 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 5 0 2 0 0 2 5 5. So there are 2s in column 5 (index 5) and column 9 (index 9). Let's see where the 5s are in the input. The input's first row has 5s at column 1 (index 1), column 7 (index 7), and column 13 (index 13). The output has 2s at column 5 (index 5) and column 9 (index 9). So for the 5 at column 1, adding 4 gives 5. For the 5 at column 7, adding 2 gives 9. For the 5 at column 13, adding -4 gives 9. This doesn't fit any pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are related to the 5s in some other way.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by replacing certain cells with 2s based on the original grid's values and positions. For example, if the original grid has a 5 in a certain position, then the output has a 2 in a certain position that is determined by some rule.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's positions. For example, the output is a copy of the input, but with certain cells replaced with 2s based on their row and column. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column (index 3) is filled with 2s for rows 0-9. This might be a fixed pattern, but why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and the positions. For example, if the original grid has a 0 in column 3, then the output has 2. But this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Maybe I should try to write a function that replaces certain cells with 2s based on the presence of 5s in the input.\n\nFor example, for every cell in the input that is a 5, we replace the cell two columns to the right with 2. If that column is out of bounds, we skip it. Let's see if this works.\n\nIn example 1's input, the first row has 5 in column 1. Adding 2 gives column 3, which is valid. So output's row 0, column 3 is 2. Similarly, the 5 in column 10 (index 10) gives column 12 (index 12), which is valid. So that's correct.\n\nIn example 2's first row, the 5 is in column 6 (index 6). Adding 2 gives column 8 (index 8), but the output's first row has a 2 in column 4. So this doesn't fit. But maybe there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the left. For example, in example 2's first row, the 5 in column 6 (index 6) has a 2 in column 4 (index 4), which is two positions to the left. But for example 1's first row, the 5 in column 1 (index 1) has a 2 in column 3 (index 3), which is two positions to the right. So this is inconsistent.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, but if the column is even, then it's two positions to the right, and if it's odd, two positions to the left. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, but if that column is beyond the grid, then it's placed in the column two positions to the left. For example, in example 2's first row, the 5 is in column 6 (index 6). Adding 2 gives 8, which is within the grid. So why is there a 2 in column 4?\n\nThis is not making sense. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of example 1, the fourth column (index 3) has 2s in rows 0-9. This might be a fixed pattern. Maybe the fourth column is always filled with 2s for rows 0-9, and other columns are filled based on other rules.\n\nBut why would that be the case? It's possible that this is a pattern that is part of the transformation, but I need to find a way to generalize it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions, and the output is generated by replacing certain cells with 2s based on their positions. For example, in the first example's output, the fourth column is filled with 2s for rows 0-9. This might be a fixed pattern, but how to determine it.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll try to implement a function that replaces certain cells with 2s based on the presence of 5s in the input, adding two columns to the right, and see if it works for the examples.\n\nSo, the plan is:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid, if the cell is 5, then in the output grid, the cell two columns to the right is set to 2. If the column is out of bounds, we skip it.\n\nBut this may not work for all examples, but let's try.\n\nFor example 1's input, this would work for the 5s in column 1, 7, 11, etc. Let's see.\n\nIn example 1's input, row 0 has 5 in column 1. So in output, column 3 is set to 2. That's correct.\n\nRow 0 also has a 5 in column 10 (index 10). Adding 2 gives column 12 (index 12), which is valid. So output row 0, column 12 is 2. But in the example 1's output, row 0, column 12 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, in example 1's output, row 0 is:\n\n0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0\n\nSo column 12 is 0. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This is not working. I'm stuck.\n\nMaybe I should look for other patterns. Let me look at the test input and see if I can find any patterns.\n\nTest input is:\n\n0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 5\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 5 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5\n0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0\n0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0\n5 0 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 2 5 5 0\n\nThe output for this test input is not provided, but the task is to write a function that transforms the input to the output. But since I don't have the output, I have to rely on the training examples.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to think of a different approach. Perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's positions, and for each cell, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 2. For example, the fourth column (index 3) is filled with 2s in rows 0-9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions. For example, the output is generated by replacing all 0s with 2s in certain columns. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions. For example, if the original grid has a 5 in a certain position, then the output has a 2 in a certain position that is determined by some rule.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the patterns I've observed in the training examples. The most consistent pattern I've seen is that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, maybe it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each cell in the input grid, if it is 5, then in the output grid, the cell two columns to the right is set to 2. If the column is out of bounds, we skip it.\n\nLet's implement this.\n\nBut in example 1's input, row 0 has a 5 in column 10 (index 10). Adding 2 gives column 12 (index 12), which is valid. So the output should have 2 in column 12. But in the example 1's output, row 0, column 12 is 0. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe the 5 in column 10 is not part of the pattern. Maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions, and the output has 2s in certain positions based on the original grid's 5s. For example, in the first example's input, the 5 in column 1 (index 1) has a 2 in column 3 (index 3). The 5 in column 7 (index 7) has a 2 in column 9 (index 9). The 5 in column 11 (index 11) has a 2 in column 13 (index 13), which is out of bounds (since the grid is 13 columns, indexes 0-12). So maybe it's not set.\n\nBut in the example 1's output, row 2 has a 5 in column 7 (index 7), and the output has a 2 in column 9 (index 9). That fits. So this suggests that the pattern is to add two columns to the right.\n\nBut in example 1's input, the 5 in column 10 (index 10) is in row 0. Adding two columns gives index 12, which is valid. So the output should have a 2 in column 12. But in the example 1's output, row 0, column 12 is 0. So this is a contradiction.\n\nMaybe the 5 in column 10 is not part of the pattern. Or maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern, but I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right, and implement that.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Iterate over each cell\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Try to set the cell two columns to the right\n                new_j = j + 2\n                if new_j < 13:\n                    transformed[i][new_j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not work for all examples. Let's test it on example 1's input.\n\nIn example 1's input, row 0, column 1 is 5. So new_j = 3, which is valid. So transformed[0][3] = 2. This matches the output.\n\nRow 0, column 10 is 5. new_j = 12, which is valid. So transformed[0][12] = 2. But in the example 1's output, row 0, column 12 is 0. So this would be incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps this is a mistake in my analysis. Let me check the example 1's output again.\n\nExample 1's output for row 0 is: 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 5 2 0 0. So column 12 is 0. So the code would set it to 2, but the output is 0. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThis is a problem. So perhaps the pattern is not as simple as that.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern, but I'll proceed with the code based on the hypothesis that for every 5 in the input, the output has a 2 in the column two positions to the right. Even though it may not work for all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions, and the output has 2s in certain positions based on the original grid's 5s. For example, in example 1's input, the 5 in column 10 (index 10) is not part of the pattern, but the 5 in column 11 (index 11) is. Let me check.\n\nIn example 1's input, row 2 has a 5 in column 11 (index 11). Adding 2 gives 13, which is out of bounds. So no change. In the output, row 2 has a 5 in column 11, and the output has 5 in that position. So no change.\n\nBut in the output, there's a 2 in column 9 (index 9), which is two positions to the left of the 5 in column 11 (index 11). So this is two positions to the left.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 5s with 2s in the column two positions to the right, and see if it passes the examples.\n\nBut since it doesn't pass example 1, I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions, and the output has 2s in positions that are two columns to the right of the original grid's 5s, but only if the original grid's cell is 5 and the new column is within the grid. Otherwise, it's not set.\n\nBut this is what the code does, and it fails for example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and positions, and the output has 2s in positions that are two columns to the left of the original grid's 5s.\n\nFor example, in example 1's first row, the 5 in column 1 (index 1) has a 2 in column 3 (index 3), which is two positions to the right. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's two positions to the left for some 5s and two positions to the right for others.\n\nThis is too ambiguous.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 5s with 2s in the column two positions to the right, and see if it passes the examples, even if it doesn't. Perhaps the examples have other patterns that I'm not seeing.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                new_j = j + 2\n                if new_j < 13:\n                    transformed[i][new_j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not work for all examples. However, given the time I've spent and the lack of a better idea, I'll proceed with this.\n"
