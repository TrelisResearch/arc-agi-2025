          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve expanding or spreading certain values (like 2, 3, 4, 8) in specific patterns.\n2. Values in the input grid that are not 0 are often expanded into larger patterns in the output grid.\n3. The transformation appears to involve some kind of \"spread\" or \"influence\" pattern where values spread out in specific ways.\n4. The output grid always has dimensions 18x17, which is important for the transformation.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading non-zero values in specific patterns, possibly with some kind of \"influence\" or \"spread\" effect.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(17)] for _ in range(18)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(18):\n        for col in range(23):  # The input grid is 18x23\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # If the value is not zero, spread it in a specific pattern\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread the value in a diamond pattern\n                for dr in range(-2, 3):\n                    for dc in range(-2, 3):\n                        if abs(dr) + abs(dc) <= 2:\n                            new_row = row + dr\n                            new_col = col + dc\n                            if 0 <= new_row < 18 and 0 <= new_col < 17:\n                                output[new_row][new_col] = value\n    \n    return output\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(17)] for _ in range(18)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(18):\n        for col in range(23):  # The input grid is 18x23\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # If the value is not zero, spread it in a specific pattern\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread the value in a diamond pattern\n                for dr in range(-2, 3):\n                    for dc in range(-2, 3):\n                        if abs(dr) + abs(dc) <= 2:\n                            new_row = row + dr\n                            new_col = col + dc\n                            if 0 <= new_row < 18 and 0 <= new_col < 17:\n                                output[new_row][new_col] = value\n    \n    return output\n```",

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve expanding or spreading certain values (like 2, 3, 4, 8) in specific patterns.\n2. Values in the input grid that are not 0 are often expanded into larger patterns in the output grid.\n3. The transformation appears to involve some kind of \"spread\" or \"influence\" pattern where values spread out in specific ways.\n4. The output grid always has dimensions 18x17, which is important for the transformation.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading non-zero values in specific patterns, possibly with some kind of \"influence\" or \"spread\" effect.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(17)] for _ in range(18)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(18):\n        for col in range(23):  # The input grid is 18x23\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # If the value is not zero, spread it in a specific pattern\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread the value in a diamond pattern\n                for dr in range(-2, 3):\n                    for dc in range(-2, 3):\n                        if abs(dr) + abs(dc) <= 2:\n                            new_row = row + dr\n                            new_col = col + dc\n                            if 0 <= new_row < 18 and 0 <= new_col < 17:\n                                output[new_row][new_col] = value\n    \n    return output\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(17)] for _ in range(18)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(18):\n        for col in range(23):  # The input grid is 18x23\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # If the value is not zero, spread it in a specific pattern\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread the value in a diamond pattern\n                for dr in range(-2, 3):\n                    for dc in range(-2, 3):\n                        if abs(dr) + abs(dc) <= 2:\n                            new_row = row + dr\n                            new_col = col + dc\n                            if 0 <= new_row < 18 and 0 <= new_col < 17:\n                                output[new_row][new_col] = value\n    \n    return output\n```",
