          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some 4s and 6s. The output seems to have the same 4s but some 6s are replaced by 4s in certain positions. Wait, looking at the input and output for Example 1:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n\nOutput rows:\nRow 0: same as input\nRow 1: same as input\nRow 2: same as input\nRow 3: 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 (the 6 in column 6 is replaced by 4?)\nRow 4: 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 0 (the original row 4 had 6s in columns 4-6, but now they're 4s?)\nRow 5: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 (the original row 5 had 6 in column 6, now replaced by 4s?)\n\nHmm, so maybe the 6s in certain positions are being replaced by 4s. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2. Input has a 4 in row 1, then 4s spread out. The output seems to have some 4s moving to other positions. For example, in the input, there's a 4 in row 1, column 5. In the output, that's still there. But in row 2, column 3, there's a 4. Maybe the 4s are being spread out or mirrored?\n\nAnother example: Example 3. Input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. The output has a 4 in row 2, column 3, but also in row 2, column 6. Wait, maybe the 4s are being mirrored or expanded in some way?\n\nLooking at Example 4. The input has a 4 in row 1, column 5, and the output has 4s in that position and others. The output seems to have more 4s in certain positions. Maybe the 4s are being spread out in a certain pattern, like expanding to the right or down?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being mirrored or rotated. For example, in Example 1, the 6s in row 3, column 6 are replaced by 4s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain patterns. Like, if there's a 6 in a certain position, it's replaced by 4s. But how to determine that?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has a 4 in row 2, column 3, and output has that same 4, but also in row 2, column 6. Maybe there's some kind of expansion or mirroring. For example, if there's a 4 in column 3, then a 4 is also added in column 6 (which is symmetric in some way? Maybe the grid is 10 columns, so column 3 and 6 are symmetric if the grid is mirrored around the center? Wait, 10 columns. The middle is between 5 and 6. So maybe columns are mirrored around column 5? For example, column 3 and 7? Or maybe some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being spread out in a way that they form a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the input are spread in a way that in the output, they are mirrored or expanded.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being replaced in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the 6s in row 3, column 6 are replaced by 4s. But why? Maybe the 6s are in certain positions that are being replaced by 4s. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 4s. For example, if there's a 4 in a certain position, then certain other positions are also filled with 4s. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 3 is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The original input had a 6 in column 6. So maybe the 6 is being replaced by 4s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being spread out in a way that they form a horizontal line. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 4 in column 3, and then in row 4, there's a 4 in columns 4-6. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 4s are in the input and output. For example, in Example 1, the input has 4s in various positions, and the output seems to have some of them in the same positions, but others are changed. Maybe the transformation is that certain regions are filled with 4s. For example, if there's a 4 in a certain position, then certain other positions are also filled with 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being mirrored in some way. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 3 has a 4 in column 3. The original input for row 3 had 0s except for column 6. But the output has a 4 in column 3. Maybe that's a mirroring of the 6 in column 6?\n\nWait, the input in row 3 has a 6 in column 6. The output for row 3 has a 4 in column 3. So maybe the 6 is being replaced by 4s in positions that are symmetric to where the 6 was. For example, column 6 is mirrored to column 3 (since 10 columns, 6 is 4 positions from the left, and 3 is 4 positions from the right? Let's see: 10 columns. Column 0 to 9. For a position i, the mirror would be 9 - i. For column 6, 9 -6 =3. So yes, column 6 is mirrored to column 3. So maybe whenever there's a 6 in column i, it's replaced by 4s in column 9 -i. But that's just for that example. But in Example 1, the 6 is in column 6 (row 3), and in the output, there's a 4 in column 3. But what about other positions?\n\nLooking at Example 1's row 4. Input row 4 has 6s in columns 4-6. The output row 4 has 4s in columns 4-6. So maybe that's a case where the 6s are being replaced by 4s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 6 in the input is replaced by 4s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the 6 in row 3, column 6 is replaced by 4 in row 3, column 3. But that's a single position. In row 4, the 6s are in columns 4-6, and the output has 4s in those columns. So maybe that's a case where the 6s are replaced by 4s in their positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in their positions, but also some other positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6 in row 3, column 6 is replaced by 4 in column 3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in their positions, and also in mirrored positions. For example, in row 3, column 6 is mirrored to column 3. So the 6 is replaced by 4 in column 3. But in row 4, the 6s are in columns 4-6. Maybe those are replaced by 4s in their positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 6 in the input is replaced by 4s in certain positions. But how to find that?\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs of the examples. For example, in Example 2, the output has more 4s in certain positions. Let's see the input and output for Example 2.\n\nInput:\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 1: same as input\nRow 2: same as input\nRow 3: same as input\nRow 4: 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 (original row 4 had 0s in column 5, but now 4s in columns 4-5?)\nRow 5: 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 (original row 5 had 0s in column 5, but now 4s in columns 4-5?)\nRow 6: 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 (original row 6 had 0s, but now 4s in columns 4-5?)\nRow 7: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 (original row 7 had 0s, but now 4s in columns 4-5?)\nRow 8: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 (original row 8 had 0s, but now 4s in columns 4-5?)\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 (original row 9 had 6 in column 5, now 4 in column 5)\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (original row 10 had 6s in columns 5-8, now they are 0s? Or maybe not. Wait the output for row 10 in example 2 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So that's all zeros. Hmm.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe there's a pattern where 4s are spread out in certain regions. For example, in Example 2, the 4s are expanding from certain positions to other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 4s and 6s. For example, if there's a 4 in a certain position, then certain other positions are filled with 4s. Or if there's a 6, it's replaced by 4s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being mirrored or expanded in some way. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the input are in certain positions, and the output has them mirrored. For example, the 4s in row 3, columns 3-6 in the input (but no, the input for row 3 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0). So that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the 4s are spread in a way that forms a kind of horizontal line. For example, row 0 has 4s from column 3 to 6. Row 1 has 4s from column 2 to 6. Row 2 has 4s from column 3. Row 3 has 4 in column 3. Row 4 has 4s from column 4 to 6. Row 5 has 4s from column 3 to 6. So maybe the 4s are being spread in a way that forms a horizontal line, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being expanded in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the input are in positions that form a certain shape, and the output has them expanded. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in row 3, column 6 and row 4, columns 4-6 and row 5, column 6. In the output, these are replaced by 4s. So maybe whenever there's a 6 in the input, it's replaced by 4s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being spread out to fill certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4s in positions that form a horizontal line. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is not zero is kept, but if it's a 6, it's replaced by 4s. But that doesn't fit with the examples. For example, in Example 2, there are 6s in the input, but the output has 4s in some positions and zeros in others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being mirrored in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the input are mirrored in the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 4. The input has a 4 in row 1, column 5. The output has 4s in that position and others. The output for row 1 has 4s in columns 5, 6, 7, 8. So maybe the 4s are expanding to the right. But how?\n\nAnother approach: try to find for each example what the transformation is.\n\nExample 1: Input has 6s in row 3, column 6. Output has 4 in row 3, column 3. Also, in row 4, the 6s are replaced by 4s. In row 5, the 6 in column 6 is replaced by 4s. So maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in positions that are mirrored. For example, column 6 in row 3 is mirrored to column 3. Similarly, in row 4, columns 4-6 are mirrored to columns 4-6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions based on their position. For example, if a 6 is in column i, then it's replaced by 4 in column i-3. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the 6s are being replaced by 4s in the same row, but in certain positions. For example, in row 3, the 6 is replaced by 4 in column 3. In row 4, the 6s are in columns 4-6, and the output has 4s in those columns. So maybe the 6s are replaced by 4s in their original positions. But why would that be the case?\n\nBut in Example 1, the output for row 3 is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The input for row 3 was 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0. So the 6 is replaced by a 4 in column 3. But why column 3?\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I should look for patterns in the outputs that are common across examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs, there's a lot of 4s. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 4s based on their position.\n\nAnother idea: the 4s in the output are in positions that are part of certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the 4s are in the left part of the grid, but in other examples, they're spread differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being spread out in a way that forms a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the output form a kind of horizontal line, but in other examples, they form different shapes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is not zero is kept, but if it's a 6, it's replaced by 4s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the transformation as a kind of expansion. For example, if there's a 4 in a cell, then certain adjacent cells are also filled with 4s. Or if there's a 6, it's replaced by 4s in certain positions.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the input and output have 4s. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4s in positions that are mirrored from the input's 6s. For example, in row 3, input has a 6 in column 6, and output has a 4 in column 3. So that's a mirrored position. Similarly, in row 4, input has 6s in columns 4-6, and output has 4s in those columns. So maybe the 6s are replaced by 4s in their original positions, but also mirrored positions.\n\nBut why would that be the case? Maybe the transformation is that any 6 in the input is replaced by 4s in the same position and its mirrored position. For example, in row 3, column 6 is mirrored to column 3. So if there's a 6 in column 6, it's replaced by 4 in column 3. But what about other positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are replaced by 4s in their mirrored positions. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a mirror of the input in some way. For example, if the input has a 6 in column i, then the output has a 4 in column 9-i. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 1, row 3, column 6 is 6. 9-6=3. So in output, that position is 4. So that matches.\n\nIn Example 1, row 4, columns 4-6 are 6. 9-4=5, 9-5=4, 9-6=3. So the mirrored positions would be 5,4,3. But in the output, row 4 has 4s in columns 4-6. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in their mirrored positions. So if there's a 6 in column i, then in column 9-i, the value is 4.\n\nBut in Example 1, row 3, column 6 is 6. So in column 3, the output is 4. That fits.\n\nIn Example 1, row 4, columns 4-6 are 6. So their mirrored positions are 5,4,3. So in output, those columns would have 4s. But in the output, row 4 has 4s in columns 4-6. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are replaced by 4s in the same column, but only if the column is in a certain range. Or maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in their own column.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 6s with 4s in certain positions, and leaving other 4s as is.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. The output has a 4 in row 2, column 3 and also in column 6. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are mirrored. For example, column 3 and 6 are mirrored around column 5 (since 3 + 6 = 9, which is the total columns minus 1). So if there's a 4 in column 3, it's mirrored to column 6.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. The output has a 4 in row 2, column 3 and 6. So that suggests that the 4 is being mirrored. So maybe the transformation is that any 4 in the input is mirrored to the other side of the grid. For example, if there's a 4 in column i, then in column 9-i, it's also 4.\n\nBut then, in Example 1, the input has 4s in certain positions, and the output has them mirrored. For example, in row 0, the input has 4s from column 3 to 6. The output has the same 4s. But if that's mirrored, then the mirrored positions would be columns 6, 5, 4, 3. Wait, but the output for row 0 is the same as input. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe this is not the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 6s with 4s in their positions. But in Example 1, the output has 4s in the positions where the input had 6s. For example, row 3, column 6 is 6 in input, and in output it's 4. Row 4, columns 4-6 are 6s in input, and in output they are 4s. Row 5, column 6 is 6, and in output it's 4. So maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in their positions. But then why in Example 3, the input has 4s in certain positions, and the output has 4s in other positions? Like in Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 3, and output has a 4 in row 2, column 3 and 6. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being expanded to their mirrored positions. For example, if there's a 4 in column i, then in column 9-i, it's also 4.\n\nBut how to test this. Let's look at Example 1's input. Row 0 has 4s from column 3 to 6. The mirrored positions for column 3 is 6, column 4 is 5, column 5 is 4, column 6 is 3. So if the input has 4s in columns 3-6, the output would have 4s in columns 3-6 and 6-3? But in the output, row 0 has 4s from 3-6, which is the same as input. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being expanded in a certain way. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the input are in positions that form a shape, and the output has them expanded to fill certain areas.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 6s with 4s in their positions, and also mirroring the 4s in certain ways.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is not zero is kept, but if it's a 6, it's replaced by 4s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the 4s are being spread out in a way that forms a horizontal line in certain rows. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 3 has a 4 in column 3, which is part of a horizontal line. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, the 4s are often in positions that are to the left of the original 6s. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in column 6, and the output has a 4 in column 3. So maybe the 4s are being placed in the left side of the grid, but this is not consistent across all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the 4s are being placed in certain positions based on their distance from the left or right edge. But this is too vague.\n\nMaybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing 6s with 4s and mirroring 4s.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the 6s are replaced by 4s in their mirrored positions. And the 4s are mirrored as well.\n\nBut how to code that.\n\nSo the plan would be:\n\n- For each cell in the input grid, if it's a 6, replace it with 4 in its mirrored position (column 9 - i).\n\n- For each cell that is a 4, mirror it to the other side.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that any 6 in the input is replaced by 4 in the same position, and also mirrored. Or maybe the 6 is replaced by 4 in the mirrored position.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nLet's try to code that.\n\nSo for each cell (i, j) in the input grid:\n\nIf the cell is 6, then in the output grid, set (i, j) to 4, and also set (i, 9 - j) to 4.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, row 3, column 6 is 6. So in output, (3, 6) is 4, and (3, 3) is 4. Which matches the example.\n\nIn row 4, columns 4-6 are 6. So for each of those, set (4, j) to 4 and (4, 9-j) to 4.\n\nFor j=4: 9-4=5. So (4,4) and (4,5) are set to 4. But in the output, row 4 has 4s in columns 4-6. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6 is replaced by 4 in the same position, and also in the mirrored position. But that would mean that for each 6, we add 4s in both positions. But in Example 1, the output for row 3, column 6 is 4, and column 3 is 4. So that's correct.\n\nBut in row 4, the input has 6 in columns 4,5,6. So for each of those columns, we set the same position to 4 and the mirrored position to 4. For column 4: mirrored is 5. So for (4,4) and (4,5), set to 4. For column 5: mirrored is 4. So already set. For column 6: mirrored is 3. So (4,6) and (4,3) are set to 4. But in the output, row 4 has 4s in columns 4-6. So that would mean that (4,3) is 4, but in the output, row 4 is 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 0. Wait, the output for row 4 in Example 1 is:\n\n0 0 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 0\n\nSo columns 0-9: positions 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo columns 2 is 4, 3 is 4, 4 is 4, 5 is 4, 6 is 4. So the 4s are in columns 2-6. But according to the mirrored positions, for column 6, the mirrored is 3. So (4,3) is set to 4. But in the input, row 4, column 3 is 0. So this would mean that the output has a 4 in column 3. Which is what the example shows.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So for each 6 in the input, we set the same position to 4 and its mirrored position to 4. But what about other cells?\n\nBut what about the 4s in the input? Are they being mirrored as well? For example, in Example 1, the input has 4s in certain positions, and the output has them mirrored.\n\nBut in the output, the 4s are not mirrored. For example, row 0 has 4s from column 3 to 6. The mirrored positions would be columns 6 to 3. But the output has the same 4s. So maybe the 4s are not being mirrored, but the 6s are being replaced by 4s in their mirrored positions.\n\nBut this would explain some of the examples. Let's see.\n\nSo the transformation would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nIf the cell is 6, then set (i,j) to 4, and set (i, 9-j) to 4.\n\nFor other cells, leave them as is.\n\nBut wait, what about the 4s in the input? For example, in Example 1, the input has 4s in certain positions, and the output has them. So the 4s are not being changed. Only the 6s are being replaced.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. The output has a 4 in row 2, column 3 and 6. So that would suggest that the 4 is being mirrored. But according to the above logic, only 6s are being replaced. So this is a contradiction.\n\nHmm. So this approach might not work for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 4 in the input is mirrored to the other side of the grid, and any 6 is replaced by 4 in its mirrored position.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nFor example, in Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. The output has a 4 in row 2, column 3 and 6. So that would be the mirrored position.\n\nSo the transformation would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\n- If the cell is 4, then set (i, 9-j) to 4.\n\n- If the cell is 6, then set (i,j) to 4 and (i, 9-j) to 4.\n\nBut this might explain some of the examples.\n\nLet's test this on Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 6s in row 3, column 6. So for that cell, set (3,6) to 4 and (3,3) to 4. So in the output, those positions are 4. Which matches the example.\n\nIn row 4, the input has 6 in columns 4-6. For each of those:\n\n- (4,4): set to 4 and (4,5) to 4.\n\n- (4,5): set to 4 and (4,4) to 4 (already set).\n\n- (4,6): set to 4 and (4,3) to 4.\n\nSo the output for row 4 would have 4 in columns 3,4,5,6. Which matches the example.\n\nIn row 5, column 6 is 6. So set (5,6) to 4 and (5,3) to 4. So in the output, row 5 has 4 in column 3 and 6. Which matches the example.\n\nBut what about the 4s in the input? For example, in row 0, column 3 is 4. So we set (0,3) to 4 and (0,6) to 4. But in the input, row 0, column 6 is 4. So the output would have 4 in column 6 as well. But in the example, row 0 has 4 in columns 3-6. So that would mean that the 4 in column 6 is already present, and the mirrored position is 3. So the output would have 4 in columns 3-6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this seems to work for Example 1.\n\nNow for Example 3.\n\nInput for row 2, column 3 is 4. So in the output, we set (2,3) to 4 and (2,6) to 4. Which matches the output of Example 3, where row 2 has 4 in column 3 and 6.\n\nAnother example: in Example 3, input row 2, column 3 is 4. Output row 2 has 4 in column 3 and 6. Which fits.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\n- If the cell is 4, then set (i, 9-j) to 4.\n\n- If the cell is 6, then set (i,j) to 4 and (i, 9-j) to 4.\n\n- For other cells, leave them as is.\n\nWait, but what about the 4s in the input that are already mirrored? For example, if a cell is 4 in column j, and its mirrored column is j', then we set j' to 4. But if j' is already 4, then it's already set. So this would ensure that all 4s are mirrored.\n\nBut what about cells that are not 4 or 6? They are left as is.\n\nLet's test this on Example 2.\n\nExample 2's input has a 4 in row 1, column 5. So in the output, we set (1,5) to 4 and (1,4) to 4. But in the input, row 1, column 5 is 4, and column 4 is 0. So the output would have 4 in column 4 and 5. But in the example, the output for row 1 is the same as input. So this would imply that the transformation is not correct.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because in Example 2, the input for row 1 is 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0. So column 5 is 4. According to the transformation, we should set (1,5) to 4 (which it already is) and (1,4) to 4. So in the output, column 4 would be 4. But in the output for Example 2, row 1 is the same as input, which has 0 in column 4. So this suggests that the transformation is not correct.\n\nHmm. So this approach works for some examples but not others. So what's wrong here?\n\nMaybe the transformation is not to mirror the 4s, but to replace 6s with 4s in their mirrored positions, and leave the 4s as they are. But then why in Example 3, the 4 is mirrored?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is only to replace 6s with 4s in their mirrored positions, and not to mirror the 4s.\n\nLet's try that. So for each 6 in the input, set (i,j) and (i, 9-j) to 4. For other cells, leave as is.\n\nIn Example 1, this would work. For row 3, column 6 is 6, so set (3,6) and (3,3) to 4. Which matches the example.\n\nFor row 4, columns 4-6 are 6. So for each of those:\n\n- (4,4) and (4,5) \u2192 set to 4.\n\n- (4,5) and (4,4) \u2192 already set.\n\n- (4,6) and (4,3) \u2192 set to 4.\n\nSo in the output, row 4 has 4s in columns 3,4,5,6. Which matches the example.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. According to this transformation, it's left as is. But in the output, it's also present, but there's a 4 in column 6. So this suggests that the 4 is not being mirrored, but the 6 is being replaced.\n\nBut how to explain the 4 in column 6 in row 2 of Example 3's output. The input for row 2, column 6 is 0. So according to this transformation, it would be 0. But the output has a 4 there. So this suggests that the transformation is not just replacing 6s.\n\nSo this approach is not working for all examples.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of other patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput row 2, column 3 is 4. Output row 2, column 3 is 4 and column 6 is 4. So the 4 is mirrored. So perhaps the transformation is that any 4 in the input is mirrored, and any 6 is replaced by 4 in its mirrored position.\n\nBut then, for the input in Example 2, row 1, column 5 is 4. So in the output, we would set column 4 to 4. But in the output of Example 2, row 1 is the same as input. So this is a contradiction.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is to mirror the 4s and 6s, but only in certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 4 in the input is mirrored to the other side, and any 6 is replaced by 4 in its position and mirrored position.\n\nBut in Example 2, this would cause the 4 in row 1, column 5 to be mirrored to column 4, making it 4. But the output for Example 2's row 1 is the same as input, which has 0 in column 4. So this is a problem.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is not to mirror all 4s, but only certain ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 4 in the input is mirrored, and any 6 is replaced by 4 in its position and mirrored position. But for Example 2, the input has a 4 in row 1, column 5. So in the output, that position is 4, and column 4 is 4. But in the output, row 1 is the same as input, which has 0 in column 4. So this is conflicting.\n\nMaybe the transformation is different for different examples. But that's not possible.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in their mirrored positions, and also to replace 4s in certain positions with 4s in other positions.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in their mirrored positions, and to replace 4s in certain positions with 4s in other positions, but this is too vague.\n\nMaybe the key is to look for the common pattern in the examples. For example, in all examples, the 6s are replaced by 4s in their mirrored positions, and the 4s are being spread out in certain ways.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nLet's try to proceed with the following approach:\n\n- For each cell in the input grid, if it's a 6, replace it with 4 in its mirrored position.\n\n- For each cell in the input grid, if it's a 4, replace it with 4 in its mirrored position.\n\nBut this would mean that all 4s and 6s are mirrored.\n\nBut in Example 2, this would cause the 4 in row 1, column 5 to be mirrored to column 4, making it 4. But the output for Example 2's row 1 is the same as input, which has 0 in column 4. So this is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in their mirrored positions, and to replace 4s in certain positions with 4s in other positions.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to focus on the 6s and their mirrored positions, and ignore the 4s. But then, how to explain Example 3's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in their mirrored positions, and to replace 4s in certain positions with 4s in other positions based on their position.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to implement the transformation that replaces 6s with 4s in their mirrored positions, and see if that works for the examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\nIf the cell is 6, then in the output grid, set (i,j) to 4 and (i, 9-j) to 4.\n\nFor other cells, leave as is.\n\nLet's test this on Example 3.\n\nExample 3's input:\n\nRow 2, column 3 is 4. According to this code, it is left as is. But in the output, row 2 has 4 in column 3 and 6. So this suggests that this code would not explain that.\n\nBut perhaps there are other 6s in the input that are being replaced.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 6 in row 7, column 5. So for that cell, set (7,5) and (7,4) to 4. But in the output, row 7 is all zeros. So this suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should try to code this approach and see what happens with the examples.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this approach and see.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Iterate over each cell\n    for i in range(6):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Set mirrored position\n                mirrored_j = 9 - j\n                # Set current position to 4\n                transformed[i][j] = 4\n                # Set mirrored position to 4\n                transformed[i][mirrored_j] = 4\n    return transformed\n\nBut let's test this on Example 1.\n\nExample 1 input has 6s in row 3, column 6. So transformed[3][6] = 4, and transformed[3][3] = 4. Which matches the example.\n\nRow 4, columns 4-6 are 6. So for each of these, transformed[i][j] and transformed[i][9-j] are set to 4. For j=4, mirrored_j=5. So transformed[4][4] = 4, transformed[4][5] = 4. For j=5, mirrored_j=4. So already set. For j=6, mirrored_j=3. So transformed[4][6] = 4, transformed[4][3] = 4. So in row 4, columns 3,4,5,6 are 4. Which matches the example.\n\nRow 5, column 6 is 6. So transformed[5][6] = 4, transformed[5][3] = 4. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this seems to work for Example 1.\n\nNow for Example 3.\n\nExample 3 input has a 6 in row 7, column 5. So transformed[7][5] = 4, transformed[7][4] = 4. But in the output for Example 3, row 7 is all zeros. So this suggests that the code is not correct. But maybe the input for Example 3 has no 6s in row 7? Let me check.\n\nExample 3's input:\n\nRow 7 is 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0. So column 5 is 6, column 6 is 6, column 7 is 6.\n\nSo for each of these:\n\nFor j=5: mirrored_j=4. So set (7,5) and (7,4) to 4.\n\nFor j=6: mirrored_j=3. Set (7,6) and (7,3) to 4.\n\nFor j=7: mirrored_j=2. Set (7,7) and (7,2) to 4.\n\nSo in the output, row 7 would have 4s in columns 2,3,4,5,6,7. But the example's output for row 7 is all zeros. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the example, the output for Example 3 is:\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is not just replacing 6s with 4s in their mirrored positions.\n\nSo this approach is not working for all examples.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is not about 6s, but about 4s and 6s in a different way.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 4s are being expanded to form a certain shape, and the 6s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in their positions, and also to expand 4s to their mirrored positions.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. So according to this, we set (2,3) to 4 and (2,6) to 4. Which matches the output.\n\nBut how to handle the 6s.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\n- If the cell is 6, set it to 4.\n\n- If the cell is 4, set its mirrored position to 4.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(6):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed[i][j] = 4\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                mirrored_j = 9 - j\n                transformed[i][mirrored_j] = 4\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, this would set the mirrored position to 4 even if it's already 4.\n\nLet's test this on Example 1.\n\nIn row 3, column 6 is 6. So transformed[3][6] = 4. The mirrored position is 3, so transformed[3][3] = 4. Which matches the example.\n\nIn row 4, columns 4-6 are 6. So transformed[4][4] = 4, transformed[4][5] = 4, transformed[4][6] = 4. The mirrored positions for these columns are 5,4,3. So for j=4, mirrored_j=5, so transformed[4][5] = 4. But it's already set. For j=5, mirrored_j=4, already set. For j=6, mirrored_j=3, so transformed[4][3] = 4. So in row 4, columns 3,4,5,6 are 4. Which matches the example.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. So transformed[2][3] is 4 (already), and mirrored_j=6. So transformed[2][6] = 4. Which matches the output.\n\nFor the 6 in row 7, column 5: transformed[7][5] = 4. The mirrored_j=4, so transformed[7][4] = 4. But in the output for Example 3, row 7 is all zeros. So this suggests that this code is not correct.\n\nBut according to the example, the output for Example 3's row 7 is all zeros. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nThis is very confusing. Perhaps the transformation is different. Maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions, and the 4s are being replaced in certain ways.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in their positions, and also replace 4s in certain positions with 4s in other positions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 6s with 4s in their positions and mirrors 4s to their mirrored positions, even if it doesn't work for all examples. This is the best I can do based on the patterns observed.\n"

Wait, looking at the input and output for Example 1:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n\nOutput rows:\nRow 0: same as input\nRow 1: same as input\nRow 2: same as input\nRow 3: 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 (the 6 in column 6 is replaced by 4?)\nRow 4: 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 0 (the original row 4 had 6s in columns 4-6, but now they're 4s?)\nRow 5: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 (the original row 5 had 6 in column 6, now replaced by 4s?)\n\nHmm, so maybe the 6s in certain positions are being replaced by 4s. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2. Input has a 4 in row 1, then 4s spread out. The output seems to have some 4s moving to other positions. For example, in the input, there's a 4 in row 1, column 5. In the output, that's still there. But in row 2, column 3, there's a 4. Maybe the 4s are being spread out or mirrored?\n\nAnother example: Example 3. Input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. The output has a 4 in row 2, column 3, but also in row 2, column 6. Wait, maybe the 4s are being mirrored or expanded in some way?\n\nLooking at Example 4. The input has a 4 in row 1, column 5, and the output has 4s in that position and others. The output seems to have more 4s in certain positions. Maybe the 4s are being spread out in a certain pattern, like expanding to the right or down?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being mirrored or rotated. For example, in Example 1, the 6s in row 3, column 6 are replaced by 4s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain patterns. Like, if there's a 6 in a certain position, it's replaced by 4s. But how to determine that?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has a 4 in row 2, column 3, and output has that same 4, but also in row 2, column 6. Maybe there's some kind of expansion or mirroring. For example, if there's a 4 in column 3, then a 4 is also added in column 6 (which is symmetric in some way? Maybe the grid is 10 columns, so column 3 and 6 are symmetric if the grid is mirrored around the center? Wait, 10 columns. The middle is between 5 and 6. So maybe columns are mirrored around column 5? For example, column 3 and 7? Or maybe some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being spread out in a way that they form a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the input are spread in a way that in the output, they are mirrored or expanded.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being replaced in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the 6s in row 3, column 6 are replaced by 4s. But why? Maybe the 6s are in certain positions that are being replaced by 4s. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 4s. For example, if there's a 4 in a certain position, then certain other positions are also filled with 4s. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 3 is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The original input had a 6 in column 6. So maybe the 6 is being replaced by 4s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being spread out in a way that they form a horizontal line. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 4 in column 3, and then in row 4, there's a 4 in columns 4-6. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 4s are in the input and output. For example, in Example 1, the input has 4s in various positions, and the output seems to have some of them in the same positions, but others are changed. Maybe the transformation is that certain regions are filled with 4s. For example, if there's a 4 in a certain position, then certain other positions are also filled with 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being mirrored in some way. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 3 has a 4 in column 3. The original input for row 3 had 0s except for column 6. But the output has a 4 in column 3. Maybe that's a mirroring of the 6 in column 6?\n\nWait, the input in row 3 has a 6 in column 6. The output for row 3 has a 4 in column 3. So maybe the 6 is being replaced by 4s in positions that are symmetric to where the 6 was. For example, column 6 is mirrored to column 3 (since 10 columns, 6 is 4 positions from the left, and 3 is 4 positions from the right? Let's see: 10 columns. Column 0 to 9. For a position i, the mirror would be 9 - i. For column 6, 9 -6 =3. So yes, column 6 is mirrored to column 3. So maybe whenever there's a 6 in column i, it's replaced by 4s in column 9 -i. But that's just for that example. But in Example 1, the 6 is in column 6 (row 3), and in the output, there's a 4 in column 3. But what about other positions?\n\nLooking at Example 1's row 4. Input row 4 has 6s in columns 4-6. The output row 4 has 4s in columns 4-6. So maybe that's a case where the 6s are being replaced by 4s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 6 in the input is replaced by 4s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the 6 in row 3, column 6 is replaced by 4 in row 3, column 3. But that's a single position. In row 4, the 6s are in columns 4-6, and the output has 4s in those columns. So maybe that's a case where the 6s are replaced by 4s in their positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in their positions, but also some other positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6 in row 3, column 6 is replaced by 4 in column 3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in their positions, and also in mirrored positions. For example, in row 3, column 6 is mirrored to column 3. So the 6 is replaced by 4 in column 3. But in row 4, the 6s are in columns 4-6. Maybe those are replaced by 4s in their positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 6 in the input is replaced by 4s in certain positions. But how to find that?\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs of the examples. For example, in Example 2, the output has more 4s in certain positions. Let's see the input and output for Example 2.\n\nInput:\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 1: same as input\nRow 2: same as input\nRow 3: same as input\nRow 4: 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 (original row 4 had 0s in column 5, but now 4s in columns 4-5?)\nRow 5: 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 (original row 5 had 0s in column 5, but now 4s in columns 4-5?)\nRow 6: 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 (original row 6 had 0s, but now 4s in columns 4-5?)\nRow 7: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 (original row 7 had 0s, but now 4s in columns 4-5?)\nRow 8: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 (original row 8 had 0s, but now 4s in columns 4-5?)\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 (original row 9 had 6 in column 5, now 4 in column 5)\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (original row 10 had 6s in columns 5-8, now they are 0s? Or maybe not. Wait the output for row 10 in example 2 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So that's all zeros. Hmm.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe there's a pattern where 4s are spread out in certain regions. For example, in Example 2, the 4s are expanding from certain positions to other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 4s and 6s. For example, if there's a 4 in a certain position, then certain other positions are filled with 4s. Or if there's a 6, it's replaced by 4s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being mirrored or expanded in some way. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the input are in certain positions, and the output has them mirrored. For example, the 4s in row 3, columns 3-6 in the input (but no, the input for row 3 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0). So that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the 4s are spread in a way that forms a kind of horizontal line. For example, row 0 has 4s from column 3 to 6. Row 1 has 4s from column 2 to 6. Row 2 has 4s from column 3. Row 3 has 4 in column 3. Row 4 has 4s from column 4 to 6. Row 5 has 4s from column 3 to 6. So maybe the 4s are being spread in a way that forms a horizontal line, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being expanded in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the input are in positions that form a certain shape, and the output has them expanded. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in row 3, column 6 and row 4, columns 4-6 and row 5, column 6. In the output, these are replaced by 4s. So maybe whenever there's a 6 in the input, it's replaced by 4s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being spread out to fill certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4s in positions that form a horizontal line. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is not zero is kept, but if it's a 6, it's replaced by 4s. But that doesn't fit with the examples. For example, in Example 2, there are 6s in the input, but the output has 4s in some positions and zeros in others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being mirrored in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the input are mirrored in the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 4. The input has a 4 in row 1, column 5. The output has 4s in that position and others. The output for row 1 has 4s in columns 5, 6, 7, 8. So maybe the 4s are expanding to the right. But how?\n\nAnother approach: try to find for each example what the transformation is.\n\nExample 1: Input has 6s in row 3, column 6. Output has 4 in row 3, column 3. Also, in row 4, the 6s are replaced by 4s. In row 5, the 6 in column 6 is replaced by 4s. So maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in positions that are mirrored. For example, column 6 in row 3 is mirrored to column 3. Similarly, in row 4, columns 4-6 are mirrored to columns 4-6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions based on their position. For example, if a 6 is in column i, then it's replaced by 4 in column i-3. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the 6s are being replaced by 4s in the same row, but in certain positions. For example, in row 3, the 6 is replaced by 4 in column 3. In row 4, the 6s are in columns 4-6, and the output has 4s in those columns. So maybe the 6s are replaced by 4s in their original positions. But why would that be the case?\n\nBut in Example 1, the output for row 3 is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The input for row 3 was 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0. So the 6 is replaced by a 4 in column 3. But why column 3?\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I should look for patterns in the outputs that are common across examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs, there's a lot of 4s. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 4s based on their position.\n\nAnother idea: the 4s in the output are in positions that are part of certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the 4s are in the left part of the grid, but in other examples, they're spread differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being spread out in a way that forms a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the output form a kind of horizontal line, but in other examples, they form different shapes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is not zero is kept, but if it's a 6, it's replaced by 4s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the transformation as a kind of expansion. For example, if there's a 4 in a cell, then certain adjacent cells are also filled with 4s. Or if there's a 6, it's replaced by 4s in certain positions.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the input and output have 4s. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4s in positions that are mirrored from the input's 6s. For example, in row 3, input has a 6 in column 6, and output has a 4 in column 3. So that's a mirrored position. Similarly, in row 4, input has 6s in columns 4-6, and output has 4s in those columns. So maybe the 6s are replaced by 4s in their original positions, but also mirrored positions.\n\nBut why would that be the case? Maybe the transformation is that any 6 in the input is replaced by 4s in the same position and its mirrored position. For example, in row 3, column 6 is mirrored to column 3. So if there's a 6 in column 6, it's replaced by 4 in column 3. But what about other positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are replaced by 4s in their mirrored positions. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a mirror of the input in some way. For example, if the input has a 6 in column i, then the output has a 4 in column 9-i. Let's check that.\n\nIn Example 1, row 3, column 6 is 6. 9-6=3. So in output, that position is 4. So that matches.\n\nIn Example 1, row 4, columns 4-6 are 6. 9-4=5, 9-5=4, 9-6=3. So the mirrored positions would be 5,4,3. But in the output, row 4 has 4s in columns 4-6. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in their mirrored positions. So if there's a 6 in column i, then in column 9-i, the value is 4.\n\nBut in Example 1, row 3, column 6 is 6. So in column 3, the output is 4. That fits.\n\nIn Example 1, row 4, columns 4-6 are 6. So their mirrored positions are 5,4,3. So in output, those columns would have 4s. But in the output, row 4 has 4s in columns 4-6. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are replaced by 4s in the same column, but only if the column is in a certain range. Or maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in their own column.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 6s with 4s in certain positions, and leaving other 4s as is.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. The output has a 4 in row 2, column 3 and also in column 6. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are mirrored. For example, column 3 and 6 are mirrored around column 5 (since 3 + 6 = 9, which is the total columns minus 1). So if there's a 4 in column 3, it's mirrored to column 6.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. The output has a 4 in row 2, column 3 and 6. So that suggests that the 4 is being mirrored. So maybe the transformation is that any 4 in the input is mirrored to the other side of the grid. For example, if there's a 4 in column i, then in column 9-i, it's also 4.\n\nBut then, in Example 1, the input has 4s in certain positions, and the output has them mirrored. For example, in row 0, the input has 4s from column 3 to 6. The output has the same 4s. But if that's mirrored, then the mirrored positions would be columns 6, 5, 4, 3. Wait, but the output for row 0 is the same as input. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe this is not the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 6s with 4s in their positions. But in Example 1, the output has 4s in the positions where the input had 6s. For example, row 3, column 6 is 6 in input, and in output it's 4. Row 4, columns 4-6 are 6s in input, and in output they are 4s. Row 5, column 6 is 6, and in output it's 4. So maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in their positions. But then why in Example 3, the input has 4s in certain positions, and the output has 4s in other positions? Like in Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 3, and output has a 4 in row 2, column 3 and 6. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being expanded to their mirrored positions. For example, if there's a 4 in column i, then in column 9-i, it's also 4.\n\nBut how to test this. Let's look at Example 1's input. Row 0 has 4s from column 3 to 6. The mirrored positions for column 3 is 6, column 4 is 5, column 5 is 4, column 6 is 3. So if the input has 4s in columns 3-6, the output would have 4s in columns 3-6 and 6-3? But in the output, row 0 has 4s from 3-6, which is the same as input. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 4s are being expanded in a certain way. For example, in Example 1, the 4s in the input are in positions that form a shape, and the output has them expanded to fill certain areas.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 6s with 4s in their positions, and also mirroring the 4s in certain ways.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is not zero is kept, but if it's a 6, it's replaced by 4s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the 4s are being spread out in a way that forms a horizontal line in certain rows. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 3 has a 4 in column 3, which is part of a horizontal line. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, the 4s are often in positions that are to the left of the original 6s. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in column 6, and the output has a 4 in column 3. So maybe the 4s are being placed in the left side of the grid, but this is not consistent across all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the 4s are being placed in certain positions based on their distance from the left or right edge. But this is too vague.\n\nMaybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing 6s with 4s and mirroring 4s.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the 6s are replaced by 4s in their mirrored positions. And the 4s are mirrored as well.\n\nBut how to code that.\n\nSo the plan would be:\n\n- For each cell in the input grid, if it's a 6, replace it with 4 in its mirrored position (column 9 - i).\n\n- For each cell that is a 4, mirror it to the other side.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that any 6 in the input is replaced by 4 in the same position, and also mirrored. Or maybe the 6 is replaced by 4 in the mirrored position.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nLet's try to code that.\n\nSo for each cell (i, j) in the input grid:\n\nIf the cell is 6, then in the output grid, set (i, j) to 4, and also set (i, 9 - j) to 4.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, row 3, column 6 is 6. So in output, (3, 6) is 4, and (3, 3) is 4. Which matches the example.\n\nIn row 4, columns 4-6 are 6. So for each of those, set (4, j) to 4 and (4, 9-j) to 4.\n\nFor j=4: 9-4=5. So (4,4) and (4,5) are set to 4. But in the output, row 4 has 4s in columns 4-6. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6 is replaced by 4 in the same position, and also in the mirrored position. But that would mean that for each 6, we add 4s in both positions. But in Example 1, the output for row 3, column 6 is 4, and column 3 is 4. So that's correct.\n\nBut in row 4, the input has 6 in columns 4,5,6. So for each of those columns, we set the same position to 4 and the mirrored position to 4. For column 4: mirrored is 5. So for (4,4) and (4,5), set to 4. For column 5: mirrored is 4. So already set. For column 6: mirrored is 3. So (4,6) and (4,3) are set to 4. But in the output, row 4 has 4s in columns 4-6. So that would mean that (4,3) is 4, but in the output, row 4 is 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 0. Wait, the output for row 4 in Example 1 is:\n\n0 0 4 4 4 4 0 4 4 0\n\nSo columns 0-9: positions 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo columns 2 is 4, 3 is 4, 4 is 4, 5 is 4, 6 is 4. So the 4s are in columns 2-6. But according to the mirrored positions, for column 6, the mirrored is 3. So (4,3) is set to 4. But in the input, row 4, column 3 is 0. So this would mean that the output has a 4 in column 3. Which is what the example shows.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So for each 6 in the input, we set the same position to 4 and its mirrored position to 4. But what about other cells?\n\nBut what about the 4s in the input? Are they being mirrored as well? For example, in Example 1, the input has 4s in certain positions, and the output has them mirrored.\n\nBut in the output, the 4s are not mirrored. For example, row 0 has 4s from column 3 to 6. The mirrored positions would be columns 6 to 3. But the output has the same 4s. So maybe the 4s are not being mirrored, but the 6s are being replaced by 4s in their mirrored positions.\n\nBut this would explain some of the examples. Let's see.\n\nSo the transformation would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nIf the cell is 6, then set (i,j) to 4, and set (i, 9-j) to 4.\n\nFor other cells, leave them as is.\n\nBut wait, what about the 4s in the input? For example, in Example 1, the input has 4s in certain positions, and the output has them. So the 4s are not being changed. Only the 6s are being replaced.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. The output has a 4 in row 2, column 3 and 6. So that would suggest that the 4 is being mirrored. But according to the above logic, only 6s are being replaced. So this is a contradiction.\n\nHmm. So this approach might not work for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 4 in the input is mirrored to the other side of the grid, and any 6 is replaced by 4 in its mirrored position.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nFor example, in Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. The output has a 4 in row 2, column 3 and 6. So that would be the mirrored position.\n\nSo the transformation would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\n- If the cell is 4, then set (i, 9-j) to 4.\n\n- If the cell is 6, then set (i,j) to 4 and (i, 9-j) to 4.\n\nBut this might explain some of the examples.\n\nLet's test this on Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 6s in row 3, column 6. So for that cell, set (3,6) to 4 and (3,3) to 4. So in the output, those positions are 4. Which matches the example.\n\nIn row 4, the input has 6 in columns 4-6. For each of those:\n\n- (4,4): set to 4 and (4,5) to 4.\n\n- (4,5): set to 4 and (4,4) to 4 (already set).\n\n- (4,6): set to 4 and (4,3) to 4.\n\nSo the output for row 4 would have 4 in columns 3,4,5,6. Which matches the example.\n\nIn row 5, column 6 is 6. So set (5,6) to 4 and (5,3) to 4. So in the output, row 5 has 4 in column 3 and 6. Which matches the example.\n\nBut what about the 4s in the input? For example, in row 0, column 3 is 4. So we set (0,3) to 4 and (0,6) to 4. But in the input, row 0, column 6 is 4. So the output would have 4 in column 6 as well. But in the example, row 0 has 4 in columns 3-6. So that would mean that the 4 in column 6 is already present, and the mirrored position is 3. So the output would have 4 in columns 3-6. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this seems to work for Example 1.\n\nNow for Example 3.\n\nInput for row 2, column 3 is 4. So in the output, we set (2,3) to 4 and (2,6) to 4. Which matches the output of Example 3, where row 2 has 4 in column 3 and 6.\n\nAnother example: in Example 3, input row 2, column 3 is 4. Output row 2 has 4 in column 3 and 6. Which fits.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\n- If the cell is 4, then set (i, 9-j) to 4.\n\n- If the cell is 6, then set (i,j) to 4 and (i, 9-j) to 4.\n\n- For other cells, leave them as is.\n\nWait, but what about the 4s in the input that are already mirrored? For example, if a cell is 4 in column j, and its mirrored column is j', then we set j' to 4. But if j' is already 4, then it's already set. So this would ensure that all 4s are mirrored.\n\nBut what about cells that are not 4 or 6? They are left as is.\n\nLet's test this on Example 2.\n\nExample 2's input has a 4 in row 1, column 5. So in the output, we set (1,5) to 4 and (1,4) to 4. But in the input, row 1, column 5 is 4, and column 4 is 0. So the output would have 4 in column 4 and 5. But in the example, the output for row 1 is the same as input. So this would imply that the transformation is not correct.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Because in Example 2, the input for row 1 is 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0. So column 5 is 4. According to the transformation, we should set (1,5) to 4 (which it already is) and (1,4) to 4. So in the output, column 4 would be 4. But in the output for Example 2, row 1 is the same as input, which has 0 in column 4. So this suggests that the transformation is not correct.\n\nHmm. So this approach works for some examples but not others. So what's wrong here?\n\nMaybe the transformation is not to mirror the 4s, but to replace 6s with 4s in their mirrored positions, and leave the 4s as they are. But then why in Example 3, the 4 is mirrored?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is only to replace 6s with 4s in their mirrored positions, and not to mirror the 4s.\n\nLet's try that. So for each 6 in the input, set (i,j) and (i, 9-j) to 4. For other cells, leave as is.\n\nIn Example 1, this would work. For row 3, column 6 is 6, so set (3,6) and (3,3) to 4. Which matches the example.\n\nFor row 4, columns 4-6 are 6. So for each of those:\n\n- (4,4) and (4,5) \u2192 set to 4.\n\n- (4,5) and (4,4) \u2192 already set.\n\n- (4,6) and (4,3) \u2192 set to 4.\n\nSo in the output, row 4 has 4s in columns 3,4,5,6. Which matches the example.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. According to this transformation, it's left as is. But in the output, it's also present, but there's a 4 in column 6. So this suggests that the 4 is not being mirrored, but the 6 is being replaced.\n\nBut how to explain the 4 in column 6 in row 2 of Example 3's output. The input for row 2, column 6 is 0. So according to this transformation, it would be 0. But the output has a 4 there. So this suggests that the transformation is not just replacing 6s.\n\nSo this approach is not working for all examples.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of other patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput row 2, column 3 is 4. Output row 2, column 3 is 4 and column 6 is 4. So the 4 is mirrored. So perhaps the transformation is that any 4 in the input is mirrored, and any 6 is replaced by 4 in its mirrored position.\n\nBut then, for the input in Example 2, row 1, column 5 is 4. So in the output, we would set column 4 to 4. But in the output of Example 2, row 1 is the same as input. So this is a contradiction.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is to mirror the 4s and 6s, but only in certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 4 in the input is mirrored to the other side, and any 6 is replaced by 4 in its position and mirrored position.\n\nBut in Example 2, this would cause the 4 in row 1, column 5 to be mirrored to column 4, making it 4. But the output for Example 2's row 1 is the same as input, which has 0 in column 4. So this is a problem.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is not to mirror all 4s, but only certain ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 4 in the input is mirrored, and any 6 is replaced by 4 in its position and mirrored position. But for Example 2, the input has a 4 in row 1, column 5. So in the output, that position is 4, and column 4 is 4. But in the output, row 1 is the same as input, which has 0 in column 4. So this is conflicting.\n\nMaybe the transformation is different for different examples. But that's not possible.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in their mirrored positions, and also to replace 4s in certain positions with 4s in other positions.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in their mirrored positions, and to replace 4s in certain positions with 4s in other positions, but this is too vague.\n\nMaybe the key is to look for the common pattern in the examples. For example, in all examples, the 6s are replaced by 4s in their mirrored positions, and the 4s are being spread out in certain ways.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nLet's try to proceed with the following approach:\n\n- For each cell in the input grid, if it's a 6, replace it with 4 in its mirrored position.\n\n- For each cell in the input grid, if it's a 4, replace it with 4 in its mirrored position.\n\nBut this would mean that all 4s and 6s are mirrored.\n\nBut in Example 2, this would cause the 4 in row 1, column 5 to be mirrored to column 4, making it 4. But the output for Example 2's row 1 is the same as input, which has 0 in column 4. So this is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in their mirrored positions, and to replace 4s in certain positions with 4s in other positions.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to focus on the 6s and their mirrored positions, and ignore the 4s. But then, how to explain Example 3's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in their mirrored positions, and to replace 4s in certain positions with 4s in other positions based on their position.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to implement the transformation that replaces 6s with 4s in their mirrored positions, and see if that works for the examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\nIf the cell is 6, then in the output grid, set (i,j) to 4 and (i, 9-j) to 4.\n\nFor other cells, leave as is.\n\nLet's test this on Example 3.\n\nExample 3's input:\n\nRow 2, column 3 is 4. According to this code, it is left as is. But in the output, row 2 has 4 in column 3 and 6. So this suggests that this code would not explain that.\n\nBut perhaps there are other 6s in the input that are being replaced.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 6 in row 7, column 5. So for that cell, set (7,5) and (7,4) to 4. But in the output, row 7 is all zeros. So this suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should try to code this approach and see what happens with the examples.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this approach and see.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Iterate over each cell\n    for i in range(6):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Set mirrored position\n                mirrored_j = 9 - j\n                # Set current position to 4\n                transformed[i][j] = 4\n                # Set mirrored position to 4\n                transformed[i][mirrored_j] = 4\n    return transformed\n\nBut let's test this on Example 1.\n\nExample 1 input has 6s in row 3, column 6. So transformed[3][6] = 4, and transformed[3][3] = 4. Which matches the example.\n\nRow 4, columns 4-6 are 6. So for each of these, transformed[i][j] and transformed[i][9-j] are set to 4. For j=4, mirrored_j=5. So transformed[4][4] = 4, transformed[4][5] = 4. For j=5, mirrored_j=4. So already set. For j=6, mirrored_j=3. So transformed[4][6] = 4, transformed[4][3] = 4. So in row 4, columns 3,4,5,6 are 4. Which matches the example.\n\nRow 5, column 6 is 6. So transformed[5][6] = 4, transformed[5][3] = 4. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this seems to work for Example 1.\n\nNow for Example 3.\n\nExample 3 input has a 6 in row 7, column 5. So transformed[7][5] = 4, transformed[7][4] = 4. But in the output for Example 3, row 7 is all zeros. So this suggests that the code is not correct. But maybe the input for Example 3 has no 6s in row 7? Let me check.\n\nExample 3's input:\n\nRow 7 is 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6 0 0. So column 5 is 6, column 6 is 6, column 7 is 6.\n\nSo for each of these:\n\nFor j=5: mirrored_j=4. So set (7,5) and (7,4) to 4.\n\nFor j=6: mirrored_j=3. Set (7,6) and (7,3) to 4.\n\nFor j=7: mirrored_j=2. Set (7,7) and (7,2) to 4.\n\nSo in the output, row 7 would have 4s in columns 2,3,4,5,6,7. But the example's output for row 7 is all zeros. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the example, the output for Example 3 is:\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is not just replacing 6s with 4s in their mirrored positions.\n\nSo this approach is not working for all examples.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is not about 6s, but about 4s and 6s in a different way.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 4s are being expanded to form a certain shape, and the 6s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in their positions, and also to expand 4s to their mirrored positions.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. So according to this, we set (2,3) to 4 and (2,6) to 4. Which matches the output.\n\nBut how to handle the 6s.\n\nSo the transformation is:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\n- If the cell is 6, set it to 4.\n\n- If the cell is 4, set its mirrored position to 4.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(6):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed[i][j] = 4\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                mirrored_j = 9 - j\n                transformed[i][mirrored_j] = 4\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, this would set the mirrored position to 4 even if it's already 4.\n\nLet's test this on Example 1.\n\nIn row 3, column 6 is 6. So transformed[3][6] = 4. The mirrored position is 3, so transformed[3][3] = 4. Which matches the example.\n\nIn row 4, columns 4-6 are 6. So transformed[4][4] = 4, transformed[4][5] = 4, transformed[4][6] = 4. The mirrored positions for these columns are 5,4,3. So for j=4, mirrored_j=5, so transformed[4][5] = 4. But it's already set. For j=5, mirrored_j=4, already set. For j=6, mirrored_j=3, so transformed[4][3] = 4. So in row 4, columns 3,4,5,6 are 4. Which matches the example.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 2, column 3. So transformed[2][3] is 4 (already), and mirrored_j=6. So transformed[2][6] = 4. Which matches the output.\n\nFor the 6 in row 7, column 5: transformed[7][5] = 4. The mirrored_j=4, so transformed[7][4] = 4. But in the output for Example 3, row 7 is all zeros. So this suggests that this code is not correct.\n\nBut according to the example, the output for Example 3's row 7 is all zeros. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nThis is very confusing. Perhaps the transformation is different. Maybe the 6s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions, and the 4s are being replaced in certain ways.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 6s with 4s in their positions, and also replace 4s in certain positions with 4s in other positions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 6s with 4s in their positions and mirrors 4s to their mirrored positions, even if it doesn't work for all examples. This is the best I can do based on the patterns observed.\n"
