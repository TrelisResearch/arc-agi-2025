          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to transform the input grid into the output grid based on the examples provided. Let me look at the examples carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 1. The input has a bunch of 0s except for the fourth column which is 5s. The output has 8s in the first three columns, then 5, then 6s and 0s. Hmm. The output seems to have some kind of expansion or transformation of the 5s. Also, the 5s in the input are in the fourth column, and in the output, they are in the fourth column but with some 8s and 6s around them.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 5s in the third column. The output has 8s in the first two columns, then 5, then 6s and 0s. So similar to the first example, but the 5 is in a different column. The output seems to have 8s expanding from the 5s, but maybe in a certain direction.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has 5s in the fifth column. The output has 8s in the first four columns, then 5, then 6s and 0s. So again, the 5 is in the fifth column, and the output has 8s expanding to the left, then 5, then 6s to the right. But in this case, the 6s are in the sixth and seventh columns, but in the output, the 6s are in the sixth and seventh columns for some rows, then 0s later.\n\nWait, maybe the 5s in the input are being transformed into 8s in some way, and the 6s are in certain positions. Also, the 0s in the input are being turned into 8s or 0s depending on their position. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example, the input has 5s in the fourth column for the first five rows. The output for those rows has 8s in the first three columns, then 5, then 6s in the fifth and sixth columns. Then in the next rows, the 6s are replaced by 0s. So maybe the 5s are being replaced by 8s in some way, and the 6s are in certain positions based on their distance from the 5s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being transformed into 8s in the output, but with some expansion. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the fourth column. The output has 8s in the first three columns, then 5, then 6s. So maybe the 5 is in the fourth column, and the 8s are in the columns to the left of it. Then, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the output for Example 1, the first three columns are 8s. So maybe the 5s are in the fourth column, and the 8s are expanding to the left. But then why are there 6s in the fifth and sixth columns? Maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5, but only for certain rows.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the 5s are being replaced by 8s in the output, but with some kind of propagation. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the fourth column. The output has 8s in the first three columns, then 5, then 6s. So maybe the 5 is in the fourth column, and the 8s are in the columns to the left, but only for certain rows. Then, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s, but with some kind of expansion. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the fourth column. The output has 8s in the first three columns, then 5, then 6s. So maybe the 5 is in the fourth column, and the 8s are in the columns to the left, but only in the rows where the 5 is present. Then, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5, but only in certain rows.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output, the first three rows have 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4-5. Then, in the next rows, the 6s are replaced by 0s. So maybe the 5s are in the fourth column, and the 8s are expanding to the left, but the 6s are expanding to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being converted to 8s, and then the 6s are in some positions. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has 5s in the third column. The output has 8s in the first two columns, then 5, then 6s in the fourth column. Wait, in the output for Example 2, the first two columns are 8s, then 5, then 6s in columns 3 and 4? Wait, the output for Example 2 is:\n\n8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0\n8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0\n8 8 5 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 5 0 0 0 0 0\n... etc.\n\nSo the third column is 5, and the fourth column is 6 in the first two rows. Then, in the third and fourth rows, the fourth column is 0. So maybe the 5s are in the third column, and the 6s are in the fourth column, but only for certain rows.\n\nHmm. So maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s in the output, but with some expansion. Also, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being converted to 8s in the output, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5. But how does that work with the 0s?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where 5s are in the input, and see how they are transformed in the output. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3 (0-based?), and in the output, they are in column 3. The 8s are in columns 0-2, and 6s in columns 4-5. So perhaps the 5 is in the same column, and the 8s are in the columns to the left, and the 6s are in the columns to the right.\n\nBut why are there 8s in the columns to the left? Maybe the 5 is in the input, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of the 5, but only for a certain number of rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first five rows. The output for those rows has 8s in the first three columns. Then, the 6s in columns 4 and 5. Then, in the next rows, the 8s are in the first two columns, and the 6s are in column 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being transformed into 8s in the output, but with some kind of spread. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3, and the output has 8s in columns 0-2. Then, the 6s in columns 4-5. So maybe the 5 is in the fourth column, and the 8s are in the columns to the left of it, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of it. But how does that work for different examples?\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has 5s in column 4. The output has 8s in columns 0-3, then 5, then 6s in columns 5-6. Then, in later rows, the 6s are replaced by 0s. So again, the 5 is in column 4, and the 8s are in columns 0-3, then 5, then 6s in columns 5-6.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for each 5 in the input, the output has 8s in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and 6s in the columns to the right of the 5's column. But how does that work with the rows?\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 5s are in the first five rows, and the output has 8s in the first three columns for those rows. Then, in the next rows, the 8s are in the first two columns. So perhaps the number of 8s to the left depends on the row. Maybe the 8s are expanding to the left for a certain number of rows, then stop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s in the output, but only in certain positions. Also, the 6s are in certain positions. Let me think of the 5s as being in a certain column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and 6s in the columns to the right.\n\nBut how to determine the number of 8s and 6s? For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The output has 8s in columns 0-2 (three columns), then 5, then 6s in columns 4-5 (two columns). Then in the next rows, the 6s are replaced by 0s. So perhaps the number of 8s is determined by the column index, and the 6s are determined by the column index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first five rows. The output for those rows has 8s in the first three columns. Then, in the next rows, the 8s are in the first two columns. So maybe the number of 8s is decreasing as the row number increases.\n\nBut how to model that. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, but only in the rows where the 5 is present. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in the first five rows. The output for those rows has 8s in the first three columns. Then, in the next rows, the 8s are in the first two columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s in the output, but the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column. But how?\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the output for each example. For Example 1, the output has 8s in the first three columns, then 5, then 6s. For Example 2, the output has 8s in the first two columns, then 5, then 6s. For Example 3, the output has 8s in the first four columns, then 5, then 6s. So the number of 8s to the left of the 5 is equal to the column index of the 5 in the input. Wait, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3 (assuming 0-based), and the 8s are in columns 0-2 (three columns). So that's the same as the column index. In Example 2, the 5 is in column 2 (input), and the 8s are in columns 0-1 (two columns). So again, same as column index. In Example 3, the 5 is in column 4, and the 8s are in columns 0-3 (four columns). So that's the same as the column index. So that seems to be a pattern.\n\nSo, for each 5 in the input, the output has 8s in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the number of 8s is equal to the column index of the 5 in the input. Then, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column. But how?\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The output has 8s in columns 0-2 (three columns). Then, the 6s are in columns 4-5 (two columns). So the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column. But how many 6s?\n\nIn Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The 6s are in columns 4 and 5. So that's two columns. Which is 7 - 3 - 1? Wait, the output grid is 14x7. So columns 0-6. For a 5 in column 3, the 6s are in columns 4 and 5. That's two columns. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, and the number of 6s is determined by some other factor. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The 6s are in columns 4 and 5, which is two columns. Then, in the next rows, the 6s are replaced by 0s. So maybe the 6s are present only for the first few rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The output for the first five rows has 6s in columns 4 and 5, but in the next rows, they are replaced by 0s. So maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the rows where the 5 is present.\n\nBut how to model that. Maybe the 6s are present in the columns to the right of the 5's column, and the number of 6s is determined by the row. For example, in the first five rows of Example 1, the 6s are in columns 4 and 5. Then, in the next rows, they are 0s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. For example, the first five rows of Example 1 have 6s, then the next rows don't. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s in the output, but the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. For example, the number of rows where the 5 is present determines how many columns to the right have 6s.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's think of the transformation rules. Maybe the 5s in the input are transformed into 8s in the output, but only in certain positions. Also, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the output in the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the first three columns. The 5 is in the fourth column. Then, the 6s are in the fifth and sixth columns. Then, in the next rows, the 6s are replaced by 0s. So perhaps the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s in the output, but the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column. Then, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows.\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe for each cell in the input grid, if it's a 5, then in the output grid, the same cell is 8. But that doesn't fit with the examples. For example, in Example 1, the input has 5s in column 3, but the output has 5 in column 3. So that's correct. Then, the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column. So for example, in the first three columns of the output, the cells are 8s. But why?\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column. But the 8s and 6s are only present in the rows where the 5 is present. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is present in the first five rows. In those rows, the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are in the columns to the right. Then, in the next rows, the 8s and 6s are 0s.\n\nBut how to determine the number of 8s and 6s. For example, the 5 is in column 3. The 8s are in columns 0-2 (three columns), which is the same as the column index of the 5. The 6s are in columns 4-5 (two columns), which is 7 - column index - 1. Because 7 is the total number of columns (since output is 14x7). So 7 - 3 - 1 = 3? Wait, that doesn't fit. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The 6s are in columns 4 and 5. That's two columns. 7 - 3 - 1 = 3. No, that doesn't fit. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 6s is determined by the column index of the 5. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The 6s are in columns 4 and 5 (two columns). Which is 3 + 1? No. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for a certain number of rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in the first five rows. The output for those rows has 6s in columns 4 and 5. Then, in the next rows, they are 0s. So perhaps the 6s are present in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the rows where the 5 is present.\n\nBut how to model that. Maybe for each row where the 5 is present, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, and the number of columns is determined by the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s in the output, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The output for the first five rows has 6s in columns 4 and 5, and then in the next rows, they are 0s.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me think of the transformation as follows:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid:\n\n- If the cell is 5, then in the output, it is 8. Also, the cells to the left of this 5's column are 8s, but only up to a certain number of columns. Then, the cells to the right are 6s, but only for certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which cells to change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s. For example, the 5s in the input are being transformed into 8s in the output, but with some spread. The 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAnother idea: For each row in the input grid, if the cell is a 5, then in the output, the same cell is 8. Then, the cells to the left of the 5's column are 8s, but only up to a certain number of columns. For example, the number of 8s is equal to the column index of the 5. Then, the cells to the right of the 5's column are 6s for the first few rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s in the output, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The output for the first five rows has 6s in columns 4 and 5. Then, in the next rows, they are 0s.\n\nBut how to determine the number of rows where this happens. Maybe the number of rows where the 5 is present determines how many rows the 6s are present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 6s are present in the columns to the right of the 5's column for the first few rows where the 5 is present. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is present in the first five rows. The 6s are present in columns 4 and 5 for those rows.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid:\n\nIf the cell is a 5, then in the output, it is 8. Also, the cells to the left of this 5's column are 8s, but only up to a certain number of columns. Then, the cells to the right are 6s, but only for the first few rows.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, if there is a 5 in the input, then in the output, the same row has 8s in the columns to the left of the 5's column, then 5, then 6s in the columns to the right. But how to determine the number of columns to the left and right.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The output has 8s in the first three columns (columns 0-2), which is the same as the column index of the 5. Then, the 6s are in columns 4-5 (two columns). Which is 7 - 3 - 1 = 3? No. But maybe it's 7 - column index - 1 = 7-3-1=3, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the number of 6s is determined by some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first two columns. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3, and the 6s are in columns 4 and 5. Then, in Example 2, the 5 is in column 2, and the 6s are in column 3 and 4. But in Example 2's output, the 6s are in column 3 and 4 for the first two rows, then in the next rows, they are 0s. So perhaps the number of 6s is 2, which is the same as the column index of the 5 plus 1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first two columns. But how to determine that.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid:\n\n- If the cell is 5, then in the output, it is 8. Also, the cells to the left of this 5's column are 8s, but only up to a certain number of columns. For example, the number of 8s is equal to the column index of the 5. Then, the cells to the right of the 5's column are 6s for the first few rows.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the 5s in the input are replaced by 8s in the output. Then, the 8s are spread to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are spread to the right of the 5's column. But how to determine the spread.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s in the output, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column. But the 6s are only present for the first few rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in the first five rows. The 6s are in columns 4 and 5 for those rows. Then, in the next rows, the 6s are 0s.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the following steps:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Check if there is a 5 in the row.\n\n- If there is a 5, then in the output row, the cells to the left of the 5's column are 8s, up to the column index of the 5.\n\n- The 5 is converted to 8.\n\n- The cells to the right of the 5's column are 6s for the first two columns, then 0s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell in the input grid:\n\n- If the cell is 5, then in the output, it is 8.\n\n- For the cells to the left of the 5's column, if they are 0, they become 8.\n\n- For the cells to the right of the 5's column, if they are 0, they become 6.\n\nBut this may not work for all examples.\n\nLet's test this idea with Example 1. The input has 5 in column 3. So in the output, the cells to the left (columns 0-2) are 8, and to the right (columns 4-6) are 6. But in the output, for the first five rows, columns 4 and 5 are 6, but column 6 is 0. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first two columns. So in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3, so columns 4 and 5 are 6, and column 6 is 0.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output for each example and see what the 8s and 6s are doing.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for the first three rows has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4-5. Then, in the next rows, the 6s are replaced by 0s. So maybe the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows.\n\nBut how to determine the number of rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first two columns. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3, so columns 4 and 5 are 6s, but column 6 is 0.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the 5s as being in a certain column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and 6s in the columns to the right. But the number of 8s is equal to the column index of the 5, and the number of 6s is 2.\n\nBut how to code that.\n\nLet's try to code this:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Find the column index of the 5 in that row.\n\n- If there is a 5 in the row, then:\n\n   - For columns 0 to (column index of 5 - 1), set to 8.\n\n   - Set the column index of 5 to 8.\n\n   - For columns (column index of 5 + 1) to (column index of 5 + 1), set to 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 6s is 2, as in Example 1 and 2. But in Example 3, the 5 is in column 4, and the output has 6s in columns 5-6 (two columns). So that fits.\n\nSo, for each row with a 5 in column c, set columns 0 to c-1 to 8, set column c to 8, and set columns c+1 to c+1 to 6. Then, for columns c+2 and beyond, set to 0.\n\nBut this seems to fit the examples.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nInput row 0: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n\nc = 3 (since 5 is in column 3). So columns 0-2 are 8, column 3 is 8, column 4 is 6, columns 5-6 are 0. So the output row would be 8 8 8 8 6 0 0. But the actual output for Example 1 is 8 8 8 5 6 6 0. Wait, this doesn't fit. Because the 5 in the input is converted to 8 in the output, but in the example, the output has 5 in column 3.\n\nWait, no. In the output for Example 1, the 5 is still in column 3. Wait, the input has 5 in column 3, and the output has 5 in column 3. But according to this idea, the 5 would be converted to 8. But in the example, it's 5. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, this suggests that my previous assumption is wrong. Because in Example 1, the output has 5 in the fourth column, but the input also has 5 there. So the 5 is not being converted to 8. So my previous idea is incorrect.\n\nSo what's the correct transformation?\n\nLooking back at the output for Example 1, the 5 is still in the fourth column. So the 5 is not being converted to 8. So perhaps my previous assumption is wrong. Then, what is the pattern?\n\nLet me re-examine the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 5 in column 3, and the output has 5 in column 3. The 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5. So the 5 is not being converted to 8. So the 5 is preserved, but the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5. Then, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that the 5s are preserved, and the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column. But how?\n\nSo for each row, if there is a 5 in column c, then:\n\n- For columns 0 to c-1: set to 8.\n\n- For column c: set to 5.\n\n- For columns c+1 to c+1: set to 6.\n\n- For columns c+2 to 6: set to 0.\n\nBut this would explain the first example.\n\nFor Example 1, the input row has 5 in column 3. So columns 0-2 are 8, column 3 is 5, column 4 is 6, columns 5-6 are 0. But the output for Example 1 is:\n\n8 8 8 5 6 6 0\n\nSo column 4 is 6, column 5 is 6, column 6 is 0. So this suggests that for columns c+1 to c+2, set to 6. But why?\n\nIn Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. So c+1 is 4, c+2 is 5. So columns 4 and 5 are 6. Then column 6 is 0. So this fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 5 in column 2. So columns 0-1 are 8, column 2 is 5, columns 3-4 are 6, and columns 5-6 are 0. But the output for Example 2 is:\n\n8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, the output for Example 2 has 8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0. So the fourth column is 6, but the fifth column is 0. So this suggests that in this case, only column 3 is 6, not 4.\n\nHmm, this contradicts the previous idea. So what's different?\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 5 in column 2. The output has 8s in columns 0-1, 5 in column 2, and 6 in column 3. Then, columns 4-7 are 0. So this suggests that the 6s are in column c+1, not c+1 to c+2.\n\nSo this indicates that the number of 6s is 1, not 2.\n\nSo this is confusing. How to reconcile this.\n\nLet me look at the output for Example 2. The output is:\n\n8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0\n\n8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0\n\n8 8 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\n8 8 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\n... etc.\n\nSo for the first two rows, the 6 is in column 3. Then, in the next two rows, it's 0.\n\nSo for a 5 in column 2, the 6 is in column 3 for the first two rows, then 0.\n\nSo perhaps the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. For example, the number of rows where the 5 is present determines how many 6s are present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 6s is determined by the number of rows where the 5 is present. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is present in the first five rows. So the 6s are in columns 4 and 5 for those rows. In Example 2, the 5 is present in the first four rows. So the 6 is in column 3 for the first two rows, then 0.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the pattern is that the 5s in the input are being preserved, and the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for a certain number of rows.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the 5s are in the first five rows. The output for those rows has 6s in columns 4 and 5. In Example 2, the 5s are in the first four rows. The output for those rows has 6 in column 3 for the first two rows, then 0.\n\nThis suggests that the number of 6s depends on the row. For example, the first few rows have 6s, and then they are replaced by 0s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nMaybe the 6s are present in the columns to the right of the 5's column for the first two rows where the 5 is present.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, and the number of 6s is determined by the row. For example, in the first row, the 6 is in column c+1, in the second row, it's in column c+1, and so on, but after a certain number of rows, it becomes 0.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to find a pattern that fits all three examples. Let's try to find a rule that can transform the input to the output.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput has 5 in column 3 for rows 0-4.\n\nOutput has 8s in columns 0-2 for those rows, 5 in column 3, and 6s in columns 4-5 for the first five rows.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput has 5 in column 2 for rows 0-3.\n\nOutput has 8s in columns 0-1 for those rows, 5 in column 2, and 6 in column 3 for the first two rows, then 0.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nInput has 5 in column 4 for rows 0-7.\n\nOutput has 8s in columns 0-3 for those rows, 5 in column 4, and 6s in columns 5-6 for the first five rows, then 0.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each row where there is a 5 in column c, the output has 8s in columns 0 to c-1, 5 in column c, and 6s in columns c+1 to c+1 (for the first few rows), then 0.\n\nBut how to determine how many rows the 6s are present.\n\nIn Example 1, the 5 is in the first five rows. The 6s are in columns 4-5 for all those rows.\n\nIn Example 2, the 5 is in the first four rows. The 6 is in column 3 for the first two rows, then 0.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5 is in the first eight rows. The 6s are in columns 5-6 for the first five rows, then 0.\n\nThis suggests that the number of rows where the 6s are present is determined by the number of rows where the 5 is present, but it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of rows where the 6s are present is equal to the number of 5s in the input. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are present in the columns to the right of the 5's column for the first two rows where the 5 is present.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to find a way to code this transformation. Let's try to write code that:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Find the column index of the 5.\n\n- If there is a 5, then:\n\n   - For columns 0 to c-1, set to 8.\n\n   - Set column c to 5.\n\n   - For columns c+1 to c+1, set to 6.\n\n   - For columns c+2 to 6, set to 0.\n\nBut this would fit Example 1 and Example 3, but not Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the 5 is in column 2. So columns 0-1 are 8, column 2 is 5, column 3 is 6, and columns 4-6 are 0. But in the output for Example 2, the first two rows have 6 in column 3, and the next two rows have 0. So this suggests that the 6 is present for the first two rows, then 0.\n\nBut according to this code, it would be present for all rows where the 5 is present. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this suggests that the 6s are only present for the first two rows where the 5 is present.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of 6s is determined by the row number. For example, the first two rows have 6 in column c+1, and then 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples and code it.\n\nLet me try to code the following:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n   if the row contains a 5:\n\n      find the column index c of the 5.\n\n      for columns 0 to c-1: set to 8.\n\n      set column c to 5.\n\n      for columns c+1 to c+1: set to 6.\n\n      for columns c+2 to 6: set to 0.\n\nBut this would fit Example 1 and Example 3, but not Example 2. Let's see.\n\nFor Example 2, the input has 5 in column 2 for rows 0-3.\n\nThe code would set columns 0-1 to 8, column 2 to 5, column 3 to 6, and columns 4-6 to 0. So the output row would be 8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0. Which matches the output for Example 2's first two rows. But in the output for Example 2, the third and fourth rows have 0 in column 3. So this code would set column 3 to 6 for all rows where the 5 is present. But in the actual output, it's 0 for those rows. So this suggests that this code is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 2, the 6 is in column 3 for the first two rows, then 0. So perhaps the number of rows where the 6 is present is equal to the number of rows where the 5 is present, but divided by some factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are present only for the first two rows where the 5 is present.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the 5 is present in the first five rows. The 6s are present in columns 4 and 5 for all those rows.\n\nIn Example 2, the 5 is present in the first four rows. The 6 is present in column 3 for the first two rows, then 0.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5 is present in the first eight rows. The 6s are present in columns 5-6 for the first five rows, then 0.\n\nThis suggests that the number of rows where the 6 is present is equal to the column index of the 5 in the input. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3, so the 6 is present for 3 rows? No, in Example 1, it's present for 5 rows.\n\nThis is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples and code it. Let's try to write code that for each 5 in the input, the output has 8s to the left, 5 in the same column, and 6s to the right for the first two columns, and 0 otherwise.\n\nBut how to handle the rows.\n\nMaybe the 6s are present in the columns to the right of the 5's column for the first two rows where the 5 is present.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column for the first two rows, and then 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to proceed with the following code:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n   if the row contains a 5:\n\n      find the column index c of the 5.\n\n      for columns 0 to c-1: set to 8.\n\n      set column c to 5.\n\n      for columns c+1 to c+1: set to 6.\n\n      for columns c+2 to 6: set to 0.\n\nBut this would not fit Example 2, but perhaps it's the best I can do.\n\nLet's test this with Example 2:\n\nInput row is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nc = 2.\n\nSo columns 0-1: 8, column 2:5, column 3:6, columns 4-6:0.\n\nSo the output row would be 8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0. Which matches the first two rows of Example 2's output. But in the output for Example 2, the third and fourth rows have 0 in column 3. So this suggests that the code would set column 3 to 6 for all rows where the 5 is present, but in the actual output, it's 0.\n\nThis indicates that this code is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the 6 is present only for the first two rows where the 5 is present.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are present for the first two rows where the 5 is present, and then 0.\n\nBut how to code that.\n\nMaybe for each row, if it is in the first two rows where the 5 is present, then set the 6s, else 0.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with the code that sets the 8s to the left, 5 in the same column, and 6 in the next column, and 0 otherwise, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nBut this may not be correct, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, here's the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = [0] * 7\n        # Find the position of 5 in the row\n        c = None\n        for i in range(7):\n            if row[i] == 5:\n                c = i\n                break\n        if c is not None:\n            # Set 8s to the left\n            for i in range(c):\n                new_row[i] = 8\n            new_row[c] = 5\n            # Set 6 in the next column\n            if c + 1 < 7:\n                new_row[c+1] = 6\n            # Set rest to 0\n            for i in range(c+2, 7):\n                new_row[i] = 0\n        else:\n            # No 5, so set to 0\n            new_row = [0]*7\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but the output is 14x7. So the code needs to process 14 rows.\n\nBut the input grid is 14 rows by 7 columns. So the code should process each of the 14 rows.\n\nBut in the examples, the output for Example 1 is 14 rows. So the code should generate 14 rows.\n\nBut in the code above, for each row in the input, it processes it and generates a new row of 7 columns.\n\nBut this code would not handle the cases where the 5 is in the last column, or where there are multiple 5s in a row.\n\nBut according to the examples, each row has a single 5.\n\nLet's test this code with Example 1.\n\nExample 1's input has 5 in column 3 for the first five rows.\n\nFor these rows, the code would set columns 0-2 to 8, column 3 to 5, column 4 to 6, and columns 5-6 to 0. So the new_row would be [8,8,8,5,6,0,0]. But the actual output for Example 1 is [8,8,8,5,6,6,0]. So this code would not match.\n\nAh, this is a problem. The code sets column 4 to 6, but the output has 6 in column 5 as well.\n\nSo this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut why? In the example, the 6s are in columns 4 and 5 for the first five rows.\n\nSo perhaps the code should set columns c+1 to c+2 to 6.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nMaybe the code should set columns c+1 and c+2 to 6, and the rest to 0.\n\nBut this would require checking if c+1 and c+2 are within the column range.\n\nLet's adjust the code:\n\nfor i in range(c+1, c+3):\n    if i < 7:\n        new_row[i] = 6\n\nBut this would set columns c+1 and c+2 to 6.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1.\n\nFor c=3, columns 4 and 5 are 6. So new_row is [8,8,8,5,6,6,0]. Which matches the first row of Example 1's output.\n\nFor Example 2, c=2. columns 3 and 4 are 6. So new_row is [8,8,5,6,6,0,0]. But the output for Example 2's first row is [8,8,5,6,0,0,0,0]. Wait, the output for Example 2 is 8 columns? No, the output is 7 columns. Wait, the input is 7 columns, so the output is 7 columns.\n\nWait, the input for Example 2 is 8 columns? No, the input is 7 columns. Wait, in the training examples, the input and output are 7 columns.\n\nWait, the input for Example 2 is:\n\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 but this is 8 columns. Wait, this is a problem. Wait, the training examples might have a mistake, but according to the problem statement, the input is a 14x7 grid.\n\nWait, looking back at the training examples:\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 this is 8 numbers, but the input should be 7 columns. This suggests that there might be a mistake in the training examples, but perhaps it's a formatting error. Alternatively, maybe the input for Example 2 is 8 columns, but the output is 8 columns. But the problem states that the output must be 14x7.\n\nBut this is confusing. Let me recheck.\n\nThe problem says that the output must be 14x7. So the input and output grids are 14 rows by 7 columns.\n\nBut in the training examples, the input for Example 2 is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, this is 14 rows, each with 8 columns. But the output is 14x7. This suggests that there's a formatting error in the training examples, but the problem says that the input and output are 14x7. So perhaps the input for Example 2 is 7 columns, and the 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 is a typo, and should be 0 0 5 0 0 0 0, which is 7 columns.\n\nAssuming that, let's re-examine Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 5 in column 2 for the first four rows. The output is:\n\n8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0 \u2192 but this is 8 columns, which is incorrect. So there must be a mistake in the example.\n\nBut given the problem statement, the output must be 14x7. So perhaps the input for Example 2 is 7 columns, and the output is 7 columns.\n\nAssuming that, the code would be adjusted.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nGiven the time, I think I'll proceed with the code that for each 5 in the input, the output has 8s to the left, 5 in the same column, and 6s in the next two columns, and 0 elsewhere.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = [0] * 7\n        c = None\n        for i in range(7):\n            if row[i] == 5:\n                c = i\n                break\n        if c is not None:\n            for i in range(c):\n                new_row[i] = 8\n            new_row[c] = 5\n            # Set next two columns to 6\n            for i in range(c+1, c+3):\n                if i < 7:\n                    new_row[i] = 6\n            # Set the rest to 0\n            for i in range(c+3, 7):\n                new_row[i] = 0\n        else:\n            new_row = [0]*7\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nThis code would set the 8s to the left of the 5, 5 in the same column, and 6 in the next two columns, then 0.\n\nTesting this with Example 1:\n\nFor c=3, new_row[0-2] = 8, new_row[3] = 5, new_row[4] and 5 = 6, new_row[6] = 0. So the row becomes [8,8,8,5,6,6,0], which matches the first row of Example 1's output.\n\nFor the second row, it's the same, so the output would be the same. This fits the first example.\n\nFor Example 2, if the input has 5 in column 2, then new_row[0-1] = 8, new_row[2] = 5, new_row[3] and 4 = 6, and new_row[5-6] = 0. So the row would be [8,8,5,6,6,0,0]. But the actual output for Example 2's first row is [8,8,5,6,0,0,0,0]. This suggests that this code is not correct.\n\nBut perhaps the example has a typo, and the output for Example 2 is 7 columns, not 8. So the code would produce [8,8,5,6,6,0,0], but the actual output is [8,8,5,6,0,0,0]. This suggests that the code is still not correct.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code, as it fits the first example and the third example.\n\nNow, let's test with Example 3:\n\nInput has 5 in column 4 for the first eight rows.\n\nnew_row[0-3] = 8, new_row[4] = 5, new_row[5] and 6 = 6, and new_row[7-6] is out of range, so 0. So the row would be [8,8,8,8,5,6,6,0], but since it's 7 columns, it would be [8,8,8,8,5,6,6]. But the output for Example 3 is [8,8,8,8,5,6,6,6], but this is 8 columns. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nBut again, this may be due to formatting errors in the examples.\n\nGiven all this, I'll proceed with the code that sets the 8s to the left of the 5, 5 in the same column, and 6s in the next two columns, and 0 elsewhere.\n\nThis code may not be perfect, but it's the best I can do based on the examples.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to transform the input grid into the output grid based on the examples provided. Let me look at the examples carefully.\n\nFirst, looking at Example 1. The input has a bunch of 0s except for the fourth column which is 5s. The output has 8s in the first three columns, then 5, then 6s and 0s. Hmm. The output seems to have some kind of expansion or transformation of the 5s. Also, the 5s in the input are in the fourth column, and in the output, they are in the fourth column but with some 8s and 6s around them.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 5s in the third column. The output has 8s in the first two columns, then 5, then 6s and 0s. So similar to the first example, but the 5 is in a different column. The output seems to have 8s expanding from the 5s, but maybe in a certain direction.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has 5s in the fifth column. The output has 8s in the first four columns, then 5, then 6s and 0s. So again, the 5 is in the fifth column, and the output has 8s expanding to the left, then 5, then 6s to the right. But in this case, the 6s are in the sixth and seventh columns, but in the output, the 6s are in the sixth and seventh columns for some rows, then 0s later.\n\nWait, maybe the 5s in the input are being transformed into 8s in some way, and the 6s are in certain positions. Also, the 0s in the input are being turned into 8s or 0s depending on their position. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example, the input has 5s in the fourth column for the first five rows. The output for those rows has 8s in the first three columns, then 5, then 6s in the fifth and sixth columns. Then in the next rows, the 6s are replaced by 0s. So maybe the 5s are being replaced by 8s in some way, and the 6s are in certain positions based on their distance from the 5s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being transformed into 8s in the output, but with some expansion. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the fourth column. The output has 8s in the first three columns, then 5, then 6s. So maybe the 5 is in the fourth column, and the 8s are in the columns to the left of it. Then, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5. But how?\n\nWait, looking at the output for Example 1, the first three columns are 8s. So maybe the 5s are in the fourth column, and the 8s are expanding to the left. But then why are there 6s in the fifth and sixth columns? Maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5, but only for certain rows.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the 5s are being replaced by 8s in the output, but with some kind of propagation. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the fourth column. The output has 8s in the first three columns, then 5, then 6s. So maybe the 5 is in the fourth column, and the 8s are in the columns to the left, but only for certain rows. Then, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s, but with some kind of expansion. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the fourth column. The output has 8s in the first three columns, then 5, then 6s. So maybe the 5 is in the fourth column, and the 8s are in the columns to the left, but only in the rows where the 5 is present. Then, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5, but only in certain rows.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output, the first three rows have 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4-5. Then, in the next rows, the 6s are replaced by 0s. So maybe the 5s are in the fourth column, and the 8s are expanding to the left, but the 6s are expanding to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being converted to 8s, and then the 6s are in some positions. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has 5s in the third column. The output has 8s in the first two columns, then 5, then 6s in the fourth column. Wait, in the output for Example 2, the first two columns are 8s, then 5, then 6s in columns 3 and 4? Wait, the output for Example 2 is:\n\n8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0\n8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0\n8 8 5 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 5 0 0 0 0 0\n... etc.\n\nSo the third column is 5, and the fourth column is 6 in the first two rows. Then, in the third and fourth rows, the fourth column is 0. So maybe the 5s are in the third column, and the 6s are in the fourth column, but only for certain rows.\n\nHmm. So maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s in the output, but with some expansion. Also, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being converted to 8s in the output, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5. But how does that work with the 0s?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where 5s are in the input, and see how they are transformed in the output. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3 (0-based?), and in the output, they are in column 3. The 8s are in columns 0-2, and 6s in columns 4-5. So perhaps the 5 is in the same column, and the 8s are in the columns to the left, and the 6s are in the columns to the right.\n\nBut why are there 8s in the columns to the left? Maybe the 5 is in the input, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of the 5, but only for a certain number of rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first five rows. The output for those rows has 8s in the first three columns. Then, the 6s in columns 4 and 5. Then, in the next rows, the 8s are in the first two columns, and the 6s are in column 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being transformed into 8s in the output, but with some kind of spread. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3, and the output has 8s in columns 0-2. Then, the 6s in columns 4-5. So maybe the 5 is in the fourth column, and the 8s are in the columns to the left of it, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of it. But how does that work for different examples?\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has 5s in column 4. The output has 8s in columns 0-3, then 5, then 6s in columns 5-6. Then, in later rows, the 6s are replaced by 0s. So again, the 5 is in column 4, and the 8s are in columns 0-3, then 5, then 6s in columns 5-6.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for each 5 in the input, the output has 8s in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and 6s in the columns to the right of the 5's column. But how does that work with the rows?\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 5s are in the first five rows, and the output has 8s in the first three columns for those rows. Then, in the next rows, the 8s are in the first two columns. So perhaps the number of 8s to the left depends on the row. Maybe the 8s are expanding to the left for a certain number of rows, then stop.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s in the output, but only in certain positions. Also, the 6s are in certain positions. Let me think of the 5s as being in a certain column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and 6s in the columns to the right.\n\nBut how to determine the number of 8s and 6s? For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The output has 8s in columns 0-2 (three columns), then 5, then 6s in columns 4-5 (two columns). Then in the next rows, the 6s are replaced by 0s. So perhaps the number of 8s is determined by the column index, and the 6s are determined by the column index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first five rows. The output for those rows has 8s in the first three columns. Then, in the next rows, the 8s are in the first two columns. So maybe the number of 8s is decreasing as the row number increases.\n\nBut how to model that. Alternatively, maybe the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, but only in the rows where the 5 is present. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in the first five rows. The output for those rows has 8s in the first three columns. Then, in the next rows, the 8s are in the first two columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s in the output, but the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column. But how?\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the output for each example. For Example 1, the output has 8s in the first three columns, then 5, then 6s. For Example 2, the output has 8s in the first two columns, then 5, then 6s. For Example 3, the output has 8s in the first four columns, then 5, then 6s. So the number of 8s to the left of the 5 is equal to the column index of the 5 in the input. Wait, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3 (assuming 0-based), and the 8s are in columns 0-2 (three columns). So that's the same as the column index. In Example 2, the 5 is in column 2 (input), and the 8s are in columns 0-1 (two columns). So again, same as column index. In Example 3, the 5 is in column 4, and the 8s are in columns 0-3 (four columns). So that's the same as the column index. So that seems to be a pattern.\n\nSo, for each 5 in the input, the output has 8s in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the number of 8s is equal to the column index of the 5 in the input. Then, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column. But how?\n\nWait, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The output has 8s in columns 0-2 (three columns). Then, the 6s are in columns 4-5 (two columns). So the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column. But how many 6s?\n\nIn Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The 6s are in columns 4 and 5. So that's two columns. Which is 7 - 3 - 1? Wait, the output grid is 14x7. So columns 0-6. For a 5 in column 3, the 6s are in columns 4 and 5. That's two columns. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, and the number of 6s is determined by some other factor. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The 6s are in columns 4 and 5, which is two columns. Then, in the next rows, the 6s are replaced by 0s. So maybe the 6s are present only for the first few rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The output for the first five rows has 6s in columns 4 and 5, but in the next rows, they are replaced by 0s. So maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the rows where the 5 is present.\n\nBut how to model that. Maybe the 6s are present in the columns to the right of the 5's column, and the number of 6s is determined by the row. For example, in the first five rows of Example 1, the 6s are in columns 4 and 5. Then, in the next rows, they are 0s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. For example, the first five rows of Example 1 have 6s, then the next rows don't. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s in the output, but the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. For example, the number of rows where the 5 is present determines how many columns to the right have 6s.\n\nBut this seems complicated. Let's think of the transformation rules. Maybe the 5s in the input are transformed into 8s in the output, but only in certain positions. Also, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the output in the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the first three columns. The 5 is in the fourth column. Then, the 6s are in the fifth and sixth columns. Then, in the next rows, the 6s are replaced by 0s. So perhaps the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s in the output, but the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column. Then, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows.\n\nBut how to model this. Maybe for each cell in the input grid, if it's a 5, then in the output grid, the same cell is 8. But that doesn't fit with the examples. For example, in Example 1, the input has 5s in column 3, but the output has 5 in column 3. So that's correct. Then, the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column. So for example, in the first three columns of the output, the cells are 8s. But why?\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column. But the 8s and 6s are only present in the rows where the 5 is present. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is present in the first five rows. In those rows, the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are in the columns to the right. Then, in the next rows, the 8s and 6s are 0s.\n\nBut how to determine the number of 8s and 6s. For example, the 5 is in column 3. The 8s are in columns 0-2 (three columns), which is the same as the column index of the 5. The 6s are in columns 4-5 (two columns), which is 7 - column index - 1. Because 7 is the total number of columns (since output is 14x7). So 7 - 3 - 1 = 3? Wait, that doesn't fit. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The 6s are in columns 4 and 5. That's two columns. 7 - 3 - 1 = 3. No, that doesn't fit. Maybe another approach.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 6s is determined by the column index of the 5. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The 6s are in columns 4 and 5 (two columns). Which is 3 + 1? No. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for a certain number of rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in the first five rows. The output for those rows has 6s in columns 4 and 5. Then, in the next rows, they are 0s. So perhaps the 6s are present in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the rows where the 5 is present.\n\nBut how to model that. Maybe for each row where the 5 is present, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, and the number of columns is determined by the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s in the output, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The output for the first five rows has 6s in columns 4 and 5, and then in the next rows, they are 0s.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me think of the transformation as follows:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid:\n\n- If the cell is 5, then in the output, it is 8. Also, the cells to the left of this 5's column are 8s, but only up to a certain number of columns. Then, the cells to the right are 6s, but only for certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which cells to change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s. For example, the 5s in the input are being transformed into 8s in the output, but with some spread. The 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAnother idea: For each row in the input grid, if the cell is a 5, then in the output, the same cell is 8. Then, the cells to the left of the 5's column are 8s, but only up to a certain number of columns. For example, the number of 8s is equal to the column index of the 5. Then, the cells to the right of the 5's column are 6s for the first few rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s in the output, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The output for the first five rows has 6s in columns 4 and 5. Then, in the next rows, they are 0s.\n\nBut how to determine the number of rows where this happens. Maybe the number of rows where the 5 is present determines how many rows the 6s are present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 6s are present in the columns to the right of the 5's column for the first few rows where the 5 is present. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is present in the first five rows. The 6s are present in columns 4 and 5 for those rows.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nLet me think of the following steps:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid:\n\nIf the cell is a 5, then in the output, it is 8. Also, the cells to the left of this 5's column are 8s, but only up to a certain number of columns. Then, the cells to the right are 6s, but only for the first few rows.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, if there is a 5 in the input, then in the output, the same row has 8s in the columns to the left of the 5's column, then 5, then 6s in the columns to the right. But how to determine the number of columns to the left and right.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. The output has 8s in the first three columns (columns 0-2), which is the same as the column index of the 5. Then, the 6s are in columns 4-5 (two columns). Which is 7 - 3 - 1 = 3? No. But maybe it's 7 - column index - 1 = 7-3-1=3, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the number of 6s is determined by some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first two columns. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3, and the 6s are in columns 4 and 5. Then, in Example 2, the 5 is in column 2, and the 6s are in column 3 and 4. But in Example 2's output, the 6s are in column 3 and 4 for the first two rows, then in the next rows, they are 0s. So perhaps the number of 6s is 2, which is the same as the column index of the 5 plus 1? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first two columns. But how to determine that.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid:\n\n- If the cell is 5, then in the output, it is 8. Also, the cells to the left of this 5's column are 8s, but only up to a certain number of columns. For example, the number of 8s is equal to the column index of the 5. Then, the cells to the right of the 5's column are 6s for the first few rows.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the 5s in the input are replaced by 8s in the output. Then, the 8s are spread to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are spread to the right of the 5's column. But how to determine the spread.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 8s in the output, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column. But the 6s are only present for the first few rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in the first five rows. The 6s are in columns 4 and 5 for those rows. Then, in the next rows, the 6s are 0s.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the following steps:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Check if there is a 5 in the row.\n\n- If there is a 5, then in the output row, the cells to the left of the 5's column are 8s, up to the column index of the 5.\n\n- The 5 is converted to 8.\n\n- The cells to the right of the 5's column are 6s for the first two columns, then 0s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell in the input grid:\n\n- If the cell is 5, then in the output, it is 8.\n\n- For the cells to the left of the 5's column, if they are 0, they become 8.\n\n- For the cells to the right of the 5's column, if they are 0, they become 6.\n\nBut this may not work for all examples.\n\nLet's test this idea with Example 1. The input has 5 in column 3. So in the output, the cells to the left (columns 0-2) are 8, and to the right (columns 4-6) are 6. But in the output, for the first five rows, columns 4 and 5 are 6, but column 6 is 0. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first two columns. So in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3, so columns 4 and 5 are 6, and column 6 is 0.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output for each example and see what the 8s and 6s are doing.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for the first three rows has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4-5. Then, in the next rows, the 6s are replaced by 0s. So maybe the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows.\n\nBut how to determine the number of rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first two columns. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3, so columns 4 and 5 are 6s, but column 6 is 0.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the 5s as being in a certain column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and 6s in the columns to the right. But the number of 8s is equal to the column index of the 5, and the number of 6s is 2.\n\nBut how to code that.\n\nLet's try to code this:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Find the column index of the 5 in that row.\n\n- If there is a 5 in the row, then:\n\n   - For columns 0 to (column index of 5 - 1), set to 8.\n\n   - Set the column index of 5 to 8.\n\n   - For columns (column index of 5 + 1) to (column index of 5 + 1), set to 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 6s is 2, as in Example 1 and 2. But in Example 3, the 5 is in column 4, and the output has 6s in columns 5-6 (two columns). So that fits.\n\nSo, for each row with a 5 in column c, set columns 0 to c-1 to 8, set column c to 8, and set columns c+1 to c+1 to 6. Then, for columns c+2 and beyond, set to 0.\n\nBut this seems to fit the examples.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nInput row 0: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n\nc = 3 (since 5 is in column 3). So columns 0-2 are 8, column 3 is 8, column 4 is 6, columns 5-6 are 0. So the output row would be 8 8 8 8 6 0 0. But the actual output for Example 1 is 8 8 8 5 6 6 0. Wait, this doesn't fit. Because the 5 in the input is converted to 8 in the output, but in the example, the output has 5 in column 3.\n\nWait, no. In the output for Example 1, the 5 is still in column 3. Wait, the input has 5 in column 3, and the output has 5 in column 3. But according to this idea, the 5 would be converted to 8. But in the example, it's 5. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, this suggests that my previous assumption is wrong. Because in Example 1, the output has 5 in the fourth column, but the input also has 5 there. So the 5 is not being converted to 8. So my previous idea is incorrect.\n\nSo what's the correct transformation?\n\nLooking back at the output for Example 1, the 5 is still in the fourth column. So the 5 is not being converted to 8. So perhaps my previous assumption is wrong. Then, what is the pattern?\n\nLet me re-examine the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 5 in column 3, and the output has 5 in column 3. The 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5. So the 5 is not being converted to 8. So the 5 is preserved, but the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5. Then, the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that the 5s are preserved, and the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column. But how?\n\nSo for each row, if there is a 5 in column c, then:\n\n- For columns 0 to c-1: set to 8.\n\n- For column c: set to 5.\n\n- For columns c+1 to c+1: set to 6.\n\n- For columns c+2 to 6: set to 0.\n\nBut this would explain the first example.\n\nFor Example 1, the input row has 5 in column 3. So columns 0-2 are 8, column 3 is 5, column 4 is 6, columns 5-6 are 0. But the output for Example 1 is:\n\n8 8 8 5 6 6 0\n\nSo column 4 is 6, column 5 is 6, column 6 is 0. So this suggests that for columns c+1 to c+2, set to 6. But why?\n\nIn Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. So c+1 is 4, c+2 is 5. So columns 4 and 5 are 6. Then column 6 is 0. So this fits.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 5 in column 2. So columns 0-1 are 8, column 2 is 5, columns 3-4 are 6, and columns 5-6 are 0. But the output for Example 2 is:\n\n8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, the output for Example 2 has 8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0. So the fourth column is 6, but the fifth column is 0. So this suggests that in this case, only column 3 is 6, not 4.\n\nHmm, this contradicts the previous idea. So what's different?\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 5 in column 2. The output has 8s in columns 0-1, 5 in column 2, and 6 in column 3. Then, columns 4-7 are 0. So this suggests that the 6s are in column c+1, not c+1 to c+2.\n\nSo this indicates that the number of 6s is 1, not 2.\n\nSo this is confusing. How to reconcile this.\n\nLet me look at the output for Example 2. The output is:\n\n8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0\n\n8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0\n\n8 8 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\n8 8 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\n... etc.\n\nSo for the first two rows, the 6 is in column 3. Then, in the next two rows, it's 0.\n\nSo for a 5 in column 2, the 6 is in column 3 for the first two rows, then 0.\n\nSo perhaps the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. For example, the number of rows where the 5 is present determines how many 6s are present.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 6s is determined by the number of rows where the 5 is present. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is present in the first five rows. So the 6s are in columns 4 and 5 for those rows. In Example 2, the 5 is present in the first four rows. So the 6 is in column 3 for the first two rows, then 0.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the pattern is that the 5s in the input are being preserved, and the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5's column, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for a certain number of rows.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the 5s are in the first five rows. The output for those rows has 6s in columns 4 and 5. In Example 2, the 5s are in the first four rows. The output for those rows has 6 in column 3 for the first two rows, then 0.\n\nThis suggests that the number of 6s depends on the row. For example, the first few rows have 6s, and then they are replaced by 0s.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nMaybe the 6s are present in the columns to the right of the 5's column for the first two rows where the 5 is present.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, and the number of 6s is determined by the row. For example, in the first row, the 6 is in column c+1, in the second row, it's in column c+1, and so on, but after a certain number of rows, it becomes 0.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to find a pattern that fits all three examples. Let's try to find a rule that can transform the input to the output.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput has 5 in column 3 for rows 0-4.\n\nOutput has 8s in columns 0-2 for those rows, 5 in column 3, and 6s in columns 4-5 for the first five rows.\n\nIn Example 2:\n\nInput has 5 in column 2 for rows 0-3.\n\nOutput has 8s in columns 0-1 for those rows, 5 in column 2, and 6 in column 3 for the first two rows, then 0.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nInput has 5 in column 4 for rows 0-7.\n\nOutput has 8s in columns 0-3 for those rows, 5 in column 4, and 6s in columns 5-6 for the first five rows, then 0.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each row where there is a 5 in column c, the output has 8s in columns 0 to c-1, 5 in column c, and 6s in columns c+1 to c+1 (for the first few rows), then 0.\n\nBut how to determine how many rows the 6s are present.\n\nIn Example 1, the 5 is in the first five rows. The 6s are in columns 4-5 for all those rows.\n\nIn Example 2, the 5 is in the first four rows. The 6 is in column 3 for the first two rows, then 0.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5 is in the first eight rows. The 6s are in columns 5-6 for the first five rows, then 0.\n\nThis suggests that the number of rows where the 6s are present is determined by the number of rows where the 5 is present, but it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of rows where the 6s are present is equal to the number of 5s in the input. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are present in the columns to the right of the 5's column for the first two rows where the 5 is present.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to find a way to code this transformation. Let's try to write code that:\n\nFor each row in the input:\n\n- Find the column index of the 5.\n\n- If there is a 5, then:\n\n   - For columns 0 to c-1, set to 8.\n\n   - Set column c to 5.\n\n   - For columns c+1 to c+1, set to 6.\n\n   - For columns c+2 to 6, set to 0.\n\nBut this would fit Example 1 and Example 3, but not Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the 5 is in column 2. So columns 0-1 are 8, column 2 is 5, column 3 is 6, and columns 4-6 are 0. But in the output for Example 2, the first two rows have 6 in column 3, and the next two rows have 0. So this suggests that the 6 is present for the first two rows, then 0.\n\nBut according to this code, it would be present for all rows where the 5 is present. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this suggests that the 6s are only present for the first two rows where the 5 is present.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of 6s is determined by the row number. For example, the first two rows have 6 in column c+1, and then 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples and code it.\n\nLet me try to code the following:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n   if the row contains a 5:\n\n      find the column index c of the 5.\n\n      for columns 0 to c-1: set to 8.\n\n      set column c to 5.\n\n      for columns c+1 to c+1: set to 6.\n\n      for columns c+2 to 6: set to 0.\n\nBut this would fit Example 1 and Example 3, but not Example 2. Let's see.\n\nFor Example 2, the input has 5 in column 2 for rows 0-3.\n\nThe code would set columns 0-1 to 8, column 2 to 5, column 3 to 6, and columns 4-6 to 0. So the output row would be 8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0. Which matches the output for Example 2's first two rows. But in the output for Example 2, the third and fourth rows have 0 in column 3. So this code would set column 3 to 6 for all rows where the 5 is present. But in the actual output, it's 0 for those rows. So this suggests that this code is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 2, the 6 is in column 3 for the first two rows, then 0. So perhaps the number of rows where the 6 is present is equal to the number of rows where the 5 is present, but divided by some factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are present only for the first two rows where the 5 is present.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the 5 is present in the first five rows. The 6s are present in columns 4 and 5 for all those rows.\n\nIn Example 2, the 5 is present in the first four rows. The 6 is present in column 3 for the first two rows, then 0.\n\nIn Example 3, the 5 is present in the first eight rows. The 6s are present in columns 5-6 for the first five rows, then 0.\n\nThis suggests that the number of rows where the 6 is present is equal to the column index of the 5 in the input. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3, so the 6 is present for 3 rows? No, in Example 1, it's present for 5 rows.\n\nThis is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples and code it. Let's try to write code that for each 5 in the input, the output has 8s to the left, 5 in the same column, and 6s to the right for the first two columns, and 0 otherwise.\n\nBut how to handle the rows.\n\nMaybe the 6s are present in the columns to the right of the 5's column for the first two rows where the 5 is present.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column for the first two rows, and then 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to proceed with the following code:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n   if the row contains a 5:\n\n      find the column index c of the 5.\n\n      for columns 0 to c-1: set to 8.\n\n      set column c to 5.\n\n      for columns c+1 to c+1: set to 6.\n\n      for columns c+2 to 6: set to 0.\n\nBut this would not fit Example 2, but perhaps it's the best I can do.\n\nLet's test this with Example 2:\n\nInput row is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nc = 2.\n\nSo columns 0-1: 8, column 2:5, column 3:6, columns 4-6:0.\n\nSo the output row would be 8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0. Which matches the first two rows of Example 2's output. But in the output for Example 2, the third and fourth rows have 0 in column 3. So this suggests that the code would set column 3 to 6 for all rows where the 5 is present, but in the actual output, it's 0.\n\nThis indicates that this code is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the 6 is present only for the first two rows where the 5 is present.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are present for the first two rows where the 5 is present, and then 0.\n\nBut how to code that.\n\nMaybe for each row, if it is in the first two rows where the 5 is present, then set the 6s, else 0.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with the code that sets the 8s to the left, 5 in the same column, and 6 in the next column, and 0 otherwise, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nBut this may not be correct, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, here's the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = [0] * 7\n        # Find the position of 5 in the row\n        c = None\n        for i in range(7):\n            if row[i] == 5:\n                c = i\n                break\n        if c is not None:\n            # Set 8s to the left\n            for i in range(c):\n                new_row[i] = 8\n            new_row[c] = 5\n            # Set 6 in the next column\n            if c + 1 < 7:\n                new_row[c+1] = 6\n            # Set rest to 0\n            for i in range(c+2, 7):\n                new_row[i] = 0\n        else:\n            # No 5, so set to 0\n            new_row = [0]*7\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but the output is 14x7. So the code needs to process 14 rows.\n\nBut the input grid is 14 rows by 7 columns. So the code should process each of the 14 rows.\n\nBut in the examples, the output for Example 1 is 14 rows. So the code should generate 14 rows.\n\nBut in the code above, for each row in the input, it processes it and generates a new row of 7 columns.\n\nBut this code would not handle the cases where the 5 is in the last column, or where there are multiple 5s in a row.\n\nBut according to the examples, each row has a single 5.\n\nLet's test this code with Example 1.\n\nExample 1's input has 5 in column 3 for the first five rows.\n\nFor these rows, the code would set columns 0-2 to 8, column 3 to 5, column 4 to 6, and columns 5-6 to 0. So the new_row would be [8,8,8,5,6,0,0]. But the actual output for Example 1 is [8,8,8,5,6,6,0]. So this code would not match.\n\nAh, this is a problem. The code sets column 4 to 6, but the output has 6 in column 5 as well.\n\nSo this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut why? In the example, the 6s are in columns 4 and 5 for the first five rows.\n\nSo perhaps the code should set columns c+1 to c+2 to 6.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nMaybe the code should set columns c+1 and c+2 to 6, and the rest to 0.\n\nBut this would require checking if c+1 and c+2 are within the column range.\n\nLet's adjust the code:\n\nfor i in range(c+1, c+3):\n    if i < 7:\n        new_row[i] = 6\n\nBut this would set columns c+1 and c+2 to 6.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1.\n\nFor c=3, columns 4 and 5 are 6. So new_row is [8,8,8,5,6,6,0]. Which matches the first row of Example 1's output.\n\nFor Example 2, c=2. columns 3 and 4 are 6. So new_row is [8,8,5,6,6,0,0]. But the output for Example 2's first row is [8,8,5,6,0,0,0,0]. Wait, the output for Example 2 is 8 columns? No, the output is 7 columns. Wait, the input is 7 columns, so the output is 7 columns.\n\nWait, the input for Example 2 is 8 columns? No, the input is 7 columns. Wait, in the training examples, the input and output are 7 columns.\n\nWait, the input for Example 2 is:\n\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 but this is 8 columns. Wait, this is a problem. Wait, the training examples might have a mistake, but according to the problem statement, the input is a 14x7 grid.\n\nWait, looking back at the training examples:\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 this is 8 numbers, but the input should be 7 columns. This suggests that there might be a mistake in the training examples, but perhaps it's a formatting error. Alternatively, maybe the input for Example 2 is 8 columns, but the output is 8 columns. But the problem states that the output must be 14x7.\n\nBut this is confusing. Let me recheck.\n\nThe problem says that the output must be 14x7. So the input and output grids are 14 rows by 7 columns.\n\nBut in the training examples, the input for Example 2 is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, this is 14 rows, each with 8 columns. But the output is 14x7. This suggests that there's a formatting error in the training examples, but the problem says that the input and output are 14x7. So perhaps the input for Example 2 is 7 columns, and the 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 is a typo, and should be 0 0 5 0 0 0 0, which is 7 columns.\n\nAssuming that, let's re-examine Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 5 in column 2 for the first four rows. The output is:\n\n8 8 5 6 0 0 0 0 \u2192 but this is 8 columns, which is incorrect. So there must be a mistake in the example.\n\nBut given the problem statement, the output must be 14x7. So perhaps the input for Example 2 is 7 columns, and the output is 7 columns.\n\nAssuming that, the code would be adjusted.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nGiven the time, I think I'll proceed with the code that for each 5 in the input, the output has 8s to the left, 5 in the same column, and 6s in the next two columns, and 0 elsewhere.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = [0] * 7\n        c = None\n        for i in range(7):\n            if row[i] == 5:\n                c = i\n                break\n        if c is not None:\n            for i in range(c):\n                new_row[i] = 8\n            new_row[c] = 5\n            # Set next two columns to 6\n            for i in range(c+1, c+3):\n                if i < 7:\n                    new_row[i] = 6\n            # Set the rest to 0\n            for i in range(c+3, 7):\n                new_row[i] = 0\n        else:\n            new_row = [0]*7\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nThis code would set the 8s to the left of the 5, 5 in the same column, and 6 in the next two columns, then 0.\n\nTesting this with Example 1:\n\nFor c=3, new_row[0-2] = 8, new_row[3] = 5, new_row[4] and 5 = 6, new_row[6] = 0. So the row becomes [8,8,8,5,6,6,0], which matches the first row of Example 1's output.\n\nFor the second row, it's the same, so the output would be the same. This fits the first example.\n\nFor Example 2, if the input has 5 in column 2, then new_row[0-1] = 8, new_row[2] = 5, new_row[3] and 4 = 6, and new_row[5-6] = 0. So the row would be [8,8,5,6,6,0,0]. But the actual output for Example 2's first row is [8,8,5,6,0,0,0,0]. This suggests that this code is not correct.\n\nBut perhaps the example has a typo, and the output for Example 2 is 7 columns, not 8. So the code would produce [8,8,5,6,6,0,0], but the actual output is [8,8,5,6,0,0,0]. This suggests that the code is still not correct.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code, as it fits the first example and the third example.\n\nNow, let's test with Example 3:\n\nInput has 5 in column 4 for the first eight rows.\n\nnew_row[0-3] = 8, new_row[4] = 5, new_row[5] and 6 = 6, and new_row[7-6] is out of range, so 0. So the row would be [8,8,8,8,5,6,6,0], but since it's 7 columns, it would be [8,8,8,8,5,6,6]. But the output for Example 3 is [8,8,8,8,5,6,6,6], but this is 8 columns. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nBut again, this may be due to formatting errors in the examples.\n\nGiven all this, I'll proceed with the code that sets the 8s to the left of the 5, 5 in the same column, and 6s in the next two columns, and 0 elsewhere.\n\nThis code may not be perfect, but it's the best I can do based on the examples.\n"
