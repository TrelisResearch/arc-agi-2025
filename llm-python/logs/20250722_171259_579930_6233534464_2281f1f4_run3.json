          "content": "Looking at the training examples, I observe that the transformation involves modifying certain cells in the grid based on their position and value. Specifically:\n\n1. In Example 1, the input has 5s in certain positions, and the output has 5s in the same positions, but also 2s in some other positions.\n2. In Example 2, the input has 5s in certain positions, and the output has 5s in the same positions, but also 2s in some other positions.\n3. In Example 3, the input has 5s in certain positions, and the output has 5s in the same positions, but also 2s in some other positions.\n\nFrom these examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Keeping the original value if it's a 5.\n- Replacing other values with 2s in certain positions.\n\nBased on this pattern, I'll write a function that replaces non-5 values with 2s in certain positions. The exact pattern is not fully clear, but I'll implement a transformation that replaces non-5 values with 2s in certain positions.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 5:\n                new_row.append(5)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(2)\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
