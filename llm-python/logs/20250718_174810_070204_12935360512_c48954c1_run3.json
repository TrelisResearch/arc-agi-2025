          "content": "Looking at the training examples, I observe that the output grid appears to be a repetition or transformation of the input grid in some way. The output grid for each example is 9x9, while the input is 3x3. This suggests that the input grid is being expanded or transformed into a larger grid.\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that the output grid seems to be a repetition of the input grid in a specific pattern. For example, in Example 1, the input grid is:\n```\n7 6 7\n2 7 6\n1 2 7\n```\nAnd the output grid is:\n```\n7 2 1 1 2 7 7 2 1\n6 7 2 2 7 6 6 7 2\n7 6 7 7 6 7 7 6 7\n7 6 7 7 6 7 7 6 7\n6 7 2 2 7 6 6 7 2\n7 2 1 1 2 7 7 2 1\n7 2 1 1 2 7 7 2 1\n6 7 2 2 7 6 6 7 2\n7 6 7 7 6 7 7 6 7\n```\nThis suggests that the input grid is being repeated in a specific pattern to form the 9x9 output grid.\n\nBased on this observation, I hypothesize that the transformation involves repeating the input grid in a specific pattern to form the 9x9 output grid.\n\nHere's my implementation of this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # The input grid is 3x3, so we need to repeat it in a specific pattern\n    # The pattern seems to be: repeat the input grid in a way that forms a 3x3 block\n    # Then repeat this 3x3 block three times to form a 9x9 grid\n    \n    # Create a 3x3 block from the input grid\n    block = [[grid[i][j] for j in range(3)] for i in range(3)]\n    \n    # Repeat the 3x3 block three times to form a 9x9 grid\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            for x in range(3):\n                for y in range(3):\n                    transformed_grid[i*3 + x][j*3 + y] = block[x][y]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # The input grid is 3x3, so we need to repeat it in a specific pattern\n    # The pattern seems to be: repeat the input grid in a way that forms a 3x3 block\n    # Then repeat this 3x3 block three times to form a 9x9 grid\n    \n    # Create a 3x3 block from the input grid\n    block = [[grid[i][j] for j in range(3)] for i in range(3)]\n    \n    # Repeat the 3x3 block three times to form a 9x9 grid\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            for x in range(3):\n                for y in range(3):\n                    transformed_grid[i*3 + x][j*3 + y] = block[x][y]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid for each example is 9x9, while the input is 3x3. This suggests that the input grid is being expanded or transformed into a larger grid.\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that the output grid seems to be a repetition of the input grid in a specific pattern. For example, in Example 1, the input grid is:\n```\n7 6 7\n2 7 6\n1 2 7\n```\nAnd the output grid is:\n```\n7 2 1 1 2 7 7 2 1\n6 7 2 2 7 6 6 7 2\n7 6 7 7 6 7 7 6 7\n7 6 7 7 6 7 7 6 7\n6 7 2 2 7 6 6 7 2\n7 2 1 1 2 7 7 2 1\n7 2 1 1 2 7 7 2 1\n6 7 2 2 7 6 6 7 2\n7 6 7 7 6 7 7 6 7\n```\nThis suggests that the input grid is being repeated in a specific pattern to form the 9x9 output grid.\n\nBased on this observation, I hypothesize that the transformation involves repeating the input grid in a specific pattern to form the 9x9 output grid.\n\nHere's my implementation of this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # The input grid is 3x3, so we need to repeat it in a specific pattern\n    # The pattern seems to be: repeat the input grid in a way that forms a 3x3 block\n    # Then repeat this 3x3 block three times to form a 9x9 grid\n    \n    # Create a 3x3 block from the input grid\n    block = [[grid[i][j] for j in range(3)] for i in range(3)]\n    \n    # Repeat the 3x3 block three times to form a 9x9 grid\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            for x in range(3):\n                for y in range(3):\n                    transformed_grid[i*3 + x][j*3 + y] = block[x][y]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # The input grid is 3x3, so we need to repeat it in a specific pattern\n    # The pattern seems to be: repeat the input grid in a way that forms a 3x3 block\n    # Then repeat this 3x3 block three times to form a 9x9 grid\n    \n    # Create a 3x3 block from the input grid\n    block = [[grid[i][j] for j in range(3)] for i in range(3)]\n    \n    # Repeat the 3x3 block three times to form a 9x9 grid\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            for x in range(3):\n                for y in range(3):\n                    transformed_grid[i*3 + x][j*3 + y] = block[x][y]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
