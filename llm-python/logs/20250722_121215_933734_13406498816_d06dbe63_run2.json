Identifying a \"target\" cell (the 8 in Example 1 and the 8 in Example 2)\n2. Creating a pattern of 5s around this target cell\n3. The pattern of 5s seems to spread outward from the target cell in a specific way\n\nFrom Example 1:\n- The 8 is at position (3,5)\n- The 5s form a sort of \"spiral\" or \"fan\" pattern spreading outward from the 8\n\nFrom Example 2:\n- The 8 is at position (7,6)\n- The 5s form a more complex pattern that seems to spread in multiple directions\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n1. Finds the position of the value 8 in the input grid\n2. Creates a pattern of 5s around this position\n3. The pattern spreads outward in a specific way\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the position of the value 8\n    target_pos = None\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                target_pos = (i, j)\n                break\n        if target_pos:\n            break\n    \n    # If no 8 is found, leave the grid unchanged\n    if not target_pos:\n        return transformed\n    \n    # Define the pattern of 5s\n    # This is a simple spiral pattern spreading outward from the target\n    # We'll create a 5x5 pattern centered at the target\n    # Then expand it to fill the grid\n    pattern = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 5, 5, 5, 0],\n        [0, 5, 0, 5, 0],\n        [0, 5, 5, 5, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Create a 13x13 grid filled with 0s\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    \n    # Place the pattern in the center of the result grid\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if pattern[i][j] == 5:\n                result[target_pos[0] + i - 2][target_pos[1] + j - 2] = 5\n    \n    # Replace the original grid with the transformed grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            transformed[i][j] = result[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the position of the value 8\n    target_pos = None\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                target_pos = (i, j)\n                break\n        if target_pos:\n            break\n    \n    # If no 8 is found, leave the grid unchanged\n    if not target_pos:\n        return transformed\n    \n    # Define the pattern of 5s\n    # This is a simple spiral pattern spreading outward from the target\n    # We'll create a 5x5 pattern centered at the target\n    # Then expand it to fill the grid\n    pattern = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 5, 5, 5, 0],\n        [0, 5, 0, 5, 0],\n        [0, 5, 5, 5, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Create a 13x13 grid filled with 0s\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    \n    # Place the pattern in the center of the result grid\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if pattern[i][j] == 5:\n                result[target_pos[0] + i - 2][target_pos[1] + j - 2] = 5\n    \n    # Replace the original grid with the transformed grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            transformed[i][j] = result[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed\n```",

The pattern of 5s seems to spread outward from the target cell in a specific way\n\nFrom Example 1:\n- The 8 is at position (3,5)\n- The 5s form a sort of \"spiral\" or \"fan\" pattern spreading outward from the 8\n\nFrom Example 2:\n- The 8 is at position (7,6)\n- The 5s form a more complex pattern that seems to spread in multiple directions\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n1. Finds the position of the value 8 in the input grid\n2. Creates a pattern of 5s around this position\n3. The pattern spreads outward in a specific way\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the position of the value 8\n    target_pos = None\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                target_pos = (i, j)\n                break\n        if target_pos:\n            break\n    \n    # If no 8 is found, leave the grid unchanged\n    if not target_pos:\n        return transformed\n    \n    # Define the pattern of 5s\n    # This is a simple spiral pattern spreading outward from the target\n    # We'll create a 5x5 pattern centered at the target\n    # Then expand it to fill the grid\n    pattern = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 5, 5, 5, 0],\n        [0, 5, 0, 5, 0],\n        [0, 5, 5, 5, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Create a 13x13 grid filled with 0s\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    \n    # Place the pattern in the center of the result grid\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if pattern[i][j] == 5:\n                result[target_pos[0] + i - 2][target_pos[1] + j - 2] = 5\n    \n    # Replace the original grid with the transformed grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            transformed[i][j] = result[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the position of the value 8\n    target_pos = None\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                target_pos = (i, j)\n                break\n        if target_pos:\n            break\n    \n    # If no 8 is found, leave the grid unchanged\n    if not target_pos:\n        return transformed\n    \n    # Define the pattern of 5s\n    # This is a simple spiral pattern spreading outward from the target\n    # We'll create a 5x5 pattern centered at the target\n    # Then expand it to fill the grid\n    pattern = [\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 5, 5, 5, 0],\n        [0, 5, 0, 5, 0],\n        [0, 5, 5, 5, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Create a 13x13 grid filled with 0s\n    result = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    \n    # Place the pattern in the center of the result grid\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if pattern[i][j] == 5:\n                result[target_pos[0] + i - 2][target_pos[1] + j - 2] = 5\n    \n    # Replace the original grid with the transformed grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            transformed[i][j] = result[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed\n```",
