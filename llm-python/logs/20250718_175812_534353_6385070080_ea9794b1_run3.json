          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice several patterns:\n\n1. The output grid seems to be a transformation of the input grid that involves:\n   - Identifying regions of certain values (like 4s, 3s, 9s)\n   - Replacing those regions with other values (like 3s, 9s, 8s)\n   - Applying some form of spatial transformation (like rotation or reflection)\n   - Possibly creating new patterns based on the original values\n\n2. There's a pattern where certain values are replaced with others in a way that seems to be based on their position and value.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Replaces certain values with others based on their position and value\n- Applies some form of spatial transformation\n- Creates new patterns based on the original values\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Apply some transformation based on value and position\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4s with 3s in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace 3s with 9s in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 9:\n                # Replace 9s with 8s in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 0:\n                # Replace 0s with 3s in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nThis implementation attempts to capture the patterns I observed in the training examples by replacing certain values with others based on their position and value. It's a partial solution that captures some aspects of the transformation, but I'm aware that there may be more complex patterns at play.",
