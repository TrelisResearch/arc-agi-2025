In Example 1, the 5s are in specific positions and the output has 1s and 2s in certain locations. In Example 2, the 5s are in different positions and the output has 1s and 2s in different locations.\n\nFrom these examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n1. Identifying positions of 5s in the input grid\n2. Placing 1s and 2s in the output grid based on the positions of these 5s\n\nHere's my best hypothesis for the transformation:\n\n- For each cell in the output grid:\n  - If the corresponding cell in the input grid is 5, place a 1 in the output grid\n  - If the corresponding cell in the input grid is 5 and it's in a specific pattern (like the last row in Example 1), place a 2\n  - Otherwise, keep the value as 0\n\nI'll implement this logic in Python.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(9):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Check if it's in the last row (Example 1 pattern)\n                if i == 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            # Otherwise, keep it as 0\n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 1, the 5s are in specific positions that seem to influence where the 1s and 2s appear in the output. In Example 2, the 5s are in different positions but still seem to influence the output values.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves identifying the positions of 5s in the input grid and using that to determine where to place values in the output grid.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Find the positions of 5s in the input grid\n    five_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(9) for j in range(9) if grid[i][j] == 5]\n    \n    # For each 5 in the input grid, determine where to place a 1 or 2 in the output\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        # The value in the output grid is 1 unless it's in the last row\n        if i == 8:\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n        else:\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Find the positions of 5s in the input grid\n    five_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(9) for j in range(9) if grid[i][j] == 5]\n    \n    # For each 5 in the input grid, determine where to place a 1 or 2 in the output\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        # The value in the output grid is 1 unless it's in the last row\n        if i == 8:\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n        else:\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
