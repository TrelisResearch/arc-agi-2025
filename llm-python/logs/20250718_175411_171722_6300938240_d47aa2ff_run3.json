The output grid seems to be a 10x10 grid where certain cells are filled with numbers based on their position in the input grid.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where numbers are placed in specific positions based on their row and column indices.\n3. In some examples, numbers are placed in specific positions that seem to follow a pattern related to their row and column indices.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that fills the output grid with numbers based on their position in the input grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 output grid initialized with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            # If the input cell is not zero, place it in the output grid\n            if grid[row][col] != 0:\n                # Place the value in the output grid at the same position\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][col]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis implementation simply copies the input grid to the output grid, as the training examples seem to show that the output grid is a direct copy of the input grid. However, I'm not entirely sure if this is the correct pattern, as the examples show some changes in the output grid. But based on the information given, this is the best I can do.",
