          "content": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the training examples to identify patterns. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what we can observe:\n\n1. **Identify the target pattern**: The output grids seem to have a specific transformation applied to the input grids. Let's look at the examples more closely.\n\n2. **Pattern Observations**:\n   - The input grids contain the value `2` and sometimes `0`.\n   - The output grids contain the value `3` in place of `2` and sometimes `0`.\n   - The transformation appears to be replacing `2` with `3` and leaving `0` unchanged.\n\n3. **Transformation Logic**:\n   - We need to create a function that iterates through each cell in the input grid.\n   - If the cell contains `2`, replace it with `3`.\n   - If the cell contains `0`, leave it unchanged.\n   - For all other values, we can either leave them unchanged or apply some other transformation if needed.\n\nGiven these observations, let's implement the transformation in Python.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for value in row:\n            if value == 2:\n                new_row.append(3)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(value)\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis function will replace all occurrences of `2` with `3` in the input grid while leaving other values unchanged. This approach should work for the provided training examples and the test input.",
