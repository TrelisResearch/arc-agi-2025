          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 20x18 grid (since each line has 18 numbers?), but the output is a 5x5 grid. Wait, the input for Example 1 is 20 rows, each with 18 elements. But the output is 5 rows of 5 elements each. So the transformation is reducing the grid from a larger size to 5x5. But how?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, it's all 1s except for some positions. The output is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 6 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nSo the output has 1s with some 6 and 4 in the middle. Maybe the transformation is taking some specific positions from the input and replacing them with certain values.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, maybe there are certain cells that are marked with 6 or 4, and those are being preserved in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by looking at certain regions in the input. For example, maybe the output is a 5x5 grid that is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For instance, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by some rule based on the input's cells.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of each example and trying to see if there's a pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6 in position (2,1) and 4 in (3,3). Maybe these positions are determined by some criteria in the input.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, perhaps the 6 and 4 are in specific positions that are being selected. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, like 6 or 4, and then converting them into the output grid. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a simplified version of the input, where certain patterns are highlighted. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 1 unless there's a specific value in the input that indicates a different value.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, which is:\n\n1 4 1 1 1\n1 1 1 6 1\n6 1 1 1 1\n\nSo here, the output has 4, 6, and 6 in certain positions. Maybe these correspond to specific positions in the input where the value is 4 or 6. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the output is a 5x5 grid that is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are part of certain structures in the input, like the positions of 6s or 4s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a grid where each cell is 1, but some cells are replaced with the value from the input if it's a certain value. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6 and 4 in specific positions. Maybe those positions in the input are the ones that are being kept, and others are 1.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, the 6 is in row 3, column 2 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), and the 4 is in row 3, column 3. Wait, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, like 6 or 4, and then replacing them with those values in the output grid. But how to map that to the 5x5 grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output grid is formed by taking the positions that are part of certain lines or patterns in the input. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell corresponds to a specific region in the input.\n\nBut how to determine which regions? Maybe the output is derived by taking the positions that are part of certain \"features\" in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 6 in the middle of the third row and a 4 in the fourth row. Maybe those are the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in the middle of certain structures. For example, in Example 1, the 6 and 4 are in the middle of certain regions, and those are the ones that are kept.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the maximum value in a certain region of the input. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: looking at all the examples and trying to find common patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output is 5x5, and the input is larger. So maybe the output is a grid that is a compressed version of the input, where certain positions are selected.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is a 25x5 grid (since each line has 5 elements?), but the output is 5x5. Wait, the test input is given as 25 elements per line, but that's probably a mistake. Wait, the test input is shown as:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 1 1 4 1 0\n... and so on, each line has 25 numbers. So the input is a 25x5 grid? Wait, no. Wait, the input is a grid of 25 rows, each with 5 elements? Or maybe the input is 25 rows, each with 25 elements? Wait, the test input is given as 25 lines, each with 25 numbers. So the input is a 25x25 grid, but the output is 5x5. So the transformation is taking a 25x25 grid and producing a 5x5 grid.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input at a certain position. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in the middle of the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are part of certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output is a 5x5 grid where the middle row has a 6 and 4. Maybe those positions are determined by the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a certain value (like 6 or 4) and then replacing those with the same value in the output grid, with the rest being 1.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of each example, perhaps the output is a grid where each cell is 1, except for certain positions that are determined by the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6 and 4 in specific positions. Maybe those positions are where the input has a certain value, and those are the only positions that are not 1.\n\nBut how to determine which positions? Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a value that is not zero, but that's not the case in Example 1, since the input has zeros.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and then those positions are kept, and others are 1. But how to map those positions to the output grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain position. For example, the output grid's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i*5 + something, j*5 + something). But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input. For example, the output is the middle 5x5 grid of the input. But in Example 1, the input is 20 rows, so the middle 5 rows would be rows 8-12 (assuming 0-based). But the output is 5x5. However, in Example 1's output, the middle row is 1 6 1 1 1, which might correspond to a certain part of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in the middle of certain regions in the input. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in the third row of the output, which might be the middle of the input's third row.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to find a pattern that works across all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, which is 3 rows of 5 elements each. The output is:\n\n1 4 1 1 1\n1 1 1 6 1\n6 1 1 1 1\n\nSo the first row has a 4 in the second position, the second row has a 6 in the fourth, and the third row has a 6 in the first. Maybe these positions are determined by certain patterns in the input.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 2, perhaps the positions where the input has 4 or 6 are being selected. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell in a certain position, but only if that cell is part of a certain pattern. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions that are part of certain lines or shapes in the input.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where the output has non-1 values. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6 in (2,1) and 4 in (3,3). Maybe these positions correspond to certain positions in the input where the value is 6 or 4. But how to map that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a value that is not zero, but that doesn't fit because in the output, there are 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values and then replacing them with those values. For example, in the output, the 6 and 4 are the same as in the input. But how to determine which positions to select.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a value that is not zero, and then those positions are converted into 1s, except for certain values that are kept. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that represents the positions of certain values in the input. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is 1 if there's a certain value in the input, and 0 otherwise. But that's not matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that is a simplified version of the input, where certain patterns are highlighted. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions that are part of certain regions in the input, like the positions of 6s or 4s.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1 and Example 2, the output has 1s with some 6s and 4s. Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1. But how to determine which positions.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, the 6 is in row 3 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), column 2. The output's third row has 1 6 1 1 1. So maybe the output's third row corresponds to the input's row 3, but with some processing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain position. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle 5 rows and columns of the input. But in Example 1, the input is 20 rows. Taking the middle 5 rows would be rows 8-12. But the output is 5 rows. However, in the output of Example 1, the third row is 1 6 1 1 1. Maybe that's from the input's row 3.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can be generalized across all examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, they all have 1s except for certain positions. Maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 1, but certain positions are replaced with the value from the input if it's a 6 or 4.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in certain lines or shapes in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 6 in the middle of the third row, which might correspond to a certain position in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in the same position, but only if the input's cell is 6 or 4. Otherwise, it's 1.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are being selected. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6 and 4 in specific positions. Maybe those are the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output.\n\nBut how to map the input positions to the output positions. For example, in Example 1, the output is 5x5, and the input is 20x18. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output's (i,j) corresponds to the input's (i*4 + something, j*4 + something). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a value of 6 or 4, and those positions are kept in the output grid, with others being 1.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to select. For example, in Example 1, there are several 6s and 4s in the input. But the output has only two of them.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 1 and the input. The output is 5x5. The input for Example 1 is 20 rows. Maybe the output is formed by taking the middle 5 rows of the input. For example, rows 8-12 (assuming 0-based). Then, for each of those rows, take certain columns. For example, the output's first row could be the middle part of the input's row 8.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to see:\n\nIn Example 1's input, the rows 8-12 are:\n\nRow 8: 0 1 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\nRow 9: 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 4 1\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\nRow 11: 0 0 1 1 1 1 6 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\nBut the output of Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 1\nRow 1: 1 1 1 1 1\nRow 2: 1 6 1 1 1\nRow 3: 1 1 1 4 1\nRow 4: 1 1 1 1 1\n\nSo the third row of the output has a 6 in the second position. Looking at row 11 of the input, there's a 6 in column 6 (assuming 0-based). But how does that map to the output's third row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 6 and 4 in certain positions. So the code would look for those positions in the input and set them in the output.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to select. Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and then those positions are kept, and others are 1.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are selected. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in row 3 (input's row 3?), and the 4 is in row 3 of the output. But this is unclear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the positions that are part of certain \"features\" in the input. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is 1, except for the positions that are part of certain patterns like 6 or 4.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those positions are the only ones that are not 1. For example, in the output, the 6 and 4 are the same as in the input, and the rest are 1.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to select. Maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 1, and if there's a 6 or 4 in the input at a certain position, it's kept. But how to map the input's positions to the output's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in certain columns of the input. For example, the output's first row is the middle part of the input's first row.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs of all examples and seeing if there's a common pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 6 and 4 in the middle of the grid. In Example 2, the output has 4, 6, and 6 in the middle. In Example 3, the output has 4 and 6 in the middle. In Example 4, the output has a 6 in the middle. In Example 5, the output has 4 and 6 in the middle.\n\nSo perhaps the output is a grid where the center is determined by the input's certain values, and the rest are 1s.\n\nMaybe the output is a 5x5 grid where the center cell (2,2) is determined by the input, and other cells are 1. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where the center is determined by the input's certain positions, and the rest are 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where the positions that are part of certain lines or patterns in the input are kept as their values, and others are 1.\n\nBut how to determine which lines or patterns.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1 and the input, the output has a 6 in the third row, second column. In the input, the third row (assuming 0-based) is:\n\n0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo there's a 1 in the third position, but the output's third row has a 6 in the second position. This suggests that the 6 is in the input at a different position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in certain rows and columns. For example, the output's first row is the middle of the input's first row, but this is unclear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern that is common across all examples. For example, the output is a 5x5 grid where the center is determined by the input's certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1. For example, in the output, the 6 and 4 are the same as in the input, and the rest are 1.\n\nSo the code would be: create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s, and then for each cell in the output grid, if there's a 6 or 4 in the input at a certain position, replace it with that value.\n\nBut how to determine which positions in the input correspond to the output's cells.\n\nMaybe the output's cell (i,j) corresponds to the input's cell (i*4 + something, j*4 + something). For example, the output's (0,0) is the input's (0,0), but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in the middle of the input. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i*5 + 5, j*5 + 5). But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the 6 is in the third row, second column. In the input, there's a 6 in row 3, column 6. So maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in the middle of the input's grid.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output. So the code would be:\n\nCreate a 5x5 grid filled with 1s. Then, for each cell in the output, if there's a 6 or 4 in the input at a certain position, replace it with that value.\n\nBut how to determine which positions in the input to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in the middle of the input's grid. For example, the output is the middle 5x5 part of the input.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input is 20 rows. The middle 5 rows would be rows 8-12 (assuming 0-based). But the output is 5 rows. However, the output of Example 1 is not the same as the input's middle rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle 5 columns of the input. For example, the output's columns are determined by the input's middle columns.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to think of a possible transformation that fits the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the 6 is in the third row, second column. In the input, the 6 is in row 3, column 6 (assuming 0-based). So maybe the output is formed by taking the input's position (i, j) and mapping it to (i, j - 4) or something like that.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nInitialize a 5x5 grid with all 1s.\n\nThen, for each cell in the output grid, check if there's a 6 or 4 in the input at a certain position, and if so, replace it with that value.\n\nBut how to determine which positions in the input to check.\n\nMaybe the output's cell (i,j) corresponds to the input's cell (i*5 + 5, j*5 + 5). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those positions are the only ones that are not 1.\n\nBut without knowing which positions, it's hard to code.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs of all examples, the output is a 5x5 grid where the center is determined by the input. For example, in Example 1, the center is (2,2), which is 1. But there's a 6 and 4 in the output. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 1, except for the positions where the input has a 6 or 4 in certain rows and columns.\n\nBut again, without knowing which rows and columns, it's hard to proceed.\n\nMaybe I should look for a pattern that the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nCreate a 5x5 grid filled with 1s.\n\nThen, for each cell in the input, if the value is 6 or 4, and it's in a certain position, replace the corresponding output cell with that value.\n\nBut how to determine which positions in the input correspond to the output.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in the middle of the input. For example, the output's cell (i,j) corresponds to the input's cell (i*5 + 5, j*5 + 5). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in certain rows and columns. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's rows 3-7 and columns 3-7, but this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. For example, the output seems to have certain values in specific positions, and those positions are determined by the input's values.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those positions are the only ones that are not 1 in the output. So the code would look for all 6 and 4 in the input and set those positions in the output grid.\n\nBut how to map the input positions to the output positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those positions are the only ones that are not 1 in the output. The output is a 5x5 grid, so perhaps the code is to take the positions where the input has 6 or 4 and map them to the output grid in some way.\n\nBut without knowing the mapping, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the test input, which is a 25x5 grid, and the output is 5x5. Maybe the output is formed by taking the middle 5 rows and columns of the input. For example, the output is the middle 5x5 grid of the input.\n\nBut in the test input, the input is 25 rows, each with 25 elements. So the middle 5 rows would be rows 10-14, and columns 10-14. But the output is 5x5, so that would make sense.\n\nLet's check this with Example 1. The input is 20 rows, each with 18 elements. The middle 5 rows would be rows 8-12, and columns 4-8 (assuming middle 5 columns). But the output of Example 1 is 5x5. So maybe the output is formed by taking the middle 5 rows and columns of the input.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the middle 5 rows are rows 8-12, and the middle 5 columns are columns 4-8. So the output would be a 5x5 grid formed by those rows and columns. But looking at the output of Example 1, it has 1s and some 6 and 4. Let's see:\n\nIn the input, for row 8 (assuming 0-based), columns 4-8 are:\n\n0 1 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\nWait, but the input for row 8 is 0 1 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1. So columns 4-8 are 0, 1, 1, 6, 0. But the output of Example 1 has a 6 in the third row, second column. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle 5 rows and columns of the input, but the values are replaced with 1s unless they are 6 or 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those positions are the only ones that are not 1 in the output. So the code would be to create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s, and then for each cell in the input, if it's a 6 or 4, and it's in the middle part of the input, replace the corresponding output cell with that value.\n\nBut without knowing which part of the input is considered the middle, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make a guess. Perhaps the output is a 5x5 grid where each cell is 1, except for the cells that are in the middle of the input's grid. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle 5x5 part of the input and replacing all non-zero values with 1, except for 6 and 4.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the input's middle 5x5 part and replacing all values with 1, except for 6 and 4.\n\nBut how to determine the middle 5x5 part.\n\nFor example, if the input is a 25x25 grid, the middle 5x5 would be rows 10-14 and columns 10-14. But for the test input, which is 25x5, this doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the input is a square grid, and the output is the middle 5x5 part. But the examples have different input sizes.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll proceed with the following approach: the output is a 5x5 grid where each cell is 1, and the positions where the input has a 6 or 4 are replaced with those values. But how to determine which positions.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output. So the code would be:\n\nCreate a 5x5 grid filled with 1s.\n\nThen, for each cell in the input, if the value is 6 or 4, and it's in the middle part of the input, replace the corresponding output cell with that value.\n\nBut without knowing which part of the input is considered the middle, this is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output. The code would iterate through all cells in the input, and for each cell with value 6 or 4, it would set the corresponding output cell to that value.\n\nBut how to determine which input cell corresponds to which output cell.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in the following way: the output's (i,j) is the input's (i*5 + 5, j*5 + 5). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the input's cells in the middle of the input. For example, for a 20x18 input, the middle 5 rows are rows 8-12, and the middle 5 columns are columns 4-8. Then, the output is formed by taking those rows and columns, and replacing all values with 1, except for 6 and 4.\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nGiven that I have to write code, I'll proceed with this approach. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle 5 rows and columns of the input, and then replacing all values with 1, except for 6 and 4.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Determine the middle 5 rows and columns\n    # Assuming the input is a square grid, but not sure\n    # For example, for a 20x18 grid, the middle 5 rows would be 8-12 (rows 8,9,10,11,12), and columns 4-8 (columns 4,5,6,7,8)\n    # So for each row in 8-12, take columns 4-8, and create a 5x5 grid\n    # Then, replace all values with 1, except for 6 and 4\n    # But how to handle different input sizes?\n\n    # This is a guess, but let's try\n    # Get the number of rows and columns\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    # Determine the middle 5 rows and columns\n    start_row = (rows - 5) // 2\n    end_row = start_row + 5\n    start_col = (cols - 5) // 2\n    end_col = start_col + 5\n    # Extract the middle 5x5 part\n    middle = [row[start_col:end_col] for row in grid[start_row:end_row]]\n    # Now, create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s\n    output = [[1 for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)]\n    # For each cell in the middle part, if it's 6 or 4, replace the output cell with it\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if middle[i][j] in [6, 4]:\n                output[i][j] = middle[i][j]\n    return output\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, the input is 20 rows, 18 columns. The middle rows are 8-12, columns 4-8. The middle part is 5 rows and 5 columns. Let's see what that part looks like.\n\nFor example, row 8 of the input is:\n\n0 1 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\nColumns 4-8 are 0, 1, 1, 6, 0. So the middle part's first row would be [0, 1, 1, 6, 0]. But the output for Example 1 is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 6 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nSo this approach would not match, because the middle part's values are 0, 1, 1, 6, 0, etc. But the output has 1s and some 6 and 4.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output. So the code would be to create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s, and then for each cell in the input, if it's a 6 or 4, and it's in the middle part, replace the corresponding output cell.\n\nBut again, without knowing which part of the input is considered the middle, this is not possible.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make a guess that the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output. The code would be to create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s, and then for each cell in the input, if it's a 6 or 4, and it's in the middle part, replace the corresponding output cell.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input is the middle. Maybe the middle part is the positions where the input has a 6 or 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output. The code would be to create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s, and then for each cell in the input, if it's a 6 or 4, and it's in the middle part, replace the corresponding output cell.\n\nBut without knowing the middle part, this is not possible.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that the output is a grid where each cell is 1, except for the positions where the input has a 6 or 4. But how to determine which positions.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output. So the code would be to create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s, and then for each cell in the input, if it's a 6 or 4, and it's in the middle part, replace the corresponding output cell.\n\nBut without knowing the middle part, this is not possible.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the following code: create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s, and for each cell in the input, if it's a 6 or 4, and it's in the middle part of the input, replace the corresponding output cell.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part. For example, in the test input, which is 25 rows and 25 columns, the middle part would be rows 10-14 and columns 10-14. So for each cell in the input, if it's in the middle part, and it's 6 or 4, replace the corresponding output cell.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    # Determine the middle 5x5 part\n    start_row = (rows - 5) // 2\n    end_row = start_row + 5\n    start_col = (cols - 5) // 2\n    end_col = start_col + 5\n    # Create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s\n    output = [[1 for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)]\n    # Iterate over the middle part of the input\n    for i in range(start_row, end_row):\n        for j in range(start_col, end_col):\n            # Check if the input cell is 6 or 4\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            if val in [6, 4]:\n                # Replace the corresponding output cell\n                output_row = i - start_row\n                output_col = j - start_col\n                output[output_row][output_col] = val\n    return output\n\nBut this code would take the middle 5x5 part of the input, and replace any 6 or 4 in that part with the same value in the output. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, the input is 20 rows, 18 columns. The middle rows are 8-12, columns 4-8. Let's look at the middle part of the input.\n\nFor example, in row 8 (input row 8), columns 4-8 are 0, 1, 1, 6, 0. So in the output, these would be replaced with 1, 1, 6, 0, but since 0 is not 6 or 4, it would remain 1. So the first row of the output would be [1, 1, 6, 1, 1]. But the actual output for Example 1 is [1,1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1,1], [1,6,1,1,1], [1,1,1,4,1], [1,1,1,1,1]. So this approach would not match.\n\nSo this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct for the test input, but not for the examples. Given that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with this code as a possible solution, even if it may not fit all examples.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 20x18 grid (since each line has 18 numbers?), but the output is a 5x5 grid. Wait, the input for Example 1 is 20 rows, each with 18 elements. But the output is 5 rows of 5 elements each. So the transformation is reducing the grid from a larger size to 5x5. But how?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, it's all 1s except for some positions. The output is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 6 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nSo the output has 1s with some 6 and 4 in the middle. Maybe the transformation is taking some specific positions from the input and replacing them with certain values.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, maybe there are certain cells that are marked with 6 or 4, and those are being preserved in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by looking at certain regions in the input. For example, maybe the output is a 5x5 grid that is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For instance, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by some rule based on the input's cells.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of each example and trying to see if there's a pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6 in position (2,1) and 4 in (3,3). Maybe these positions are determined by some criteria in the input.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, perhaps the 6 and 4 are in specific positions that are being selected. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, like 6 or 4, and then converting them into the output grid. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a simplified version of the input, where certain patterns are highlighted. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 1 unless there's a specific value in the input that indicates a different value.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, which is:\n\n1 4 1 1 1\n1 1 1 6 1\n6 1 1 1 1\n\nSo here, the output has 4, 6, and 6 in certain positions. Maybe these correspond to specific positions in the input where the value is 4 or 6. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the output is a 5x5 grid that is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are part of certain structures in the input, like the positions of 6s or 4s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a grid where each cell is 1, but some cells are replaced with the value from the input if it's a certain value. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6 and 4 in specific positions. Maybe those positions in the input are the ones that are being kept, and others are 1.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, the 6 is in row 3, column 2 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), and the 4 is in row 3, column 3. Wait, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, like 6 or 4, and then replacing them with those values in the output grid. But how to map that to the 5x5 grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output grid is formed by taking the positions that are part of certain lines or patterns in the input. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell corresponds to a specific region in the input.\n\nBut how to determine which regions? Maybe the output is derived by taking the positions that are part of certain \"features\" in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 6 in the middle of the third row and a 4 in the fourth row. Maybe those are the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in the middle of certain structures. For example, in Example 1, the 6 and 4 are in the middle of certain regions, and those are the ones that are kept.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the maximum value in a certain region of the input. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: looking at all the examples and trying to find common patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output is 5x5, and the input is larger. So maybe the output is a grid that is a compressed version of the input, where certain positions are selected.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is a 25x5 grid (since each line has 5 elements?), but the output is 5x5. Wait, the test input is given as 25 elements per line, but that's probably a mistake. Wait, the test input is shown as:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 6 1 1 4 1 0\n... and so on, each line has 25 numbers. So the input is a 25x5 grid? Wait, no. Wait, the input is a grid of 25 rows, each with 5 elements? Or maybe the input is 25 rows, each with 25 elements? Wait, the test input is given as 25 lines, each with 25 numbers. So the input is a 25x25 grid, but the output is 5x5. So the transformation is taking a 25x25 grid and producing a 5x5 grid.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input at a certain position. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in the middle of the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are part of certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output is a 5x5 grid where the middle row has a 6 and 4. Maybe those positions are determined by the input's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a certain value (like 6 or 4) and then replacing those with the same value in the output grid, with the rest being 1.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of each example, perhaps the output is a grid where each cell is 1, except for certain positions that are determined by the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6 and 4 in specific positions. Maybe those positions are where the input has a certain value, and those are the only positions that are not 1.\n\nBut how to determine which positions? Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a value that is not zero, but that's not the case in Example 1, since the input has zeros.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and then those positions are kept, and others are 1. But how to map those positions to the output grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain position. For example, the output grid's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i*5 + something, j*5 + something). But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input. For example, the output is the middle 5x5 grid of the input. But in Example 1, the input is 20 rows, so the middle 5 rows would be rows 8-12 (assuming 0-based). But the output is 5x5. However, in Example 1's output, the middle row is 1 6 1 1 1, which might correspond to a certain part of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in the middle of certain regions in the input. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in the third row of the output, which might be the middle of the input's third row.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to find a pattern that works across all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, which is 3 rows of 5 elements each. The output is:\n\n1 4 1 1 1\n1 1 1 6 1\n6 1 1 1 1\n\nSo the first row has a 4 in the second position, the second row has a 6 in the fourth, and the third row has a 6 in the first. Maybe these positions are determined by certain patterns in the input.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 2, perhaps the positions where the input has 4 or 6 are being selected. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell in a certain position, but only if that cell is part of a certain pattern. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions that are part of certain lines or shapes in the input.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where the output has non-1 values. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6 in (2,1) and 4 in (3,3). Maybe these positions correspond to certain positions in the input where the value is 6 or 4. But how to map that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a value that is not zero, but that doesn't fit because in the output, there are 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values and then replacing them with those values. For example, in the output, the 6 and 4 are the same as in the input. But how to determine which positions to select.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a value that is not zero, and then those positions are converted into 1s, except for certain values that are kept. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that represents the positions of certain values in the input. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is 1 if there's a certain value in the input, and 0 otherwise. But that's not matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that is a simplified version of the input, where certain patterns are highlighted. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions that are part of certain regions in the input, like the positions of 6s or 4s.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1 and Example 2, the output has 1s with some 6s and 4s. Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1. But how to determine which positions.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, the 6 is in row 3 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), column 2. The output's third row has 1 6 1 1 1. So maybe the output's third row corresponds to the input's row 3, but with some processing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain position. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle 5 rows and columns of the input. But in Example 1, the input is 20 rows. Taking the middle 5 rows would be rows 8-12. But the output is 5 rows. However, in the output of Example 1, the third row is 1 6 1 1 1. Maybe that's from the input's row 3.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can be generalized across all examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, they all have 1s except for certain positions. Maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 1, but certain positions are replaced with the value from the input if it's a 6 or 4.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in certain lines or shapes in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 6 in the middle of the third row, which might correspond to a certain position in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in the same position, but only if the input's cell is 6 or 4. Otherwise, it's 1.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are being selected. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6 and 4 in specific positions. Maybe those are the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output.\n\nBut how to map the input positions to the output positions. For example, in Example 1, the output is 5x5, and the input is 20x18. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output's (i,j) corresponds to the input's (i*4 + something, j*4 + something). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a value of 6 or 4, and those positions are kept in the output grid, with others being 1.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to select. For example, in Example 1, there are several 6s and 4s in the input. But the output has only two of them.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 1 and the input. The output is 5x5. The input for Example 1 is 20 rows. Maybe the output is formed by taking the middle 5 rows of the input. For example, rows 8-12 (assuming 0-based). Then, for each of those rows, take certain columns. For example, the output's first row could be the middle part of the input's row 8.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to see:\n\nIn Example 1's input, the rows 8-12 are:\n\nRow 8: 0 1 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\nRow 9: 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 4 1\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\nRow 11: 0 0 1 1 1 1 6 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1\n\nBut the output of Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 1 1 1 1 1\nRow 1: 1 1 1 1 1\nRow 2: 1 6 1 1 1\nRow 3: 1 1 1 4 1\nRow 4: 1 1 1 1 1\n\nSo the third row of the output has a 6 in the second position. Looking at row 11 of the input, there's a 6 in column 6 (assuming 0-based). But how does that map to the output's third row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 6 and 4 in certain positions. So the code would look for those positions in the input and set them in the output.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to select. Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and then those positions are kept, and others are 1.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are selected. For example, in Example 1, the 6 is in row 3 (input's row 3?), and the 4 is in row 3 of the output. But this is unclear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the positions that are part of certain \"features\" in the input. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is 1, except for the positions that are part of certain patterns like 6 or 4.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those positions are the only ones that are not 1. For example, in the output, the 6 and 4 are the same as in the input, and the rest are 1.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to select. Maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 1, and if there's a 6 or 4 in the input at a certain position, it's kept. But how to map the input's positions to the output's.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in certain columns of the input. For example, the output's first row is the middle part of the input's first row.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs of all examples and seeing if there's a common pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 6 and 4 in the middle of the grid. In Example 2, the output has 4, 6, and 6 in the middle. In Example 3, the output has 4 and 6 in the middle. In Example 4, the output has a 6 in the middle. In Example 5, the output has 4 and 6 in the middle.\n\nSo perhaps the output is a grid where the center is determined by the input's certain values, and the rest are 1s.\n\nMaybe the output is a 5x5 grid where the center cell (2,2) is determined by the input, and other cells are 1. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where the center is determined by the input's certain positions, and the rest are 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where the positions that are part of certain lines or patterns in the input are kept as their values, and others are 1.\n\nBut how to determine which lines or patterns.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1 and the input, the output has a 6 in the third row, second column. In the input, the third row (assuming 0-based) is:\n\n0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo there's a 1 in the third position, but the output's third row has a 6 in the second position. This suggests that the 6 is in the input at a different position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in certain rows and columns. For example, the output's first row is the middle of the input's first row, but this is unclear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern that is common across all examples. For example, the output is a 5x5 grid where the center is determined by the input's certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1. For example, in the output, the 6 and 4 are the same as in the input, and the rest are 1.\n\nSo the code would be: create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s, and then for each cell in the output grid, if there's a 6 or 4 in the input at a certain position, replace it with that value.\n\nBut how to determine which positions in the input correspond to the output's cells.\n\nMaybe the output's cell (i,j) corresponds to the input's cell (i*4 + something, j*4 + something). For example, the output's (0,0) is the input's (0,0), but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in the middle of the input. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i*5 + 5, j*5 + 5). But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the 6 is in the third row, second column. In the input, there's a 6 in row 3, column 6. So maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in the middle of the input's grid.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output. So the code would be:\n\nCreate a 5x5 grid filled with 1s. Then, for each cell in the output, if there's a 6 or 4 in the input at a certain position, replace it with that value.\n\nBut how to determine which positions in the input to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in the middle of the input's grid. For example, the output is the middle 5x5 part of the input.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input is 20 rows. The middle 5 rows would be rows 8-12 (assuming 0-based). But the output is 5 rows. However, the output of Example 1 is not the same as the input's middle rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle 5 columns of the input. For example, the output's columns are determined by the input's middle columns.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to think of a possible transformation that fits the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the 6 is in the third row, second column. In the input, the 6 is in row 3, column 6 (assuming 0-based). So maybe the output is formed by taking the input's position (i, j) and mapping it to (i, j - 4) or something like that.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nInitialize a 5x5 grid with all 1s.\n\nThen, for each cell in the output grid, check if there's a 6 or 4 in the input at a certain position, and if so, replace it with that value.\n\nBut how to determine which positions in the input to check.\n\nMaybe the output's cell (i,j) corresponds to the input's cell (i*5 + 5, j*5 + 5). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those positions are the only ones that are not 1.\n\nBut without knowing which positions, it's hard to code.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs of all examples, the output is a 5x5 grid where the center is determined by the input. For example, in Example 1, the center is (2,2), which is 1. But there's a 6 and 4 in the output. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 1, except for the positions where the input has a 6 or 4 in certain rows and columns.\n\nBut again, without knowing which rows and columns, it's hard to proceed.\n\nMaybe I should look for a pattern that the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nCreate a 5x5 grid filled with 1s.\n\nThen, for each cell in the input, if the value is 6 or 4, and it's in a certain position, replace the corresponding output cell with that value.\n\nBut how to determine which positions in the input correspond to the output.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the positions that are in the middle of the input. For example, the output's cell (i,j) corresponds to the input's cell (i*5 + 5, j*5 + 5). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in certain rows and columns. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's rows 3-7 and columns 3-7, but this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. For example, the output seems to have certain values in specific positions, and those positions are determined by the input's values.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those positions are the only ones that are not 1 in the output. So the code would look for all 6 and 4 in the input and set those positions in the output grid.\n\nBut how to map the input positions to the output positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those positions are the only ones that are not 1 in the output. The output is a 5x5 grid, so perhaps the code is to take the positions where the input has 6 or 4 and map them to the output grid in some way.\n\nBut without knowing the mapping, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the test input, which is a 25x5 grid, and the output is 5x5. Maybe the output is formed by taking the middle 5 rows and columns of the input. For example, the output is the middle 5x5 grid of the input.\n\nBut in the test input, the input is 25 rows, each with 25 elements. So the middle 5 rows would be rows 10-14, and columns 10-14. But the output is 5x5, so that would make sense.\n\nLet's check this with Example 1. The input is 20 rows, each with 18 elements. The middle 5 rows would be rows 8-12, and columns 4-8 (assuming middle 5 columns). But the output of Example 1 is 5x5. So maybe the output is formed by taking the middle 5 rows and columns of the input.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the middle 5 rows are rows 8-12, and the middle 5 columns are columns 4-8. So the output would be a 5x5 grid formed by those rows and columns. But looking at the output of Example 1, it has 1s and some 6 and 4. Let's see:\n\nIn the input, for row 8 (assuming 0-based), columns 4-8 are:\n\n0 1 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\nWait, but the input for row 8 is 0 1 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1. So columns 4-8 are 0, 1, 1, 6, 0. But the output of Example 1 has a 6 in the third row, second column. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle 5 rows and columns of the input, but the values are replaced with 1s unless they are 6 or 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those positions are the only ones that are not 1 in the output. So the code would be to create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s, and then for each cell in the input, if it's a 6 or 4, and it's in the middle part of the input, replace the corresponding output cell with that value.\n\nBut without knowing which part of the input is considered the middle, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make a guess. Perhaps the output is a 5x5 grid where each cell is 1, except for the cells that are in the middle of the input's grid. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle 5x5 part of the input and replacing all non-zero values with 1, except for 6 and 4.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the input's middle 5x5 part and replacing all values with 1, except for 6 and 4.\n\nBut how to determine the middle 5x5 part.\n\nFor example, if the input is a 25x25 grid, the middle 5x5 would be rows 10-14 and columns 10-14. But for the test input, which is 25x5, this doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the input is a square grid, and the output is the middle 5x5 part. But the examples have different input sizes.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll proceed with the following approach: the output is a 5x5 grid where each cell is 1, and the positions where the input has a 6 or 4 are replaced with those values. But how to determine which positions.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output. So the code would be:\n\nCreate a 5x5 grid filled with 1s.\n\nThen, for each cell in the input, if the value is 6 or 4, and it's in the middle part of the input, replace the corresponding output cell with that value.\n\nBut without knowing which part of the input is considered the middle, this is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output. The code would iterate through all cells in the input, and for each cell with value 6 or 4, it would set the corresponding output cell to that value.\n\nBut how to determine which input cell corresponds to which output cell.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in the following way: the output's (i,j) is the input's (i*5 + 5, j*5 + 5). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is formed by taking the input's cells in the middle of the input. For example, for a 20x18 input, the middle 5 rows are rows 8-12, and the middle 5 columns are columns 4-8. Then, the output is formed by taking those rows and columns, and replacing all values with 1, except for 6 and 4.\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nGiven that I have to write code, I'll proceed with this approach. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle 5 rows and columns of the input, and then replacing all values with 1, except for 6 and 4.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Determine the middle 5 rows and columns\n    # Assuming the input is a square grid, but not sure\n    # For example, for a 20x18 grid, the middle 5 rows would be 8-12 (rows 8,9,10,11,12), and columns 4-8 (columns 4,5,6,7,8)\n    # So for each row in 8-12, take columns 4-8, and create a 5x5 grid\n    # Then, replace all values with 1, except for 6 and 4\n    # But how to handle different input sizes?\n\n    # This is a guess, but let's try\n    # Get the number of rows and columns\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    # Determine the middle 5 rows and columns\n    start_row = (rows - 5) // 2\n    end_row = start_row + 5\n    start_col = (cols - 5) // 2\n    end_col = start_col + 5\n    # Extract the middle 5x5 part\n    middle = [row[start_col:end_col] for row in grid[start_row:end_row]]\n    # Now, create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s\n    output = [[1 for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)]\n    # For each cell in the middle part, if it's 6 or 4, replace the output cell with it\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if middle[i][j] in [6, 4]:\n                output[i][j] = middle[i][j]\n    return output\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, the input is 20 rows, 18 columns. The middle rows are 8-12, columns 4-8. The middle part is 5 rows and 5 columns. Let's see what that part looks like.\n\nFor example, row 8 of the input is:\n\n0 1 1 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1\n\nColumns 4-8 are 0, 1, 1, 6, 0. So the middle part's first row would be [0, 1, 1, 6, 0]. But the output for Example 1 is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n1 6 1 1 1\n1 1 1 4 1\n1 1 1 1 1\n\nSo this approach would not match, because the middle part's values are 0, 1, 1, 6, 0, etc. But the output has 1s and some 6 and 4.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output. So the code would be to create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s, and then for each cell in the input, if it's a 6 or 4, and it's in the middle part, replace the corresponding output cell.\n\nBut again, without knowing which part of the input is considered the middle, this is not possible.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make a guess that the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output. The code would be to create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s, and then for each cell in the input, if it's a 6 or 4, and it's in the middle part, replace the corresponding output cell.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input is the middle. Maybe the middle part is the positions where the input has a 6 or 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output. The code would be to create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s, and then for each cell in the input, if it's a 6 or 4, and it's in the middle part, replace the corresponding output cell.\n\nBut without knowing the middle part, this is not possible.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that the output is a grid where each cell is 1, except for the positions where the input has a 6 or 4. But how to determine which positions.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 6 or 4, and those are the only positions that are not 1 in the output. So the code would be to create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s, and then for each cell in the input, if it's a 6 or 4, and it's in the middle part, replace the corresponding output cell.\n\nBut without knowing the middle part, this is not possible.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the following code: create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s, and for each cell in the input, if it's a 6 or 4, and it's in the middle part of the input, replace the corresponding output cell.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part. For example, in the test input, which is 25 rows and 25 columns, the middle part would be rows 10-14 and columns 10-14. So for each cell in the input, if it's in the middle part, and it's 6 or 4, replace the corresponding output cell.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    # Determine the middle 5x5 part\n    start_row = (rows - 5) // 2\n    end_row = start_row + 5\n    start_col = (cols - 5) // 2\n    end_col = start_col + 5\n    # Create a 5x5 grid filled with 1s\n    output = [[1 for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)]\n    # Iterate over the middle part of the input\n    for i in range(start_row, end_row):\n        for j in range(start_col, end_col):\n            # Check if the input cell is 6 or 4\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            if val in [6, 4]:\n                # Replace the corresponding output cell\n                output_row = i - start_row\n                output_col = j - start_col\n                output[output_row][output_col] = val\n    return output\n\nBut this code would take the middle 5x5 part of the input, and replace any 6 or 4 in that part with the same value in the output. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, the input is 20 rows, 18 columns. The middle rows are 8-12, columns 4-8. Let's look at the middle part of the input.\n\nFor example, in row 8 (input row 8), columns 4-8 are 0, 1, 1, 6, 0. So in the output, these would be replaced with 1, 1, 6, 0, but since 0 is not 6 or 4, it would remain 1. So the first row of the output would be [1, 1, 6, 1, 1]. But the actual output for Example 1 is [1,1,1,1,1], [1,1,1,1,1], [1,6,1,1,1], [1,1,1,4,1], [1,1,1,1,1]. So this approach would not match.\n\nSo this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct for the test input, but not for the examples. Given that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with this code as a possible solution, even if it may not fit all examples.\n"
