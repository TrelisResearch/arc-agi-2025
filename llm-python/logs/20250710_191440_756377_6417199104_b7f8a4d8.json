          "Based on the visual analysis of the training examples, here's the transformation pattern:\n\n## Observations\n\n- All grids are 23\u00d728.\n- The grids consist of repeated 5\u00d75 blocks, separated by 1-column/row black (0) lines.\n- Each 5\u00d75 block has a colored outer border and colored center.\n- In every output, black (0) lines crossing between the blocks are potentially replaced with a new color, forming a \"circuit\" or frame linking blocks.\n- **The color used for the frame/circuit is the color of the innermost color (center) of the central (middle) block** in the grid.\n    - For example, Example 1: the middle 5\u00d75 block (center cell is at (11, 13)) is color 3, and the frame in the output is drawn in color 3.\n- The frame is drawn along the black \"spines\" between blocks, forming a rectangle tightly enclosing the central block, matching the black spacing between blocks.\n- Additionally, in some examples, small squares (2\u00d72) or single squares are drawn at the corners where the frame turns or continues, matching the central color, but not always.\n\n## Algorithm/Pseudocode\n\n1. **Copy input grid as basis for output.**\n2. **Identify 5\u00d75 blocks** and their spacings:\n   - Blocks start at index 1 and repeat every 6\n   - Block size: 5\n   - Spacing: 1\n3. **Find coordinates of the central block**.\n   - There are usually 4 rows of blocks vertically and horizontally (check the actual placement to compute).\n   - The middle block is at (row_block_idx, col_block_idx) = (#blocks // 2, #blocks // 2)\n4. **Determine center color** (the value at the center cell of the central 5\u00d75 block).\n5. **Draw a rectangular frame IN the 0 \"spines\" around the center block, using this color:**\n   - The top/left of the frame starts at the 0-lane to the \"above-left\" of the central block, and bottom/right to the opposing side.\n   - The thickness of the frame is 1 pixel.\n6. **Output must remain 23\u00d728.**\n\nLet's implement this logic.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    out = grid.copy()\n\n    ROWS, COLS = out.shape\n    # Step 1: Find all valid 5x5 blocks (they all start on rows/cols 1+6k)\n    block_size = 5\n    gap = 1\n\n    # Find all start indices for blocks\n    block_rows = []\n    r = 1\n    while r + block_size <= ROWS:\n        block_rows.append(r)\n        r += block_size + gap\n    block_cols = []\n    c = 1\n    while c + block_size <= COLS:\n        block_cols.append(c)\n        c += block_size + gap\n        \n    # Step 2: Find central block\n    n_rows = len(block_rows)\n    n_cols = len(block_cols)\n    row_idx = n_rows // 2\n    col_idx = n_cols // 2\n    center_block_r = block_rows[row_idx]\n    center_block_c = block_cols[col_idx]\n\n    # Step 3: Get the block center color\n    center_color = grid[center_block_r + 2, center_block_c + 2]\n    \n    # Step 4: Draw a frame of 1-thickness on the 0 lanes surrounding the central block, spanning\n    # between the black \"spines\" from (uppermost, leftmost) to (bottommost, rightmost) 0-corridors\n    # The outer frame includes the black lanes at indices immediately before and after the central block\n    # The outline intersects all blocks of the same \"generation\" as the central block\n    \n    # To generalize, find the black vertical lane left of center block and right of center block\n    left_lane_col = center_block_c - gap\n    right_lane_col = center_block_c + block_size\n    # Same for rows\n    top_lane_row = center_block_r - gap\n    bottom_lane_row = center_block_r + block_size\n\n    # The frame is drawn along the entire 0-corridor, but *usually* is an outline/rectangle\n    # spanning several blocks.

examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"
