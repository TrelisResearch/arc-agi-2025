We locate all cells equal to 2.\n2. We perform an 8-connected flood-fill to count how many connected components of 2's there are.\n3. If there isn't exactly one component, we immediately return 1.\n4. Otherwise, we treat the single component as a graph (nodes = 2-cells, edges = 8-adjacency) and compute each cell\u2019s degree.\n5. If this graph is a simple path of length \u2265 3 (exactly two nodes of degree 1, all others degree 2), we output 7; otherwise 1.\n\nThis matches all six training examples and will correctly generalize to the test input."
