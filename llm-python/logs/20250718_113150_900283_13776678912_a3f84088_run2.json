The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with a different value (5 \u2192 2 or 5 \u2192 2 in some cases)\n2. There's a pattern where the middle column (or columns) are modified in a specific way\n3. The transformation appears to be a form of \"erosion\" or \"dilation\" operation, where certain values are replaced based on their neighbors\n4. The transformation seems to be more complex than simple value substitution, involving spatial relationships\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values based on their neighbors and positions.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the transformation logic\n    # Replace 5 with 2 in certain positions based on patterns observed\n    # This is a simplified version that captures the observed patterns\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 5:\n                # Check if it's in the middle rows and columns\n                if i > 1 and i < 11 and j > 1 and j < 11:\n                    # Check if it's in a position that should be replaced\n                    if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                    elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",

The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with a different value (5 \u2192 2 or 5 \u2192 2 in some cases)\n2. There's a pattern where the middle column (or columns) are modified in a specific way\n3. The transformation appears to be a form of \"erosion\" or \"dilation\" operation, where certain values are replaced based on their neighbors\n4. The transformation seems to be more complex than simple value substitution, involving spatial relationships\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values based on their neighbors and positions.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the transformation logic\n    # Replace 5 with 2 in certain positions based on patterns observed\n    # This is a simplified version that captures the observed patterns\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 5:\n                # Check if it's in the middle rows and columns\n                if i > 1 and i < 11 and j > 1 and j < 11:\n                    # Check if it's in a position that should be replaced\n                    if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                    elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
