          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. There seems to be a transformation where certain values (like 2 and 8) are expanded or replaced with sequences of 2s.\n2. Values like 3 and 4 appear to be \"seed\" values that trigger some kind of expansion or propagation of 2s around them.\n3. The output grid always has a specific structure with 21 rows and 25 columns, suggesting that the transformation might involve padding or specific placement rules.\n4. There's a pattern where certain values (like 2) are expanded into blocks of 2s, and other values (like 8) are placed in specific positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves expanding certain values into blocks of 2s, propagating values from certain seed points, and maintaining a specific grid structure.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(25)] for _ in range(21)]\n    \n    # Copy the input grid to the output grid\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Expand 2s into blocks of 2s\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Expand to a 3x3 block\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        if 0 <= i + di < 21 and 0 <= j + dj < 25:\n                            transformed_grid[i + di][j + dj] = 2\n    \n    # Expand 8s into blocks of 2s\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Expand to a 3x3 block\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        if 0 <= i + di < 21 and 0 <= j + dj < 25:\n                            transformed_grid[i + di][j + dj] = 2\n    \n    # Expand 3s into blocks of 2s\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Expand to a 3x3 block\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        if 0 <= i + di < 21 and 0 <= j + dj < 25:\n                            transformed_grid[i + di][j + dj] = 2\n    \n    # Expand 4s into blocks of 2s\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Expand to a 3x3 block\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        if 0 <= i + di < 21 and 0 <= j + dj < 25:\n                            transformed_grid[i + di][j + dj] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. There seems to be a transformation where certain values (like 2 and 8) are expanded or replaced with sequences of 2s.\n2. Values like 3 and 4 appear to be \"seed\" values that trigger some kind of expansion or propagation of 2s around them.\n3. The output grid always has a specific structure with 21 rows and 25 columns, suggesting that the transformation might involve padding or specific placement rules.\n4. There's a pattern where certain values (like 2) are expanded into blocks of 2s, and other values (like 8) are placed in specific positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves expanding certain values into blocks of 2s, propagating values from certain seed points, and maintaining a specific grid structure.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(25)] for _ in range(21)]\n    \n    # Copy the input grid to the output grid\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Expand 2s into blocks of 2s\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Expand to a 3x3 block\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        if 0 <= i + di < 21 and 0 <= j + dj < 25:\n                            transformed_grid[i + di][j + dj] = 2\n    \n    # Expand 8s into blocks of 2s\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Expand to a 3x3 block\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        if 0 <= i + di < 21 and 0 <= j + dj < 25:\n                            transformed_grid[i + di][j + dj] = 2\n    \n    # Expand 3s into blocks of 2s\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Expand to a 3x3 block\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        if 0 <= i + di < 21 and 0 <= j + dj < 25:\n                            transformed_grid[i + di][j + dj] = 2\n    \n    # Expand 4s into blocks of 2s\n    for i in range(21):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Expand to a 3x3 block\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        if 0 <= i + di < 21 and 0 <= j + dj < 25:\n                            transformed_grid[i + di][j + dj] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
