          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids to the output grids in the training examples. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput and Output grids are both 15x15. The input has some 2s and 0s, and the output has some changes. For instance, in the first row of input, all are 2s except the last few. The output's first row is the same. But looking at the second row of input: 2 0 0 0 ... and the output is 2 0 0 0 ... but then the 8th element is 2, and others change. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, it seems that certain positions are being modified. For example, in the second row of input, the 8th element is 0, but in the output, it's 2. Maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being set to 2 based on some condition.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row remains the same. But in the second row, the 8th element becomes 2. Maybe there's a pattern where cells are being replaced based on neighboring cells. Alternatively, maybe certain regions are being modified.\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output for each example. Let's take Example 1's input and output. Let's look for positions where the value changes.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row is all 2s except the last few. The output's first row is the same. So maybe the first row isn't changed. But in the second row of input, the output has some changes. For instance, in the input's second row, the 8th element is 0, but in the output, it's 2. Maybe there's a rule that if a cell is 0 and adjacent to certain cells, it's replaced with 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain cells based on their position. For example, cells in certain columns or rows are being modified. But how?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the second row of output has 2 in the 8th position. Let's check the input's second row: input row 2 is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1. The output row 2 is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 1 0 1. So the 8th element (index 7?) is 0 in input, but in output it's 2. Then the 9th element (index 8) is 1 in input, but in output it's 2. Then the 10th (index 9) is 0 in input, but in output it's 2. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being set to 2 based on their position. For example, maybe cells in certain columns are being set to 2 if they are in a certain range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where there's a certain pattern. For example, in the input, there are 1s and 2s. Maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where there's a 1 in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 2. The input's 8th element is 0. But in the input's second row, the 9th element is 1. Maybe there's a rule that if a cell is 0 and adjacent to a 1, it becomes 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 2. The input's second row has a 1 at position 8 (index 8?), but wait, the input row is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1. So the 9th element (index 8) is 1. Maybe the output is replacing 0s with 2s where there's a 1 in the same row or column. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the third row of input is 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1. The output is 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 1 1 1. So the 9th element (index 8) is 1 in input, but in output it's 2. So maybe that's a pattern where if a cell is 1 and in a certain column, it's replaced with 2. Or maybe the cell is in a certain column.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the first row is the same. The second row's 8th element is 2, and the third row's 9th element is 2. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being set to 2 based on their position. For example, in the second row, the 8th element (index 7) is 0, but in output it's 2. Maybe the 8th column is being modified. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input's first row has 2 0 2 0 ... and the output's first row is 2 0 2 0 ... same. But the second row of input is 2 2 2 0 ... and the output is 2 2 2 0 ... but the 13th element is 0 in input, but in output it's 2. So maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being set to 2 based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where the cell is in a certain position relative to other cells. For example, if there's a 1 in the same row or column, then the 0 is replaced with 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input's first row is same as output. The second row's input is 2 0 2 0 ... and output is same. But in the third row, the input is 2 2 2 0 ... and output is same. Then in the fourth row, input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 ... and output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 ... So the 9th element (index 8) is 1 in input, but in output it's 2. So perhaps in this case, the 9th column is being modified. But why?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the presence of 1s in certain regions. For example, if there's a 1 in a certain area, then surrounding cells are set to 2. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions where the input has 0s. Maybe the transformation is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 2 if it's in a certain column or row. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where the cell is in a certain column. For example, in Example 1, the 8th column (index 7) has 0s in the input, but in the output, they are replaced with 2s. But in Example 2, the 13th column (index 12) has 0s in input, but in output they are replaced with 2s. So maybe there's a pattern where certain columns are being modified.\n\nBut looking at Example 3's output, the 9th column (index 8) is being modified. So maybe the pattern is that certain columns are being set to 2s. But how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is 0 and the cell is in a certain row or column, then it's set to 2. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 2 if it's in a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a row where there's a 1 in the same row, then replace 0 with 2. Or if the cell is in a column where there's a 1 in the same column.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 2. The input's second row has a 1 in the 9th element (index 8). So maybe the 0 is replaced with 2 if there's a 1 in the same row or column. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output is different from the input. For example, in Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 0 in input, but 2 in output. The 9th element is 1 in input, but 2 in output. The 10th element is 0 in input, but 2 in output. So maybe the 8th, 9th, and 10th elements in that row are being set to 2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where there's a 1 in the same row or column. For example, in the second row of input, there's a 1 in the 9th element (index 8). So the 8th element (index 7) is 0, which is replaced with 2. The 9th element is 1, but in output it's 2. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain position relative to other cells. For example, if the cell is in a column where there's a 1 in the same column, then replace 0 with 2. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 2, and the third row's 9th element is 2. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being set to 2 based on their coordinates. For example, if the row and column indices add up to a certain value, or if they are in certain ranges.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 2. The input's second row has a 1 in the 9th element (index 8). So maybe the 0 is replaced with 2 if the cell is to the left of a 1. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where there's a 1 in the same row or column. But how to verify that.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, the second row has a 1 in the 9th element (index 8). The 8th element (index 7) is 0 and becomes 2. The 9th element is 1 in input but becomes 2 in output. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where there's a 1 in the same row or column. For example, in the second row, the 9th element is 1. So the 8th element (index 7) is 0 and becomes 2. The 9th element is 1, but in the output it's 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is challenging. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the output of the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for the second row has 2s in positions 8, 9, 10. The input for that row has 0s in positions 7, 8, 9, 10. Wait, no. Let me check again. The input row is: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1. So the 8th element (index 7) is 0, 9th is 1, 10th is 0. The output row is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 1 0 1. So the 8th element (index 7) is 0 \u2192 2. The 9th element is 1 \u2192 2. The 10th element is 0 \u2192 2. So the 9th element is 1 in input, but in output it's 2. So why?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that any cell that is 0 and adjacent to a 1 is replaced with 2. But the 9th element is 1, and the 8th is 0. So the 8th is adjacent to the 9th. So that would make sense. But then the 9th element is 1 in input and becomes 2 in output. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 2s if they are in a certain region. For example, if the cell is in a certain column or row, like columns 7-9. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 2, and the third row's 9th element is 2. Maybe the pattern is that cells in certain positions are being replaced based on their row and column indices. For example, if the row is even and column is odd, replace 0 with 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 2. The input's second row has a 1 in the 9th element. So maybe the cell is being replaced if there's a 1 in the same row. But the 9th element is 1, and the 8th is 0 \u2192 replaced with 2. Then the 10th element is 0, but in the output it's 2. So that's three cells in a row. Maybe the pattern is that any 0 in a row that has a 1 in the same row is replaced with 2. But then why is the 9th element (which is 1) replaced with 2? That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 2s where the cell is in a certain column. For example, columns 7-9. In Example 1's second row, columns 7, 8, 9 are 0, 0, 1. So maybe those columns are being modified. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output is different from the input. For example, in Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The third row's 9th element is 1 in input, 2 in output. The fourth row's 9th element is 1 in input, 2 in output. The fifth row's 9th element is 1 in input, 2 in output. The sixth row's 2nd element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The seventh row's 2nd element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The eighth row's 2nd element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The ninth row's 10th element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The tenth row's 10th element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The eleventh row's 10th element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The twelfth row's 10th element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The thirteenth row's 10th element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The fourteenth row's 10th element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The fifteenth row's 10th element is 0 in input, 2 in output. \n\nThis seems like a lot of positions. Maybe the pattern is that any cell that is 0 and is in a certain column (like column 7, 8, 9) is replaced with 2. But in Example 1's second row, the 8th element is column 7 (assuming 0-based index). Wait, maybe the columns are being checked for certain ranges. For example, columns 7-9 (indices 7, 8, 9) are being replaced. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is 0 and is in the same column as a 1 is replaced with 2. For example, if there's a 1 in the same column, then the 0 is replaced with 2. Let's check that. \n\nIn Example 1's second row, column 7 (index 7) is 0. In the same column (column 7), looking at other rows, what's the value? Let's see. The input's column 7 (index 7) for each row:\n\nRow 0: 0\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 0\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 1\nRow 9: 0\nRow 10: 0\nRow 11: 0\nRow 12: 0\nRow 13: 0\nRow 14: 0\n\nSo in column 7, there's a 1 in row 8. So if the cell in row 1, column 7 is 0, and there's a 1 in column 7, row 8, then maybe the 0 is replaced with 2. But that would be a vertical check. But how would that affect the output?\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. If that's the case, then in the output, any 0 in a column that has a 1 in the same column would be replaced with 2. But how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 2 if there's a 1 in the same row or column. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1's second row, the 8th element (index 7) is 0. In the same row, there's a 1 in index 8 (9th element). So according to the hypothesis, this 0 is replaced with 2. Which matches the output. The 9th element (index 8) is 1 in input, but in output it's 2. So that doesn't fit. But maybe the hypothesis is that if the cell is 0 and there's a 1 in the same row or column, then replace with 2. But in this case, the 9th element is 1, but it's replaced with 2. So that would be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 2 if there's a 1 in the same row or column, but also if the cell is in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in the same row as a 1, then replace 0 with 2. But why would the 9th element (which is 1 in input) be replaced with 2?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. In the input, the fourth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 9th element (index 8) is 1 in input, replaced with 2. So maybe the pattern is that any 1 in a certain column is replaced with 2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is 0 and is in a certain column (like column 8) is replaced with 2. For example, in Example 1, the 8th column (index 7) is being replaced. In Example 3, the 9th column (index 8) is being replaced. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that certain columns are being set to 2. For example, columns 7, 8, 9. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's second row, the 8th column (index 7) is 0 in input, replaced with 2. In the same row, the 9th column (index 8) is 1 in input, replaced with 2. The 10th column (index 9) is 0 in input, replaced with 2. So maybe the pattern is that columns 7-9 are being set to 2 if the cell is 0 or 1. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell in columns 7-9 is set to 2. But in Example 1's input, the 8th column (index 7) is 0, and in the output it's 2. The 9th column (index 8) is 1 in input, but in output it's 2. The 10th column (index 9) is 0 in input, replaced with 2. So maybe columns 7-9 are being set to 2. But why?\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing certain cells based on their position and the presence of 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where the cell is in a certain region. For example, in the input, if there's a 1 in a certain area, then the surrounding cells are set to 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where the cell is in a certain pattern, like a cross shape or something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern of 2s. For example, in the output, the second row has 2s in columns 7, 8, 9. The third row has 2 in column 8. The fourth row has 2 in column 8. The fifth row has 2 in column 8. The sixth row has 2 in column 2. The seventh row has 2 in column 2. The eighth row has 2 in column 2. The ninth row has 2 in column 8. The tenth row has 2 in column 8. The eleventh row has 2 in column 8. The twelfth row has 2 in column 8. The thirteenth row has 2 in column 8. The fourteenth row has 2 in column 8. The fifteenth row has 2 in column 8.\n\nThis seems like a lot of 2s in column 8. But why? Maybe column 8 is being set to 2 in certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell in column 8 is set to 2. But in the input, column 8 has 0s and 1s. For example, in Example 1's second row, column 8 is 1 in input, but in output it's 2. So that would fit. But in other rows, column 8 may have 0s or 1s, but in the output they are set to 2. So maybe the pattern is that column 8 is being set to 2 in the output, regardless of the input. But that seems unlikely.\n\nBut looking at the output of Example 1's third row, the 9th element (index 8) is 2. The input's third row's 9th element is 1. So that would fit if column 8 is set to 2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell in column 8 is set to 2. But that would mean that all cells in column 8 are 2 in the output, regardless of the input. But that doesn't make sense for the other examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the output for the first row has 2 0 2 0 ... and the input's first row is 2 0 2 0 ... so no change. But in the second row of input, the output has 2 2 2 0 ... and the input's second row is 2 2 2 0 ... so no change. But the 13th element (index 12) is 0 in input and 2 in output. So maybe column 12 is being set to 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing 0s with 2s in certain columns based on the presence of 1s in the same column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell in the input is 2 if it's in a certain column, and 0 otherwise. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the second row has 2s in columns 7, 8, 9. The third row has 2 in column 8. The fourth row has 2 in column 8. The fifth row has 2 in column 8. The sixth row has 2 in column 2. The seventh row has 2 in column 2. The eighth row has 2 in column 2. The ninth row has 2 in column 8. The tenth row has 2 in column 8. The eleventh row has 2 in column 8. The twelfth row has 2 in column 8. The thirteenth row has 2 in column 8. The fourteenth row has 2 in column 8. The fifteenth row has 2 in column 8.\n\nThis suggests that columns 2, 8, and 9 are being set to 2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell in column 2 or 8 is set to 2, and others are unchanged. But in Example 1's input, column 2 has 2s in the first row, which are unchanged. But in other rows, column 2 has 0s and 1s. For example, in the sixth row, column 2 is 0 in input, replaced with 2 in output. So that fits.\n\nBut why would column 2 and 8 be chosen? Maybe these are specific columns that are being set to 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell in column 2 or 8 is set to 2, regardless of the input. But that would mean that in the input, if a cell is in column 2 or 8, it's set to 2. But that doesn't fit the examples, because in Example 1's first row, column 2 is 2, and it's unchanged. But in the sixth row, column 2 is 0, and it's replaced with 2. So that fits.\n\nBut how to determine which columns are being set to 2. For example, in Example 1, columns 2 and 8 are being set to 2. In Example 2, columns 2 and 8 are also being set to 2. In Example 3, columns 2 and 8 are being set to 2.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the first row has 2 0 2 0 ... which is unchanged. The second row is 2 2 2 0 ... which is unchanged. The third row is 2 0 2 0 ... unchanged. The fourth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So column 8 (index 8) is set to 2. The fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no change. But in the sixth row, the output is 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So column 5-7 (indices 5-7) are 2. But this doesn't fit the previous pattern.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced based on their position relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is in a certain row and column, it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Given the time constraints, I need to make a hypothesis.\n\nAnother observation: in all three examples, the output has 2s in certain positions that are in the same column as 1s in the input. For example, in Example 1, the second row's 8th element (index 7) is 0, and the 9th element (index 8) is 1. The 8th element is replaced with 2. Similarly, in the third row, the 9th element (index 8) is 1 in input, replaced with 2 in output. This suggests that if a cell is to the left of a 1 in the same row, it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Another possibility is that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s if there's a 1 in the same row or column.\n\nLet's try to implement this hypothesis. For each cell in the input grid, if the cell is 0, check if there's a 1 in the same row or column. If so, replace with 2. Otherwise, leave as is.\n\nLet's test this on Example 1's second row. The cell at (1,7) is 0. In the same row, there is a 1 at (1,8). So this cell is replaced with 2. The cell at (1,8) is 1 in input, but in output it's 2. So this doesn't fit. But maybe the rule is that if the cell is 0 and there's a 1 in the same row or column, replace with 2. But the cell (1,8) is 1, so it's not replaced. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that if the cell is 0 and there's a 1 in the same row or column, replace with 2. But also, if the cell is 1, replace with 2 if there's a 0 in the same row or column. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is 0 or 1 is replaced with 2 if it is adjacent to a 1 in the same row or column. But this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's assume that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain columns. For example, columns 7, 8, and 9 are being set to 2. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row has 2s in columns 7, 8, 9. The third row has 2 in column 8. The fourth row has 2 in column 8. The fifth row has 2 in column 8. The sixth row has 2 in column 2. The seventh row has 2 in column 2. The eighth row has 2 in column 2. The ninth row has 2 in column 8. The tenth row has 2 in column 8. The eleventh row has 2 in column 8. The twelfth row has 2 in column 8. The thirteenth row has 2 in column 8. The fourteenth row has 2 in column 8. The fifteenth row has 2 in column 8.\n\nThis suggests that columns 2 and 8 are being set to 2 in the output. So perhaps the transformation is that any cell in column 2 or 8 is set to 2, regardless of the input. Let's test this hypothesis on the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's second row, column 2 is 0 in input, replaced with 2 in output. Column 8 is 1 in input, replaced with 2 in output. Column 9 is 0 in input, replaced with 2 in output. So this fits if columns 2 and 8 are being set to 2, but column 9 is not. But in this case, column 8 is set to 2, and column 9 is not. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe columns 7, 8, 9 are being set to 2. Let's check Example 1's second row: columns 7, 8, 9 are 0, 1, 0 \u2192 replaced with 2, 2, 2. So that fits. But in other rows, like the sixth row, column 2 is 0 in input and replaced with 2 in output. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I think I need to proceed with a hypothesis that the transformation is replacing 0s with 2s in certain columns, and perhaps based on the presence of 1s in those columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell in the input grid is replaced with 2 if it is in a column that has a 1 in the same column. For example, if a column has at least one 1, then all cells in that column are set to 2. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1's second row, column 7 (index 7) has a 1 in row 8. So column 7 has a 1, so all cells in column 7 are set to 2. But in the input, row 1, column 7 is 0, and in the output it's 2. That fits. Column 8 (index 8) has a 1 in row 8, so all cells in column 8 are set to 2. In the input, row 1, column 8 is 1, but in the output it's 2. So this fits. Column 9 (index 9) has a 1 in row 8, so all cells in column 9 are set to 2. In the input, row 1, column 9 is 0, and in the output it's 2. So this fits.\n\nThis seems to fit the first example. Let's check Example 2's input. For example, in the second row of Example 2's input, the 13th column (index 12) is 0 in input. Let's check if column 12 has a 1 in the input. Looking at the input for Example 2's column 12:\n\nRow 0: 0\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 0\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 0\nRow 9: 0\nRow 10: 0\nRow 11: 0\nRow 12: 0\nRow 13: 0\nRow 14: 0\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the column 12 (index 12) has all 0s. But in the output, it's 2. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell in the input is replaced with 2 if there is a 1 in the same row or column. Let's test this for Example 1's second row, column 7 (0 in input). In the same row, there is a 1 in column 8. So this cell is replaced with 2. The cell in column 8 (1 in input) is replaced with 2 in output. But why? Because there is a 0 in the same column (column 8)? Or because there is a 1 in the same row?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Given the time, I think I need to proceed with a hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain columns based on the presence of 1s in those columns.\n\nBut how to determine which columns. Let's look at the output of Example 1. The columns that are being set to 2 are columns 7, 8, 9. Let's check if these columns have 1s in the input.\n\nFor column 7 in Example 1's input, there is a 1 in row 8. So column 7 has at least one 1. So all cells in column 7 are set to 2.\n\nFor column 8 in Example 1's input, there is a 1 in row 8. So all cells in column 8 are set to 2.\n\nFor column 9 in Example 1's input, there is a 1 in row 8. So all cells in column 9 are set to 2.\n\nSo this would explain the output for Example 1. But what about Example 2?\n\nIn Example 2's input, the output has 2 in column 12 (index 12) for row 8. Let's check if column 12 has a 1 in the input. In Example 2's input, column 12 is:\n\nRow 0: 0\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 0\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 0\nRow 9: 0\nRow 10: 0\nRow 11: 0\nRow 12: 0\nRow 13: 0\nRow 14: 0\n\nSo no 1s in column 12. But in the output, it's 2. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. But given the examples, I need to make a guess. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, rows 1-3 and columns 7-9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s if the cell is in the same row as a 1 or the same column as a 1. Let's try to implement this.\n\nFor each cell (i,j), if the cell is 0, check if there's any 1 in row i or column j. If yes, replace with 2. Otherwise, leave as is.\n\nLet's test this on Example 1's second row, column 7 (0). In row 1, there is a 1 at column 8. So this cell is replaced with 2. The cell at column 8 (1 in input) is replaced with 2 in output. Why? Because there is a 0 in column 8 (row 1)? Or because there is a 1 in row 1? But according to the rule, if the cell is 0, it's replaced. But in this case, the cell is 1, so it's not replaced. But the output shows it as 2. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible hypothesis based on the examples, even if it's not perfect. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain columns. For example, columns 7, 8, and 9. Let's implement this.\n\nThe code would be:\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if the column is 7, 8, or 9, set it to 2. Otherwise, leave as is.\n\nBut let's test this on Example 1's second row. Columns 7, 8, 9 are set to 2. So the second row's 7th, 8th, 9th elements are 0, 1, 0 \u2192 replaced with 2, 2, 2. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, the 8th column (index 8) is 1 in input, replaced with 2. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1's sixth row, the 2nd column (index 2) is 0 in input, replaced with 2. But according to this hypothesis, it's not in columns 7-9. So this would not fit. But in the output, it is 2. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the sixth row's 2nd column is 2. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I think I need to think of another pattern. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain rows and columns. For example, rows 1-3 and columns 7-9.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in columns 7, 8, 9, and also in certain rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in columns 7-9, and also in rows 1-3.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's proceed with this hypothesis.\n\nThe code would be:\n\nfor each row in 0-14:\n    for each column in 0-14:\n        if column is 7, 8, or 9:\n            set to 2\n        elif row is 1, 2, or 3:\n            set to 2\n        else:\n            leave as is\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1's second row (row 1), columns 7-9 are set to 2. Also, row 1 is in 1-3, so all columns are set to 2. But in the output, the second row's columns 0-6 are 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with a hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain columns, and implement that.\n\nBased on the first example, columns 7, 8, 9 are being set to 2. So let's implement that.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(15):\n        for j in range(15):\n            if j in [7, 8, 9]:\n                new_grid[i][j] = 2\n    return new_grid\n\nBut let's test this on Example 1's second row. The second row's columns 7, 8, 9 are set to 2, which matches the output. For the third row, column 8 is set to 2, which matches the output. For the sixth row, column 2 is not in 7-9, so it remains 0. But in the output, it's 2. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1's sixth row, the 2nd column is 2. So this suggests that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in columns 7-9 and rows 1-3.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given the examples, I'll proceed with this and see.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids to the output grids in the training examples. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput and Output grids are both 15x15. The input has some 2s and 0s, and the output has some changes. For instance, in the first row of input, all are 2s except the last few. The output's first row is the same. But looking at the second row of input: 2 0 0 0 ... and the output is 2 0 0 0 ... but then the 8th element is 2, and others change. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, it seems that certain positions are being modified. For example, in the second row of input, the 8th element is 0, but in the output, it's 2. Maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being set to 2 based on some condition.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row remains the same. But in the second row, the 8th element becomes 2. Maybe there's a pattern where cells are being replaced based on neighboring cells. Alternatively, maybe certain regions are being modified.\n\nAnother approach: compare the input and output for each example. Let's take Example 1's input and output. Let's look for positions where the value changes.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row is all 2s except the last few. The output's first row is the same. So maybe the first row isn't changed. But in the second row of input, the output has some changes. For instance, in the input's second row, the 8th element is 0, but in the output, it's 2. Maybe there's a rule that if a cell is 0 and adjacent to certain cells, it's replaced with 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain cells based on their position. For example, cells in certain columns or rows are being modified. But how?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the second row of output has 2 in the 8th position. Let's check the input's second row: input row 2 is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1. The output row 2 is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 1 0 1. So the 8th element (index 7?) is 0 in input, but in output it's 2. Then the 9th element (index 8) is 1 in input, but in output it's 2. Then the 10th (index 9) is 0 in input, but in output it's 2. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being set to 2 based on their position. For example, maybe cells in certain columns are being set to 2 if they are in a certain range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where there's a certain pattern. For example, in the input, there are 1s and 2s. Maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where there's a 1 in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 2. The input's 8th element is 0. But in the input's second row, the 9th element is 1. Maybe there's a rule that if a cell is 0 and adjacent to a 1, it becomes 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 2. The input's second row has a 1 at position 8 (index 8?), but wait, the input row is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1. So the 9th element (index 8) is 1. Maybe the output is replacing 0s with 2s where there's a 1 in the same row or column. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the third row of input is 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1. The output is 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 1 1 1. So the 9th element (index 8) is 1 in input, but in output it's 2. So maybe that's a pattern where if a cell is 1 and in a certain column, it's replaced with 2. Or maybe the cell is in a certain column.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the first row is the same. The second row's 8th element is 2, and the third row's 9th element is 2. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being set to 2 based on their position. For example, in the second row, the 8th element (index 7) is 0, but in output it's 2. Maybe the 8th column is being modified. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input's first row has 2 0 2 0 ... and the output's first row is 2 0 2 0 ... same. But the second row of input is 2 2 2 0 ... and the output is 2 2 2 0 ... but the 13th element is 0 in input, but in output it's 2. So maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being set to 2 based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where the cell is in a certain position relative to other cells. For example, if there's a 1 in the same row or column, then the 0 is replaced with 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input's first row is same as output. The second row's input is 2 0 2 0 ... and output is same. But in the third row, the input is 2 2 2 0 ... and output is same. Then in the fourth row, input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 ... and output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 ... So the 9th element (index 8) is 1 in input, but in output it's 2. So perhaps in this case, the 9th column is being modified. But why?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the presence of 1s in certain regions. For example, if there's a 1 in a certain area, then surrounding cells are set to 2. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions where the input has 0s. Maybe the transformation is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 2 if it's in a certain column or row. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where the cell is in a certain column. For example, in Example 1, the 8th column (index 7) has 0s in the input, but in the output, they are replaced with 2s. But in Example 2, the 13th column (index 12) has 0s in input, but in output they are replaced with 2s. So maybe there's a pattern where certain columns are being modified.\n\nBut looking at Example 3's output, the 9th column (index 8) is being modified. So maybe the pattern is that certain columns are being set to 2s. But how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the cell is 0 and the cell is in a certain row or column, then it's set to 2. But how to find that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 2 if it's in a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a row where there's a 1 in the same row, then replace 0 with 2. Or if the cell is in a column where there's a 1 in the same column.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 2. The input's second row has a 1 in the 9th element (index 8). So maybe the 0 is replaced with 2 if there's a 1 in the same row or column. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output is different from the input. For example, in Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 0 in input, but 2 in output. The 9th element is 1 in input, but 2 in output. The 10th element is 0 in input, but 2 in output. So maybe the 8th, 9th, and 10th elements in that row are being set to 2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where there's a 1 in the same row or column. For example, in the second row of input, there's a 1 in the 9th element (index 8). So the 8th element (index 7) is 0, which is replaced with 2. The 9th element is 1, but in output it's 2. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain position relative to other cells. For example, if the cell is in a column where there's a 1 in the same column, then replace 0 with 2. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 2, and the third row's 9th element is 2. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being set to 2 based on their coordinates. For example, if the row and column indices add up to a certain value, or if they are in certain ranges.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 2. The input's second row has a 1 in the 9th element (index 8). So maybe the 0 is replaced with 2 if the cell is to the left of a 1. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where there's a 1 in the same row or column. But how to verify that.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, the second row has a 1 in the 9th element (index 8). The 8th element (index 7) is 0 and becomes 2. The 9th element is 1 in input but becomes 2 in output. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where there's a 1 in the same row or column. For example, in the second row, the 9th element is 1. So the 8th element (index 7) is 0 and becomes 2. The 9th element is 1, but in the output it's 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is challenging. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the output of the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for the second row has 2s in positions 8, 9, 10. The input for that row has 0s in positions 7, 8, 9, 10. Wait, no. Let me check again. The input row is: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1. So the 8th element (index 7) is 0, 9th is 1, 10th is 0. The output row is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 1 0 1. So the 8th element (index 7) is 0 \u2192 2. The 9th element is 1 \u2192 2. The 10th element is 0 \u2192 2. So the 9th element is 1 in input, but in output it's 2. So why?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that any cell that is 0 and adjacent to a 1 is replaced with 2. But the 9th element is 1, and the 8th is 0. So the 8th is adjacent to the 9th. So that would make sense. But then the 9th element is 1 in input and becomes 2 in output. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 2s if they are in a certain region. For example, if the cell is in a certain column or row, like columns 7-9. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 2, and the third row's 9th element is 2. Maybe the pattern is that cells in certain positions are being replaced based on their row and column indices. For example, if the row is even and column is odd, replace 0 with 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 2. The input's second row has a 1 in the 9th element. So maybe the cell is being replaced if there's a 1 in the same row. But the 9th element is 1, and the 8th is 0 \u2192 replaced with 2. Then the 10th element is 0, but in the output it's 2. So that's three cells in a row. Maybe the pattern is that any 0 in a row that has a 1 in the same row is replaced with 2. But then why is the 9th element (which is 1) replaced with 2? That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 2s where the cell is in a certain column. For example, columns 7-9. In Example 1's second row, columns 7, 8, 9 are 0, 0, 1. So maybe those columns are being modified. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output is different from the input. For example, in Example 1, the second row's 8th element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The third row's 9th element is 1 in input, 2 in output. The fourth row's 9th element is 1 in input, 2 in output. The fifth row's 9th element is 1 in input, 2 in output. The sixth row's 2nd element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The seventh row's 2nd element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The eighth row's 2nd element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The ninth row's 10th element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The tenth row's 10th element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The eleventh row's 10th element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The twelfth row's 10th element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The thirteenth row's 10th element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The fourteenth row's 10th element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The fifteenth row's 10th element is 0 in input, 2 in output. \n\nThis seems like a lot of positions. Maybe the pattern is that any cell that is 0 and is in a certain column (like column 7, 8, 9) is replaced with 2. But in Example 1's second row, the 8th element is column 7 (assuming 0-based index). Wait, maybe the columns are being checked for certain ranges. For example, columns 7-9 (indices 7, 8, 9) are being replaced. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is 0 and is in the same column as a 1 is replaced with 2. For example, if there's a 1 in the same column, then the 0 is replaced with 2. Let's check that. \n\nIn Example 1's second row, column 7 (index 7) is 0. In the same column (column 7), looking at other rows, what's the value? Let's see. The input's column 7 (index 7) for each row:\n\nRow 0: 0\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 0\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 1\nRow 9: 0\nRow 10: 0\nRow 11: 0\nRow 12: 0\nRow 13: 0\nRow 14: 0\n\nSo in column 7, there's a 1 in row 8. So if the cell in row 1, column 7 is 0, and there's a 1 in column 7, row 8, then maybe the 0 is replaced with 2. But that would be a vertical check. But how would that affect the output?\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. If that's the case, then in the output, any 0 in a column that has a 1 in the same column would be replaced with 2. But how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 2 if there's a 1 in the same row or column. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nIn Example 1's second row, the 8th element (index 7) is 0. In the same row, there's a 1 in index 8 (9th element). So according to the hypothesis, this 0 is replaced with 2. Which matches the output. The 9th element (index 8) is 1 in input, but in output it's 2. So that doesn't fit. But maybe the hypothesis is that if the cell is 0 and there's a 1 in the same row or column, then replace with 2. But in this case, the 9th element is 1, but it's replaced with 2. So that would be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 2 if there's a 1 in the same row or column, but also if the cell is in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in the same row as a 1, then replace 0 with 2. But why would the 9th element (which is 1 in input) be replaced with 2?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. In the input, the fourth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 9th element (index 8) is 1 in input, replaced with 2. So maybe the pattern is that any 1 in a certain column is replaced with 2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is 0 and is in a certain column (like column 8) is replaced with 2. For example, in Example 1, the 8th column (index 7) is being replaced. In Example 3, the 9th column (index 8) is being replaced. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that certain columns are being set to 2. For example, columns 7, 8, 9. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's second row, the 8th column (index 7) is 0 in input, replaced with 2. In the same row, the 9th column (index 8) is 1 in input, replaced with 2. The 10th column (index 9) is 0 in input, replaced with 2. So maybe the pattern is that columns 7-9 are being set to 2 if the cell is 0 or 1. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell in columns 7-9 is set to 2. But in Example 1's input, the 8th column (index 7) is 0, and in the output it's 2. The 9th column (index 8) is 1 in input, but in output it's 2. The 10th column (index 9) is 0 in input, replaced with 2. So maybe columns 7-9 are being set to 2. But why?\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing certain cells based on their position and the presence of 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where the cell is in a certain region. For example, in the input, if there's a 1 in a certain area, then the surrounding cells are set to 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where the cell is in a certain pattern, like a cross shape or something. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern of 2s. For example, in the output, the second row has 2s in columns 7, 8, 9. The third row has 2 in column 8. The fourth row has 2 in column 8. The fifth row has 2 in column 8. The sixth row has 2 in column 2. The seventh row has 2 in column 2. The eighth row has 2 in column 2. The ninth row has 2 in column 8. The tenth row has 2 in column 8. The eleventh row has 2 in column 8. The twelfth row has 2 in column 8. The thirteenth row has 2 in column 8. The fourteenth row has 2 in column 8. The fifteenth row has 2 in column 8.\n\nThis seems like a lot of 2s in column 8. But why? Maybe column 8 is being set to 2 in certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell in column 8 is set to 2. But in the input, column 8 has 0s and 1s. For example, in Example 1's second row, column 8 is 1 in input, but in output it's 2. So that would fit. But in other rows, column 8 may have 0s or 1s, but in the output they are set to 2. So maybe the pattern is that column 8 is being set to 2 in the output, regardless of the input. But that seems unlikely.\n\nBut looking at the output of Example 1's third row, the 9th element (index 8) is 2. The input's third row's 9th element is 1. So that would fit if column 8 is set to 2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell in column 8 is set to 2. But that would mean that all cells in column 8 are 2 in the output, regardless of the input. But that doesn't make sense for the other examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the output for the first row has 2 0 2 0 ... and the input's first row is 2 0 2 0 ... so no change. But in the second row of input, the output has 2 2 2 0 ... and the input's second row is 2 2 2 0 ... so no change. But the 13th element (index 12) is 0 in input and 2 in output. So maybe column 12 is being set to 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing 0s with 2s in certain columns based on the presence of 1s in the same column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell in the input is 2 if it's in a certain column, and 0 otherwise. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the second row has 2s in columns 7, 8, 9. The third row has 2 in column 8. The fourth row has 2 in column 8. The fifth row has 2 in column 8. The sixth row has 2 in column 2. The seventh row has 2 in column 2. The eighth row has 2 in column 2. The ninth row has 2 in column 8. The tenth row has 2 in column 8. The eleventh row has 2 in column 8. The twelfth row has 2 in column 8. The thirteenth row has 2 in column 8. The fourteenth row has 2 in column 8. The fifteenth row has 2 in column 8.\n\nThis suggests that columns 2, 8, and 9 are being set to 2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell in column 2 or 8 is set to 2, and others are unchanged. But in Example 1's input, column 2 has 2s in the first row, which are unchanged. But in other rows, column 2 has 0s and 1s. For example, in the sixth row, column 2 is 0 in input, replaced with 2 in output. So that fits.\n\nBut why would column 2 and 8 be chosen? Maybe these are specific columns that are being set to 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell in column 2 or 8 is set to 2, regardless of the input. But that would mean that in the input, if a cell is in column 2 or 8, it's set to 2. But that doesn't fit the examples, because in Example 1's first row, column 2 is 2, and it's unchanged. But in the sixth row, column 2 is 0, and it's replaced with 2. So that fits.\n\nBut how to determine which columns are being set to 2. For example, in Example 1, columns 2 and 8 are being set to 2. In Example 2, columns 2 and 8 are also being set to 2. In Example 3, columns 2 and 8 are being set to 2.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the first row has 2 0 2 0 ... which is unchanged. The second row is 2 2 2 0 ... which is unchanged. The third row is 2 0 2 0 ... unchanged. The fourth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So column 8 (index 8) is set to 2. The fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no change. But in the sixth row, the output is 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So column 5-7 (indices 5-7) are 2. But this doesn't fit the previous pattern.\n\nHmm, this suggests that my previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced based on their position relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is in a certain row and column, it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Given the time constraints, I need to make a hypothesis.\n\nAnother observation: in all three examples, the output has 2s in certain positions that are in the same column as 1s in the input. For example, in Example 1, the second row's 8th element (index 7) is 0, and the 9th element (index 8) is 1. The 8th element is replaced with 2. Similarly, in the third row, the 9th element (index 8) is 1 in input, replaced with 2 in output. This suggests that if a cell is to the left of a 1 in the same row, it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Another possibility is that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s if there's a 1 in the same row or column.\n\nLet's try to implement this hypothesis. For each cell in the input grid, if the cell is 0, check if there's a 1 in the same row or column. If so, replace with 2. Otherwise, leave as is.\n\nLet's test this on Example 1's second row. The cell at (1,7) is 0. In the same row, there is a 1 at (1,8). So this cell is replaced with 2. The cell at (1,8) is 1 in input, but in output it's 2. So this doesn't fit. But maybe the rule is that if the cell is 0 and there's a 1 in the same row or column, replace with 2. But the cell (1,8) is 1, so it's not replaced. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that if the cell is 0 and there's a 1 in the same row or column, replace with 2. But also, if the cell is 1, replace with 2 if there's a 0 in the same row or column. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is 0 or 1 is replaced with 2 if it is adjacent to a 1 in the same row or column. But this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's assume that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain columns. For example, columns 7, 8, and 9 are being set to 2. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row has 2s in columns 7, 8, 9. The third row has 2 in column 8. The fourth row has 2 in column 8. The fifth row has 2 in column 8. The sixth row has 2 in column 2. The seventh row has 2 in column 2. The eighth row has 2 in column 2. The ninth row has 2 in column 8. The tenth row has 2 in column 8. The eleventh row has 2 in column 8. The twelfth row has 2 in column 8. The thirteenth row has 2 in column 8. The fourteenth row has 2 in column 8. The fifteenth row has 2 in column 8.\n\nThis suggests that columns 2 and 8 are being set to 2 in the output. So perhaps the transformation is that any cell in column 2 or 8 is set to 2, regardless of the input. Let's test this hypothesis on the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's second row, column 2 is 0 in input, replaced with 2 in output. Column 8 is 1 in input, replaced with 2 in output. Column 9 is 0 in input, replaced with 2 in output. So this fits if columns 2 and 8 are being set to 2, but column 9 is not. But in this case, column 8 is set to 2, and column 9 is not. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe columns 7, 8, 9 are being set to 2. Let's check Example 1's second row: columns 7, 8, 9 are 0, 1, 0 \u2192 replaced with 2, 2, 2. So that fits. But in other rows, like the sixth row, column 2 is 0 in input and replaced with 2 in output. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I think I need to proceed with a hypothesis that the transformation is replacing 0s with 2s in certain columns, and perhaps based on the presence of 1s in those columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell in the input grid is replaced with 2 if it is in a column that has a 1 in the same column. For example, if a column has at least one 1, then all cells in that column are set to 2. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1's second row, column 7 (index 7) has a 1 in row 8. So column 7 has a 1, so all cells in column 7 are set to 2. But in the input, row 1, column 7 is 0, and in the output it's 2. That fits. Column 8 (index 8) has a 1 in row 8, so all cells in column 8 are set to 2. In the input, row 1, column 8 is 1, but in the output it's 2. So this fits. Column 9 (index 9) has a 1 in row 8, so all cells in column 9 are set to 2. In the input, row 1, column 9 is 0, and in the output it's 2. So this fits.\n\nThis seems to fit the first example. Let's check Example 2's input. For example, in the second row of Example 2's input, the 13th column (index 12) is 0 in input. Let's check if column 12 has a 1 in the input. Looking at the input for Example 2's column 12:\n\nRow 0: 0\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 0\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 0\nRow 9: 0\nRow 10: 0\nRow 11: 0\nRow 12: 0\nRow 13: 0\nRow 14: 0\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the column 12 (index 12) has all 0s. But in the output, it's 2. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell in the input is replaced with 2 if there is a 1 in the same row or column. Let's test this for Example 1's second row, column 7 (0 in input). In the same row, there is a 1 in column 8. So this cell is replaced with 2. The cell in column 8 (1 in input) is replaced with 2 in output. But why? Because there is a 0 in the same column (column 8)? Or because there is a 1 in the same row?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Given the time, I think I need to proceed with a hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain columns based on the presence of 1s in those columns.\n\nBut how to determine which columns. Let's look at the output of Example 1. The columns that are being set to 2 are columns 7, 8, 9. Let's check if these columns have 1s in the input.\n\nFor column 7 in Example 1's input, there is a 1 in row 8. So column 7 has at least one 1. So all cells in column 7 are set to 2.\n\nFor column 8 in Example 1's input, there is a 1 in row 8. So all cells in column 8 are set to 2.\n\nFor column 9 in Example 1's input, there is a 1 in row 8. So all cells in column 9 are set to 2.\n\nSo this would explain the output for Example 1. But what about Example 2?\n\nIn Example 2's input, the output has 2 in column 12 (index 12) for row 8. Let's check if column 12 has a 1 in the input. In Example 2's input, column 12 is:\n\nRow 0: 0\nRow 1: 0\nRow 2: 0\nRow 3: 0\nRow 4: 0\nRow 5: 0\nRow 6: 0\nRow 7: 0\nRow 8: 0\nRow 9: 0\nRow 10: 0\nRow 11: 0\nRow 12: 0\nRow 13: 0\nRow 14: 0\n\nSo no 1s in column 12. But in the output, it's 2. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. But given the examples, I need to make a guess. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, rows 1-3 and columns 7-9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s if the cell is in the same row as a 1 or the same column as a 1. Let's try to implement this.\n\nFor each cell (i,j), if the cell is 0, check if there's any 1 in row i or column j. If yes, replace with 2. Otherwise, leave as is.\n\nLet's test this on Example 1's second row, column 7 (0). In row 1, there is a 1 at column 8. So this cell is replaced with 2. The cell at column 8 (1 in input) is replaced with 2 in output. Why? Because there is a 0 in column 8 (row 1)? Or because there is a 1 in row 1? But according to the rule, if the cell is 0, it's replaced. But in this case, the cell is 1, so it's not replaced. But the output shows it as 2. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible hypothesis based on the examples, even if it's not perfect. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain columns. For example, columns 7, 8, and 9. Let's implement this.\n\nThe code would be:\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if the column is 7, 8, or 9, set it to 2. Otherwise, leave as is.\n\nBut let's test this on Example 1's second row. Columns 7, 8, 9 are set to 2. So the second row's 7th, 8th, 9th elements are 0, 1, 0 \u2192 replaced with 2, 2, 2. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, the 8th column (index 8) is 1 in input, replaced with 2. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1's sixth row, the 2nd column (index 2) is 0 in input, replaced with 2. But according to this hypothesis, it's not in columns 7-9. So this would not fit. But in the output, it is 2. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the sixth row's 2nd column is 2. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I think I need to think of another pattern. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain rows and columns. For example, rows 1-3 and columns 7-9.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in columns 7, 8, 9, and also in certain rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in columns 7-9, and also in rows 1-3.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's proceed with this hypothesis.\n\nThe code would be:\n\nfor each row in 0-14:\n    for each column in 0-14:\n        if column is 7, 8, or 9:\n            set to 2\n        elif row is 1, 2, or 3:\n            set to 2\n        else:\n            leave as is\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1's second row (row 1), columns 7-9 are set to 2. Also, row 1 is in 1-3, so all columns are set to 2. But in the output, the second row's columns 0-6 are 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 0, 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with a hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain columns, and implement that.\n\nBased on the first example, columns 7, 8, 9 are being set to 2. So let's implement that.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(15):\n        for j in range(15):\n            if j in [7, 8, 9]:\n                new_grid[i][j] = 2\n    return new_grid\n\nBut let's test this on Example 1's second row. The second row's columns 7, 8, 9 are set to 2, which matches the output. For the third row, column 8 is set to 2, which matches the output. For the sixth row, column 2 is not in 7-9, so it remains 0. But in the output, it's 2. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1's sixth row, the 2nd column is 2. So this suggests that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in columns 7-9 and rows 1-3.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given the examples, I'll proceed with this and see.\n"
