          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with others in a structured way.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain values (like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) are replaced with other values in specific regions of the grid.\n3. The transformation seems to be more about replacing values in certain regions rather than changing their positions.\n4. The output grid always has the same dimensions (18x22), so we need to ensure our transformation maintains this.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with others in specific regions of the grid. For example, values like 2 might be replaced with 3, 3 with 4, and so on.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the value replacement pattern\n    value_replacements = {\n        2: 3,\n        3: 4,\n        4: 5,\n        5: 6,\n        6: 7,\n        7: 8,\n        8: 9\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the value replacement pattern\n    for i in range(18):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid[i][j] in value_replacements:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = value_replacements[grid[i][j]]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the value replacement pattern\n    value_replacements = {\n        2: 3,\n        3: 4,\n        4: 5,\n        5: 6,\n        6: 7,\n        7: 8,\n        8: 9\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the value replacement pattern\n    for i in range(18):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid[i][j] in value_replacements:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = value_replacements[grid[i][j]]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

There are patterns where specific values (like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) are replaced with other values in a systematic way.\n3. The transformation appears to be based on some kind of spatial pattern or rule that maps specific values to others in a consistent manner.\n4. There are instances where values are replaced in a way that seems to be based on their position in the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with others in a structured way.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a deep copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the mapping of values based on observed patterns\n    value_map = {\n        0: 0,\n        1: 1,\n        2: 2,\n        3: 3,\n        4: 4,\n        5: 5,\n        6: 6,\n        7: 7,\n        8: 8,\n        9: 9\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the transformation\n    for i in range(18):\n        for j in range(22):\n            # Replace values based on observed patterns\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a deep copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the mapping of values based on observed patterns\n    value_map = {\n        0: 0,\n        1: 1,\n        2: 2,\n        3: 3,\n        4: 4,\n        5: 5,\n        6: 6,\n        7: 7,\n        8: 8,\n        9: 9\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the transformation\n    for i in range(18):\n        for j in range(22):\n            # Replace values based on observed patterns\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with others in a structured way.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain values (like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) are replaced with other values in specific regions of the grid.\n3. The transformation seems to be more about replacing values in certain regions rather than changing their positions.\n4. The output grid always has the same dimensions (18x22), so we need to ensure our transformation maintains this.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with others in specific regions of the grid.
