If the number is already at the 10th column, it simply appends a `5`.",

Iterate through each cell in the input grid.\n2. If a cell contains a value `v` and is surrounded by zeros, create a 5x11 grid starting from the current cell and fill it with the value `v`, except for the last cell which will be filled with `v+2`.\n\n### Python Function:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    transformed_grid = [[0] * 11 for _ in range(5)]\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                continue\n\n            # Check if the current cell is surrounded by zeros\n            if (i == 0 or grid[i-1][j] == 0) and (i == rows-1 or grid[i+1][j] == 0) and \\\n               (j == 0 or grid[i][j-1] == 0) and (j == cols-1 or grid[i][j+1] == 0):\n                value = grid[i][j]\n                for x in range(5):\n                    for y in range(11):\n                        if y < 10:\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = value\n                        else:\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = value + 2\n\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function iterates through each cell in the input grid.\n- If a cell contains a value `v` and is surrounded by zeros, it creates a 5x11 grid starting from the current cell and fills it with the value `v`, except for the last cell which is filled with `v+2`.\n- The function returns the transformed 5x11 grid.\n\nThis solution captures the observed patterns in the training examples and attempts to apply the same transformation to the input grid.",

Finding the two numbers in the input grid.\n2. Creating a new grid with two rows of those numbers.\n3.
