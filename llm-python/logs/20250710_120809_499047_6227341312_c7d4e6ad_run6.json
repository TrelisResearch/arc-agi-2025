          "Let's analyze the patterns carefully:\n\n### Observations from training examples:\n- The large shape in the center (gray color 5) is transformed by replacing all connected 5's **with the color of the top-most left vertical bar** on the left side.\n- The vertical bars on the left side keep their original colors.\n- The connecting shape changes color from 5 to the color of the vertical bar **on the same row** at the leftmost part of the grid.\n- The replaced color used for the shape is the color of the vertical bar that is closest (in terms of rows) on the left-hand side.\n- For example, in the first training example: vertical bars have colors [8 (rows 2\u20134), 2 (rows 5\u20138)].\n- The shape pixels that align with the rows with 8 become color 8. The shape pixels that align with rows with 2 become color 2.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- For every pixel in the shape (value=5 in input), replace it with the color of the vertical bar on the **same row** in the first column (column 0).\n- Non-shape pixels remain unchanged except that shape pixels get replaced as above.\n\n### Implementation steps:\n1. Identify the positions of vertical bars on the left column (column 0).\n2. For each cell with value 5 in the input grid, replace with the color value at the same row column 0.\n3. All other cells remain unchanged.\n4. Return transformed grid with size 10\u00d710.\n\nThis matches the pattern observed from both textual and visual info.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Copy input grid to output\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    for r in range(10):\n        left_color = grid[r][0]  # color of leftmost cell in this row (vertical bar)\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with color of left bar on same row\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = left_color\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```"

              "Let's analyze the patterns carefully:\n\n### Observations from training examples:\n- The large shape in the center (gray color 5) is transformed by replacing all connected 5's **with the color of the top-most left vertical bar** on the left side.\n- The vertical bars on the left side keep their original colors.\n- The connecting shape changes color from 5 to the color of the vertical bar **on the same row** at the leftmost part of the grid.\n- The replaced color used for the shape is the color of the vertical bar that is closest (in terms of rows) on the left-hand side.\n- For example, in the first training example: vertical bars have colors [8 (rows 2\u20134), 2 (rows 5\u20138)].\n- The shape pixels that align with the rows with 8 become color 8. The shape pixels that align with rows with 2 become color 2.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- For every pixel in the shape (value=5 in input), replace it with the color of the vertical bar on the **same row** in the first column (column 0).\n- Non-shape pixels remain unchanged except that shape pixels get replaced as above.\n\n### Implementation steps:\n1. Identify the positions of vertical bars on the left column (column 0).\n2. For each cell with value 5 in the input grid, replace with the color value at the same row column 0.\n3. All other cells remain unchanged.\n4. Return transformed grid with size 10\u00d710.\n\nThis matches the pattern observed from both textual and visual info.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Copy input grid to output\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    for r in range(10):\n        left_color = grid[r][0]  # color of leftmost cell in this row (vertical bar)\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with color of left bar on same row\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = left_color\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```"
