So, the input and output grids are 3 rows by 10 columns for the examples, but the test input is 3 rows by 14 columns. Wait, the problem says the output must always be 3x10. So the test input is 3x14, but the output is 3x10. Hmm, maybe the transformation is about expanding or modifying certain parts of the grid.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has 3 rows, each with 10 elements. The output is also 3 rows, each with 10 elements. Wait, the input in Example 1 is 3 rows of 10 elements each. The output is the same. Wait, but the input for Example 2 is 3 rows of 12 elements each? Wait, no. Let me check again. Oh, the input for Example 2 is given as:\n\nInput:\n3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, that's 3 rows, each with 12 elements.

Wait, the output for Example 2 is:\n\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3\nWait no, the output is given as:\n\nOutput:\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3\n1 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 1\n\nWait, each output row has 12 elements. But the problem says the output must be 3x10. Wait, maybe the examples are not correct? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 3x10. But the training examples show outputs with more columns. Wait, maybe the examples are not in the correct format. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the test input is 3x14, but the output must be 3x10. So the training examples must have outputs that are 3x10. But looking at Example 1's output:\n\nOutput:\n8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8\n1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n\nEach row has 10 elements. So the output is 3x10. So the input for Example 1 is 3 rows of 10 elements each. The output is same. So in Example 2, the input is 3 rows of 12 elements each? But the output is 3 rows of 12 elements each? But the problem says that the output must be 3x10. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the examples have a typo. Or perhaps the input and output for the examples are not 3x10. Wait, maybe the examples are not in the correct format. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says that the output must always be 3\u00d710. So the training examples' outputs must be 3x10. But looking at Example 2's output, the first line is 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 \u2014 that's 13 elements. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me count the elements in the output of Example 2.\n\nOriginal output for Example 2:\n\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 \u2014 that's 13 elements. But that's impossible. Wait, perhaps the example is written with some formatting issues. Maybe the output for Example 2 is 3 rows of 12 elements each. But the problem says that the output must be 3x10. So maybe the examples are not correct. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input and output for the training examples are not 3x10. Maybe the problem is that the input is 3 rows by 10 columns, and the output is 3 rows by 10 columns. But the examples given have outputs with more columns. That seems conflicting. But perhaps the examples are not correctly formatted. For example, in Example 2, the output is written as:\n\nOutput:\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3\n1 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 1\n\nWait, each line has 12 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 3x10. So this is confusing. But perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the examples are correct. Maybe the output is 3x10, but in the examples, the output is written with more elements. Wait, perhaps the examples are not properly formatted. For example, maybe in Example 2, the output is 3 rows of 12 elements, but the problem says that the output must be 3x10. That would be a contradiction. But perhaps the examples are not correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input and output for the training examples are not 3x10. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Your task is to: 1. Analyze the training examples to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids 2. Write a Python program that implements your best understanding of the transformation 3. DO NOT predict or generate the test output - your job is only to write the transformation program 4. Attempt a solution - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis 5. Do not repeat the same transformation - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\"\n\nThe problem says that the output must always be 3\u00d710. So the input and output grids for the training examples must be 3x10. But looking at the examples given, perhaps they are not. For example, in Example 1, the input is 3 rows of 10 elements each. The output is also 3 rows of 10 elements each. So that's correct. But in Example 2, the input is given as 3 rows with 12 elements each, and the output is 3 rows with 12 elements each. But that's conflicting with the problem's requirement that the output is 3x10. So maybe the examples are not correct. Or perhaps the problem is that the input and output for the training examples are not 3x10, but the test input is 3x14, and the output is 3x10. So the function must take any input (possibly of varying size) and output a 3x10 grid. But that's not possible. So maybe the problem is that the input is 3x10, and the output is 3x10. But the examples have outputs that are 3x12. That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input for the training examples is 3 rows by 10 columns, and the output is 3 rows by 10 columns. So in Example 2, the input is 3 rows of 12 elements. That can't be. So there's a mistake here. But perhaps the examples are written with some formatting errors. For example, maybe the input for Example 2 is 3 rows of 10 elements, but the output is 3 rows of 10 elements. But the way it's written here is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are correct, and the problem is that the output must be 3x10, but the examples have outputs that are 3x12. But that can't be. So perhaps the problem is that the input is 3 rows by N columns, and the output is 3x10. So for example, the input in Example 1 is 3x10, output is 3x10. The input in Example 2 is 3x12, and the output is 3x10. But that's not possible. So maybe the examples are not correctly formatted. Alternatively, maybe the output for Example 2 is 3x10, but the way it's written here is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are correct, and the output for Example 2 is 3x10, but the way it's written is incorrect. For example, maybe the output for Example 2 is:\n\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 \u2014 but that's 12 elements. But that's not possible. So I'm confused. But given that the problem says that the output must be 3x10, I need to focus on that.\n\nSo, looking at the examples, perhaps the transformation is that the first few columns are kept, and the rest are filled with some pattern. For example, in Example 1, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 8 2 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output row 0: 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8. So the first three elements are the same, then the next elements are filled with 8s, then the last element is 8. Wait, but the output has 10 elements. The original input has 10 elements. So the output is same as input in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the non-zero elements. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 8, 2, 8, then zeros. The output is 8,2,8, then 8s, then 2,8. So maybe the zeros are replaced with the same value as the first non-zero element in some way. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput row 0: [8, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput row 0: [8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nSo the first three elements are same as input. Then, the next 4 elements (positions 3-6) are 8s. Then, position 7 is 8, position 8 is 2, position 9 is 8. So maybe the zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, but then there's some pattern. Or maybe the zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, and then the last element is the same as the first non-zero element.\n\nBut in the input row 0, the first non-zero element is 8. Then, the output row 0 starts with 8, 2, 8, then 8s, then 2, 8. So maybe the zeros are replaced with 8s, but the last element is 8. But the original input has 0s after the first three elements. So the output is 8, 2, 8, then 8s (positions 3-6), then 2 and 8. But how does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the existing elements. For example, in the first row, the first three elements are kept, and then the next elements are filled with the same value as the first non-zero element. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the existing elements into a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input:\n\nRow 0: 3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 but that's 12 elements. But the output is 3x10. So maybe the input is 3x10, and the output is 3x10. But the way the example is written is confusing. Let me try to think of the examples as 3x10.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input is 3 rows of 10 elements each. The output is also 3 rows of 10 elements each.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is 3 rows of 10 elements each. The output is also 3 rows of 10 elements each. But the way it's written is confusing. Maybe the input for Example 2 is:\n\nInput:\n3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBut that's 3 rows of 10 elements each. Then the output is:\n\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 \u2192 but that's 12 elements. Wait, this is conflicting. Maybe the example is written with a typo. Perhaps the output for Example 2 is:\n\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 \u2192 but that's 12 elements. But the output must be 3x10. So maybe the example is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the output is 3 rows of 10 elements each, and the example is written with some formatting issues. For example, the output for Example 2 may be:\n\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 \u2192 but that's 12 elements. So this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the examples are not correctly formatted. But given that the problem says that the output must be 3x10, I need to proceed with that.\n\nAssuming that the input and output are 3x10, let's try to find patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 8 2 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 1 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 1 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8\nRow 1: 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1\nRow 2: 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n\nSo for each row, the first three elements are the same as the input. Then, the next elements are filled with the same value as the first non-zero element in the row. But for row 0, the first non-zero element is 8. So the next elements are 8. Then, the last two elements are 2 and 8. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero element in the row. For example, in row 0, the first non-zero element is 8. So the zeros after the first three elements are replaced with 8. Then, the last element is 8. But in the output row 0, the last element is 8. So that's consistent.\n\nFor row 1: input is [1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The first non-zero elements are 1, 8, 1. So the zeros are replaced with 1? But in the output, the zeros are replaced with 1s. So the output row 1 is 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1. So the first three elements are 1,8,1. Then, the next elements (positions 3-6) are 1, and then position 7 is 1, then position 8 is 8, and position 9 is 1. Hmm, but why is position 8 8 and position 9 1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero element in the row. But in row 1, the first non-zero element is 1 (position 0). So all zeros are replaced with 1. But in the output, the first three elements are 1,8,1. Then, the next elements (positions 3-7) are 1s. Then, position 8 is 8, position 9 is 1. So that doesn't fit. So maybe this is not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the existing elements. For example, in row 0, the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element (8), and then the last element is the same as the first non-zero element. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for row 0, the first three elements are same as input, then the next elements are 8s. Then, the last two elements are 2 and 8. But the input row 0 has 2 in position 1, and 8 in position 2. Then, the output row 0 has 2 and 8 in the last two positions. So maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the same value as the first non-zero element, and then the last element is the same as the first non-zero element. But this doesn't explain the 2 in position 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by expanding the existing elements into a certain pattern. For example, in row 0, the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element (8), and then the last element is the same as the second element (2). But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the existing elements into a pattern where the first non-zero element is expanded to the right, and then the last element is the same as the second element. But this is getting too vague.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 2 3 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 but this is 14 elements. But the output must be 3x10. So perhaps the input is 3x10, and the output is 3x10. So maybe the input for Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 3 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 8 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 2 8 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThen the output is:\n\nRow 0: 2 3 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 1: 2 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 2: 2 8 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nSo the first four elements are same as input, then the next elements are filled with 2s. But in the output, the first four elements are 2,3,8,2. Then, the next elements are 2s. So maybe the pattern is that the zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero element in the row. But in row 0, the first non-zero element is 2 (position 0). So the zeros are replaced with 2. But in the output row 0, the first four elements are 2,3,8,2. Then, the next six elements are 2. So that fits.\n\nIn row 1, the input is 2 8 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. The first non-zero element is 2. So the zeros are replaced with 2. But the output row 1 is 2 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. So that fits.\n\nIn row 2, the input is 2 8 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. The first non-zero element is 2. So the zeros are replaced with 2. The output row 2 is 2 8 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. Which fits.\n\nSo in this case, the pattern is that for each row, the zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero element in the row. But in Example 1, the first non-zero element in row 0 is 8, and the zeros are replaced with 8. However, in the output of Example 1, the first three elements are 8, 2, 8, then the next elements are 8s, and then the last two elements are 2 and 8. Wait, but according to this pattern, the zeros would be replaced with 8. So the output row 0 would be 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8. But the actual output is 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8. So the last two elements are 2 and 8, not 8. So this contradicts the pattern.\n\nHmm. So maybe the pattern is not as simple as replacing zeros with the first non-zero element. Let's think again.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row of input is 8 2 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8. So the first three elements are same. The next elements are 8s. Then, the last two elements are 2 and 8. But why?\n\nLooking at the second row of input: 1 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1. So the first three elements are same. Then, the next elements are 1s. Then, the last two elements are 8 and 1. So the pattern here is that the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the first non-zero element (1), but the last element is the same as the second element (8) and the previous element (1)? Or maybe the last element is the same as the second element.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the existing elements in such a way that the first non-zero element is expanded to the right, and the last element is the same as the second element. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the first non-zero element is expanded to the right, and the last element is the same as the second element in the row. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1, row 0: the first non-zero element is 8. So the zeros are filled with 8, but the last element is 8. But the output row 0 has 2 and 8 as the last two elements. So maybe the pattern is that the first non-zero element is expanded to the right, and the last element is the same as the second element in the row.\n\nBut in row 0, the second element is 2. So the last element is 8. That doesn't fit. So this is confusing.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output, perhaps the pattern is different. Let's take Example 2's input:\n\nAssuming that the input is 3 rows of 10 elements each. For example:\n\nRow 0: 3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBut the output is:\n\nRow 0: 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 \u2192 but that's 12 elements. So this is not possible. So perhaps the examples are not correct. But given that the problem says that the output must be 3x10, I'll proceed under the assumption that the examples are correctly formatted, and that the output is 3x10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are not in the correct format. For example, in Example 2, the input has 3 rows of 12 elements each, but the output is 3 rows of 10 elements each. So the transformation is to take the first 10 elements of each row. But that would be a stretch. But that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, and the rest are filled with the same value as the first non-zero element. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs:\n\nIn Example 1, the output for row 0 is 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8. The first three elements are same as input. Then, the next elements are 8s, and the last two elements are 2 and 8. So perhaps the pattern is that after the first three elements, the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and then the last element is the same as the second element in the row.\n\nBut in row 0, the second element is 2, and the last element is 8. So that doesn't fit. Or maybe the last element is the same as the first element. In row 0, the first element is 8, and the last element is 8. Which fits. In row 1 of Example 1, the output is 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1. The last element is 1, which is same as the first element (1). So that fits. Similarly, row 2's output is same as row 1. So this seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for each row, the first three elements are kept as is. Then, the next elements are filled with the first non-zero element in the row. Then, the last element is the same as the first element.\n\nBut let's check this for Example 1:\n\nRow 0: first three elements are 8, 2, 8. First non-zero element is 8. So the next elements are filled with 8. The last element is 8 (same as first element). So the output row is 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8. But the actual output is 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8. So the last two elements are 2 and 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the pattern is not as simple as that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the second element in the row. For row 0, the second element is 2. So the last element is 8. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the third element. In row 0, the third element is 8. So the last element is 8. Which fits. But the output row 0 has 2 and 8 as the last two elements. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last two elements are the same as the second and third elements. For row 0, the second element is 2, third is 8. So the last two elements are 2 and 8. Which fits the output. For row 1, the second element is 8, third is 1. So the last two elements would be 8 and 1. Which fits the output row 1: 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1. Yes, the last two elements are 8 and 1.\n\nAh, this seems to fit. So the pattern is:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- Keep the first three elements as they are.\n\n- Fill the next elements (from position 3 to position 7) with the value of the first non-zero element in the row.\n\n- Then, the last two elements are the second and third elements of the row.\n\nBut wait, in row 0, the first three elements are 8, 2, 8. The next elements (positions 3-7) are filled with 8 (the first non-zero element). Then the last two elements are 2 and 8. Which fits.\n\nIn row 1 of Example 1, the first three elements are 1, 8, 1. The first non-zero element is 1. So positions 3-7 are filled with 1. Then the last two elements are 8 and 1. Which fits the output.\n\nFor row 2 of Example 1, same as row 1.\n\nIn Example 3, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 2 3 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 first three elements are 2, 3, 8. The first non-zero element is 2. So positions 3-7 are filled with 2. Then the last two elements are 3 and 8. So the output row is 2 3 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 8. But the actual output is 2 3 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. So this doesn't fit. Wait, the output for Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 3 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nSo the last two elements are 2 and 2. But according to the pattern, the last two elements should be 3 and 8. So this contradicts the pattern.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that after the first three elements, the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element.\n\nIn Example 1, row 0: first non-zero is 8. So the next elements are 8s. The last element is 8. Which fits the output row 0's last element. But the second last element is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element. For row 0, the last element is 8. But the output row 0 has 2 and 8 as the last two elements. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs for Example 1 and 3:\n\nExample 1's output for row 0: 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8 \u2192 the first three elements are 8,2,8. Then, the next four elements are 8s. Then, the last two elements are 2 and 8. So the pattern could be that after the first three elements, the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and then the last two elements are the second and third elements of the row.\n\nIn Example 3's output for row 0: 2 3 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 \u2192 the first three elements are 2,3,8. Then, the next elements are 2s (first non-zero is 2). The last two elements are 2 and 2. But according to the pattern, they should be 3 and 8. So this doesn't fit. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, and the rest are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element.\n\nIn Example 1, row 0: first non-zero is 8. So the last element is 8. But the output row 0 has 2 and 8 as the last two elements. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, and the rest are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the third element.\n\nIn Example 1, row 0: third element is 8, so last element is 8. Which fits. In row 1, third element is 1, so last element is 1. Which fits. In Example 3's row 0, third element is 8, so last element is 8. But the output row 0 is 2 3 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 \u2192 last element is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has the first three elements of the input, and then some pattern. For example, in Example 1, the first three elements are kept, and then the rest are filled with 8s or 1s, and then the last two elements are filled with certain values.\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs for the examples and see if there's a pattern in how the zeros are replaced.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nRow 0: input has 0s from position 3 to 9. Output has 8s from position 3 to 7, then 2 and 8.\n\nRow 1: input has 0s from position 3 to 9. Output has 1s from position 3 to 7, then 8 and 1.\n\nRow 2: same as row 1.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nRow 0: input has 0s from position 4 to 9. Output has 2s from position 4 to 9.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, but for the last two elements, it's replaced with the value of the second and third elements.\n\nBut in Example 1, row 0, the second element is 2, third is 8. So the last two elements are 2 and 8. Which fits. In row 1, the second element is 8, third is 1. So the last two elements are 8 and 1. Which fits.\n\nIn Example 3, row 0: the second element is 3, third is 8. So the last two elements would be 3 and 8. But the output is 2 3 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the last two elements are 2 and 2. This doesn't fit. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the first element.\n\nIn Example 1, row 0: first element is 8, so last element is 8. Which fits. Row 1: first element is 1, so last element is 1. Which fits. In Example 3, row 0: first element is 2, so last element is 2. Which fits the output.\n\nSo for Example 3's row 0, the last element is 2. So the pattern is: after the first three elements, fill the rest with the first non-zero element, and the last element is the first element.\n\nBut how does this fit with the other examples?\n\nIn Example 1, row 0: the first three elements are 8, 2, 8. Then, the next elements are 8s (first non-zero is 8). The last element is 8 (first element). So the output row is 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8. But the actual output is 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8. So the last two elements are 2 and 8. So this doesn't fit. But according to this pattern, the last element should be 8, and the previous element would be 8. So why is it 2 and 8?\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the first three elements are kept, and then the rest are filled with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element. But for the last two elements, it's possible that the second element is kept, and the last is the first non-zero element.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, and then the rest are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last two elements are filled with the second and third elements of the row.\n\nBut in Example 3, this doesn't fit. So perhaps the examples are not consistent, and I need to find another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has the first three elements of the input, and then the rest are filled with a certain value, and then the last two elements are filled with certain values. For example, in Example 1, the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last two elements are filled with the second and third elements of the input.\n\nBut in Example 3, this would mean that the last two elements are 3 and 8, but the output is 2 and 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, and then the rest are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element.\n\nIn Example 1, row 0: first non-zero is 8, so the last element is 8. Which fits. But the output has 2 and 8 as the last two elements. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about what the transformation does for each example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 3x10 grid. The output is also 3x10. The first three columns are the same as the input. Then, the next columns are filled with the value of the first non-zero element in the row. Then, the last two columns are filled with the second and third elements of the input.\n\nBut in Example 3, this doesn't fit. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to expand the first three columns and then fill the rest with the first non-zero element in the row, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element.\n\nBut this doesn't explain the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, then the rest are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element. But in Example 1, the last element is 8, which fits. But in the output, the last two elements are 2 and 8. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each row, the first three elements are kept, then the rest are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element. But for the last two elements, it's possible that the second element is kept, and the last is the first non-zero element.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the pattern that seems to fit most of the examples, even if it doesn't fit all.\n\nSo, the pattern is: for each row, the first three elements are kept, then the rest are filled with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output row 0 has last element as 8, which is the first non-zero element. But the second last element is 2, which is the second element of the input. So perhaps the pattern is that the last element is the first non-zero element, and the second last element is the second element of the input.\n\nThis seems to fit Example 1 and 3.\n\nFor Example 1, row 0: second element is 2, so second last is 2, last is 8.\n\nFor Example 3, row 0: second element is 3, so second last is 3, last is 2. But this doesn't fit. So this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the last two elements are filled with the second and third elements of the input. For example, in Example 1, row 0, the last two elements are 2 and 8, which are the second and third elements of the input. In Example 3, the last two elements are 2 and 2, which are not the second and third elements of the input. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to implement the pattern that seems to work for most examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBased on Example 1 and 3, the pattern is:\n\nFor each row:\n\n1. Keep the first three elements as they are.\n\n2. Find the first non-zero element in the row.\n\n3. Fill the remaining elements (from position 3 to 9) with the value of the first non-zero element.\n\n4. The last element is the same as the first non-zero element.\n\nBut this doesn't explain the second last element in Example 1. So perhaps the second last element is the second element of the input.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- The first three elements are kept.\n\n- The next elements (positions 3 to 7) are filled with the first non-zero element.\n\n- The last two elements are filled with the second and third elements of the input.\n\nSo for Example 1, row 0, the last two elements are 2 and 8, which are the second and third elements of the input.\n\nFor Example 3, row 0, the last two elements are 3 and 8, but the output is 2 and 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps the examples are not correct, and this is the best pattern I can find.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Take the first three elements.\n\n- Find the first non-zero element in the row.\n\n- Fill the next elements (positions 3 to 9) with the first non-zero element.\n\n- The last two elements are the second and third elements of the input.\n\nBut in Example 3, this would not work, but perhaps it's the best possible.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # first three elements\n        first_three = row[:3]\n        # find first non-zero\n        first_non_zero = None\n        for val in row:\n            if val != 0:\n                first_non_zero = val\n                break\n        # if no non-zero, set to 0?\n        if first_non_zero is None:\n            first_non_zero = 0\n        # fill the rest with first_non_zero\n        # the rest is positions 3 to 9 (since it's 10 elements)\n        # but the first three are already taken, so the remaining 7 elements?\n        # wait, the row has 10 elements. So positions 0-9.\n        # first three are 0-2. Then, positions 3-9 (7 elements) are to be filled.\n        # but in the output, the last two elements are the second and third elements.\n        # So for the rest, positions 3-7 are filled with first_non_zero, and positions 8 and 9 are filled with row[1] and row[2].\n        # but this is not clear.\n        # So, the code would be:\n        # new_row = first_three + [first_non_zero] * 7\n        # then, replace the last two elements with row[1] and row[2]\n        # but this would be:\n        new_row = first_three.copy()\n        # fill positions 3-9 with first_non_zero\n        for i in range(3, 10):\n            new_row[i] = first_non_zero\n        # replace the last two elements with row[1] and row[2]\n        new_row[8] = row[1]\n        new_row[9] = row[2]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1.\n\nExample 1 row 0: input is [8,2,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nfirst_three is [8,2,8]\n\nfirst_non_zero is 8.\n\nnew_row is [8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nthen, replace positions 8 and 9 with row[1] (2) and row[2] (8). So new_row becomes [8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8]. Which matches the output.\n\nFor Example 1 row 1: input is [1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nfirst_three is [1,8,1], first_non_zero is 1.\n\nnew_row is [1,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], then replace positions 8 and 9 with row[1] (8) and row[2] (1). So new_row becomes [1,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,1]. Which matches the output.\n\nFor Example 3, row 0: input is [2,3,8,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nfirst_three is [2,3,8], first_non_zero is 2.\n\nnew_row is [2,3,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2], then replace positions 8 and 9 with row[1] (3) and row[2] (8). So new_row becomes [2,3,8,2,2,2,2,2,3,8]. But the actual output is [2,3,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. So this doesn't fit. But this suggests that this pattern is not correct.\n\nBut perhaps the example is wrong, or the pattern is different. Given that this pattern fits the first two examples, and the third example may have a different pattern, I'll proceed with this.\n\nSo the code is as described.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n3 8 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBut the output must be 3x10. So for each row, the first three elements are kept, then the rest are filled with the first non-zero element, and the last two elements are replaced with the second and third elements of the input.\n\nFor the first row of test input: [3,8,8,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 wait, this is 14 elements. But the input is supposed to be 3x10. So perhaps the input is 3 rows of 10 elements each. So perhaps the test input is:\n\nRow 0: 3 8 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 10 elements.\nRow 1: 2 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 10 elements.\nRow 2: 1 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 10 elements.\nRow 3: 2 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 10 elements.\n\nBut the problem says that the test input is 3x14. So this is conflicting. But the code is supposed to take any input and output 3x10. But the training examples have 3x10 inputs and outputs.\n\nAssuming that the test input is 3x10, then the code would work.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with the code as described.\n"

So, the input and output grids are 3 rows by 10 columns for the examples, but the test input is 3 rows by 14 columns. Wait, the problem says the output must always be 3x10. So the test input is 3x14, but the output is 3x10. Hmm, maybe the transformation is about expanding or modifying certain parts of the grid.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has 3 rows, each with 10 elements. The output is also 3 rows, each with 10 elements. Wait, the input in Example 1 is 3 rows of 10 elements each. The output is the same. Wait, but the input for Example 2 is 3 rows of 12 elements each? Wait, no. Let me check again. Oh, the input for Example 2 is given as:\n\nInput:\n3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, that's 3 rows, each with 12 elements.

Wait, the output for Example 2 is:\n\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3\nWait no, the output is given as:\n\nOutput:\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3\n1 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 1\n\nWait, each output row has 12 elements. But the problem says the output must be 3x10. Wait, maybe the examples are not correct? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 3x10. But the training examples show outputs with more columns. Wait, maybe the examples are not in the correct format. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the test input is 3x14, but the output must be 3x10. So the training examples must have outputs that are 3x10. But looking at Example 1's output:\n\nOutput:\n8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8\n1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n\nEach row has 10 elements. So the output is 3x10. So the input for Example 1 is 3 rows of 10 elements each. The output is same. So in Example 2, the input is 3 rows of 12 elements each? But the output is 3 rows of 12 elements each? But the problem says that the output must be 3x10. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe the examples have a typo. Or perhaps the input and output for the examples are not 3x10. Wait, maybe the examples are not in the correct format. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says that the output must always be 3\u00d710. So the training examples' outputs must be 3x10. But looking at Example 2's output, the first line is 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 \u2014 that's 13 elements. Wait, that can't be. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me count the elements in the output of Example 2.\n\nOriginal output for Example 2:\n\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 \u2014 that's 13 elements. But that's impossible. Wait, perhaps the example is written with some formatting issues. Maybe the output for Example 2 is 3 rows of 12 elements each. But the problem says that the output must be 3x10. So maybe the examples are not correct. Or perhaps there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input and output for the training examples are not 3x10. Maybe the problem is that the input is 3 rows by 10 columns, and the output is 3 rows by 10 columns. But the examples given have outputs with more columns. That seems conflicting. But perhaps the examples are not correctly formatted. For example, in Example 2, the output is written as:\n\nOutput:\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3\n1 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3\n1 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 1\n\nWait, each line has 12 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 3x10. So this is confusing. But perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the examples are correct. Maybe the output is 3x10, but in the examples, the output is written with more elements. Wait, perhaps the examples are not properly formatted. For example, maybe in Example 2, the output is 3 rows of 12 elements, but the problem says that the output must be 3x10. That would be a contradiction. But perhaps the examples are not correct. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input and output for the training examples are not 3x10. Let me check the problem again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Your task is to: 1. Analyze the training examples to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids 2. Write a Python program that implements your best understanding of the transformation 3. DO NOT predict or generate the test output - your job is only to write the transformation program 4. Attempt a solution - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis 5. Do not repeat the same transformation - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\"\n\nThe problem says that the output must always be 3\u00d710. So the input and output grids for the training examples must be 3x10. But looking at the examples given, perhaps they are not. For example, in Example 1, the input is 3 rows of 10 elements each. The output is also 3 rows of 10 elements each. So that's correct. But in Example 2, the input is given as 3 rows with 12 elements each, and the output is 3 rows with 12 elements each. But that's conflicting with the problem's requirement that the output is 3x10. So maybe the examples are not correct. Or perhaps the problem is that the input and output for the training examples are not 3x10, but the test input is 3x14, and the output is 3x10. So the function must take any input (possibly of varying size) and output a 3x10 grid. But that's not possible. So maybe the problem is that the input is 3x10, and the output is 3x10. But the examples have outputs that are 3x12. That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input for the training examples is 3 rows by 10 columns, and the output is 3 rows by 10 columns. So in Example 2, the input is 3 rows of 12 elements. That can't be. So there's a mistake here. But perhaps the examples are written with some formatting errors. For example, maybe the input for Example 2 is 3 rows of 10 elements, but the output is 3 rows of 10 elements. But the way it's written here is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are correct, and the problem is that the output must be 3x10, but the examples have outputs that are 3x12. But that can't be. So perhaps the problem is that the input is 3 rows by N columns, and the output is 3x10. So for example, the input in Example 1 is 3x10, output is 3x10. The input in Example 2 is 3x12, and the output is 3x10. But that's not possible. So maybe the examples are not correctly formatted. Alternatively, maybe the output for Example 2 is 3x10, but the way it's written here is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are correct, and the output for Example 2 is 3x10, but the way it's written is incorrect. For example, maybe the output for Example 2 is:\n\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 \u2014 but that's 12 elements. But that's not possible. So I'm confused. But given that the problem says that the output must be 3x10, I need to focus on that.\n\nSo, looking at the examples, perhaps the transformation is that the first few columns are kept, and the rest are filled with some pattern. For example, in Example 1, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 8 2 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output row 0: 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8. So the first three elements are the same, then the next elements are filled with 8s, then the last element is 8. Wait, but the output has 10 elements. The original input has 10 elements. So the output is same as input in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the non-zero elements. For example, in Example 1, the first row has 8, 2, 8, then zeros. The output is 8,2,8, then 8s, then 2,8. So maybe the zeros are replaced with the same value as the first non-zero element in some way. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput row 0: [8, 2, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput row 0: [8, 2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 2, 8]\n\nSo the first three elements are same as input. Then, the next 4 elements (positions 3-6) are 8s. Then, position 7 is 8, position 8 is 2, position 9 is 8. So maybe the zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, but then there's some pattern. Or maybe the zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, and then the last element is the same as the first non-zero element.\n\nBut in the input row 0, the first non-zero element is 8. Then, the output row 0 starts with 8, 2, 8, then 8s, then 2, 8. So maybe the zeros are replaced with 8s, but the last element is 8. But the original input has 0s after the first three elements. So the output is 8, 2, 8, then 8s (positions 3-6), then 2 and 8. But how does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the existing elements. For example, in the first row, the first three elements are kept, and then the next elements are filled with the same value as the first non-zero element. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the existing elements into a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input:\n\nRow 0: 3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 but that's 12 elements. But the output is 3x10. So maybe the input is 3x10, and the output is 3x10. But the way the example is written is confusing. Let me try to think of the examples as 3x10.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input is 3 rows of 10 elements each. The output is also 3 rows of 10 elements each.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is 3 rows of 10 elements each. The output is also 3 rows of 10 elements each. But the way it's written is confusing. Maybe the input for Example 2 is:\n\nInput:\n3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBut that's 3 rows of 10 elements each. Then the output is:\n\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 \u2192 but that's 12 elements. Wait, this is conflicting. Maybe the example is written with a typo. Perhaps the output for Example 2 is:\n\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 \u2192 but that's 12 elements. But the output must be 3x10. So maybe the example is wrong. Alternatively, maybe the output is 3 rows of 10 elements each, and the example is written with some formatting issues. For example, the output for Example 2 may be:\n\n3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 \u2192 but that's 12 elements. So this is impossible. Therefore, perhaps the examples are not correctly formatted. But given that the problem says that the output must be 3x10, I need to proceed with that.\n\nAssuming that the input and output are 3x10, let's try to find patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 8 2 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 1 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 1 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8\nRow 1: 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1\nRow 2: 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1\n\nSo for each row, the first three elements are the same as the input. Then, the next elements are filled with the same value as the first non-zero element in the row. But for row 0, the first non-zero element is 8. So the next elements are 8. Then, the last two elements are 2 and 8. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero element in the row. For example, in row 0, the first non-zero element is 8. So the zeros after the first three elements are replaced with 8. Then, the last element is 8. But in the output row 0, the last element is 8. So that's consistent.\n\nFor row 1: input is [1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The first non-zero elements are 1, 8, 1. So the zeros are replaced with 1? But in the output, the zeros are replaced with 1s. So the output row 1 is 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1. So the first three elements are 1,8,1. Then, the next elements (positions 3-6) are 1, and then position 7 is 1, then position 8 is 8, and position 9 is 1. Hmm, but why is position 8 8 and position 9 1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero element in the row. But in row 1, the first non-zero element is 1 (position 0). So all zeros are replaced with 1. But in the output, the first three elements are 1,8,1. Then, the next elements (positions 3-7) are 1s. Then, position 8 is 8, position 9 is 1. So that doesn't fit. So maybe this is not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the existing elements. For example, in row 0, the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element (8), and then the last element is the same as the first non-zero element. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for row 0, the first three elements are same as input, then the next elements are 8s. Then, the last two elements are 2 and 8. But the input row 0 has 2 in position 1, and 8 in position 2. Then, the output row 0 has 2 and 8 in the last two positions. So maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the same value as the first non-zero element, and then the last element is the same as the first non-zero element. But this doesn't explain the 2 in position 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by expanding the existing elements into a certain pattern. For example, in row 0, the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element (8), and then the last element is the same as the second element (2). But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the existing elements into a pattern where the first non-zero element is expanded to the right, and then the last element is the same as the second element. But this is getting too vague.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 2 3 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 but this is 14 elements. But the output must be 3x10. So perhaps the input is 3x10, and the output is 3x10. So maybe the input for Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 3 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 8 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 2 8 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThen the output is:\n\nRow 0: 2 3 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 1: 2 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 2: 2 8 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nSo the first four elements are same as input, then the next elements are filled with 2s. But in the output, the first four elements are 2,3,8,2. Then, the next elements are 2s. So maybe the pattern is that the zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero element in the row. But in row 0, the first non-zero element is 2 (position 0). So the zeros are replaced with 2. But in the output row 0, the first four elements are 2,3,8,2. Then, the next six elements are 2. So that fits.\n\nIn row 1, the input is 2 8 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. The first non-zero element is 2. So the zeros are replaced with 2. But the output row 1 is 2 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. So that fits.\n\nIn row 2, the input is 2 8 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. The first non-zero element is 2. So the zeros are replaced with 2. The output row 2 is 2 8 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. Which fits.\n\nSo in this case, the pattern is that for each row, the zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero element in the row. But in Example 1, the first non-zero element in row 0 is 8, and the zeros are replaced with 8. However, in the output of Example 1, the first three elements are 8, 2, 8, then the next elements are 8s, and then the last two elements are 2 and 8. Wait, but according to this pattern, the zeros would be replaced with 8. So the output row 0 would be 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8. But the actual output is 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8. So the last two elements are 2 and 8, not 8. So this contradicts the pattern.\n\nHmm. So maybe the pattern is not as simple as replacing zeros with the first non-zero element. Let's think again.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row of input is 8 2 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8. So the first three elements are same. The next elements are 8s. Then, the last two elements are 2 and 8. But why?\n\nLooking at the second row of input: 1 8 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1. So the first three elements are same. Then, the next elements are 1s. Then, the last two elements are 8 and 1. So the pattern here is that the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the first non-zero element (1), but the last element is the same as the second element (8) and the previous element (1)? Or maybe the last element is the same as the second element.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the existing elements in such a way that the first non-zero element is expanded to the right, and the last element is the same as the second element. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the first non-zero element is expanded to the right, and the last element is the same as the second element in the row. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1, row 0: the first non-zero element is 8. So the zeros are filled with 8, but the last element is 8. But the output row 0 has 2 and 8 as the last two elements. So maybe the pattern is that the first non-zero element is expanded to the right, and the last element is the same as the second element in the row.\n\nBut in row 0, the second element is 2. So the last element is 8. That doesn't fit. So this is confusing.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output, perhaps the pattern is different. Let's take Example 2's input:\n\nAssuming that the input is 3 rows of 10 elements each. For example:\n\nRow 0: 3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 1 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 3 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 1 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBut the output is:\n\nRow 0: 3 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 \u2192 but that's 12 elements. So this is not possible. So perhaps the examples are not correct. But given that the problem says that the output must be 3x10, I'll proceed under the assumption that the examples are correctly formatted, and that the output is 3x10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are not in the correct format. For example, in Example 2, the input has 3 rows of 12 elements each, but the output is 3 rows of 10 elements each. So the transformation is to take the first 10 elements of each row. But that would be a stretch. But that's possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, and the rest are filled with the same value as the first non-zero element. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs:\n\nIn Example 1, the output for row 0 is 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8. The first three elements are same as input. Then, the next elements are 8s, and the last two elements are 2 and 8. So perhaps the pattern is that after the first three elements, the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and then the last element is the same as the second element in the row.\n\nBut in row 0, the second element is 2, and the last element is 8. So that doesn't fit. Or maybe the last element is the same as the first element. In row 0, the first element is 8, and the last element is 8. Which fits. In row 1 of Example 1, the output is 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1. The last element is 1, which is same as the first element (1). So that fits. Similarly, row 2's output is same as row 1. So this seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for each row, the first three elements are kept as is. Then, the next elements are filled with the first non-zero element in the row. Then, the last element is the same as the first element.\n\nBut let's check this for Example 1:\n\nRow 0: first three elements are 8, 2, 8. First non-zero element is 8. So the next elements are filled with 8. The last element is 8 (same as first element). So the output row is 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8. But the actual output is 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8. So the last two elements are 2 and 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the pattern is not as simple as that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the second element in the row. For row 0, the second element is 2. So the last element is 8. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the third element. In row 0, the third element is 8. So the last element is 8. Which fits. But the output row 0 has 2 and 8 as the last two elements. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last two elements are the same as the second and third elements. For row 0, the second element is 2, third is 8. So the last two elements are 2 and 8. Which fits the output. For row 1, the second element is 8, third is 1. So the last two elements would be 8 and 1. Which fits the output row 1: 1 8 1 1 1 1 1 1 8 1. Yes, the last two elements are 8 and 1.\n\nAh, this seems to fit. So the pattern is:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- Keep the first three elements as they are.\n\n- Fill the next elements (from position 3 to position 7) with the value of the first non-zero element in the row.\n\n- Then, the last two elements are the second and third elements of the row.\n\nBut wait, in row 0, the first three elements are 8, 2, 8. The next elements (positions 3-7) are filled with 8 (the first non-zero element). Then the last two elements are 2 and 8. Which fits.\n\nIn row 1 of Example 1, the first three elements are 1, 8, 1. The first non-zero element is 1. So positions 3-7 are filled with 1. Then the last two elements are 8 and 1. Which fits the output.\n\nFor row 2 of Example 1, same as row 1.\n\nIn Example 3, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 2 3 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 first three elements are 2, 3, 8. The first non-zero element is 2. So positions 3-7 are filled with 2. Then the last two elements are 3 and 8. So the output row is 2 3 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 8. But the actual output is 2 3 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. So this doesn't fit. Wait, the output for Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 3 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nSo the last two elements are 2 and 2. But according to the pattern, the last two elements should be 3 and 8. So this contradicts the pattern.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that after the first three elements, the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element.\n\nIn Example 1, row 0: first non-zero is 8. So the next elements are 8s. The last element is 8. Which fits the output row 0's last element. But the second last element is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element. For row 0, the last element is 8. But the output row 0 has 2 and 8 as the last two elements. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs for Example 1 and 3:\n\nExample 1's output for row 0: 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8 \u2192 the first three elements are 8,2,8. Then, the next four elements are 8s. Then, the last two elements are 2 and 8. So the pattern could be that after the first three elements, the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and then the last two elements are the second and third elements of the row.\n\nIn Example 3's output for row 0: 2 3 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 \u2192 the first three elements are 2,3,8. Then, the next elements are 2s (first non-zero is 2). The last two elements are 2 and 2. But according to the pattern, they should be 3 and 8. So this doesn't fit. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, and the rest are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element.\n\nIn Example 1, row 0: first non-zero is 8. So the last element is 8. But the output row 0 has 2 and 8 as the last two elements. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, and the rest are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the third element.\n\nIn Example 1, row 0: third element is 8, so last element is 8. Which fits. In row 1, third element is 1, so last element is 1. Which fits. In Example 3's row 0, third element is 8, so last element is 8. But the output row 0 is 2 3 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 \u2192 last element is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has the first three elements of the input, and then some pattern. For example, in Example 1, the first three elements are kept, and then the rest are filled with 8s or 1s, and then the last two elements are filled with certain values.\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs for the examples and see if there's a pattern in how the zeros are replaced.\n\nIn Example 1:\n\nRow 0: input has 0s from position 3 to 9. Output has 8s from position 3 to 7, then 2 and 8.\n\nRow 1: input has 0s from position 3 to 9. Output has 1s from position 3 to 7, then 8 and 1.\n\nRow 2: same as row 1.\n\nIn Example 3:\n\nRow 0: input has 0s from position 4 to 9. Output has 2s from position 4 to 9.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, but for the last two elements, it's replaced with the value of the second and third elements.\n\nBut in Example 1, row 0, the second element is 2, third is 8. So the last two elements are 2 and 8. Which fits. In row 1, the second element is 8, third is 1. So the last two elements are 8 and 1. Which fits.\n\nIn Example 3, row 0: the second element is 3, third is 8. So the last two elements would be 3 and 8. But the output is 2 3 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the last two elements are 2 and 2. This doesn't fit. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the first element.\n\nIn Example 1, row 0: first element is 8, so last element is 8. Which fits. Row 1: first element is 1, so last element is 1. Which fits. In Example 3, row 0: first element is 2, so last element is 2. Which fits the output.\n\nSo for Example 3's row 0, the last element is 2. So the pattern is: after the first three elements, fill the rest with the first non-zero element, and the last element is the first element.\n\nBut how does this fit with the other examples?\n\nIn Example 1, row 0: the first three elements are 8, 2, 8. Then, the next elements are 8s (first non-zero is 8). The last element is 8 (first element). So the output row is 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8. But the actual output is 8 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 8. So the last two elements are 2 and 8. So this doesn't fit. But according to this pattern, the last element should be 8, and the previous element would be 8. So why is it 2 and 8?\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the first three elements are kept, and then the rest are filled with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element. But for the last two elements, it's possible that the second element is kept, and the last is the first non-zero element.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, and then the rest are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last two elements are filled with the second and third elements of the row.\n\nBut in Example 3, this doesn't fit. So perhaps the examples are not consistent, and I need to find another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has the first three elements of the input, and then the rest are filled with a certain value, and then the last two elements are filled with certain values. For example, in Example 1, the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last two elements are filled with the second and third elements of the input.\n\nBut in Example 3, this would mean that the last two elements are 3 and 8, but the output is 2 and 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, and then the rest are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element.\n\nIn Example 1, row 0: first non-zero is 8, so the last element is 8. Which fits. But the output has 2 and 8 as the last two elements. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about what the transformation does for each example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 3x10 grid. The output is also 3x10. The first three columns are the same as the input. Then, the next columns are filled with the value of the first non-zero element in the row. Then, the last two columns are filled with the second and third elements of the input.\n\nBut in Example 3, this doesn't fit. So perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to expand the first three columns and then fill the rest with the first non-zero element in the row, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element.\n\nBut this doesn't explain the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the first three elements are kept, then the rest are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element. But in Example 1, the last element is 8, which fits. But in the output, the last two elements are 2 and 8. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each row, the first three elements are kept, then the rest are filled with the value of the first non-zero element, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element. But for the last two elements, it's possible that the second element is kept, and the last is the first non-zero element.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the pattern that seems to fit most of the examples, even if it doesn't fit all.\n\nSo, the pattern is: for each row, the first three elements are kept, then the rest are filled with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, and the last element is the same as the first non-zero element.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output row 0 has last element as 8, which is the first non-zero element. But the second last element is 2, which is the second element of the input. So perhaps the pattern is that the last element is the first non-zero element, and the second last element is the second element of the input.\n\nThis seems to fit Example 1 and 3.\n\nFor Example 1, row 0: second element is 2, so second last is 2, last is 8.\n\nFor Example 3, row 0: second element is 3, so second last is 3, last is 2. But this doesn't fit. So this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the last two elements are filled with the second and third elements of the input. For example, in Example 1, row 0, the last two elements are 2 and 8, which are the second and third elements of the input. In Example 3, the last two elements are 2 and 2, which are not the second and third elements of the input. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to implement the pattern that seems to work for most examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBased on Example 1 and 3, the pattern is:\n\nFor each row:\n\n1. Keep the first three elements as they are.\n\n2. Find the first non-zero element in the row.\n\n3. Fill the remaining elements (from position 3 to 9) with the value of the first non-zero element.\n\n4. The last element is the same as the first non-zero element.\n\nBut this doesn't explain the second last element in Example 1. So perhaps the second last element is the second element of the input.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is:\n\nFor each row:\n\n- The first three elements are kept.\n\n- The next elements (positions 3 to 7) are filled with the first non-zero element.\n\n- The last two elements are filled with the second and third elements of the input.\n\nSo for Example 1, row 0, the last two elements are 2 and 8, which are the second and third elements of the input.\n\nFor Example 3, row 0, the last two elements are 3 and 8, but the output is 2 and 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps the examples are not correct, and this is the best pattern I can find.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Take the first three elements.\n\n- Find the first non-zero element in the row.\n\n- Fill the next elements (positions 3 to 9) with the first non-zero element.\n\n- The last two elements are the second and third elements of the input.\n\nBut in Example 3, this would not work, but perhaps it's the best possible.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # first three elements\n        first_three = row[:3]\n        # find first non-zero\n        first_non_zero = None\n        for val in row:\n            if val != 0:\n                first_non_zero = val\n                break\n        # if no non-zero, set to 0?\n        if first_non_zero is None:\n            first_non_zero = 0\n        # fill the rest with first_non_zero\n        # the rest is positions 3 to 9 (since it's 10 elements)\n        # but the first three are already taken, so the remaining 7 elements?\n        # wait, the row has 10 elements. So positions 0-9.\n        # first three are 0-2. Then, positions 3-9 (7 elements) are to be filled.\n        # but in the output, the last two elements are the second and third elements.\n        # So for the rest, positions 3-7 are filled with first_non_zero, and positions 8 and 9 are filled with row[1] and row[2].\n        # but this is not clear.\n        # So, the code would be:\n        # new_row = first_three + [first_non_zero] * 7\n        # then, replace the last two elements with row[1] and row[2]\n        # but this would be:\n        new_row = first_three.copy()\n        # fill positions 3-9 with first_non_zero\n        for i in range(3, 10):\n            new_row[i] = first_non_zero\n        # replace the last two elements with row[1] and row[2]\n        new_row[8] = row[1]\n        new_row[9] = row[2]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1.\n\nExample 1 row 0: input is [8,2,8,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nfirst_three is [8,2,8]\n\nfirst_non_zero is 8.\n\nnew_row is [8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8]\n\nthen, replace positions 8 and 9 with row[1] (2) and row[2] (8). So new_row becomes [8,2,8,8,8,8,8,8,2,8]. Which matches the output.\n\nFor Example 1 row 1: input is [1,8,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nfirst_three is [1,8,1], first_non_zero is 1.\n\nnew_row is [1,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], then replace positions 8 and 9 with row[1] (8) and row[2] (1). So new_row becomes [1,8,1,1,1,1,1,1,8,1]. Which matches the output.\n\nFor Example 3, row 0: input is [2,3,8,2,0,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nfirst_three is [2,3,8], first_non_zero is 2.\n\nnew_row is [2,3,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2], then replace positions 8 and 9 with row[1] (3) and row[2] (8). So new_row becomes [2,3,8,2,2,2,2,2,3,8]. But the actual output is [2,3,8,2,2,2,2,2,2,2]. So this doesn't fit. But this suggests that this pattern is not correct.\n\nBut perhaps the example is wrong, or the pattern is different. Given that this pattern fits the first two examples, and the third example may have a different pattern, I'll proceed with this.\n\nSo the code is as described.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n3 8 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBut the output must be 3x10. So for each row, the first three elements are kept, then the rest are filled with the first non-zero element, and the last two elements are replaced with the second and third elements of the input.\n\nFor the first row of test input: [3,8,8,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 wait, this is 14 elements. But the input is supposed to be 3x10. So perhaps the input is 3 rows of 10 elements each. So perhaps the test input is:\n\nRow 0: 3 8 8 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 10 elements.\nRow 1: 2 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 10 elements.\nRow 2: 1 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 10 elements.\nRow 3: 2 1 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 10 elements.\n\nBut the problem says that the test input is 3x14. So this is conflicting. But the code is supposed to take any input and output 3x10. But the training examples have 3x10 inputs and outputs.\n\nAssuming that the test input is 3x10, then the code would work.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with the code as described.\n"
