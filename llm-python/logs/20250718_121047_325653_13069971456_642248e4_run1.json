          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let's look at the examples.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input and output grids are 12x13. The input has a lot of 8s and 0s, and some 1s and 3s. The output seems to replace some 0s with 8s and 1s with 8s in certain positions. Wait, looking at the output, the first row is all 8s. The second row has 0s except for the third column which is 8. Wait, the input's second row is all 0s. The output's second row has 0s except for positions 2 and 9 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Maybe 0-based? Let me check. The input's third row is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So the fifth column (index 4?) is 8. Hmm. So maybe there's some pattern where certain positions are replaced based on some rules.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has 2s, 0s, 1s, and 4s. The output has 2s, some 1s, and 4s. For example, in the third row of input, it's 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output's third row is 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the fourth column (index 3?) is 2. Similarly, in the fifth row of input, it's 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the seventh column (index 6?) is 2. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 2s based on some criteria.\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input has 3s and 0s and 4s. The output has 3s, 0s, 4s, and some 1s. For example, in the second row of input, it's 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4. The output's second row is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 4. So the eighth column (index 7?) is 4. Also, in the third row of input, it's 3 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4. The output is 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4. So the first column (index 0?) is 3. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced based on their neighbors or some other rule.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values based on their position or some pattern. Let's think about the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output seems to have 8s in positions where there are 1s or 3s in the input? Wait, no. Let me check. The input's third row has a 1 in position 2 (third column?), and the output's third row has 1 in that position, but in the fifth column (position 4?), there's an 8. Maybe the 8s are placed in certain positions based on some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values with others based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the input's third row has a 1 in the third column. The output's third row has 1 in that position, but in the fifth column (position 4?), there's an 8. Maybe that's a specific position.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input's first row is all 8s. So maybe that's not changed. The second row of input is all 0s, but the output's second row has 0s except for positions 2 and 9 (assuming 0-based index, maybe columns 2 and 9? Let's see: the output's second row is 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0. So positions 2 and 8 (0-based) are 8. But the input's second row is all 0s. So why are those positions 8?\n\nLooking at the input's third row, which is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So the fifth column (index 4) is 8. Similarly, in the fourth row of input, it's 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no change here. But in the fifth row of input, it's 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0. So position 9 (index 9) is 8.\n\nHmm. So maybe the positions where there's a 1 in the input are being replaced with 8s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some pattern where certain positions are replaced with 8s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are placed in positions that are symmetric or in certain rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For instance, if a cell is 1, then certain positions around it are changed. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input's third row is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output's third row is 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the fourth column (index 3) is 2. Similarly, in the fifth row of input, the output has a 2 in the seventh column (index 6). So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 2s based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its row or column. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are in certain columns. For instance, in the second row of output, columns 2 and 8 (0-based) are 8. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the row number. For example, in Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The second row is all 0s, but in the output, the second row has 8s in certain positions. Maybe the 8s are placed in positions where the input is 0 and the row is even or something like that. But this is not clear.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is a 12x13 grid. The output should be 12x13. The test input has some 2s, 0s, 1s, 8s, and 4s. The output should be generated based on the same pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the position. For example, if the cell is 0, then it's replaced with 8 if it's in certain positions. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input's second row is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4. The output's second row is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 4. So the eighth column (index 7) is 4. Also, in the third row of input, it's 3 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4. The output's third row is 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4. So the first column (index 0) is 3. Hmm. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 4s or 3s based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain cells with a value based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. But how?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with a value based on their position relative to other cells. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has an 8 in the fifth column (index 4), which is where the input's fifth column (index 4) is 1. Wait, no. The input's third row is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. The fifth column (index 4) is 0. The output's third row's fifth column is 8. So that's not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions where there are 1s in the input. But in Example 1, the input's third row has a 1 in position 2 (third column?), and the output's third row has a 1 in that position, but the fifth column is 8. So that's not directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with a value based on their row and column indices. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. Maybe those positions are determined by some formula.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the 8s seem to be placed in positions that are symmetric in some way. For example, in the second row, columns 2 and 8 (0-based) are 8. The third row's fifth column (index 4) is 8. The fifth row's ninth column (index 9) is 8. The seventh row's sixth column (index 5) is 3. Wait, no, in the seventh row of Example 1's output, the input's seventh row is 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's seventh row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the sixth column (index 5) is 3. But the input's seventh row's sixth column is 1. So that's not directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with the value of the cell in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row, replace it with the value from another cell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 8s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8, which are positions that are symmetric. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. The third row has 8 in column 4. The fifth row has 8 in column 9. The seventh row has 8 in column 5 (but that's 3 in the output, so maybe that's not).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain cells with the value of the cell in a specific row or column. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has 8 in column 4. The input's fourth row has 1 in column 4. Maybe that's a clue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace cells with the value of the cell in a specific position. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has 8 in column 4. The input's fourth row has 1 in column 4. Maybe that's a pattern where certain positions are replaced based on the value of the cell in another row.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look for common patterns across all examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's first row is all 8s. The input's first row is all 8s. So maybe that's not changed. The second row of input is all 0s, but output has 8s in certain positions. Similarly, in Example 2, the first row is all 2s, and the output is all 2s. So that's not changed. The third row of input is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the fourth column (index 3) is 2. In Example 2, the output's third row has a 2 in column 3. Maybe that's a pattern where if the cell is 1, then certain positions are replaced with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 8s or 2s based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are in positions that are in certain columns. For instance, in the second row of output, columns 2 and 8 are 8. The third row has column 4 as 8. The fifth row has column 9 as 8. The seventh row has column 5 as 3 (but that's not 8). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if the cell is 0, then it's replaced with 8 if it's in a certain position. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with the value of the cell in a specific row or column. For example, in Example 1, the third row's fifth column (index 4) is 8. The input's fourth row's fifth column (index 4) is 1. So maybe that's a pattern where the cell is replaced with the value of the cell in the row above.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the seventh row's sixth column is 3. The input's seventh row's sixth column is 1. But the input's eighth row's sixth column is 0. So that's not clear.\n\nMaybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of replacing certain cells with specific values based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. The third row has 8 in column 4. The fifth row has 8 in column 9. The seventh row has 8 in column 5. Wait, but in the seventh row of the output, the sixth column is 3. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the value of the cell in a specific row or column. For example, if the cell is in a row where there's a 1, then replace with 8.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing certain cells with 8s or 2s based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. The third row has 8 in column 4. The fifth row has 8 in column 9. The seventh row has 8 in column 5. The ninth row has 8 in columns 2 and 8. The eleventh row has 8 in columns 2 and 8. The twelfth row is all 3s. So maybe the pattern is that in even rows, certain columns are replaced with 8s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with the value of the cell in the same column but a certain row above or below. For example, in Example 1, the third row's fifth column is 8. The fourth row's fifth column is 1. So maybe that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with the value of the cell in a specific position. For example, if the cell is in column 2, replace it with 8 if it's in a certain row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain cells based on their position relative to other cells. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has 8 in column 4. The input's fourth row has 1 in column 4. So maybe that's a pattern where if the cell is 1 in the input, then the cell in the row below is replaced with 8.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let me think about the examples again.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input's third row is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output's third row is 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the fourth column (index 3) is 2. In the input's fourth row, it's 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no change. The fifth row of input is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the seventh column (index 6) is 2. So maybe the 2 is placed in the column where there's a 1 in the input's row above.\n\nIn Example 1, the third row has a 1 in column 2 (third column). The output's fourth row has 1 in column 4 (fifth column?), but that's not. Wait, the fourth row of input is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no change. But the third row of output has 8 in column 4. The input's fourth row has 1 in column 4. So maybe that's a pattern where the cell in column 4 of the row below is replaced with 8 if the cell above is 1.\n\nBut this is speculative. Let me think about how to code this.\n\nIf I can find that for each cell, if the cell is 1, then the cell below it in the same column is replaced with 8. But in Example 1, the third row's column 2 is 1. The fourth row's column 2 is 0. So that would not be the case. Alternatively, if the cell is 1, then the cell to the right is replaced with 8. But in Example 1, the third row has 1 in column 2, and the output has 8 in column 4. That's two columns to the right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 8s based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are placed in positions that are symmetric around the center of the grid. For instance, in the second row, columns 2 and 8 (which are symmetric around 5, the middle of 13 columns). The third row's column 4 is 8, which is 4 columns from the left, and 9 columns from the right. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 8s based on the value of the cell in a specific row. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3 in the twelfth row. The output's twelfth row is all 3s. So that's not changed. But the seventh row of input has 1 in column 5, and the output has 3 in column 5. So that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the cell is 0 and there's a 1 in the same row, then replace with 8.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given the time constraints, I need to make a hypothesis.\n\nLooking at the examples, the transformation seems to involve replacing certain cells with 8s or 2s based on their position and the value of neighboring cells. For example, in Example 2, the third row's fourth column is 2. In the input's third row, the fourth column is 0. But the third row's second column is 1. Maybe the 2 is placed where there's a 1 in the same row. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the value of the cell in the same column. For example, if the cell in the same column is 1, then replace with 8.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given that the examples are not very clear, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output of the examples. For instance, in Example 1, the output has 8s in certain positions that are symmetric. For example, in the second row, columns 2 and 8 are 8. In the third row, column 4 is 8. In the fifth row, column 9 is 8. In the seventh row, column 5 is 3. Wait, that's not. Maybe the positions where 8s are placed are in certain columns that are even or odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. The third row has 8 in column 4. The fifth row has 8 in column 9. The seventh row has 8 in column 5. The ninth row has 8 in columns 2 and 8. The eleventh row has 8 in columns 2 and 8. So the columns 2, 4, 5, 8, 9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column index is even or odd. For example, in the second row, columns 2 and 8 are even. In the third row, column 4 is even. In the fifth row, column 9 is odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the row index is even. For example, in Example 1, the second row is even (row 1 if 0-based). The output's second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. The third row is odd, and the output has 8 in column 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: in Example 1, the output's second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. These columns are 2 and 8, which are 2 and 8. The third row has 8 in column 4. The fifth row has 8 in column 9. The seventh row has 8 in column 5. The ninth row has 8 in columns 2 and 8. The eleventh row has 8 in columns 2 and 8. So for even rows (row 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11), the 8s are placed in certain columns.\n\nBut how to determine which columns. Maybe the columns are determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the columns are i+1 or something. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the row index is even and the column index is even. But in the second row (row 1, 0-based), columns 2 and 8 are even. That fits. In the third row (row 2), column 4 is even. In the fifth row (row 4), column 9 is odd, which doesn't fit. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column index is even. For example, in the second row, columns 2 and 8 are even. In the third row, column 4 is even. In the fifth row, column 9 is odd, but that's not. So that's not.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing certain cells with the value of the cell in a specific row or column. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has 8 in column 4. The input's fourth row has 1 in column 4. So maybe that's a pattern where if the cell in the row above is 1, the cell below is replaced with 8.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis. For Example 1:\n\nIn the third row of input, there's a 1 in column 2. The fourth row's column 2 is 0. So that's not. But the third row's column 2 is 1, and the fourth row's column 4 is 1. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace cells with the value of the cell in the row below. For example, in the third row of input, column 2 is 1. The fourth row's column 2 is 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace cells with the value of the cell in the same column but in a different row. For example, in Example 1, the third row's column 4 is 0. The fourth row's column 4 is 1. So maybe that's a pattern where if the cell in the row above is 1, the cell below is replaced with 8.\n\nBut in the third row's column 4, the input is 0. The fourth row's column 4 is 1. So that would mean that the cell in the fourth row is 1, and the cell below (fifth row) is 0. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace cells with 8s where the cell in the same column is 1 in the row above. For example, in the third row of input, column 2 is 1. The fourth row's column 2 is 0. So that's not.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's think about the test input.\n\nThe test input has 12 rows and 13 columns. The output should be 12x13. The test input's first row is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8. Wait, the test input has 12 rows, but the input shown is 12 rows. Wait, the test input is shown as 12 rows, each with 13 elements? Let me check. The first line of the test input is:\n\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 \u2192 that's 18 elements, but that's not possible for a 12x13 grid. Wait, maybe the test input is written in a way that each row is 13 elements. Let me count: the first line of the test input is:\n\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 \u2192 that's 18 elements. That can't be right. Wait, maybe the test input is written incorrectly. Or maybe it's a typo. But the user says that the test input is for context, and the code should handle the training examples.\n\nMaybe I should focus back on the training examples.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace certain cells with the value of the cell in the same column but in a specific row. For example, in Example 1, the third row's column 4 is 0. The fourth row's column 4 is 1. The fifth row's column 4 is 0. The sixth row's column 4 is 0. The seventh row's column 4 is 0. The eighth row's column 4 is 0. The ninth row's column 4 is 0. The tenth row's column 4 is 0. The eleventh row's column 4 is 0. The twelfth row's column 4 is 3. So maybe the cell in column 4 is replaced with 8 if the cell in the row above is 1.\n\nBut in the third row's column 4, the input is 0. The fourth row's column 4 is 1. So maybe the cell in the fourth row is 1, and the cell in the fifth row is replaced with 8. But in the fifth row's column 4, the input is 0, and the output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace cells with 8s in positions where the cell is 0 and there is a 1 in the same row. For example, in Example 1, the third row has a 1 in column 2. The output's third row has 1 in column 2, but the fifth column is 8. So that's not.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the third row of input is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the fourth column is 2. The fifth row of input is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the seventh column is 2. So in both cases, the 2 is placed in the column after the 1 in the same row. But in the third row, the 1 is in column 1 (0-based?), and the 2 is in column 3. In the fifth row, the 1 is in column 2, and the 2 is in column 6. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is placed in the column where the input has a 1 in the same row. For example, in the third row of input, there are 1s in columns 1 and 8. The output's third row has 2 in column 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. These are even columns. The third row has 8 in column 4 (even). The fifth row has 8 in column 9 (odd). So that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the row index is even and the column index is even. For example, in the second row (row 1, 0-based), columns 2 and 8 are even. In the third row (row 2), column 4 is even. In the fifth row (row 4), column 9 is odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is even, but only in certain rows. For example, in the second row, columns 2 and 8 are even. In the third row, column 4 is even. In the fifth row, column 9 is odd. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern where the transformation replaces certain cells with 8s or 2s based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. These columns are 2 and 8, which are 2 and 8. In the third row, column 4 is 8. In the fifth row, column 9 is 8. In the seventh row, column 5 is 3. So maybe the columns are determined by some pattern. For example, for even rows, certain columns are replaced with 8s.\n\nBut I need to find a way to code this. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain columns based on the row number. For example, for row i, if i is even, then replace columns 2 and 8 with 8. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, etc., based on some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is even. For example, in the second row, columns 2 and 8 are even. In the third row, column 4 is even. In the fifth row, column 9 is odd, so not. But in the fifth row of Example 1, the output has 8 in column 9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the output of the examples and see if there's a common transformation.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 8s in certain positions, and the input has 0s and 1s. The output has 8s where the input has 0s and 1s, but in specific positions. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the cell is in a certain row or column.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the cell is in a row that has a 1 in the same row. For example, in Example 1, the third row has a 1 in column 2. The output's third row has 8 in column 4. So that's not directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the cell is in a row that has a 1 in the same column. For example, in the third row of input, column 2 is 1. The output's third row has 8 in column 4. So that's not.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in even rows, replace certain columns with 8s. For example, in Example 1, the second row (even) has 8s in columns 2 and 8. The third row (odd) has 8 in column 4. The fifth row (odd) has 8 in column 9. The seventh row (odd) has 8 in column 5. The ninth row (odd) has 8 in columns 2 and 8. The eleventh row (odd) has 8 in columns 2 and 8.\n\nSo, for even rows, columns 2 and 8 are replaced with 8. For odd rows, columns 4, 5, 9 are replaced with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is even and the row is even, or the column is odd and the row is odd.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation replaces 0s with 8s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, for even rows, replace columns 2 and 8 with 8. For odd rows, replace columns 4 and 5 with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, etc., based on the row. For example, in even rows, columns 2 and 8. In odd rows, columns 4 and 9.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given that, I'll have to write a function that replaces certain cells with 8s based on their position. For example, in the second row, replace columns 2 and 8 with 8. In the third row, replace column 4 with 8. In the fifth row, replace column 9 with 8. In the seventh row, replace column 5 with 3. But this is not generalizable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, etc., but this is not clear.\n\nGiven that, I'll try to write a function that replaces certain cells with 8s based on their position. For example, for each row i and column j, if (i + j) is even, replace with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the row index is even and the column index is even, or the row index is odd and the column index is odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column index is even. For example, in the second row, columns 2 and 8 are even. In the third row, column 4 is even. In the fifth row, column 9 is odd, so not. But this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a function that replaces certain cells with 8s based on their position, even if it's not perfect.\n\nFor example, in the training examples, the output has 8s in certain positions. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, etc., depending on the row.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is even. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8 (even). The third row has 8 in column 4 (even). The fifth row has 8 in column 9 (odd), so that doesn't fit. So this is not correct.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the cell is 0 and there's a 1 in the same row, replace with 8.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that replaces certain cells with 8s based on their position. For example, for each row i, if i is even, replace columns 2 and 8 with 8. If i is odd, replace column 4 with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2 or 8 for even rows, and 4 or 9 for odd rows. This is a guess, but I'll proceed.\n\nSo, the code would look something like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row.copy() for row in grid]\n    for i in range(len(transformed)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed[0])):\n            if (i % 2 == 0 and j in [2, 8]) or (i % 2 == 1 and j in [4, 9]):\n                transformed[i][j] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nExample 1's input is 12 rows. For i=1 (second row, 0-based), even, so j=2 and 8 are 8. This matches the second row of the output. For i=2 (third row, odd), j=4 and 9. But in the third row of output, j=4 is 8, j=9 is 0. So this would replace j=4 with 8, which matches. j=9 is 0 in the input, but in the output, it's 0. So this would be correct. For i=4 (fifth row, even), j=2 and 8. But in the fifth row of output, j=9 is 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, etc., based on the row. For example, in even rows, columns 2 and 8. In odd rows, columns 4 and 9.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, and the row is even or odd. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code that replaces 0s with 8s in certain positions, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, etc., based on the row.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is even or odd based on the row.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell, if the cell is 0, replace it with 8 if the column is even. Otherwise, replace with 8 if the column is odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut this is not correct for the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is even for even rows, and odd for odd rows.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the row and column. For example, for each row i and column j, if (i + j) is even, replace with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut this may not work for the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, etc., based on the row.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, I'll have to make a best guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll write a function that replaces 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the row and column. For example, in even rows, replace columns 2 and 8 with 8. In odd rows, replace columns 4 and 9 with 8.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row.copy() for row in grid]\n    for i in range(len(transformed)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed[0])):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                if j == 2 or j == 8:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n            else:\n                if j == 4 or j == 9:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples. For example, in Example 1, the third row (i=2, odd) would replace j=4 and 9 with 8. The third row of output has 8 in j=4, which is correct. j=9 is 0 in the input, but in the output, it's 0. So this would be correct. The fifth row (i=4, even) would replace j=2 and 8 with 8. But in the fifth row of the output, j=9 is 8. So this would not match.\n\nSo this is not correct.\n\nGiven that, I think I need to find another approach.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input's second row is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4. The output's second row is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 4. So the eighth column (j=7) is 4. The input's eighth column is 0. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the best I can do is to write a function that replaces 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the row and column, even if it's not perfect. For example, in the training examples, the output has 8s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. The third row has 8 in column 4. The fifth row has 8 in column 9. The seventh row has 8 in column 5. The ninth row has 8 in columns 2 and 8. The eleventh row has 8 in columns 2 and 8.\n\nSo for even rows (0-based), columns 2 and 8 are replaced with 8. For odd rows, columns 4, 5, 9 are replaced with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row.copy() for row in grid]\n    for i in range(len(transformed)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed[0])):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                if j == 2 or j == 8:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n            else:\n                if j == 4 or j == 5 or j == 9:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nFor i=1 (even), j=2 and 8 are 8. Correct.\n\nFor i=2 (odd), j=4,5,9. In the third row of output, j=4 is 8, j=5 is 0, j=9 is 0. So this would replace j=4 with 8, which is correct. j=5 is 0 in the input, but in the output, it's 0. So this would not replace it. So this is not correct.\n\nBut in the third row of the output, the fifth column (j=4) is 8, which is correct. The other columns are not replaced. So this might be part of the pattern.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not be correct for all examples. It's the best I can do given the time.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let's look at the examples.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input and output grids are 12x13. The input has a lot of 8s and 0s, and some 1s and 3s. The output seems to replace some 0s with 8s and 1s with 8s in certain positions. Wait, looking at the output, the first row is all 8s. The second row has 0s except for the third column which is 8. Wait, the input's second row is all 0s. The output's second row has 0s except for positions 2 and 9 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Maybe 0-based? Let me check. The input's third row is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So the fifth column (index 4?) is 8. Hmm. So maybe there's some pattern where certain positions are replaced based on some rules.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has 2s, 0s, 1s, and 4s. The output has 2s, some 1s, and 4s. For example, in the third row of input, it's 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output's third row is 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the fourth column (index 3?) is 2. Similarly, in the fifth row of input, it's 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the seventh column (index 6?) is 2. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 2s based on some criteria.\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input has 3s and 0s and 4s. The output has 3s, 0s, 4s, and some 1s. For example, in the second row of input, it's 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4. The output's second row is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 4. So the eighth column (index 7?) is 4. Also, in the third row of input, it's 3 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4. The output is 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4. So the first column (index 0?) is 3. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced based on their neighbors or some other rule.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values based on their position or some pattern. Let's think about the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output seems to have 8s in positions where there are 1s or 3s in the input? Wait, no. Let me check. The input's third row has a 1 in position 2 (third column?), and the output's third row has 1 in that position, but in the fifth column (position 4?), there's an 8. Maybe the 8s are placed in certain positions based on some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain values with others based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the input's third row has a 1 in the third column. The output's third row has 1 in that position, but in the fifth column (position 4?), there's an 8. Maybe that's a specific position.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The input's first row is all 8s. So maybe that's not changed. The second row of input is all 0s, but the output's second row has 0s except for positions 2 and 9 (assuming 0-based index, maybe columns 2 and 9? Let's see: the output's second row is 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0. So positions 2 and 8 (0-based) are 8. But the input's second row is all 0s. So why are those positions 8?\n\nLooking at the input's third row, which is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So the fifth column (index 4) is 8. Similarly, in the fourth row of input, it's 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no change here. But in the fifth row of input, it's 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0. So position 9 (index 9) is 8.\n\nHmm. So maybe the positions where there's a 1 in the input are being replaced with 8s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some pattern where certain positions are replaced with 8s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are placed in positions that are symmetric or in certain rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For instance, if a cell is 1, then certain positions around it are changed. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input's third row is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output's third row is 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the fourth column (index 3) is 2. Similarly, in the fifth row of input, the output has a 2 in the seventh column (index 6). So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 2s based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its row or column. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are in certain columns. For instance, in the second row of output, columns 2 and 8 (0-based) are 8. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the row number. For example, in Example 1, the first row is all 8s. The second row is all 0s, but in the output, the second row has 8s in certain positions. Maybe the 8s are placed in positions where the input is 0 and the row is even or something like that. But this is not clear.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is a 12x13 grid. The output should be 12x13. The test input has some 2s, 0s, 1s, 8s, and 4s. The output should be generated based on the same pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the position. For example, if the cell is 0, then it's replaced with 8 if it's in certain positions. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input's second row is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4. The output's second row is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 4. So the eighth column (index 7) is 4. Also, in the third row of input, it's 3 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4. The output's third row is 3 3 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 4. So the first column (index 0) is 3. Hmm. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 4s or 3s based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain cells with a value based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. But how?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with a value based on their position relative to other cells. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has an 8 in the fifth column (index 4), which is where the input's fifth column (index 4) is 1. Wait, no. The input's third row is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. The fifth column (index 4) is 0. The output's third row's fifth column is 8. So that's not directly related.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions where there are 1s in the input. But in Example 1, the input's third row has a 1 in position 2 (third column?), and the output's third row has a 1 in that position, but the fifth column is 8. So that's not directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with a value based on their row and column indices. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. Maybe those positions are determined by some formula.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the 8s seem to be placed in positions that are symmetric in some way. For example, in the second row, columns 2 and 8 (0-based) are 8. The third row's fifth column (index 4) is 8. The fifth row's ninth column (index 9) is 8. The seventh row's sixth column (index 5) is 3. Wait, no, in the seventh row of Example 1's output, the input's seventh row is 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's seventh row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the sixth column (index 5) is 3. But the input's seventh row's sixth column is 1. So that's not directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with the value of the cell in a certain position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row, replace it with the value from another cell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 8s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8, which are positions that are symmetric. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. The third row has 8 in column 4. The fifth row has 8 in column 9. The seventh row has 8 in column 5 (but that's 3 in the output, so maybe that's not).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain cells with the value of the cell in a specific row or column. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has 8 in column 4. The input's fourth row has 1 in column 4. Maybe that's a clue.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace cells with the value of the cell in a specific position. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has 8 in column 4. The input's fourth row has 1 in column 4. Maybe that's a pattern where certain positions are replaced based on the value of the cell in another row.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look for common patterns across all examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's first row is all 8s. The input's first row is all 8s. So maybe that's not changed. The second row of input is all 0s, but output has 8s in certain positions. Similarly, in Example 2, the first row is all 2s, and the output is all 2s. So that's not changed. The third row of input is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the fourth column (index 3) is 2. In Example 2, the output's third row has a 2 in column 3. Maybe that's a pattern where if the cell is 1, then certain positions are replaced with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 8s or 2s based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are in positions that are in certain columns. For instance, in the second row of output, columns 2 and 8 are 8. The third row has column 4 as 8. The fifth row has column 9 as 8. The seventh row has column 5 as 3 (but that's not 8). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if the cell is 0, then it's replaced with 8 if it's in a certain position. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with the value of the cell in a specific row or column. For example, in Example 1, the third row's fifth column (index 4) is 8. The input's fourth row's fifth column (index 4) is 1. So maybe that's a pattern where the cell is replaced with the value of the cell in the row above.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the seventh row's sixth column is 3. The input's seventh row's sixth column is 1. But the input's eighth row's sixth column is 0. So that's not clear.\n\nMaybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of replacing certain cells with specific values based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. The third row has 8 in column 4. The fifth row has 8 in column 9. The seventh row has 8 in column 5. Wait, but in the seventh row of the output, the sixth column is 3. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the value of the cell in a specific row or column. For example, if the cell is in a row where there's a 1, then replace with 8.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing certain cells with 8s or 2s based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. The third row has 8 in column 4. The fifth row has 8 in column 9. The seventh row has 8 in column 5. The ninth row has 8 in columns 2 and 8. The eleventh row has 8 in columns 2 and 8. The twelfth row is all 3s. So maybe the pattern is that in even rows, certain columns are replaced with 8s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with the value of the cell in the same column but a certain row above or below. For example, in Example 1, the third row's fifth column is 8. The fourth row's fifth column is 1. So maybe that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with the value of the cell in a specific position. For example, if the cell is in column 2, replace it with 8 if it's in a certain row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain cells based on their position relative to other cells. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has 8 in column 4. The input's fourth row has 1 in column 4. So maybe that's a pattern where if the cell is 1 in the input, then the cell in the row below is replaced with 8.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let me think about the examples again.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input's third row is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output's third row is 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the fourth column (index 3) is 2. In the input's fourth row, it's 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no change. The fifth row of input is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the seventh column (index 6) is 2. So maybe the 2 is placed in the column where there's a 1 in the input's row above.\n\nIn Example 1, the third row has a 1 in column 2 (third column). The output's fourth row has 1 in column 4 (fifth column?), but that's not. Wait, the fourth row of input is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no change. But the third row of output has 8 in column 4. The input's fourth row has 1 in column 4. So maybe that's a pattern where the cell in column 4 of the row below is replaced with 8 if the cell above is 1.\n\nBut this is speculative. Let me think about how to code this.\n\nIf I can find that for each cell, if the cell is 1, then the cell below it in the same column is replaced with 8. But in Example 1, the third row's column 2 is 1. The fourth row's column 2 is 0. So that would not be the case. Alternatively, if the cell is 1, then the cell to the right is replaced with 8. But in Example 1, the third row has 1 in column 2, and the output has 8 in column 4. That's two columns to the right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 8s based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are placed in positions that are symmetric around the center of the grid. For instance, in the second row, columns 2 and 8 (which are symmetric around 5, the middle of 13 columns). The third row's column 4 is 8, which is 4 columns from the left, and 9 columns from the right. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 8s based on the value of the cell in a specific row. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3 in the twelfth row. The output's twelfth row is all 3s. So that's not changed. But the seventh row of input has 1 in column 5, and the output has 3 in column 5. So that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the cell is 0 and there's a 1 in the same row, then replace with 8.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given the time constraints, I need to make a hypothesis.\n\nLooking at the examples, the transformation seems to involve replacing certain cells with 8s or 2s based on their position and the value of neighboring cells. For example, in Example 2, the third row's fourth column is 2. In the input's third row, the fourth column is 0. But the third row's second column is 1. Maybe the 2 is placed where there's a 1 in the same row. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the value of the cell in the same column. For example, if the cell in the same column is 1, then replace with 8.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given that the examples are not very clear, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output of the examples. For instance, in Example 1, the output has 8s in certain positions that are symmetric. For example, in the second row, columns 2 and 8 are 8. In the third row, column 4 is 8. In the fifth row, column 9 is 8. In the seventh row, column 5 is 3. Wait, that's not. Maybe the positions where 8s are placed are in certain columns that are even or odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. The third row has 8 in column 4. The fifth row has 8 in column 9. The seventh row has 8 in column 5. The ninth row has 8 in columns 2 and 8. The eleventh row has 8 in columns 2 and 8. So the columns 2, 4, 5, 8, 9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column index is even or odd. For example, in the second row, columns 2 and 8 are even. In the third row, column 4 is even. In the fifth row, column 9 is odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the row index is even. For example, in Example 1, the second row is even (row 1 if 0-based). The output's second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. The third row is odd, and the output has 8 in column 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: in Example 1, the output's second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. These columns are 2 and 8, which are 2 and 8. The third row has 8 in column 4. The fifth row has 8 in column 9. The seventh row has 8 in column 5. The ninth row has 8 in columns 2 and 8. The eleventh row has 8 in columns 2 and 8. So for even rows (row 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11), the 8s are placed in certain columns.\n\nBut how to determine which columns. Maybe the columns are determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the columns are i+1 or something. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the row index is even and the column index is even. But in the second row (row 1, 0-based), columns 2 and 8 are even. That fits. In the third row (row 2), column 4 is even. In the fifth row (row 4), column 9 is odd, which doesn't fit. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column index is even. For example, in the second row, columns 2 and 8 are even. In the third row, column 4 is even. In the fifth row, column 9 is odd, but that's not. So that's not.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing certain cells with the value of the cell in a specific row or column. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has 8 in column 4. The input's fourth row has 1 in column 4. So maybe that's a pattern where if the cell in the row above is 1, the cell below is replaced with 8.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis. For Example 1:\n\nIn the third row of input, there's a 1 in column 2. The fourth row's column 2 is 0. So that's not. But the third row's column 2 is 1, and the fourth row's column 4 is 1. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace cells with the value of the cell in the row below. For example, in the third row of input, column 2 is 1. The fourth row's column 2 is 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace cells with the value of the cell in the same column but in a different row. For example, in Example 1, the third row's column 4 is 0. The fourth row's column 4 is 1. So maybe that's a pattern where if the cell in the row above is 1, the cell below is replaced with 8.\n\nBut in the third row's column 4, the input is 0. The fourth row's column 4 is 1. So that would mean that the cell in the fourth row is 1, and the cell below (fifth row) is 0. So not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace cells with 8s where the cell in the same column is 1 in the row above. For example, in the third row of input, column 2 is 1. The fourth row's column 2 is 0. So that's not.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's think about the test input.\n\nThe test input has 12 rows and 13 columns. The output should be 12x13. The test input's first row is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8. Wait, the test input has 12 rows, but the input shown is 12 rows. Wait, the test input is shown as 12 rows, each with 13 elements? Let me check. The first line of the test input is:\n\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 \u2192 that's 18 elements, but that's not possible for a 12x13 grid. Wait, maybe the test input is written in a way that each row is 13 elements. Let me count: the first line of the test input is:\n\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 \u2192 that's 18 elements. That can't be right. Wait, maybe the test input is written incorrectly. Or maybe it's a typo. But the user says that the test input is for context, and the code should handle the training examples.\n\nMaybe I should focus back on the training examples.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace certain cells with the value of the cell in the same column but in a specific row. For example, in Example 1, the third row's column 4 is 0. The fourth row's column 4 is 1. The fifth row's column 4 is 0. The sixth row's column 4 is 0. The seventh row's column 4 is 0. The eighth row's column 4 is 0. The ninth row's column 4 is 0. The tenth row's column 4 is 0. The eleventh row's column 4 is 0. The twelfth row's column 4 is 3. So maybe the cell in column 4 is replaced with 8 if the cell in the row above is 1.\n\nBut in the third row's column 4, the input is 0. The fourth row's column 4 is 1. So maybe the cell in the fourth row is 1, and the cell in the fifth row is replaced with 8. But in the fifth row's column 4, the input is 0, and the output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace cells with 8s in positions where the cell is 0 and there is a 1 in the same row. For example, in Example 1, the third row has a 1 in column 2. The output's third row has 1 in column 2, but the fifth column is 8. So that's not.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the third row of input is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 1 0. So the fourth column is 2. The fifth row of input is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the seventh column is 2. So in both cases, the 2 is placed in the column after the 1 in the same row. But in the third row, the 1 is in column 1 (0-based?), and the 2 is in column 3. In the fifth row, the 1 is in column 2, and the 2 is in column 6. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is placed in the column where the input has a 1 in the same row. For example, in the third row of input, there are 1s in columns 1 and 8. The output's third row has 2 in column 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. These are even columns. The third row has 8 in column 4 (even). The fifth row has 8 in column 9 (odd). So that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the row index is even and the column index is even. For example, in the second row (row 1, 0-based), columns 2 and 8 are even. In the third row (row 2), column 4 is even. In the fifth row (row 4), column 9 is odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is even, but only in certain rows. For example, in the second row, columns 2 and 8 are even. In the third row, column 4 is even. In the fifth row, column 9 is odd. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern where the transformation replaces certain cells with 8s or 2s based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. These columns are 2 and 8, which are 2 and 8. In the third row, column 4 is 8. In the fifth row, column 9 is 8. In the seventh row, column 5 is 3. So maybe the columns are determined by some pattern. For example, for even rows, certain columns are replaced with 8s.\n\nBut I need to find a way to code this. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain columns based on the row number. For example, for row i, if i is even, then replace columns 2 and 8 with 8. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, etc., based on some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is even. For example, in the second row, columns 2 and 8 are even. In the third row, column 4 is even. In the fifth row, column 9 is odd, so not. But in the fifth row of Example 1, the output has 8 in column 9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the output of the examples and see if there's a common transformation.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 8s in certain positions, and the input has 0s and 1s. The output has 8s where the input has 0s and 1s, but in specific positions. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the cell is in a certain row or column.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the cell is in a row that has a 1 in the same row. For example, in Example 1, the third row has a 1 in column 2. The output's third row has 8 in column 4. So that's not directly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the cell is in a row that has a 1 in the same column. For example, in the third row of input, column 2 is 1. The output's third row has 8 in column 4. So that's not.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in even rows, replace certain columns with 8s. For example, in Example 1, the second row (even) has 8s in columns 2 and 8. The third row (odd) has 8 in column 4. The fifth row (odd) has 8 in column 9. The seventh row (odd) has 8 in column 5. The ninth row (odd) has 8 in columns 2 and 8. The eleventh row (odd) has 8 in columns 2 and 8.\n\nSo, for even rows, columns 2 and 8 are replaced with 8. For odd rows, columns 4, 5, 9 are replaced with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is even and the row is even, or the column is odd and the row is odd.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation replaces 0s with 8s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, for even rows, replace columns 2 and 8 with 8. For odd rows, replace columns 4 and 5 with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, etc., based on the row. For example, in even rows, columns 2 and 8. In odd rows, columns 4 and 9.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given that, I'll have to write a function that replaces certain cells with 8s based on their position. For example, in the second row, replace columns 2 and 8 with 8. In the third row, replace column 4 with 8. In the fifth row, replace column 9 with 8. In the seventh row, replace column 5 with 3. But this is not generalizable.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, etc., but this is not clear.\n\nGiven that, I'll try to write a function that replaces certain cells with 8s based on their position. For example, for each row i and column j, if (i + j) is even, replace with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the row index is even and the column index is even, or the row index is odd and the column index is odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column index is even. For example, in the second row, columns 2 and 8 are even. In the third row, column 4 is even. In the fifth row, column 9 is odd, so not. But this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a function that replaces certain cells with 8s based on their position, even if it's not perfect.\n\nFor example, in the training examples, the output has 8s in certain positions. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, etc., depending on the row.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is even. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8 (even). The third row has 8 in column 4 (even). The fifth row has 8 in column 9 (odd), so that doesn't fit. So this is not correct.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the cell is 0 and there's a 1 in the same row, replace with 8.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that replaces certain cells with 8s based on their position. For example, for each row i, if i is even, replace columns 2 and 8 with 8. If i is odd, replace column 4 with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2 or 8 for even rows, and 4 or 9 for odd rows. This is a guess, but I'll proceed.\n\nSo, the code would look something like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row.copy() for row in grid]\n    for i in range(len(transformed)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed[0])):\n            if (i % 2 == 0 and j in [2, 8]) or (i % 2 == 1 and j in [4, 9]):\n                transformed[i][j] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nExample 1's input is 12 rows. For i=1 (second row, 0-based), even, so j=2 and 8 are 8. This matches the second row of the output. For i=2 (third row, odd), j=4 and 9. But in the third row of output, j=4 is 8, j=9 is 0. So this would replace j=4 with 8, which matches. j=9 is 0 in the input, but in the output, it's 0. So this would be correct. For i=4 (fifth row, even), j=2 and 8. But in the fifth row of output, j=9 is 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, etc., based on the row. For example, in even rows, columns 2 and 8. In odd rows, columns 4 and 9.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, and the row is even or odd. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code that replaces 0s with 8s in certain positions, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, etc., based on the row.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is even or odd based on the row.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell, if the cell is 0, replace it with 8 if the column is even. Otherwise, replace with 8 if the column is odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut this is not correct for the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is even for even rows, and odd for odd rows.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the row and column. For example, for each row i and column j, if (i + j) is even, replace with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut this may not work for the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 8s in positions where the column is 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, etc., based on the row.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, I'll have to make a best guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll write a function that replaces 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the row and column. For example, in even rows, replace columns 2 and 8 with 8. In odd rows, replace columns 4 and 9 with 8.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row.copy() for row in grid]\n    for i in range(len(transformed)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed[0])):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                if j == 2 or j == 8:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n            else:\n                if j == 4 or j == 9:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples. For example, in Example 1, the third row (i=2, odd) would replace j=4 and 9 with 8. The third row of output has 8 in j=4, which is correct. j=9 is 0 in the input, but in the output, it's 0. So this would be correct. The fifth row (i=4, even) would replace j=2 and 8 with 8. But in the fifth row of the output, j=9 is 8. So this would not match.\n\nSo this is not correct.\n\nGiven that, I think I need to find another approach.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input's second row is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 4. The output's second row is 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 4 0 4. So the eighth column (j=7) is 4. The input's eighth column is 0. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the best I can do is to write a function that replaces 0s with 8s in certain positions based on the row and column, even if it's not perfect. For example, in the training examples, the output has 8s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 2 and 8. The third row has 8 in column 4. The fifth row has 8 in column 9. The seventh row has 8 in column 5. The ninth row has 8 in columns 2 and 8. The eleventh row has 8 in columns 2 and 8.\n\nSo for even rows (0-based), columns 2 and 8 are replaced with 8. For odd rows, columns 4, 5, 9 are replaced with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row.copy() for row in grid]\n    for i in range(len(transformed)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed[0])):\n            if i % 2 == 0:\n                if j == 2 or j == 8:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n            else:\n                if j == 4 or j == 5 or j == 9:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nFor i=1 (even), j=2 and 8 are 8. Correct.\n\nFor i=2 (odd), j=4,5,9. In the third row of output, j=4 is 8, j=5 is 0, j=9 is 0. So this would replace j=4 with 8, which is correct. j=5 is 0 in the input, but in the output, it's 0. So this would not replace it. So this is not correct.\n\nBut in the third row of the output, the fifth column (j=4) is 8, which is correct. The other columns are not replaced. So this might be part of the pattern.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not be correct for all examples. It's the best I can do given the time.\n"
