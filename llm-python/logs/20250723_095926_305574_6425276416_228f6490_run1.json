In Example 1, the output grid has some values changed from 5 to 8 in certain positions.\n2. In Example 2, values change from 0 to 3 in certain positions.\n3. In Example 3, values change from 2 to 0 in certain positions, and some values change from 5 to 8.\n\nFrom these examples, I observe that the transformation seems to involve:\n- Changing certain values to other values based on their position\n- Possibly replacing values in specific patterns or regions of the grid\n- Not changing all values, but only certain ones\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values based on their position. I'll assume that values in certain positions (like the middle of the grid) might be replaced with other values.\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values based on their position\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Example pattern: replace 5 with 8 in certain positions\n            if grid[i][j] == 5 and (i % 2 == 0 or j % 2 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            # Example pattern: replace 0 with 3 in certain positions\n            if grid[i][j] == 0 and (i % 3 == 0 or j % 3 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            # Example pattern: replace 2 with 0 in certain positions\n            if grid[i][j] == 2 and (i % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values based on their position\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Example pattern: replace 5 with 8 in certain positions\n            if grid[i][j] == 5 and (i % 2 == 0 or j % 2 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            # Example pattern: replace 0 with 3 in certain positions\n            if grid[i][j] == 0 and (i % 3 == 0 or j % 3 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            # Example pattern: replace 2 with 0 in certain positions\n            if grid[i][j] == 2 and (i % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 0):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

Specifically, it seems like values in certain positions are being replaced with other values based on some pattern.\n\nHere's my best guess at the transformation pattern:\n\n- For each cell in the grid:\n  - If the value is 5 and the cell is in a certain position (like row 2, column 2), change it to 8.\n  - If the value is 0 and the cell is in a certain position (like row 2, column 2), change it to 0.\n  - If the value is 2 and the cell is in a certain position (like row 2, column 2), change it to 0.\n  - If the value is 5 and the cell is in a certain position (like row 2, column 2), change it to 0.\n\nI'll implement this pattern in the transformation function.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Example 1 pattern: change 5 to 8 in certain positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5 and (i == 2 and j == 2) or (i == 2 and j == 3):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                \n    # Example 2 pattern: change 0 to 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0 and (i == 1 and j == 1) or (i == 1 and j == 2):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                \n    # Example 3 pattern: change 2 to 0 in certain positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2 and (i == 1 and j == 1) or (i == 1 and j == 2):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

There's a pattern where values in certain positions are modified based on their neighbors.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Replaces certain values with others based on their position and value\n- Applies transformations in a way that seems to match the examples\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define transformation rules based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified version that captures some of the observed patterns\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with 8 in certain positions\n                if i > 1 and j > 1 and i < 8 and j < 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Replace 0 with 0 in certain positions\n                if i > 1 and j > 1 and i < 8 and j < 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                # Keep 7 in certain positions\n                if i == 0 and j == 0 or i == 0 and j == 8 or i == 8 and j == 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 0 in certain positions\n                if i == 8 and j == 1 or i == 8 and j == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Keep 8 in certain positions\n                if i == 8 and j == 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace 3 with 0 in certain positions\n                if i == 5 and j == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Replace 6 with 0 in certain positions\n                if i == 8 and j == 7:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 0 in certain positions\n                if i == 8 and j == 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define transformation rules based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified version that captures some of the observed patterns\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with 8 in certain positions\n                if i > 1 and j > 1 and i < 8 and j < 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Replace 0 with 0 in certain positions\n                if i > 1 and j > 1 and i < 8 and j < 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                # Keep 7 in certain positions\n                if i == 0 and j == 0 or i == 0 and j == 8 or i == 8 and j == 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 0 in certain positions\n                if i == 8 and j == 1 or i == 8 and j == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Keep 8 in certain positions\n                if i == 8 and j == 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace 3 with 0 in certain positions\n                if i == 5 and j == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Replace 6 with 0 in certain positions\n                if i == 8 and j == 7:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 0 in certain positions\n                if i == 8 and j == 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
