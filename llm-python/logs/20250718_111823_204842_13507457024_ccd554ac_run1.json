In Example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid and the output is a 9x9 grid that appears to be the input repeated in a certain pattern.\n3. In Example 2, the input is a 2x2 grid and the output is a 4x4 grid that appears to be the input repeated in a pattern.\n4. In Example 3, the input is a 2x2 grid and the output is a 4x4 grid that appears to be the input repeated in a pattern.\n5. In Example 4, the input is a 3x3 grid and the output is a 9x9 grid that appears to be the input repeated in a pattern.\n6. In Example 5, the input is a 4x4 grid and the output is a 16x16 grid that appears to be the input repeated in a pattern.\n7. In Example 6, the input is a 4x4 grid and the output is a 16x16 grid that appears to be the input repeated in a pattern.\n\nFrom these examples, I hypothesize that the transformation is to repeat the input grid in a certain pattern to form a 9x9 output grid. The pattern seems to be that the input grid is repeated in a way that creates a larger grid.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Determine the size of the input grid\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    \n    # Create a 9x9 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Calculate how many times to repeat the input grid\n    repeat_rows = 3\n    repeat_cols = 3\n    \n    # Fill the output grid by repeating the input grid\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(9):\n            original_row = i // 3\n            original_col = j // 3\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[original_row][original_col]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid and the output is a 9x9 grid that appears to be the input repeated in a certain pattern.\n3. In Example 2, the input is a 2x2 grid and the output is a 4x4 grid that appears to be the input repeated in a pattern.\n4. In Example 3, the input is a 2x2 grid and the output is a 4x4 grid that appears to be the input repeated in a pattern.\n5. In Example 4, the input is a 3x3 grid and the output is a 9x9 grid that appears to be the input repeated in a pattern.\n6. In Example 5, the input is a 4x4 grid and the output is a 16x16 grid that appears to be the input repeated in a pattern.\n7. In Example 6, the input is a 4x4 grid and the output is a 16x16 grid that appears to be the input repeated in a pattern.\n\nFrom these examples, I hypothesize that the transformation is to repeat the input grid in a certain pattern to form a 9x9 output grid. The pattern seems to be that the input grid is repeated in a way that creates a larger grid.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Determine the size of the input grid\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    \n    # Create a 9x9 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Calculate how many times to repeat the input grid\n    repeat_rows = 3\n    repeat_cols = 3\n    \n    # Fill the output grid by repeating the input grid\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(9):\n            original_row = i // 3\n            original_col = j // 3\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[original_row][original_col]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
