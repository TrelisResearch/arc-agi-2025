          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid always has 5 rows and 7 columns, as required.\n2. The transformation seems to involve some form of pattern recognition and transformation of values based on their position and value.\n3. In Example 1, the input has a 7 in the 4th column of each row, and the output has a pattern of 8 and 7 alternating in that column.\n4. In Example 2, the input has a 7 in the 3rd column of each row, and the output has a pattern of 7 and 8 alternating in that column.\n5. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with alternating patterns of 7 and 8 based on their position and value.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with alternating patterns of 7 and 8 based on their position and value.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for i, val in enumerate(row):\n            if val == 7:\n                # Replace 7 with alternating 7 and 8 based on column index\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    new_row.append(7)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(8)\n            elif val == 0:\n                # Replace 0 with 0 or 8 based on column index\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(8)\n            else:\n                # For other values, keep them as is\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
