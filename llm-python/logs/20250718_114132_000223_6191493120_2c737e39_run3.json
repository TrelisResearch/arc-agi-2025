In Example 1, certain numbers (like 3, 1, 5, 7, 2) appear in the input and are replicated in specific positions in the output.\n2. In Example 2, numbers like 3, 2, 5 appear in the input and are replicated in specific positions in the output.\n3. In Example 3, numbers like 1, 5, 2, 3 appear in the input and are replicated in specific positions in the output.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replicating certain numbers from specific positions in the input grid to new positions in the output grid.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
