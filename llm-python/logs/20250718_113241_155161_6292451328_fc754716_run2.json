The non-zero value seems to be at the center of the output grid, and the output grid is always 3x3.\n\nLet me analyze each example:\n\n1. In Example 1, the input has a 2 in the center, and the output is a 3x3 grid with 2s on the edges and 0 in the center.\n2. In Example 2, the input has a 3 in the center, and the output is a 3x3 grid with 3s on the edges and 0 in the center.\n3. In Example 3, the input has a 1 in the center, and the output is a 5x7 grid with 1s on the edges and 0 in the center.\n4. In Example 4, the input has a 6 in the center, and the output is a 5x7 grid with 6s on the edges and 0 in the center.\n\nFrom these examples, I observe that the non-zero value in the input is \"expanded\" into a larger grid with that value on the edges and 0 in the center. The size of the output grid depends on the input grid size.\n\nFor the test input, the non-zero value is 8 in the center of a 7x7 grid. The output should be a 7x7 grid with 8s on the edges and 0 in the center.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find the position of the non-zero value\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[i])):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Create a new 3x3 grid with the non-zero value on the edges and 0 in the center\n                transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n                transformed_grid[0][0] = grid[i][j]\n                transformed_grid[0][1] = grid[i][j]\n                transformed_grid[0][2] = grid[i][j]\n                transformed_grid[1][0] = grid[i][j]\n                transformed_grid[1][2] = grid[i][j]\n                transformed_grid[2][0] = grid[i][j]\n                transformed_grid[2][1] = grid[i][j]\n                transformed_grid[2][2] = grid[i][j]\n                return transformed_grid\n    # If no non-zero value is found, return a 3x3 grid of zeros\n    return [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n```",
