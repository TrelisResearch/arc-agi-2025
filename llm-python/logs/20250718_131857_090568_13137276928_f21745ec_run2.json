          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to analyze the three training examples and see what transformation is being applied from input to output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a bunch of 0s and 8s, 6s, 4s, 5s. The output seems to have some changes. For instance, in the input, there's a row with 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 ... and the output has the same. But in other parts, like the third row, the input has 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 ... and the output changes some of the 0s to 6s. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain regions are replaced with other numbers. \n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has some 3s, 2s, 5s, 7s. The output seems to have some changes. For example, in the input, there's a row with 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 ... and the output keeps that. But in other parts, like the third row, the input has 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 ... and the output changes some of the 0s to 3s and others to 2s. Hmm, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled based on their location or some other rule.\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has 2s, 8s, 1s, 7s. The output changes some of the 2s to 6s, and the 7s to 1s. Wait, but in the third example, the output has some 1s in certain positions. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced based on their position or some other criteria.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers in specific regions. For example, in Example 1, the input has a block of 8s in the middle, and the output seems to keep those. But in other parts, like the middle of the grid, there are 6s and 4s. Wait, maybe the output is modifying certain areas based on their position. For instance, maybe certain regions are being filled with numbers based on their distance from the edges or some other criteria.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of mirroring or rotation. But looking at the examples, that doesn't seem to be the case. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 ... which is different from the input's third row. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in the first example, the input has a row with 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 ... which is the same in the output. But in other rows, like the third row, the input has 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 ... and the output changes some of the 0s to 6s. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with 6s or other numbers based on their location.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output, there's a row that starts with 0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 ... and the input's third row is 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 ... So maybe the output is modifying certain positions based on some rule. For example, maybe the positions that are in certain columns or rows are being modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced with others in specific regions. For instance, in Example 1, the input has a block of 8s in the middle, and the output keeps those. But in other parts, like the middle of the grid, there are 6s. Maybe the 6s are replacing certain 0s in specific areas.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the test input. The test input has 0s, 8s, 5s, 7s, 1s, 3s. The output for the test input is not given, but the task is to write a function that transforms the input grid according to the same rules as the training examples.\n\nLooking at the test input's first few rows:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8.\n\nAnd so on. The output for the test input is not given, but the function should be written based on the training examples.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have 6s in certain areas, while in Example 2, 2s and 5s are replaced. Maybe the transformation is replacing numbers in certain regions based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number's value and their position. For instance, numbers in certain rows or columns are replaced with other numbers. For example, in Example 1, the first row is all 0s in the input and output. But in the third row of Example 1, the input has 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 ... and the output changes some of the 0s to 6s. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their location.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has some 6s in the middle of the grid. In Example 2, there are 2s and 5s. In Example 3, there are 1s and 7s. Maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers in certain regions. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain numbers are replaced with others. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is surrounded by certain numbers, it's replaced with another. But that seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, cells in certain rows or columns are replaced. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has some 6s. Maybe the cells in certain positions (like columns 11-15) are replaced with 6s. But how to determine that?\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the third row is:\n\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6.\n\nThe input's third row is:\n\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6.\n\nWait, that's the same. Wait, no, the input's third row in Example 1 is:\n\nOriginal input row 3: 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6.\n\nBut the output for that row is:\n\n0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6.\n\nWait, that's different. So maybe the transformation is not straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain numbers are replaced based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has some 8s in positions that were 0s in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with others based on their position in the grid. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain numbers are replaced with 6s. But how to determine that?\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output of Example 1, the third row has 0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 ... which suggests that some 0s are being replaced with 8s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a certain number, it's replaced. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number's value and its position. For example, cells in certain columns are replaced with other numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of consecutive same numbers. For example, in Example 1's input, the third row has a sequence of 0s, and the output changes some of them to 6s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, cells in the middle of the grid are replaced with certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in the middle columns. \n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the training examples. \n\nIn Example 1, the input has a row with 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 ... which is the same in the output. But in the third row, the input has 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 ... and the output has 0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 ... which suggests that some 0s are replaced with 8s. But why?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's third row: the 0s in positions 3-5 (columns 3,4,5) are replaced with 8s? Or maybe not. Let me check:\n\nInput row 3 (third row of input) is:\n\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6.\n\nOutput row 3 is:\n\n0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6.\n\nSo, the input's third row has 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 6 ... and the output has 0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 ... So, in the input, the fourth column (index 3) is 0, but in the output it's 8. Similarly, the fifth column (index 4) is 0 in input, but in the output it's 8. Then, the sixth column (index 5) is 0 in input, but output is 0. So that's a bit inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in neighboring cells. For example, if a cell is adjacent to an 8, it's replaced with 8. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number's position in the grid. For example, certain rows or columns are being modified. \n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all 0s, same as input. The second row is same as input. The third row has some changes. The fourth row has some changes. \n\nIn Example 2, the output has some changes in the third row. For example, input row 3 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2. The output row 3 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2. So, the 9th column (index 8) is 0 in input and 0 in output. But the 9th column is 0 in input and 3 in output? Wait, maybe I'm getting the indexes wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on certain patterns of numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has a block of 6s in the middle. In Example 2, the output has 2s and 5s in certain positions. In Example 3, the output has 1s and 7s in certain positions. \n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers in certain regions based on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain numbers are replaced with others. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation involves replacing numbers in certain regions based on their value. For example, if a cell has a 0, it's replaced with a certain number based on its position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from the edges. For example, cells in the middle of the grid are replaced with certain numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers. For example, if a cell is part of a certain shape, it's replaced. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, the first row is all 0s. The second row has 8s in columns 12-23. The third row has 5s in columns 2-9, and 8s in column 12. The output for the test input is not given, but the function needs to be written based on the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of times a certain number appears in the row or column. \n\nAnother possible pattern: In Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions. In Example 2, 2s and 5s. In Example 3, 1s and 7s. Maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, numbers in certain columns are replaced. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is in a certain range. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in columns 11-15 (assuming 0-based indexing). Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's output, the third row has 6s in columns 11-15 (assuming the row is 0-based). But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. \n\nBut how to determine this from the examples?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the pattern in the three examples. \n\nIn Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions. In Example 2, the output has 2s and 5s. In Example 3, the output has 1s and 7s. \n\nWait, in Example 3's input, there are 7s in certain positions. The output has 1s in those positions. For example, the input's row 17 has 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 ... and the output has 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... but that's not the case. Wait, looking at Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput row 17: 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nOutput row 17: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nSo the 7s are replaced with 0s. But in other rows, like row 16, the input has 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. The output has 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So the 7s are replaced with 0s, but the 1s are kept. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation might be replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in Example 3, the 7s are replaced with 0s in certain regions. \n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions. In Example 2, the output has 2s and 5s. In Example 3, the output has 1s and 7s. It's possible that the transformation is replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number's value and their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row, it's replaced with a certain number. \n\nBut how to determine this from the examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in the input. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 8s, it's replaced with 6s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output of Example 1, the third row has 0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 ... which suggests that some cells are being replaced with 8s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of consecutive 0s in a row. For example, if there are three 0s in a row, replace them with 6s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position. For example, cells in the middle of the grid are replaced with certain numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's row and column indices. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is in a certain range. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nLet me think about the test input. The test input has a row with 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8. The output for this would be something that follows the same pattern as the training examples. \n\nBut since I don't have the output, I need to find a pattern that fits the training examples. \n\nLooking at the three examples, it's possible that the transformation involves replacing certain numbers in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions. In Example 2, 2s and 5s. In Example 3, 1s and 7s. \n\nAnother possible pattern: In each example, certain numbers are replaced with others based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in certain columns. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 1's output, the third row has 6s in columns 11-15. The input's third row has 6s in columns 11-15. Wait, no. The input's third row in Example 1 is:\n\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6.\n\nSo columns 11-15 are 6s. The output's third row is:\n\n0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6.\n\nSo columns 11-15 are 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output's fourth row has 0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6. So the 6s are in columns 11-15. But in the input, they were already there. So maybe the transformation is not changing those positions. \n\nThis suggests that maybe the transformation is not replacing those 6s, but other parts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain column, it's replaced with a certain number. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output's third row has 6s in columns 11-15. But the input's third row already had 6s in those columns. So maybe the transformation is not changing those. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that can be implemented in code. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is based on the number of times a certain number appears in the row or column. For example, if a row has a certain number of 0s, replace them with 6s. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number's value and its position. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, replace it with a certain number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 8s, replace it with 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be implemented. For example, in the training examples, the output seems to have certain numbers in specific regions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions, and in Example 2, 2s and 5s. \n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with 6, 2, or 1 depending on the example.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is in a certain range. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in certain columns. Let's look at the columns where 6s appear in the output. In the third row of Example 1, columns 11-15 are 6s. In other rows, maybe similar patterns. \n\nBut this is too vague. \n\nAnother possible pattern: In the examples, the output seems to have certain numbers in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in the middle of the grid, while in Example 2, 2s and 5s are in certain positions. \n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers in the grid with others based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific number. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in the middle of the grid. Maybe the transformation is replacing cells in certain rows or columns with 6s. \n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in the input. For example, if a cell is in a row that has 8s, it's replaced with 6s. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to know. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nLooking at the three examples, it seems that the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in the middle of the grid. In Example 2, 2s and 5s are in certain positions. In Example 3, 1s and 7s are in certain positions. \n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers in certain regions of the grid. For example, the middle region is replaced with certain numbers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the number's value and its position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row, it's replaced with a certain number. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, I need to make an assumption. \n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions, and the input has 6s in those positions. So maybe the transformation is not changing those. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of consecutive same numbers in a row. For example, if there are three consecutive 0s, replace them with 6s. \n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid (rows 5-14, columns 5-14), replace it with 6, 2, or 1. \n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be implemented. For example, in the examples, the output has certain numbers in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, columns 11-15 in certain rows are 6s. \n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing cells in certain columns with certain numbers. For example, columns 11-15 are replaced with 6s. \n\nBut how to verify this?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output, in row 3, columns 11-15 are 6s in both input and output. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even, replace certain columns. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to know.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. \n\nPerhaps the transformation is replacing certain numbers in the grid based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain number. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is replacing cells in columns 11-15 with 6s. \n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of times a certain number appears in the grid. \n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess. \n\nPerhaps the transformation is based on the following: \n\n- For cells in certain rows or columns, replace them with certain numbers. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is replacing cells in columns 11-15 with 6s. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number's value and their position. For example, if a cell is in a row that has 8s, replace it with 6s. \n\nBut again, this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain numbers based on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid, replace 0s with 6s, 2s with 5s, etc. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nPerhaps the function can check if the cell is in a certain region of the grid and replace it accordingly. \n\nFor example, in the middle of the grid (rows 5-14, columns 5-14), replace 0s with 6s. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the function could replace 0s with certain numbers based on their position. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to know. \n\nGiven the examples, I think the best approach is to look for patterns in the output of the examples and try to find a rule that can be implemented. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions. In Example 2, 2s and 5s. In Example 3, 1s and 7s. \n\nPerhaps the transformation is replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain number. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother idea: In the examples, the output seems to have certain numbers in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in the middle of the grid. In Example 2, 2s and 5s in certain positions. In Example 3, 1s and 7s in certain positions. \n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the following: \n\n- Replace 0s in certain regions with 6s, 2s, 1s, etc., depending on the region. \n\nBut how to determine which regions?\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the row is even, replace with certain numbers. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to know. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess and write a function that replaces certain numbers based on their position. For example, replace 0s in certain columns with 6s. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 8s in the row. For example, if a row has a certain number of 8s, replace other numbers with 6s. \n\nBut again, this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that I need to provide a solution, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nAssume that the transformation replaces certain numbers in certain regions of the grid. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain numbers are replaced with others. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nPerhaps the transformation is based on the following:\n\n- For cells in rows 5-14 (middle rows) and columns 5-14 (middle columns), replace 0s with 6s, 2s with 5s, etc. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is based on the following: \n\n- Replace 0s with 6s in certain columns. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in columns 11-15. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 0s with 6s in certain columns, and 8s with other numbers. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is based on the following: \n\n- For each cell, if it's in the middle of the grid, replace it with a certain value. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code. \n\nAt this point, I'll have to make a guess and write a function that replaces certain numbers based on their position. \n\nFor example, in the middle of the grid, replace 0s with 6s. \n\nBut how to determine the middle? \n\nMaybe the middle is rows 5-14 and columns 5-14. \n\nSo, for each cell in rows 5-14 and columns 5-14, replace 0 with 6. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nLet's see if this fits the examples. \n\nIn Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions. For example, in row 3, columns 11-15 are 6s. If the middle is rows 5-14 and columns 5-14, then row 3 is not in the middle. So this might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, the middle is rows 5-14 and columns 5-14. \n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 6s in columns 11-15, which is in the middle. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach. \n\nSo the function would check if the cell is in the middle of the grid (rows 5-14, columns 5-14), and replace 0s with 6s. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the row is even, replace certain columns. \n\nBut without knowing, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Replace 0s in the middle of the grid with 6s\n    for i in range(5, 14):\n        for j in range(5, 14):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                transformed[i][j] = 6\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess and may not fit the examples. \n\nHowever, looking at Example 1's output, the third row (i=2) is not in the middle (rows 5-14), so this might not apply. \n\nAlternatively, the middle is rows 5-14 and columns 5-14, but in Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions that are not in this range. \n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll have to proceed with this approach, even though it's not certain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 8s in the row. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother idea: In the examples, the output has certain numbers in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in the middle of the grid. In Example 2, 2s and 5s. In Example 3, 1s and 7s. \n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 6s in certain regions. \n\nBut without knowing the exact regions, it's hard to code. \n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern in the examples and write code that replaces certain numbers based on their position. \n\nFor example, in the test input, the third row has 5s in columns 2-9, and the output may replace them with 6s or other numbers. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, I'm stuck. \n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a guess and write a function that replaces 0s with 6s in certain columns. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nFinal answer:\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to analyze the three training examples and see what transformation is being applied from input to output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a bunch of 0s and 8s, 6s, 4s, 5s. The output seems to have some changes. For instance, in the input, there's a row with 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 ... and the output has the same. But in other parts, like the third row, the input has 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 ... and the output changes some of the 0s to 6s. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain regions are replaced with other numbers. \n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has some 3s, 2s, 5s, 7s. The output seems to have some changes. For example, in the input, there's a row with 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 ... and the output keeps that. But in other parts, like the third row, the input has 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 ... and the output changes some of the 0s to 3s and others to 2s. Hmm, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled based on their location or some other rule.\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has 2s, 8s, 1s, 7s. The output changes some of the 2s to 6s, and the 7s to 1s. Wait, but in the third example, the output has some 1s in certain positions. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced based on their position or some other criteria.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers in specific regions. For example, in Example 1, the input has a block of 8s in the middle, and the output seems to keep those. But in other parts, like the middle of the grid, there are 6s and 4s. Wait, maybe the output is modifying certain areas based on their position. For instance, maybe certain regions are being filled with numbers based on their distance from the edges or some other criteria.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of mirroring or rotation. But looking at the examples, that doesn't seem to be the case. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 ... which is different from the input's third row. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in the first example, the input has a row with 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 ... which is the same in the output. But in other rows, like the third row, the input has 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 ... and the output changes some of the 0s to 6s. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with 6s or other numbers based on their location.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output, there's a row that starts with 0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 ... and the input's third row is 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 ... So maybe the output is modifying certain positions based on some rule. For example, maybe the positions that are in certain columns or rows are being modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced with others in specific regions. For instance, in Example 1, the input has a block of 8s in the middle, and the output keeps those. But in other parts, like the middle of the grid, there are 6s. Maybe the 6s are replacing certain 0s in specific areas.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the test input. The test input has 0s, 8s, 5s, 7s, 1s, 3s. The output for the test input is not given, but the task is to write a function that transforms the input grid according to the same rules as the training examples.\n\nLooking at the test input's first few rows:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8.\n\nAnd so on. The output for the test input is not given, but the function should be written based on the training examples.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have 6s in certain areas, while in Example 2, 2s and 5s are replaced. Maybe the transformation is replacing numbers in certain regions based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number's value and their position. For instance, numbers in certain rows or columns are replaced with other numbers. For example, in Example 1, the first row is all 0s in the input and output. But in the third row of Example 1, the input has 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 ... and the output changes some of the 0s to 6s. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their location.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has some 6s in the middle of the grid. In Example 2, there are 2s and 5s. In Example 3, there are 1s and 7s. Maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers in certain regions. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain numbers are replaced with others. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is surrounded by certain numbers, it's replaced with another. But that seems complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, cells in certain rows or columns are replaced. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has some 6s. Maybe the cells in certain positions (like columns 11-15) are replaced with 6s. But how to determine that?\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the third row is:\n\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6.\n\nThe input's third row is:\n\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6.\n\nWait, that's the same. Wait, no, the input's third row in Example 1 is:\n\nOriginal input row 3: 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6.\n\nBut the output for that row is:\n\n0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6.\n\nWait, that's different. So maybe the transformation is not straightforward. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain numbers are replaced based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row has some 8s in positions that were 0s in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with others based on their position in the grid. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain numbers are replaced with 6s. But how to determine that?\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output of Example 1, the third row has 0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 ... which suggests that some 0s are being replaced with 8s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a certain number, it's replaced. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number's value and its position. For example, cells in certain columns are replaced with other numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of consecutive same numbers. For example, in Example 1's input, the third row has a sequence of 0s, and the output changes some of them to 6s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, cells in the middle of the grid are replaced with certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in the middle columns. \n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the training examples. \n\nIn Example 1, the input has a row with 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 ... which is the same in the output. But in the third row, the input has 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 ... and the output has 0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 ... which suggests that some 0s are replaced with 8s. But why?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's third row: the 0s in positions 3-5 (columns 3,4,5) are replaced with 8s? Or maybe not. Let me check:\n\nInput row 3 (third row of input) is:\n\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6.\n\nOutput row 3 is:\n\n0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6.\n\nSo, the input's third row has 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 6 ... and the output has 0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 ... So, in the input, the fourth column (index 3) is 0, but in the output it's 8. Similarly, the fifth column (index 4) is 0 in input, but in the output it's 8. Then, the sixth column (index 5) is 0 in input, but output is 0. So that's a bit inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in neighboring cells. For example, if a cell is adjacent to an 8, it's replaced with 8. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number's position in the grid. For example, certain rows or columns are being modified. \n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all 0s, same as input. The second row is same as input. The third row has some changes. The fourth row has some changes. \n\nIn Example 2, the output has some changes in the third row. For example, input row 3 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2. The output row 3 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2. So, the 9th column (index 8) is 0 in input and 0 in output. But the 9th column is 0 in input and 3 in output? Wait, maybe I'm getting the indexes wrong. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on certain patterns of numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has a block of 6s in the middle. In Example 2, the output has 2s and 5s in certain positions. In Example 3, the output has 1s and 7s in certain positions. \n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers in certain regions based on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain numbers are replaced with others. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation involves replacing numbers in certain regions based on their value. For example, if a cell has a 0, it's replaced with a certain number based on its position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from the edges. For example, cells in the middle of the grid are replaced with certain numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers. For example, if a cell is part of a certain shape, it's replaced. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, the first row is all 0s. The second row has 8s in columns 12-23. The third row has 5s in columns 2-9, and 8s in column 12. The output for the test input is not given, but the function needs to be written based on the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of times a certain number appears in the row or column. \n\nAnother possible pattern: In Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions. In Example 2, 2s and 5s. In Example 3, 1s and 7s. Maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, numbers in certain columns are replaced. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is in a certain range. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in columns 11-15 (assuming 0-based indexing). Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's output, the third row has 6s in columns 11-15 (assuming the row is 0-based). But I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced. \n\nBut how to determine this from the examples?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the pattern in the three examples. \n\nIn Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions. In Example 2, the output has 2s and 5s. In Example 3, the output has 1s and 7s. \n\nWait, in Example 3's input, there are 7s in certain positions. The output has 1s in those positions. For example, the input's row 17 has 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 ... and the output has 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... but that's not the case. Wait, looking at Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput row 17: 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nOutput row 17: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nSo the 7s are replaced with 0s. But in other rows, like row 16, the input has 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. The output has 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So the 7s are replaced with 0s, but the 1s are kept. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation might be replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in Example 3, the 7s are replaced with 0s in certain regions. \n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions. In Example 2, the output has 2s and 5s. In Example 3, the output has 1s and 7s. It's possible that the transformation is replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number's value and their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row, it's replaced with a certain number. \n\nBut how to determine this from the examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in the input. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 8s, it's replaced with 6s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output of Example 1, the third row has 0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 ... which suggests that some cells are being replaced with 8s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of consecutive 0s in a row. For example, if there are three 0s in a row, replace them with 6s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position. For example, cells in the middle of the grid are replaced with certain numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's row and column indices. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is in a certain range. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nLet me think about the test input. The test input has a row with 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8. The output for this would be something that follows the same pattern as the training examples. \n\nBut since I don't have the output, I need to find a pattern that fits the training examples. \n\nLooking at the three examples, it's possible that the transformation involves replacing certain numbers in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions. In Example 2, 2s and 5s. In Example 3, 1s and 7s. \n\nAnother possible pattern: In each example, certain numbers are replaced with others based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in certain columns. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 1's output, the third row has 6s in columns 11-15. The input's third row has 6s in columns 11-15. Wait, no. The input's third row in Example 1 is:\n\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6.\n\nSo columns 11-15 are 6s. The output's third row is:\n\n0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6.\n\nSo columns 11-15 are 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6. Not sure.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output's fourth row has 0 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 6 6. So the 6s are in columns 11-15. But in the input, they were already there. So maybe the transformation is not changing those positions. \n\nThis suggests that maybe the transformation is not replacing those 6s, but other parts. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain column, it's replaced with a certain number. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output's third row has 6s in columns 11-15. But the input's third row already had 6s in those columns. So maybe the transformation is not changing those. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that can be implemented in code. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is based on the number of times a certain number appears in the row or column. For example, if a row has a certain number of 0s, replace them with 6s. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number's value and its position. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, replace it with a certain number. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 8s, replace it with 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be implemented. For example, in the training examples, the output seems to have certain numbers in specific regions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions, and in Example 2, 2s and 5s. \n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with 6, 2, or 1 depending on the example.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is in a certain range. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in certain columns. Let's look at the columns where 6s appear in the output. In the third row of Example 1, columns 11-15 are 6s. In other rows, maybe similar patterns. \n\nBut this is too vague. \n\nAnother possible pattern: In the examples, the output seems to have certain numbers in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in the middle of the grid, while in Example 2, 2s and 5s are in certain positions. \n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers in the grid with others based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific number. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in the middle of the grid. Maybe the transformation is replacing cells in certain rows or columns with 6s. \n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in the input. For example, if a cell is in a row that has 8s, it's replaced with 6s. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to know. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nLooking at the three examples, it seems that the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in the middle of the grid. In Example 2, 2s and 5s are in certain positions. In Example 3, 1s and 7s are in certain positions. \n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers in certain regions of the grid. For example, the middle region is replaced with certain numbers. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the number's value and its position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row, it's replaced with a certain number. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, I need to make an assumption. \n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions, and the input has 6s in those positions. So maybe the transformation is not changing those. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of consecutive same numbers in a row. For example, if there are three consecutive 0s, replace them with 6s. \n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid (rows 5-14, columns 5-14), replace it with 6, 2, or 1. \n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be implemented. For example, in the examples, the output has certain numbers in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, columns 11-15 in certain rows are 6s. \n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing cells in certain columns with certain numbers. For example, columns 11-15 are replaced with 6s. \n\nBut how to verify this?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output, in row 3, columns 11-15 are 6s in both input and output. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even, replace certain columns. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to know.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. \n\nPerhaps the transformation is replacing certain numbers in the grid based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain number. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is replacing cells in columns 11-15 with 6s. \n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of times a certain number appears in the grid. \n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess. \n\nPerhaps the transformation is based on the following: \n\n- For cells in certain rows or columns, replace them with certain numbers. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is replacing cells in columns 11-15 with 6s. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number's value and their position. For example, if a cell is in a row that has 8s, replace it with 6s. \n\nBut again, this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain numbers based on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid, replace 0s with 6s, 2s with 5s, etc. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nPerhaps the function can check if the cell is in a certain region of the grid and replace it accordingly. \n\nFor example, in the middle of the grid (rows 5-14, columns 5-14), replace 0s with 6s. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the function could replace 0s with certain numbers based on their position. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to know. \n\nGiven the examples, I think the best approach is to look for patterns in the output of the examples and try to find a rule that can be implemented. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions. In Example 2, 2s and 5s. In Example 3, 1s and 7s. \n\nPerhaps the transformation is replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain number. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother idea: In the examples, the output seems to have certain numbers in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in the middle of the grid. In Example 2, 2s and 5s in certain positions. In Example 3, 1s and 7s in certain positions. \n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the following: \n\n- Replace 0s in certain regions with 6s, 2s, 1s, etc., depending on the region. \n\nBut how to determine which regions?\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the row is even, replace with certain numbers. \n\nBut without more data, it's hard to know. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess and write a function that replaces certain numbers based on their position. For example, replace 0s in certain columns with 6s. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 8s in the row. For example, if a row has a certain number of 8s, replace other numbers with 6s. \n\nBut again, this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that I need to provide a solution, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nAssume that the transformation replaces certain numbers in certain regions of the grid. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain numbers are replaced with others. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nPerhaps the transformation is based on the following:\n\n- For cells in rows 5-14 (middle rows) and columns 5-14 (middle columns), replace 0s with 6s, 2s with 5s, etc. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is based on the following: \n\n- Replace 0s with 6s in certain columns. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in columns 11-15. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 0s with 6s in certain columns, and 8s with other numbers. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is based on the following: \n\n- For each cell, if it's in the middle of the grid, replace it with a certain value. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code. \n\nAt this point, I'll have to make a guess and write a function that replaces certain numbers based on their position. \n\nFor example, in the middle of the grid, replace 0s with 6s. \n\nBut how to determine the middle? \n\nMaybe the middle is rows 5-14 and columns 5-14. \n\nSo, for each cell in rows 5-14 and columns 5-14, replace 0 with 6. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nLet's see if this fits the examples. \n\nIn Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions. For example, in row 3, columns 11-15 are 6s. If the middle is rows 5-14 and columns 5-14, then row 3 is not in the middle. So this might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, the middle is rows 5-14 and columns 5-14. \n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 6s in columns 11-15, which is in the middle. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach. \n\nSo the function would check if the cell is in the middle of the grid (rows 5-14, columns 5-14), and replace 0s with 6s. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the row is even, replace certain columns. \n\nBut without knowing, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Replace 0s in the middle of the grid with 6s\n    for i in range(5, 14):\n        for j in range(5, 14):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                transformed[i][j] = 6\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess and may not fit the examples. \n\nHowever, looking at Example 1's output, the third row (i=2) is not in the middle (rows 5-14), so this might not apply. \n\nAlternatively, the middle is rows 5-14 and columns 5-14, but in Example 1, the output has 6s in certain positions that are not in this range. \n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll have to proceed with this approach, even though it's not certain. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 8s in the row. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother idea: In the examples, the output has certain numbers in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 6s in the middle of the grid. In Example 2, 2s and 5s. In Example 3, 1s and 7s. \n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 6s in certain regions. \n\nBut without knowing the exact regions, it's hard to code. \n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern in the examples and write code that replaces certain numbers based on their position. \n\nFor example, in the test input, the third row has 5s in columns 2-9, and the output may replace them with 6s or other numbers. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, I'm stuck. \n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a guess and write a function that replaces 0s with 6s in certain columns. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nFinal answer:\n"
