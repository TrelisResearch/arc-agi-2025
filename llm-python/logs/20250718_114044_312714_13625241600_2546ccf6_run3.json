The output grid often has the same structure as the input grid\n2. There are patterns of 6s and 4s in the first example, and 2s and 3s in the second example\n3. The middle rows in the first example seem to be all 6s, and in the second example, the middle rows are all 2s\n4. In the first example, some 6s are replaced with 4s in certain positions\n5. In the second example, some 3s are replaced with 1s in certain positions\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Keeping the same structure as the input grid\n- Replacing certain values with others based on their position\n- Preserving the middle rows as they are\n\nHere's my implementation of this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values based on their position\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[0])):\n            # Replace 6 with 4 in certain positions\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 6:\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            # Replace 3 with 1 in certain positions\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values based on their position\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[0])):\n            # Replace 6 with 4 in certain positions\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 6:\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            # Replace 3 with 1 in certain positions\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that:\n\n1. The output grid often has the same structure as the input grid\n2. There are patterns of 6s and 4s in the first example, and 2s and 3s in the second example\n3. The middle rows in the first example seem to be all 6s, and in the second example, the middle rows are all 2s\n4. In the first example, some 6s are replaced with 4s in certain positions\n5. In the second example, some 3s are replaced with 1s in certain positions\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Keeping the same structure as the input grid\n- Replacing certain values with others based on their position\n- Preserving the middle rows as they are\n\nHere's my implementation of this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values based on their position\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[0])):\n            # Replace 6 with 4 in certain positions\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 6:\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            # Replace 3 with 1 in certain positions\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values based on their position\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[0])):\n            # Replace 6 with 4 in certain positions\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 6:\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            # Replace 3 with 1 in certain positions\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
