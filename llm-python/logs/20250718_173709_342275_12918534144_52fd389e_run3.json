          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with others based on their position and value.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain values (like 4) are replaced with 2 or 3 in specific regions.\n3. Values like 1 and 2 seem to be used as \"markers\" or \"boundaries\" in the transformation.\n4. There's a pattern where values in the middle of the grid are transformed, while the edges remain unchanged.\n5. Values like 8 in Example 3 are transformed into a horizontal line of 8s in the output.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain values with others based on their position and value\n- Creating horizontal lines of values in certain regions\n- Preserving the edges of the grid\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with others based on their position and value.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain values (like 4) are replaced with 2 or 3 in specific regions.\n3. Values like 1 and 2 seem to be used as \"markers\" or \"boundaries\" in the transformation.\n4. There's a pattern where values in the middle of the grid are transformed, while the edges remain unchanged.\n5. Values like 8 in Example 3 are transformed into a horizontal line of 8s in the output.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain values with others based on their position and value\n- Creating horizontal lines of values in certain regions\n- Preserving the edges of the grid\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # Replace certain values with others based on their position and value\n    #
