          "Let's analyze the training examples carefully:\n\n1. Input grids are 3\u00d73, output grids are consistently 3\u00d76.\n2. The output grids are wider, extending each input grid's width by approximately doubling it.\n3. Color patterns in the input appear to be mirrored or repeated in the output:\n    - Output often shows a central symmetry or repeated patterns of the original input colors.\n    - The rows remain 3, so the transformation impacts horizontal arrangement only.\n4. Observing Input 1 \u2192 Output 1:\n    - Input: Row 1: [pink, blue, pink]\n    - Output: Row 1: [pink, pink, blue, pink, pink, blue]\n    - We see a mirroring and repetition pattern: the input row is roughly repeated and reflected horizontally.\n5. Testing other examples supports the idea:\n    - Outputs are about symmetrically repeating or mirroring halves of input rows.\n    - The output rows seem constructed by concatenating parts of the input rows in mirrored or repeated fashion.\n    - Possibly extend the input rows with some repeated or mirrored segments to reach 6 columns.\n6. In multiple outputs, the left half and right half either mirror each other or a pattern is repeated/patched to form a 6-element row.\n\nBased on the above, the best guess is:\n\n**Transformation hypothesis:**\n\n- Each input row (3 elements) is transformed into a 6-element row by concatenating:\n  - The input row itself\n  - Followed by a reversed or slightly altered version of itself (such as mirrored or repeated segments)\n- The output grid then has the same 3 rows, each with 6 columns.\n- Possibly the input row is extended by concatenating either itself or its reversed version.\n\nTo approximate this:\n\n- For each row in input:\n  - Construct output row by input row + input row reversed\n- This creates a 3\u00d76 output with the basic mirrored pattern consistent with many examples.\n\nThis approach captures key elements of the general pattern: 3 rows, 6 columns, horizontally mirrored or doubled rows.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation detail:**\n\n- Input is a list of lists: grid[row][col] with dimension 3\u00d73.\n- Output: 3\u00d76 list of lists.\n- For each row in input, output row = row + reversed(row).\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create output grid 3x6 by concatenating each input row with its reversed copy\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = row + row[::-1]\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
