The transformation seems to involve propagating values from certain positions to neighboring cells.\n2. There are patterns where values like 1 and 2 are spread out in specific ways.\n3. The transformation appears to involve some kind of \"spread\" or \"influence\" where certain values affect their neighbors.\n4. There's a pattern where values in certain positions influence the surrounding cells in a specific way.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads values from certain positions to their neighbors, with some specific rules for how values propagate.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the spread pattern\n    # This is a simple pattern where we spread values from certain positions to their neighbors\n    # We'll use a simple rule: if a cell has a value > 0, we spread it to neighboring cells\n    # with some probability or based on a specific pattern\n    \n    # For this solution, we'll spread values from cells with value 1 or 2 to their neighbors\n    # with a simple rule: if a cell has value 1 or 2, we spread it to neighboring cells\n    # with a specific pattern\n    \n    # Create a mask for cells with value 1 or 2\n    mask = (grid_np == 1) | (grid_np == 2)\n    \n    # Create a queue for BFS\n    from collections import deque\n    queue = deque()\n    \n    # Find all cells with value 1 or 2\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if mask[i][j]:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Directions: up, right, down, left\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]\n    \n    # Perform BFS to spread values\n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check all four directions\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            \n            # Check if the new position is within bounds\n            if 0 <= nx < 30 and 0 <= ny < 30:\n                # If the new cell is 0, set it to 1 or 2 based on the original value\n                if grid_np[nx][ny] == 0:\n                    # Spread the value from the original cell\n                    if grid_np[x][y] == 1:\n                        transformed_grid[nx][ny] = 1\n                    elif grid_np[x][y] == 2:\n                        transformed_grid[nx][ny] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    mask = (grid_np == 1) | (grid_np == 2)\n    \n    from collections import deque\n    queue = deque()\n    \n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if mask[i][j]:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n    \n    directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]\n    \n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.popleft()\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < 30 and 0 <= ny < 30:\n                if grid_np[nx][ny] == 0:\n                    if grid_np[x][y] == 1:\n                        transformed_grid[nx][ny] = 1\n                    elif grid_np[x][y] == 2:\n                        transformed_grid[nx][ny] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",

The transformation seems to involve propagating values from certain positions to neighboring cells.\n2. There are patterns where values like 1 and 2 are spread out in specific ways.\n3.

There's a pattern where values in certain positions influence the surrounding cells in a specific way.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads values from certain positions to their neighbors, with some specific rules for how values propagate.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the spread pattern\n    # This is a simple pattern where we spread values from certain positions to their neighbors\n    # We'll use a simple rule: if a cell has a value > 0, we spread it to neighboring cells\n    # with some probability or based on a specific pattern\n    \n    # For this solution, we'll spread values from cells with value 1 or 2 to their neighbors\n    # with a simple rule: if a cell has value 1 or 2, we spread it to neighboring cells\n    # with a specific pattern\n    \n    # Create a mask for cells with value 1 or 2\n    mask = (grid_np == 1) | (grid_np == 2)\n    \n    # Create a queue for BFS\n    from collections import deque\n    queue = deque()\n    \n    # Find all cells with value 1 or 2\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if mask[i][j]:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Directions: up, right, down, left\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]\n    \n    # Perform BFS to spread values\n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check all four directions\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            \n            # Check if the new position is within bounds\n            if 0 <= nx < 30 and 0 <= ny < 30:\n                # If the new cell is 0, set it to 1 or 2 based on the original value\n                if grid_np[nx][ny] == 0:\n                    # Spread the value from the original cell\n                    if grid_np[x][y] == 1:\n                        transformed_grid[nx][ny] = 1\n                    elif grid_np[x][y] == 2:\n                        transformed_grid[nx][ny] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    mask = (grid_np == 1) | (grid_np == 2)\n    \n    from collections import deque\n    queue = deque()\n    \n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if mask[i][j]:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n    \n    directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]\n    \n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.popleft()\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < 30 and 0 <= ny < 30:\n                if grid_np[nx][ny] == 0:\n                    if grid_np[x][y] == 1:\n                        transformed_grid[nx][ny] = 1\n                    elif grid_np[x][y] == 2:\n                        transformed_grid[nx][ny] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
