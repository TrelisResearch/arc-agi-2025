              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the output grids often have similar structures to the input grids, but with some transformations. For example:\n\n1. In Example 1, the output grid seems to have more 1s in the middle and more 8s on the edges.\n2. In Example 2, the output grid seems to have more 3s and 9s in the middle and more 0s on the edges.\n3. In Example 3, the output grid seems to have more 2s and 4s in the middle and more 1s on the edges.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Preserving the general shape and structure of the input grid\n- Changing the values in a way that seems to \"fill in\" certain patterns or \"smooth out\" others\n- Possibly replacing certain values with others based on their position in the grid\n\nBased on this, I'll implement a transformation that replaces values in a way that seems to \"fill in\" certain patterns, while preserving the general structure.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace values based on a pattern that seems to \"fill in\" certain patterns\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Replace 0s with 1s or 8s based on position\n                if i < 3 or i > 6 or j < 3 or j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Replace 1s with 2s or 6s based on position\n                if i < 3 or i > 6 or j < 3 or j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2s with 3s or 7s based on position\n                if i < 3 or i > 6 or j < 3 or j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace 3s with 4s or 9s based on position\n                if i < 3 or i > 6 or j < 3 or j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4s with 5s or 0s based on position\n                if i < 3 or i > 6 or j < 3 or j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Replace 5s with 6s or 1s based on position\n                if i < 3 or i > 6 or j < 3 or j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Replace 6s with 7s or 2s based on position\n                if i < 3 or i > 6 or j < 3 or j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                # Replace 7s with 8s or 3s based on position\n                if i < 3 or i > 6 or j < 3 or j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8s with 9s or 4s based on position\n                if i < 3 or i > 6 or j < 3 or j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                # Replace 9s with 0s or 5s based on position\n                if i < 3 or i > 6 or j < 3 or j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
