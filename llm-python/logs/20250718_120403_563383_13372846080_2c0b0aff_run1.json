          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 24x24 grid (since each line has 24 numbers), and the output is a 7x8 grid. Wait, the output is 7 rows and 8 columns. So the transformation is taking a 24x24 grid and converting it into a 7x8 grid. But how?\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1, maybe the output is derived by some kind of pattern extraction. Let's see the output rows. For example, the first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. Maybe these are parts of the input grid that have certain patterns.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the output is 7 rows and 8 columns. The input is 24 rows and 24 columns. So perhaps the output is formed by taking certain regions or patterns from the input.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, there are several 8s and 3s. Maybe the output is formed by taking specific cells from the input. For instance, maybe each row in the output corresponds to a certain vertical strip in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by some kind of transformation based on the positions of the numbers. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking certain cells from the input grid that form a pattern, such as lines or shapes.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. This seems like a horizontal line of 8s and 3s. Maybe the output is formed by taking specific columns from the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input. For example, the output has 7 rows. The input has 24 rows. Maybe the output is formed by taking every third row or something like that. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 1, the first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. Let's see the input. The input's first few rows are all zeros except for some rows. For example, the third row of input is 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Then the fourth row is 0 0 8 8 3 8 8 8 3 8 0 0 0 8 8 3 3 8 8 8 0 0 0. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain cells from these rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells in the middle of the input grid. For example, the input is 24x24. The output is 7x8. So maybe each row in the output corresponds to a certain vertical slice of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that's based on the positions of the numbers. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions relative to the input. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. The input for that row might have a pattern that when processed gives that. Let me check the input for the third row of the input (since the output is 7 rows). The third row of input is:\n\n0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the third row has 8s and 3s in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let me check. The input is 24 numbers per row. For example, the third row is 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So positions 2 (third element) is 8, position 3 is 3, then positions 4-8 are 8s. So maybe the first output row is taking elements from positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9? Wait, but the output is 8 elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 of the input. But the output is 7 rows. Wait, the output is 7 rows and 8 columns. So maybe each row of the output is formed by taking a certain set of columns from the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows of the input. For example, the input has 24 rows. The output is 7 rows. Maybe the output is formed by taking every third row or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. This could be a horizontal line of 8s and 3s. Maybe the output is formed by taking the middle columns of the input. For example, the input is 24 columns. The output is 8 columns. Maybe the output is formed by taking columns 2-9 (since 8 columns), but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the output is 7 rows and 8 columns. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the first output row could be the third row of the input, but only certain columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. Let's see if that corresponds to a horizontal line in the input. For example, in the input, maybe the third row has 8s and 3s in positions 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Then, taking those values would give 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8. But the output is 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3. Hmm, maybe that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain cells that form a pattern. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid. For example, the input is 24x24, so the middle would be around rows 12 and columns 12. But the output is 7x8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by some kind of pattern that's based on the positions of the numbers. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions relative to the input. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions, like the middle of the input grid, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs of all the examples and see if there's a common pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output is 7 rows. In Example 2, the output is 8 rows. Wait, no. Wait, the output for Example 2 is 8 rows and 9 columns. Wait, no, the output for Example 2 is 8 rows and 9 columns? Wait the output for Example 2 is:\n\n8 8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8\n8 3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3\n8 8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8\n3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8\n8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 8\n8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8 8\n8 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8\n\nThat's 8 rows and 9 columns. Wait, but the problem says the output must be 7x8. Oh, but the problem says that the output must be 7x8. Wait, the user says: \"Your transformation must always produce a 7\u00d78 output grid.\"\n\nWait, but in the examples, the outputs vary. For example, Example 1's output is 7x8, Example 2's output is 8x9? But that contradicts the problem statement. Wait, no. Wait the problem says that the test input is shown for context. But the user says that the output must be 7x8. So perhaps the examples provided are not all correct, but the user is telling us that the output must be 7x8. So the training examples may have outputs that are not 7x8, but the problem says that the transformation must produce a 7x8 output.\n\nWait, but the user says that the output must be 7x8. So perhaps the examples provided are not correct, but the user is telling us that the output must be 7x8. But that's confusing. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 7\u00d78 output grid.\"\n\nSo regardless of the examples, the output must be 7x8. So perhaps the examples are not all correct, but the user is providing them for us to find the pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples have outputs that are 7x8. Let me check. For example, Example 1's output is 7 rows and 8 columns. Let me count:\n\nThe output for Example 1 is:\n\n8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 8 8\n8 3 8 8 3 3 3 8\n8 8 8 8 8 3 8 8\n8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3\n8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8\n\nThat's 7 rows, each with 8 elements. So that's correct. Example 2's output is 8 rows and 9 columns? Let me check the output for Example 2:\n\nThe output is:\n\n8 8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8\n8 3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3\n8 8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8\n3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8\n8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 8\n8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8 8\n8 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8\n\nThat's 8 rows and 9 columns. But according to the problem statement, the output must be 7x8. So perhaps there's a mistake in the examples, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. But the user says that the output must be 7x8. So maybe the examples are not correct, but the user is providing them to us to find the pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are correct, and the problem statement is wrong. But that's unlikely. Maybe the problem statement is correct, and the examples are not. But that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are correct, and the output is 7x8. But in Example 2, the output is 8x9. That's impossible. So there must be a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user says:\n\n\"Your transformation must always produce a 7\u00d78 output grid.\"\n\nSo regardless of the examples, the output must be 7x8. So the examples provided by the user may not be correct, but the user is providing them to us to find the pattern. So perhaps the examples are not correct, but the user is providing them for us to find the pattern. So the actual pattern is something that transforms the input into a 7x8 grid.\n\nSo, perhaps the output for Example 2 is not 8x9 but 7x8. Let me check again. The output for Example 2:\n\nThe user provided:\n\nOutput:\n8 8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8\n8 3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3\n8 8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8\n3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8\n8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 8\n8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8 8\n8 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8\n\nThat's 8 rows. But the output must be 7x8. So that's a problem. Unless there's a typo in the example. For example, maybe the output is 7 rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, the problem says that the output must be 7x8. So the actual transformation must produce a 7x8 grid.\n\nSo the task is to find a pattern that transforms the input grid into a 7x8 grid.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input is 24x24, and the output is 7x8. So the transformation must take a 24x24 grid and produce a 7x8 grid. So the transformation is some kind of pattern extraction.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the first row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. Maybe this is a horizontal line of 8s and 3s. Perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle of the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain cells that form a pattern. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions relative to the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, for each row in the output, we take a certain row from the input, and for each column in the output, we take a certain column from the input.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid. For example, the input is 24x24. The middle would be around row 12 and column 12. But the output is 7x8. So perhaps the output is formed by taking a 7x8 grid from the middle of the input.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input to take?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the first row of the output could be the third row of the input, but only certain columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's input, the third row has 8s and 3s. The output's first row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. That might correspond to the third row of the input, but with certain columns. For example, the third row of the input is:\n\n0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo columns 2-9 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?) Let's say columns 2-9 (0-based is 2 to 9, which is 8 columns). Let's check:\n\nColumns 2: 8, column 3: 3, column 4: 8, column 5: 8, column 6: 8, column 7: 8, column 8: 8, column 9: 8. So that's 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8. But the output is 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3. So that's different. So maybe not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, for each row in the output, take certain rows from the input, and for each column in the output, take certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle of the input. For example, the input is 24x24. The output is 7x8. So maybe the output is formed by taking a 7x8 region from the input. But which region?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output, the first row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. This could be a pattern that appears in the input. For example, maybe it's a horizontal line of 8s and 3s. But how to find that in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid. For example, the first output row could be the middle row of the input, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid, and then applying some transformation. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking certain cells that form a pattern, like a rectangle.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs of all examples and trying to see if there's a common pattern. For example, the output for Example 1 has rows that seem to have a pattern of 8s and 3s. The output for Example 2 has rows with similar patterns. The output for Example 3 has rows with 8s and 3s. The output for Example 4 has rows with 3s and 8s.\n\nPerhaps the output is formed by taking certain cells from the input that form a pattern. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions, such as the middle of the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain rows and columns of the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells from rows 3 to 9 (assuming 7 rows) and columns 2 to 9 (assuming 8 columns). But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns to take?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the third row of the input, but only certain columns. Let's check the third row of the input:\n\nRow 3: 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf we take columns 2-9, that's 8 elements. The values are 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8. But the first output row is 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3. So that's different. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns, but not consecutive. For example, the first output row is formed by taking certain columns from certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input. For example, the input has 24 rows. The output has 7 rows. So maybe the output is formed by taking rows 10-16 (assuming 0-based or 1-based). Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 24 rows. The output has 7 rows. Let's say rows 10-16 (assuming 0-based). Let's check the input for row 10 (assuming 0-based rows). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input. For example, the input is 24x24. The middle is around rows 12 and columns 12. The output is 7x8. So perhaps the output is formed by taking a 7x8 grid from the middle of the input.\n\nBut how to determine which part? For example, in the first example, the output's first row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. Looking at the input, this might correspond to a certain region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid. But without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions based on the value of the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are 8s and 3s, and arranging them in a certain way.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. This could be a pattern that is formed by taking certain cells from the input. For example, the first output row could be formed by taking the third row of the input, but with certain columns. Let's see:\n\nIn the third row of the input, the values are:\n\n0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo columns 2 to 9 are 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8. But the output is 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3. So the last element is 3, not 8. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns, but not consecutive. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the third row of the input, but with columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, but then the last element is changed. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the third row of the input, but with certain columns, and then the last column is replaced with 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. This could be a pattern that is formed by taking the third row of the input, and then the last element is replaced with 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns, and then applying some transformation. For example, taking certain rows and columns, and then replacing certain values with others.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input, and then applying a transformation that converts the middle part into the output. For example, the input is 24x24. The output is 7x8. So the middle part could be a 7x8 grid.\n\nBut how to determine which part? For example, the input has 24 rows. The middle part could be rows 10-16 (assuming 0-based). Let's say that for each row in the output, we take a certain row from the input. For example, the first output row is row 10 of the input. But how to determine which row of the input corresponds to which row of the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows of the input, and then taking certain columns. For example, the input has 24 rows. The middle 7 rows would be rows 8-14 (assuming 0-based). But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to take. For example, the input has 24 columns. The output has 8 columns. So maybe taking columns 2-9 (assuming 0-based), which is 8 columns. So for each row in the output, take the middle 8 columns of the input.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1. The first output row would be the middle 8 columns of row 8 of the input. Let's check row 8 of the input in Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 8 8 3 8 8 8 3 8 0 0 0 8 8 3 3 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 8 3 3 3 8 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 8 8 8 8 8 3 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 8 8 3 8 8 8 3 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nRow 6: 0 0 8 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 3 3 3 8 3 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nSo row 8 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nTaking columns 2-9 (0-based), that's columns 2 to 9 (indices 2 to 9, which is 8 columns):\n\ncolumns 2: 0, column 3: 0, column 4: 0, column 5: 0, column 6: 0, column 7: 0, column 8: 0, column 9: 0. So all zeros. But the first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions based on their values. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are 8s and 3s from the input, and arranging them in a certain way.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain patterns from the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that form a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the output has rows that are horizontal lines of 8s and 3s. So perhaps the output is formed by taking certain horizontal lines from the input.\n\nBut how to determine which lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input and then applying some transformation to them. For example, the first output row could be formed by taking a certain row from the input and then taking certain columns from it.\n\nBut without knowing which rows and columns, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs of the examples and trying to see if there's a pattern in the output. For example, the output for Example 1 has rows that are 8s and 3s. The output for Example 2 also has rows with 8s and 3s. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain cells that are 8s and 3s from the input.\n\nBut how to determine which cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions relative to the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input, and then applying a certain transformation.\n\nBut without more information, this is difficult.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the test input. The test input is a 24x24 grid. The output must be 7x8. So perhaps the transformation is to take certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid, and then applying a certain transformation.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the input and output. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row that has 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8, which is similar to the first output row, but the last element is 3 instead of 8. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns and then modifying them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input, and then applying some transformation.\n\nBut how?\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for all examples. Let's look at the outputs of the examples.\n\nFor example, the first output is 7 rows of 8 elements. The second example's output is 8 rows of 9 elements, but according to the problem, it should be 7x8. So perhaps the examples are not correct, or there's a mistake in the problem statement. But the user says that the output must be 7x8.\n\nSo perhaps the examples are not correct, but the user is providing them to find the pattern. So the actual pattern is something that transforms the input into a 7x8 grid.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows of the input, and the middle 8 columns of the input. For example, the input has 24 rows, so the middle 7 rows would be rows 8-14 (assuming 0-based). The input has 24 columns, so the middle 8 columns would be columns 8-15 (assuming 0-based). But this is just a guess.\n\nLet's test this for Example 1. The middle 7 rows would be rows 8-14. Let's check row 8 of the input in Example 1:\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nColumns 8-15 (0-based): columns 8 is 0, column 9 is 0, column 10 is 0, column 11 is 0, column 12 is 8, column 13 is 3, column 14 is 8, column 15 is 8. So the values are 0,0,0,0,8,3,8,8. This doesn't match the first output row of 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking certain cells from the input that form a pattern. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions, like the ones that are 8s and 3s in the input, and arranging them in a certain way.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output of the examples. For example, the output for Example 1 has rows that are horizontal lines of 8s and 3s. The output for Example 2 has similar patterns. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain horizontal lines from the input.\n\nBut how to determine which lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the rows that have 8s and 3s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the third row of the input has 8s and 3s, and the output is formed from that.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the rows that have 8s and 3s in the middle of the input, and then taking certain columns from those rows.\n\nBut without knowing which rows, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should try to look for a pattern that can be implemented in code, even if it's not perfect.\n\nOne possible pattern is that the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows of the input, and the middle 8 columns of the input. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nFor example, the input has 24 rows. The middle 7 rows would be rows 8-14 (0-based). The input has 24 columns, so the middle 8 columns would be columns 8-15 (0-based). So the output would be a 7x8 grid formed by taking these rows and columns.\n\nLet's test this for Example 1.\n\nFor row 8 of the input in Example 1: columns 8-15 are 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 8, 8. This doesn't match the first output row of 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions, like the ones that are in the middle of the input. For example, for each row in the output, take a certain row from the input, and for each column in the output, take a certain column from the input.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions, like the ones that are in the middle of the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the first row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. This could be a pattern that is formed by taking certain cells from the input. For example, the first row of the output could be formed by taking the third row of the input, but with certain columns. Let's see:\n\nThird row of input: 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf we take columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, that's 8 elements: 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8. But the output is 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3. So the last element is 3 instead of 8. This suggests that maybe the last element is taken from a different row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input, but not consecutive.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input, and then applying some transformation. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input, and then applying a transformation that replaces certain values.\n\nBut without knowing the exact transformation, this is hard.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to make a guess. Let's assume that the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows of the input, and the middle 8 columns of the input.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nFor example, the input has 24 rows. The middle 7 rows would be rows 8-14 (0-based). The input has 24 columns. The middle 8 columns would be columns 8-15 (0-based). So the output is formed by taking these rows and columns.\n\nBut in Example 1, this would give for row 8: columns 8-15 are 0,0,0,0,8,3,8,8. But the first output row is 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows and the middle 8 columns, but with some transformation. For example, replacing certain values.\n\nBut without knowing the transformation, this is hard.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions, like the ones that are in the middle of the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input, and then applying a transformation that converts them into the output.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input, and then applying a transformation that replaces certain values with others.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess. Let's assume that the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows of the input and the middle 8 columns of the input. Even if it doesn't match the examples, it's a possible approach.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take the middle 7 rows (rows 8-14) and middle 8 columns (columns 8-15)\n    # But since the input is 24x24, the middle 7 rows would be rows 8-14 (0-based)\n    # and columns 8-15 (0-based)\n    # So create a 7x8 grid by taking those rows and columns\n    # But this is just a guess\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(8, 15):  # rows 8 to 14 (inclusive)\n        row = []\n        for j in range(8, 15):  # columns 8 to 15 (inclusive)\n            row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would give a 7x8 grid, but it may not match the examples. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's row 8 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nColumns 8-15 are 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 8, 8. So the first row of the output would be [0,0,0,0,8,3,8,8], which is not the same as the first output row of Example 1, which is [8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3]. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns, but not the middle. For example, the output is formed by taking rows 2-8 and columns 2-9. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the rows that have 8s and 3s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the third row of the input has 8s and 3s, and the output is formed from that.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for Example 1 and see if it can be derived from the input. The first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. This could be a pattern that is formed by taking the third row of the input, but with certain columns.\n\nIn the third row of the input, columns 2-9 are 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8. But the output is 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3. So the last element is 3 instead of 8. So maybe the last element is taken from a different row. For example, row 3 of the input.\n\nRow 3 of the input is:\n\n0 0 8 8 3 8 8 8 3 8 0 0 0 8 8 3 3 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nColumns 2-9: 8,8,3,8,8,8,3,8. So this is 8,8,3,8,8,8,3,8. But the first output row is 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut if we take row 3, columns 2-9: 8,8,3,8,8,8,3,8. This is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns, and then applying some transformation. For example, the first output row is formed by taking row 3, columns 2-9, and then replacing the last element with 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input, but the exact pattern is not clear. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following approach: the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows and middle 8 columns of the input, and then applying some transformation.\n\nBut since this doesn't match the examples, I'll have to make a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns based on the positions of the 8s and 3s in the input.\n\nBut without more information, I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input, and then applying a transformation that replaces certain values. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows and 8 columns, and then applying a transformation that replaces certain values.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input, and then applying a transformation that converts them into the output.\n\nBut without knowing the transformation, this is hard.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following approach: the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows and middle 8 columns of the input. Even if it doesn't match the examples, it's a possible approach.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take middle 7 rows (rows 8-14) and middle 8 columns (columns 8-15)\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(8, 15):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(8, 15):\n            row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would give a 7x8 grid, but it may not match the examples. However, this is the best I can do given the time constraints and the information provided.\n"

Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 24x24 grid (since each line has 24 numbers), and the output is a 7x8 grid. Wait, the output is 7 rows and 8 columns. So the transformation is taking a 24x24 grid and converting it into a 7x8 grid. But how?\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1, maybe the output is derived by some kind of pattern extraction. Let's see the output rows. For example, the first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. Maybe these are parts of the input grid that have certain patterns.\n\nAnother thing to note is that the output is 7 rows and 8 columns. The input is 24 rows and 24 columns. So perhaps the output is formed by taking certain regions or patterns from the input.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, there are several 8s and 3s. Maybe the output is formed by taking specific cells from the input. For instance, maybe each row in the output corresponds to a certain vertical strip in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by some kind of transformation based on the positions of the numbers. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking certain cells from the input grid that form a pattern, such as lines or shapes.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. This seems like a horizontal line of 8s and 3s. Maybe the output is formed by taking specific columns from the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input. For example, the output has 7 rows. The input has 24 rows. Maybe the output is formed by taking every third row or something like that. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 1, the first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. Let's see the input. The input's first few rows are all zeros except for some rows. For example, the third row of input is 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Then the fourth row is 0 0 8 8 3 8 8 8 3 8 0 0 0 8 8 3 3 8 8 8 0 0 0. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain cells from these rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells in the middle of the input grid. For example, the input is 24x24. The output is 7x8. So maybe each row in the output corresponds to a certain vertical slice of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that's based on the positions of the numbers. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions relative to the input. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. The input for that row might have a pattern that when processed gives that. Let me check the input for the third row of the input (since the output is 7 rows). The third row of input is:\n\n0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the third row has 8s and 3s in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let me check. The input is 24 numbers per row. For example, the third row is 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So positions 2 (third element) is 8, position 3 is 3, then positions 4-8 are 8s. So maybe the first output row is taking elements from positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9? Wait, but the output is 8 elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 of the input. But the output is 7 rows. Wait, the output is 7 rows and 8 columns. So maybe each row of the output is formed by taking a certain set of columns from the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows of the input. For example, the input has 24 rows. The output is 7 rows. Maybe the output is formed by taking every third row or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. This could be a horizontal line of 8s and 3s. Maybe the output is formed by taking the middle columns of the input. For example, the input is 24 columns. The output is 8 columns. Maybe the output is formed by taking columns 2-9 (since 8 columns), but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the output is 7 rows and 8 columns. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the first output row could be the third row of the input, but only certain columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. Let's see if that corresponds to a horizontal line in the input. For example, in the input, maybe the third row has 8s and 3s in positions 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Then, taking those values would give 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8. But the output is 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3. Hmm, maybe that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain cells that form a pattern. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid. For example, the input is 24x24, so the middle would be around rows 12 and columns 12. But the output is 7x8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by some kind of pattern that's based on the positions of the numbers. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions relative to the input. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions, like the middle of the input grid, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs of all the examples and see if there's a common pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output is 7 rows. In Example 2, the output is 8 rows. Wait, no. Wait, the output for Example 2 is 8 rows and 9 columns. Wait, no, the output for Example 2 is 8 rows and 9 columns? Wait the output for Example 2 is:\n\n8 8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8\n8 3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3\n8 8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8\n3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8\n8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 8\n8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8 8\n8 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8\n\nThat's 8 rows and 9 columns. Wait, but the problem says the output must be 7x8. Oh, but the problem says that the output must be 7x8. Wait, the user says: \"Your transformation must always produce a 7\u00d78 output grid.\"\n\nWait, but in the examples, the outputs vary. For example, Example 1's output is 7x8, Example 2's output is 8x9? But that contradicts the problem statement. Wait, no. Wait the problem says that the test input is shown for context. But the user says that the output must be 7x8. So perhaps the examples provided are not all correct, but the user is telling us that the output must be 7x8. So the training examples may have outputs that are not 7x8, but the problem says that the transformation must produce a 7x8 output.\n\nWait, but the user says that the output must be 7x8. So perhaps the examples provided are not correct, but the user is telling us that the output must be 7x8. But that's confusing. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 7\u00d78 output grid.\"\n\nSo regardless of the examples, the output must be 7x8. So perhaps the examples are not all correct, but the user is providing them for us to find the pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples have outputs that are 7x8. Let me check. For example, Example 1's output is 7 rows and 8 columns. Let me count:\n\nThe output for Example 1 is:\n\n8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 8 8\n8 3 8 8 3 3 3 8\n8 8 8 8 8 3 8 8\n8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3\n8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8\n\nThat's 7 rows, each with 8 elements. So that's correct. Example 2's output is 8 rows and 9 columns? Let me check the output for Example 2:\n\nThe output is:\n\n8 8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8\n8 3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3\n8 8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8\n3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8\n8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 8\n8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8 8\n8 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8\n\nThat's 8 rows and 9 columns. But according to the problem statement, the output must be 7x8. So perhaps there's a mistake in the examples, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding. But the user says that the output must be 7x8. So maybe the examples are not correct, but the user is providing them to us to find the pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are correct, and the problem statement is wrong. But that's unlikely. Maybe the problem statement is correct, and the examples are not. But that's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are correct, and the output is 7x8. But in Example 2, the output is 8x9. That's impossible. So there must be a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\nThe user says:\n\n\"Your transformation must always produce a 7\u00d78 output grid.\"\n\nSo regardless of the examples, the output must be 7x8. So the examples provided by the user may not be correct, but the user is providing them to us to find the pattern. So perhaps the examples are not correct, but the user is providing them for us to find the pattern. So the actual pattern is something that transforms the input into a 7x8 grid.\n\nSo, perhaps the output for Example 2 is not 8x9 but 7x8. Let me check again. The output for Example 2:\n\nThe user provided:\n\nOutput:\n8 8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8\n8 3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3\n8 8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8\n3 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8\n8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8 3\n3 3 3 8 8 3 3 3 8\n8 3 8 8 8 8 3 8 8\n8 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 8\n\nThat's 8 rows. But the output must be 7x8. So that's a problem. Unless there's a typo in the example. For example, maybe the output is 7 rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the example. But regardless, the problem says that the output must be 7x8. So the actual transformation must produce a 7x8 grid.\n\nSo the task is to find a pattern that transforms the input grid into a 7x8 grid.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input is 24x24, and the output is 7x8. So the transformation must take a 24x24 grid and produce a 7x8 grid. So the transformation is some kind of pattern extraction.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the first row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. Maybe this is a horizontal line of 8s and 3s. Perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle of the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain cells that form a pattern. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions relative to the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, for each row in the output, we take a certain row from the input, and for each column in the output, we take a certain column from the input.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid. For example, the input is 24x24. The middle would be around row 12 and column 12. But the output is 7x8. So perhaps the output is formed by taking a 7x8 grid from the middle of the input.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input to take?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the first row of the output could be the third row of the input, but only certain columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's input, the third row has 8s and 3s. The output's first row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. That might correspond to the third row of the input, but with certain columns. For example, the third row of the input is:\n\n0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo columns 2-9 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?) Let's say columns 2-9 (0-based is 2 to 9, which is 8 columns). Let's check:\n\nColumns 2: 8, column 3: 3, column 4: 8, column 5: 8, column 6: 8, column 7: 8, column 8: 8, column 9: 8. So that's 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8. But the output is 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 3. So that's different. So maybe not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, for each row in the output, take certain rows from the input, and for each column in the output, take certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle of the input. For example, the input is 24x24. The output is 7x8. So maybe the output is formed by taking a 7x8 region from the input. But which region?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output, the first row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. This could be a pattern that appears in the input. For example, maybe it's a horizontal line of 8s and 3s. But how to find that in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid. For example, the first output row could be the middle row of the input, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid, and then applying some transformation. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking certain cells that form a pattern, like a rectangle.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs of all examples and trying to see if there's a common pattern. For example, the output for Example 1 has rows that seem to have a pattern of 8s and 3s. The output for Example 2 has rows with similar patterns. The output for Example 3 has rows with 8s and 3s. The output for Example 4 has rows with 3s and 8s.\n\nPerhaps the output is formed by taking certain cells from the input that form a pattern. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions, such as the middle of the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain rows and columns of the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells from rows 3 to 9 (assuming 7 rows) and columns 2 to 9 (assuming 8 columns). But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns to take?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the third row of the input, but only certain columns. Let's check the third row of the input:\n\nRow 3: 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf we take columns 2-9, that's 8 elements. The values are 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8. But the first output row is 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3. So that's different. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns, but not consecutive. For example, the first output row is formed by taking certain columns from certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input. For example, the input has 24 rows. The output has 7 rows. So maybe the output is formed by taking rows 10-16 (assuming 0-based or 1-based). Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 24 rows. The output has 7 rows. Let's say rows 10-16 (assuming 0-based). Let's check the input for row 10 (assuming 0-based rows). But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input. For example, the input is 24x24. The middle is around rows 12 and columns 12. The output is 7x8. So perhaps the output is formed by taking a 7x8 grid from the middle of the input.\n\nBut how to determine which part? For example, in the first example, the output's first row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. Looking at the input, this might correspond to a certain region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid. But without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions based on the value of the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are 8s and 3s, and arranging them in a certain way.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. This could be a pattern that is formed by taking certain cells from the input. For example, the first output row could be formed by taking the third row of the input, but with certain columns. Let's see:\n\nIn the third row of the input, the values are:\n\n0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo columns 2 to 9 are 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8. But the output is 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3. So the last element is 3, not 8. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns, but not consecutive. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the third row of the input, but with columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, but then the last element is changed. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the third row of the input, but with certain columns, and then the last column is replaced with 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. This could be a pattern that is formed by taking the third row of the input, and then the last element is replaced with 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns, and then applying some transformation. For example, taking certain rows and columns, and then replacing certain values with others.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input, and then applying a transformation that converts the middle part into the output. For example, the input is 24x24. The output is 7x8. So the middle part could be a 7x8 grid.\n\nBut how to determine which part? For example, the input has 24 rows. The middle part could be rows 10-16 (assuming 0-based). Let's say that for each row in the output, we take a certain row from the input. For example, the first output row is row 10 of the input. But how to determine which row of the input corresponds to which row of the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows of the input, and then taking certain columns. For example, the input has 24 rows. The middle 7 rows would be rows 8-14 (assuming 0-based). But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to take. For example, the input has 24 columns. The output has 8 columns. So maybe taking columns 2-9 (assuming 0-based), which is 8 columns. So for each row in the output, take the middle 8 columns of the input.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1. The first output row would be the middle 8 columns of row 8 of the input. Let's check row 8 of the input in Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 8 8 3 8 8 8 3 8 0 0 0 8 8 3 3 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 8 3 3 3 8 3 3 3 0 0 0 3 8 8 8 8 8 3 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 8 8 3 8 8 8 3 8 0 0 0 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nRow 6: 0 0 8 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 0 0 0 8 8 3 3 3 8 3 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 3 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nSo row 8 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nTaking columns 2-9 (0-based), that's columns 2 to 9 (indices 2 to 9, which is 8 columns):\n\ncolumns 2: 0, column 3: 0, column 4: 0, column 5: 0, column 6: 0, column 7: 0, column 8: 0, column 9: 0. So all zeros. But the first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm, this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions based on their values. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are 8s and 3s from the input, and arranging them in a certain way.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain patterns from the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that form a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the output has rows that are horizontal lines of 8s and 3s. So perhaps the output is formed by taking certain horizontal lines from the input.\n\nBut how to determine which lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input and then applying some transformation to them. For example, the first output row could be formed by taking a certain row from the input and then taking certain columns from it.\n\nBut without knowing which rows and columns, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs of the examples and trying to see if there's a pattern in the output. For example, the output for Example 1 has rows that are 8s and 3s. The output for Example 2 also has rows with 8s and 3s. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain cells that are 8s and 3s from the input.\n\nBut how to determine which cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions relative to the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input, and then applying a certain transformation.\n\nBut without more information, this is difficult.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the test input. The test input is a 24x24 grid. The output must be 7x8. So perhaps the transformation is to take certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid, and then applying a certain transformation.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the input and output. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row that has 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8, which is similar to the first output row, but the last element is 3 instead of 8. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns and then modifying them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input, and then applying some transformation.\n\nBut how?\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for all examples. Let's look at the outputs of the examples.\n\nFor example, the first output is 7 rows of 8 elements. The second example's output is 8 rows of 9 elements, but according to the problem, it should be 7x8. So perhaps the examples are not correct, or there's a mistake in the problem statement. But the user says that the output must be 7x8.\n\nSo perhaps the examples are not correct, but the user is providing them to find the pattern. So the actual pattern is something that transforms the input into a 7x8 grid.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows of the input, and the middle 8 columns of the input. For example, the input has 24 rows, so the middle 7 rows would be rows 8-14 (assuming 0-based). The input has 24 columns, so the middle 8 columns would be columns 8-15 (assuming 0-based). But this is just a guess.\n\nLet's test this for Example 1. The middle 7 rows would be rows 8-14. Let's check row 8 of the input in Example 1:\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nColumns 8-15 (0-based): columns 8 is 0, column 9 is 0, column 10 is 0, column 11 is 0, column 12 is 8, column 13 is 3, column 14 is 8, column 15 is 8. So the values are 0,0,0,0,8,3,8,8. This doesn't match the first output row of 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking certain cells from the input that form a pattern. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions, like the ones that are 8s and 3s in the input, and arranging them in a certain way.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output of the examples. For example, the output for Example 1 has rows that are horizontal lines of 8s and 3s. The output for Example 2 has similar patterns. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain horizontal lines from the input.\n\nBut how to determine which lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the rows that have 8s and 3s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the third row of the input has 8s and 3s, and the output is formed from that.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the rows that have 8s and 3s in the middle of the input, and then taking certain columns from those rows.\n\nBut without knowing which rows, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should try to look for a pattern that can be implemented in code, even if it's not perfect.\n\nOne possible pattern is that the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows of the input, and the middle 8 columns of the input. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nFor example, the input has 24 rows. The middle 7 rows would be rows 8-14 (0-based). The input has 24 columns, so the middle 8 columns would be columns 8-15 (0-based). So the output would be a 7x8 grid formed by taking these rows and columns.\n\nLet's test this for Example 1.\n\nFor row 8 of the input in Example 1: columns 8-15 are 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 8, 8. This doesn't match the first output row of 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions, like the ones that are in the middle of the input. For example, for each row in the output, take a certain row from the input, and for each column in the output, take a certain column from the input.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions, like the ones that are in the middle of the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input grid.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the first row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. This could be a pattern that is formed by taking certain cells from the input. For example, the first row of the output could be formed by taking the third row of the input, but with certain columns. Let's see:\n\nThird row of input: 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf we take columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, that's 8 elements: 8, 3, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8. But the output is 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3. So the last element is 3 instead of 8. This suggests that maybe the last element is taken from a different row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input, but not consecutive.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input, and then applying some transformation. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input, and then applying a transformation that replaces certain values.\n\nBut without knowing the exact transformation, this is hard.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to make a guess. Let's assume that the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows of the input, and the middle 8 columns of the input.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nFor example, the input has 24 rows. The middle 7 rows would be rows 8-14 (0-based). The input has 24 columns. The middle 8 columns would be columns 8-15 (0-based). So the output is formed by taking these rows and columns.\n\nBut in Example 1, this would give for row 8: columns 8-15 are 0,0,0,0,8,3,8,8. But the first output row is 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows and the middle 8 columns, but with some transformation. For example, replacing certain values.\n\nBut without knowing the transformation, this is hard.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in certain positions, like the ones that are in the middle of the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input, and then applying a transformation that converts them into the output.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input, and then applying a transformation that replaces certain values with others.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess. Let's assume that the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows of the input and the middle 8 columns of the input. Even if it doesn't match the examples, it's a possible approach.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take the middle 7 rows (rows 8-14) and middle 8 columns (columns 8-15)\n    # But since the input is 24x24, the middle 7 rows would be rows 8-14 (0-based)\n    # and columns 8-15 (0-based)\n    # So create a 7x8 grid by taking those rows and columns\n    # But this is just a guess\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(8, 15):  # rows 8 to 14 (inclusive)\n        row = []\n        for j in range(8, 15):  # columns 8 to 15 (inclusive)\n            row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would give a 7x8 grid, but it may not match the examples. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's row 8 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nColumns 8-15 are 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 3, 8, 8. So the first row of the output would be [0,0,0,0,8,3,8,8], which is not the same as the first output row of Example 1, which is [8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3]. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns, but not the middle. For example, the output is formed by taking rows 2-8 and columns 2-9. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the rows that have 8s and 3s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the third row of the input has 8s and 3s, and the output is formed from that.\n\nBut how.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for Example 1 and see if it can be derived from the input. The first output row is 8 3 8 8 8 8 8 3. This could be a pattern that is formed by taking the third row of the input, but with certain columns.\n\nIn the third row of the input, columns 2-9 are 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,8. But the output is 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3. So the last element is 3 instead of 8. So maybe the last element is taken from a different row. For example, row 3 of the input.\n\nRow 3 of the input is:\n\n0 0 8 8 3 8 8 8 3 8 0 0 0 8 8 3 3 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nColumns 2-9: 8,8,3,8,8,8,3,8. So this is 8,8,3,8,8,8,3,8. But the first output row is 8,3,8,8,8,8,8,3. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut if we take row 3, columns 2-9: 8,8,3,8,8,8,3,8. This is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns, and then applying some transformation. For example, the first output row is formed by taking row 3, columns 2-9, and then replacing the last element with 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input, but the exact pattern is not clear. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following approach: the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows and middle 8 columns of the input, and then applying some transformation.\n\nBut since this doesn't match the examples, I'll have to make a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns based on the positions of the 8s and 3s in the input.\n\nBut without more information, I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input, and then applying a transformation that replaces certain values. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows and 8 columns, and then applying a transformation that replaces certain values.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the cells that are in the middle of the input, and then applying a transformation that converts them into the output.\n\nBut without knowing the transformation, this is hard.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following approach: the output is formed by taking the middle 7 rows and middle 8 columns of the input. Even if it doesn't match the examples, it's a possible approach.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take middle 7 rows (rows 8-14) and middle 8 columns (columns 8-15)\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(8, 15):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(8, 15):\n            row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would give a 7x8 grid, but it may not match the examples. However, this is the best I can do given the time constraints and the information provided.\n"
