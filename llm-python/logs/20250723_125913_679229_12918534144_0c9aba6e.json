          "content": "Let's analyze the training examples to identify patterns in how the input grid is transformed into the output grid.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Background (7s)**: The 7s in the input grid are not present in the output grid, indicating they might be removed.\n2. **Color/Value Changes**:\n   - **2s**: In many cases, 2s are replaced by 8s in the output grid.\n   - **6s**: 6s are replaced by 0s in the output grid.\n3. **Pattern Placement**:\n   - **2s to 8s**: The 2s are often placed in a way that forms a pattern or structure in the output grid.\n   - **6s to 0s**: The 6s are often isolated and replaced by 0s.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe transformation involves:\n1. Removing the 7s.\n2. Replacing 2s with 8s.\n3. Replacing 6s with 0s.\n\n### Python Code:\nLet's implement this hypothesis in Python.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            # Replace 2s with 8s\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            # Replace 6s with 0s\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            # Remove 7s (set to 0)\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Copy the Grid**: We create a copy of the input grid to ensure we don't modify the original data.\n2. **Iterate and Replace**: We loop through each cell in the grid and apply the transformation rules:\n   - Replace 2s with 8s.\n   - Replace 6s with 0s.\n   - Remove 7s by setting them to 0.\n3. **Return the Transformed Grid**: Finally, we return the transformed grid.\n\nThis code should handle the transformation based on the observed patterns in the training examples.",

              "content": "Let's analyze the training examples to identify patterns in how the input grid is transformed into the output grid.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Background (7s)**: The 7s in the input grid are not present in the output grid, indicating they might be removed.\n2. **Color/Value Changes**:\n   - **2s**: In many cases, 2s are replaced by 8s in the output grid.\n   - **6s**: 6s are replaced by 0s in the output grid.\n3. **Pattern Placement**:\n   - **2s to 8s**: The 2s are often placed in a way that forms a pattern or structure in the output grid.\n   - **6s to 0s**: The 6s are often isolated and replaced by 0s.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe transformation involves:\n1. Removing the 7s.\n2. Replacing 2s with 8s.\n3. Replacing 6s with 0s.\n\n### Python Code:\nLet's implement this hypothesis in Python.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            # Replace 2s with 8s\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            # Replace 6s with 0s\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            # Remove 7s (set to 0)\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Copy the Grid**: We create a copy of the input grid to ensure we don't modify the original data.\n2. **Iterate and Replace**: We loop through each cell in the grid and apply the transformation rules:\n   - Replace 2s with 8s.\n   - Replace 6s with 0s.\n   - Remove 7s by setting them to 0.\n3. **Return the Transformed Grid**: Finally, we return the transformed grid.\n\nThis code should handle the transformation based on the observed patterns in the training examples.",
