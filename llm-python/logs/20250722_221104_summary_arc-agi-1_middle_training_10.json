              "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's dive into this. I need to figure out the transformation from the input grid to the output grid based on the three examples provided. Let's start by examining each example carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput has 5s in a specific pattern, and the output has 2s and 1s. The output seems to be determined by the proximity of 5s. For instance, in the input, the first 5s are in row 2, columns 2-4, and then more spread out. The output has 2s in those regions but also 1s in other parts.\n\nWait, in the output, the value depends on how close the 5s are. For example, in the first row of input, there are no 5s, so the output is 0. But in the second row, the 5s are adjacent, so maybe the output is 2s. But then in another part of the output, there's a 1. So, maybe the color (value) depends on the connectivity of the 5s. Wait, maybe the output values are based on the minimal distance from the nearest 5, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the shape of the 5s, like if they form a cross or a line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the color (value) of the 5s in the input. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s in the area where the 5s are, but in other parts, the color is 1. Hmm, maybe the output color is determined by the number of 5s in the connected component. Wait, but that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output value is determined based on the color of the input. But in example 1, the output is 2 in some areas and 1 in others. Wait, maybe it's based on the parity of the distance from the nearest 5? Or maybe the output value is based on whether the cell is part of a certain component.\n\nAnother approach: look for the minimal distance from the nearest 5. For example, in example 1, the output for a cell might be 1 if it's adjacent to a 5, and 2 if it's two steps away. But in the output of example 1, cells that are two steps away from the 5s have 2s, and cells adjacent to the 5s have 1s. Wait, but in example 1, in row 8, column 1 has value 1. Let me check the input for that cell. The input for that cell is 5? No, the input for row 8, column 0 is 0. Wait, maybe I need to look at the input and output more carefully.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is based on the minimal number of steps from the nearest 5 cell. For example:\n\n- If the cell is a 5, output is 1 (since it's the same as the input value 5, but in example 1, the output for 5s is not present. Wait, in example 1, the input has 5s, but the output has 2s and 1s. So that approach might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, the output is determined by the connected component of 5s. For example, if the 5s form a certain shape, the output color for each cell depends on the size of the component. But again, looking at example 1, some cells have 2s and others have 1s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is determined by the number of 5s in the connected component. If the component has an even number of 5s, then the output is 1, else 2. But that seems arbitrary and might not fit the examples.\n\nWait, example 1's input has a connected component of 5s that includes multiple cells. For instance, in the first three rows, columns 2-4 have 5s. Then in row 5, column 6-7 have 5s, and so on. But the output has a mixture of 1s and 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the output value is determined based on the parity of the number of steps from the nearest 5. For example, if the steps are even, then 1, else 2. But again, I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the minimum distance from the nearest 5 cell, where distance is the Manhattan distance. For example:\n\n- If the distance is 0, output 1.\n- If distance is 1, output 2.\n- If distance is 2, output 1.\n- If distance is 3, output 2.\nBut that might not fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is determined by the minimum distance to the nearest 5 cell, with the color being 1 if the distance is even, and 2 if odd. But how does that fit with example 1?\n\nIn example 1, consider the cell at row 7, column 0. The input is 5? Wait, no. The input for that cell is 5 in row 8, column 1. Let me check the input again.\n\nLet me take example 1's input:\n\nInput grid for example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\nRow 1: all 0s.\nRow 2: columns 2-4 are 5s.\nRow 3: same as row 2.\nRow 4: all 0s.\nRow 5: columns 6-7 are 5s.\nRow 6: columns 5-7 are 5s.\nRow 7: columns 0-1 are 5s.\nRow 8: columns 0-2 are 5s.\nRow 9: all 0s.\n\nOutput grid for example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\nRow 1: all 0s.\nRow 2: columns 2-4 are 2s.\nRow 3: same as row 2.\nRow 4: all 0s.\nRow 5: columns 6-7 are 2s.\nRow 6: columns 5-7 are 2s.\nRow 7: columns 0-1 are 1s.\nRow 8: columns 0-1 are 1s, column 2 is 1.\nRow 9: all 0s.\n\nSo for example, the cell in row 7, column 0 (output is 1) has a distance of 1 (Manhattan distance) to the nearest 5 cell. Because in row 7, column 0 is part of a 5 cell. Wait, but the input cell for row 7, column 0 is 5? Wait, in the input grid of example 1, row 7 (which is the 8th row if starting from 0) is:\n\n0 5 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 ?\n\nWait, example 1's input for row 7 (assuming rows are 0-based):\n\nRow 7: 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 ?\n\nWait, the input for row 7 is 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So the cell at (7, 0) is 0. Wait, but the input row 7 has 5s at columns 1, 2, and 6. So the output for row 7, column 0 is 1. The distance from (7,0) to the nearest 5 cell is the minimum of:\n\n- (7,1) is 1 cell away (Manhattan distance 1).\nSo that would make the output 1. So the output value is 1 if the distance is odd and 2 if even? Wait, but in this case, the distance is 1 (odd), so output is 1. For example, the cell in row 5, column 6 is a 5, and the output is 2. The distance from cell (5,6) to itself is 0, but the output is 2. Wait, that doesn't fit. So that theory is invalid.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's look at example 3:\n\nExample 3's input has several 5s, and the output is a mix of 1s and 2s. Let's focus on the output for cells that are adjacent to 5s. For instance, in the output of example 3, there are cells with value 2 in some areas and 1 in others. So the output is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output value is determined by the parity of the distance to the nearest 5 cell, but in a different way. For example, if the distance is even, the output is 2, and if odd, 1. But in example 1, the cell (5,6) is a 5, so the distance is 0 (even), but the output is 2. That would fit. So for that cell, output is 2. If that's the case, then the output is based on the distance modulo 2.\n\nWait, but in example 1, cell (7,0) has distance 1. So output is ",
