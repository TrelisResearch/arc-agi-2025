Observations:\n\n- The input always contains a horizontal or vertical yellow line or stripe.\n- The transformation seems to highlight or isolate certain objects near or along the yellow stripe.\n- The overall output appears to be a simplified or binary-encoded version of the presence/motion of certain features.\n- In the given examples, the transformation appears to focus on the region around the yellow stripe and then \"projects\" or \"extrudes\" the pattern into a simplified binary grid, perhaps emphasizing the presence of certain features (visualized as 2s and 0s).\n- Training examples display a consistent theme: the yellow line acts as a separator or focal point, and the output seems to encode spatial features relative to it, possibly abstracted as binary values 0 or 2.\n\nGiven the level of abstraction and the pattern, a plausible approach is:\n\n- Detect the yellow stripe\n- For each row, focus on the region near or containing the yellow stripe\n- Transform the grid around that area into a binary pattern, emphasizing the position of specific features (e.g., presence of blue or black pixels)\n- For simplicity, I will just encode in the output a pattern that \"detects\" the presence of blue and black pixels relative to the yellow stripe: set 2 if a feature is present near the stripe, otherwise 0\n- The output is constrained to be 5x4, so I will crop or select a part of the grid accordingly, focusing on the area around the yellow stripe.\n\nHere's an implementation based on these insights.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Convert to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    rows, cols = arr.shape\n\n    # Find the yellow stripe: assume it's the column with the most yellow pixels (value 4)\n    # For simplicity, find the column with maximum sum of value 4 spanning rows\n    yellow_cols_count = np.sum(arr == 4, axis=0)\n    yellow_col = np.argmax(yellow_cols_count)\n\n    # Define the output grid size\n    output_rows, output_cols = 5, 4\n    output_grid = np.zeros((output_rows, output_cols), dtype=int)\n\n    # Focus on a region around the yellow stripe: pick rows 0-4, cols around yellow stripe\n    # For simplicity, extract a 5x4 region centered on the yellow stripe\n    start_col = max(0, yellow_col - 2)\n    end_col = start_col + output_cols\n    region = arr[:output_rows, start_col:end_col]\n\n    # For each cell in the output grid, set 2 if there's a blue (1) or black (3) pixel\n    # near the yellow stripe, else 0\n    for r in range(output_rows):\n        for c in range(output_cols):\n            pixel = region[r, c]\n            if pixel == 1 or pixel == 3:\n                output_grid[r, c] = 2\n            else:\n                output_grid[r, c] = 0\n\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
