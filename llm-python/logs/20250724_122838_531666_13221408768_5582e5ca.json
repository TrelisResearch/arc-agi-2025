In Example 3: The number 6 appears 3 times, and the output is all 6s.\n\nThis suggests the pattern might be:\n- Find the most frequently occurring number in the input grid\n- Fill the entire output grid with that number\n\nLet me verify this hypothesis:\n- Example 1: 4 appears 3 times, 6 appears 2 times, 3 appears 2 times, 8 appears 1 time, 0 appears 1 time \u2192 Most frequent: 4 \u2713\n- Example 2: 9 appears 3 times, 1 appears 2 times, 8 appears 2 times, 4 appears 1 time, 6 appears 1 time \u2192 Most frequent: 9 \u2713\n- Example 3: 6 appears 3 times, 4 appears 2 times, 8 appears 2 times, 9 appears 1 time, 1 appears 1 time \u2192 Most frequent: 6 \u2713\n\nThis looks like the correct pattern.
