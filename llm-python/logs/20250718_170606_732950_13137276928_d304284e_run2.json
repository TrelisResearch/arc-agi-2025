In the output grids, the 7s and 6s seem to be transformed in a way that creates patterns of 7s and 6s in specific configurations.\n3. The 7s in the input seem to be replaced with a pattern of 7s and 6s in the output.\n4. There appears to be a transformation that replaces certain configurations of 7s with patterns of 7s and 6s.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain patterns of 7s with specific patterns of 7s and 6s.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The input grid has a lot of 0s, with some 7s and 6s in specific positions.\n2. In the output grids, the 7s and 6s seem to be transformed in a way that creates patterns of 7s and 6s in specific configurations.\n3. The 7s in the input seem to be replaced with a pattern of 7s and 6s in the output.\n4. There appears to be a transformation that replaces certain configurations of 7s with patterns of 7s and 6s.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain patterns of 7s with specific patterns of 7s and 6s.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
