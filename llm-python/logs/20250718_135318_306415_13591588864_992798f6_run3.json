          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let's take each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has a 2 in the 13th row (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), and the output has that 2 in the same position. But then there's a 0 in the 10th row (row index 9?), and the output has a 3 in that row, but the 11th row (row index 10?) has a 1. Wait, looking at the output for example 1, the 10th row (probably row index 9) has a 1 in the second column. Wait, the input for example 1 has a 1 in row 10 (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), but the output has that 1 in the same position. But then the output has 3s spreading out from that position. Let me check again.\n\nIn example 1's input, the 10th row (row 10, since it's 13 rows) has a 1 in column 1. The output for that row is 0 1 0 ... So the 1 is preserved. But then, in the rows below, there's a spread of 3s. For example, row 11 (original input row 11) has 0s, but in the output, row 11 (original input row 11?) is the same as input. Wait, maybe the 3s are spreading out from the 1 in the input. Wait, the input has a 1 in row 10 (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), and the output has 3s in the rows below. Let me think: the output for example 1 has 3s in positions that are expanding outward from the 1. For example, row 10 (original input row 10) has a 1. Then row 11 (original input row 11) is the same as input. Wait, maybe the 3s are expanding in a certain pattern. Let me look at the output for example 1:\n\nLooking at the output rows:\n\nRow 4 (input row 4) has a 0 in column 11 (original input row 4, column 11 is 0). The output for row 4 has a 3 in column 5? Wait, no. Let me check the output for example 1 again. The output for example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: all 0s.\n\nRow 2: all 0s.\n\nRow 3: all 0s except column 11 is 2.\n\nRow 4: 0s except column 5 is 3?\n\nWait, the output for example 1's row 4 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 but no, looking at the output:\n\nThe output for example 1 is:\n\nRow 3: 0s except column 11 is 2.\n\nRow 4: 0s except column 5 is 3?\n\nWait, the output for example 1 is:\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 \u2192 so in row 4, columns 6-9 are 3s?\n\nWait, the output for example 1's row 4 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. So that's 12 columns. Wait, the grid is 13x12? Wait the input is 13 rows and 12 columns. So each row has 12 elements. So for example, in example 1's output, row 4 has a 3 in column 7, 8, 9? Or maybe columns 6-9?\n\nWait, the input for example 1 has a 2 in row 3 (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), column 11. The output for that row is same. Then in row 4, the output has a 3 in column 5? Or maybe the 3s are expanding in some way.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1, row 4 has a 3 in column 5? Or maybe the 3s are expanding outward from the 1 in row 10, column 1. Let me check the output for example 1's row 10. The input for row 10 is 0 1 0 ... and the output is same. Then, in row 11, the output is same as input. But in row 12, the output is same as input. Wait, but the output for example 1 has 3s in rows 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc. So maybe the 3s are expanding in a diagonal or some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a certain direction. For example, in example 1, the 1 is in row 10, column 1. Then, the 3s start appearing in row 4, which is 6 rows above. That seems odd. Wait, maybe the 3s are expanding in a certain way based on the position of the 1. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a spiral or some pattern. But that's hard to see. Let's look at example 2.\n\nIn example 2, the input has a 2 in row 1, column 1. The output for that row is same. Then, in the output, rows 2-8 have 3s in column 2, then row 8 has a 3 in column 3. Wait, the output for example 2:\n\nRow 0: 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 2 0 ... \n\nRow 2: 0 0 3 0 ... \n\nRow 3: 0 0 3 0 ... \n\nRow 4: 0 0 3 0 ... \n\nRow 5: 0 0 3 0 ... \n\nRow 6: 0 0 3 0 ... \n\nRow 7: 0 0 3 0 ... \n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 3 ... \n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 3 ... \n\nAnd so on. So the 3s are expanding outward from the 2 in row 1, column 1. The 3s are spreading in a diagonal direction. For example, row 2 has a 3 in column 2. Then row 3 has 3 in column 2. Then row 8 has 3 in column 3. So it's like the 3s are expanding in a way that each row adds a new 3 further to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a diagonal pattern. For example, in example 2, the 2 is at (1,1). Then, the 3s start at (2,2), then (3,2), then (4,2), etc. But that seems inconsistent. Wait, maybe the 3s are expanding in a certain direction. For example, the 3s are spreading to the right and down. But in example 2, row 2 has 3 in column 2. Then row 3 has 3 in column 2. Then row 8 has 3 in column 3. So perhaps the 3s are expanding in a way that each row adds a new 3 in the next column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that depends on the distance from the original value. For example, in example 1, the 1 is in row 10, column 1. Then, the 3s spread out from that position. But in example 1, the 3s start in row 4, which is 6 rows above. That seems like a lot. Maybe the 3s are expanding in a certain pattern based on the position of the original value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a certain direction. For example, in example 2, the 2 is at (1,1). Then, the 3s are expanding to the right and down. So for each row below, the 3s spread to the right. But in example 2, row 2 has a 3 in column 2. Then row 3 has 3 in column 2. Then row 8 has 3 in column 3. So perhaps the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in the same column as the previous row, but then in the next row, they move to the next column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a diagonal pattern. For example, in example 2, the 3s are in positions (row, column) where row + column is a certain value. Let me check:\n\nOriginal 2 is at (1,1). Then, the first 3 is at (2,2) (row + column = 4). Then, row 3, column 2: row + column = 5. Then row 4, column 2: row + column = 6. Then row 5, column 2: 7. Then row 6, column 2: 8. Then row 7, column 2: 9. Then row 8, column 3: 11. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in the same column as the original position plus some offset. For example, in example 2, the original 2 is at (1,1). Then, in row 2, column 2. Then row 3, column 2. Then row 8, column 3. Maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the column is increasing by 1 every certain steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a spiral or some pattern that depends on the position of the original value. But how?\n\nLooking at example 3. The input has a 2 in row 1, column 6 (assuming rows are 0-indexed). The output for that row is same. Then, in the output, the 3s start spreading out. The output for example 3's row 2 has a 3 in column 5. Then row 3 has 3 in column 5. Then rows 4-8 have 3 in column 5. Then row 11 has 3 in column 5. Then row 12 has 3 in column 4. So the 3s are expanding in a way that they start from the original position and spread outward in a certain direction. For example, the original 2 is at (1,6). Then, the 3s start in row 2, column 5. Then row 3, column 5. Then row 4, column 5. Then row 5, column 5. Then row 6, column 5. Then row 7, column 5. Then row 8, column 5. Then row 9, column 5. Then row 10, column 5. Then row 11, column 5. Then row 12, column 4. So this seems like the 3s are spreading in a diagonal direction. For example, each row adds a 3 in column 5, but then in the next row, it moves left by one. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a certain pattern based on the distance from the original value. For example, the original value is at (row, col), and then the 3s are placed in positions that are a certain distance away. But how?\n\nLooking at example 4. The input has a 1 in row 1, column 11. The output for that row is same. Then, in the output, the 3s start spreading. For example, row 2 has 3 in column 11. Then row 3 has 3 in column 10. Then row 4 has 3 in column 9. Then row 5 has 3 in column 8. Then row 6 has 3 in column 7. Then row 7 has 3 in column 6. Then row 8 has 3 in column 5. Then row 9 has 3 in column 4. Then row 10 has 3 in column 3. Then row 11 has 3 in column 2. Then row 12 has 3 in column 1. Then row 13 has 3 in column 0. Wait, no. The input for example 4 is 14 rows? Wait, no. Wait the input for example 4 is 14 rows? Because the test input is 14 rows. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 13x12. So the input for example 4 is 14 rows? Or perhaps the input is 13 rows. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 13x12. So the input for each example is 13 rows, 12 columns. Let me check example 4's input:\n\nThe input for example 4 is 14 rows? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. The test input is 14 rows. But the training examples have 13 rows. For example, example 1's input has 13 rows, as per the input given. So example 4's input is 13 rows. Let me check the input for example 4:\n\nThe input for example 4 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 ... 0 (12 elements)\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 ... 1 ... 0 (column 11 is 1)\n\nRow 2: all 0s.\n\n...\n\nRow 13: all 0s.\n\nWait, but that would be 14 rows. But the output is 13x12. So maybe the input for example 4 is 13 rows. Wait, the problem says that the output is always 13x12. So the input for each example is 13 rows, 12 columns. So example 4's input has 13 rows. So the input for example 4 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 ... 1 ... 0 (column 11 is 1).\n\nRow 2: all 0s.\n\n...\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nRow 13: all 0s? No, that's 14 rows. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the example 4 input again:\n\nThe input for example 4 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n... and so on for 13 rows. So the input has 13 rows. Then, the output for example 4 has a 1 in row 1, column 11. Then, the output has 3s spreading out in a way that in row 2, column 11 is 3. Then row 3, column 10 is 3. Then row 4, column 9 is 3. And so on. So the 3s are spreading out to the left and down. So for each row, the 3s are moving left by one column. So in row 2, column 11 is 3. Then row 3, column 10 is 3. Then row 4, column 9, etc. So this seems like a pattern where the 3s are expanding in a diagonal direction, moving left and down.\n\nSo for example 4, the original 1 is at (1,11). Then, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from (2,11) to (13, 0), but since there are only 13 rows, maybe up to row 12. Wait, the output for example 4 is 13 rows. So the 3s start at row 2, column 11 (row 2, column 11 is 3), then row 3, column 10 is 3, etc., until row 12, column 0 is 3. So the 3s are expanding in a diagonal line from (row, column) where row increases by 1 and column decreases by 1 each step.\n\nSimilarly, in example 2, the original 2 is at (1,1). The 3s spread in a diagonal line where row increases by 1 and column increases by 1. Wait, no. Because in example 2, the 3s start at (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), etc. Wait, that's not a diagonal. Wait, perhaps the pattern is different. Let me check again.\n\nIn example 2, the original 2 is at (1,1). The output for row 2 has a 3 in column 2. Then row 3 has a 3 in column 2. Then row 4 has a 3 in column 2. Then row 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc. Then row 8 has a 3 in column 3. Hmm, that seems inconsistent. Wait, maybe there's a different pattern. Maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in the same column as the original position plus some offset. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are expanding in a spiral or some other pattern. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking at all examples, perhaps the transformation is that any non-zero value in the input is replaced by a certain value, and then the 3s are spread out in a certain way. But how?\n\nWait, looking at example 1, the original 2 is in row 3, column 11. The output for that row is same. Then, in row 4, there's a 3 in column 5. Then in row 5, column 5 is 3. Then row 6, column 5 is 3. Then row 7, column 5 is 3. Then row 8, column 5 is 3. Then row 9, column 5 is 3. Then row 10, column 5 is 3. Then row 11, column 5 is 3. Then row 12, column 5 is 3. Wait, but the output for example 1 has in row 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. So columns 7-10 are 3s. Then row 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0. So column 6 is 3. Then row 6: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. Column 5 is 3. Then row 7: 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Column 4 is 3. Then row 8: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Column 3 is 3. Then row 9: 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Column 2 is 3. Then row 10: 0 1 0 ... So the 1 is preserved. Then row 11 and 12 are same as input. So the 3s are expanding in a diagonal pattern, moving left and up. So for example, the 3s are in positions where row increases by 1 and column decreases by 1 each time. But how does that fit with the example 1's 3s?\n\nIn example 1, the original 2 is in row 3, column 11. Then, the 3s start in row 4, column 5. Then row 5, column 5. Then row 6, column 5. Then row 7, column 5. Then row 8, column 5. Then row 9, column 5. Then row 10, column 5. Then row 11, column 5. Then row 12, column 5. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because the 3s are not moving in a diagonal. So perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in positions that are a certain distance from the original value. For example, the original value is at (row, col), and then the 3s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are spread out in a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the original 2 is at (3,11). Then the 3s are spread in a way that starts from that position and expands outward. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the 3s are spreading from the 1 in row 10, column 1. The 1 is in the input. The output has 3s expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in columns that are moving left. For example, row 10 has 1 in column 1. Then row 11 (input row 11) has 0s. But in the output, row 11 has 0s. Then row 12 has 0s. But in the output, the 3s are in row 4, 5, 6, etc. So this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are expanding in a way that for each non-zero value, the 3s are spread in a certain direction. For example, in example 2, the 2 is at (1,1). The 3s spread to the right and down. In example 4, the 1 is at (1,11), and the 3s spread to the left and down. In example 3, the 2 is at (1,6), and the 3s spread to the left and down. So maybe the pattern is that for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are spread in a diagonal direction from that value, moving in a certain direction.\n\nBut how to determine the direction? For example, in example 2, the 2 is at (1,1). The 3s spread to the right and down. So for each row below, the 3s are placed in the same column. Then, in row 8, the 3s are in column 3. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in the same column as the original value plus some offset. For example, in example 2, the original 2 is at (1,1). Then, the 3s are placed in row 2, column 2 (so row + 1, column + 1). Then row 3, column 2 (row + 2, column + 0). Then row 4, column 2 (row + 3, column + 0). Then row 5, column 2, etc. So this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a spiral pattern. But that's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for example 1, the 3s are spread in a way that they are expanding from the 1 in row 10, column 1. The 3s are in positions that are diagonally to the left and up. For example, row 4, column 5 is 3. Then row 5, column 5 is 3. Then row 6, column 5 is 3. Then row 7, column 5 is 3. Then row 8, column 5 is 3. Then row 9, column 5 is 3. Then row 10, column 5 is 3. Then row 11, column 5 is 3. Then row 12, column 5 is 3. So the 3s are expanding in a vertical line, but that doesn't fit with the example 1's output.\n\nWait, in example 1's output, row 4 has 3 in column 7, 8, 9. Then row 5 has 3 in column 6. Then row 6 has 3 in column 5. Then row 7 has 3 in column 4. Then row 8 has 3 in column 3. Then row 9 has 3 in column 2. Then row 10 has 3 in column 1. But the original 1 is in row 10, column 1. So the 3s are spreading from that position upwards and to the left. So for each row above, the 3s are moving left by one column. So the 3s are expanding in a diagonal line from the original position, moving up and left. But how?\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from that position, moving in a certain direction. For example, if the original value is at (row, col), then the 3s are spread in positions where row decreases by 1 and column decreases by 1 for each step. But how does that fit with example 2?\n\nIn example 2, the original 2 is at (1,1). The output has 3s in row 2, column 2 (row+1, column+1). Then row 3, column 2 (row+2, column+0). Then row 4, column 2 (row+3, column+0). Then row 5, column 2. This doesn't fit the diagonal pattern. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in the same column as the original position, but for rows below. For example, in example 2, the 3s start at row 2, column 2. Then row 3, column 2. Then row 4, column 2. Then row 5, column 2. Then row 6, column 2. Then row 7, column 2. Then row 8, column 3. So this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a way that they form a diamond shape. For example, the original value is at (row, col), and the 3s are spread in all directions, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the transformation rules that can explain all examples.\n\nLooking at example 1: the 2 is in row 3, column 11. The output has a 2 there. Then, the 3s are spread in a way that in row 4, column 5 is 3. Then row 5, column 5 is 3. Then row 6, column 5 is 3. Then row 7, column 5 is 3. Then row 8, column 5 is 3. Then row 9, column 5 is 3. Then row 10, column 5 is 3. Then row 11, column 5 is 3. Then row 12, column 5 is 3. So this is a vertical line of 3s starting from row 4, column 5. But why?\n\nIn example 2, the 2 is at row 1, column 1. The output has 3s in row 2, column 2. Then row 3, column 2. Then row 4, column 2. Then row 5, column 2. Then row 6, column 2. Then row 7, column 2. Then row 8, column 3. So this is a vertical line of 3s starting from row 2, column 2, then continuing down, then moving to the right.\n\nIn example 3, the 2 is at row 1, column 6. The output has 3s in row 2, column 5. Then row 3, column 5. Then row 4, column 5. Then row 5, column 5. Then row 6, column 5. Then row 7, column 5. Then row 8, column 5. Then row 9, column 5. Then row 10, column 5. Then row 11, column 5. Then row 12, column 4. So this is a vertical line of 3s starting at row 2, column 5, then moving down, then moving left.\n\nIn example 4, the 1 is at row 1, column 11. The output has 3s in row 2, column 11. Then row 3, column 10. Then row 4, column 9. Then row 5, column 8. Then row 6, column 7. Then row 7, column 6. Then row 8, column 5. Then row 9, column 4. Then row 10, column 3. Then row 11, column 2. Then row 12, column 1. So this is a diagonal line from row 2, column 11 down and left.\n\nSo it seems that the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from the original value. The direction depends on the original value's position. For example, in example 2, the original value is at (1,1), and the 3s spread to the right and down. In example 4, the original value is at (1,11), and the 3s spread to the left and down. In example 3, the original value is at (1,6), and the 3s spread to the left and down. In example 1, the original value is at (3,11), and the 3s spread to the left and down. But in example 1, the 3s are in a vertical line, not a diagonal.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's a pattern where the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from the original value, moving in a certain direction. For example, if the original value is in row r, column c, then the 3s are spread in the direction of row increasing and column decreasing, or row decreasing and column increasing, depending on the position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in the same column as the original value plus a certain offset. For example, in example 4, the 1 is at (1,11). The 3s start at row 2, column 11. Then row 3, column 10. So for each row, the column decreases by 1. So the pattern is row increases by 1, column decreases by 1. This forms a diagonal line from (row, column) = (2, 11) to (12, 0). But in example 4, the output has 3s in row 2, column 11; row 3, column 10; ... up to row 12, column 0. So that's a diagonal line.\n\nSimilarly, in example 2, the original 2 is at (1,1). The 3s are in row 2, column 2; row 3, column 2; row 4, column 2; ... up to row 8, column 3. Wait, that doesn't fit. But in example 2, after row 8, the 3s move to column 3. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in the same column as the original value, but for rows below. So for example, in example 2, the 3s are in row 2, column 2. Then row 3, column 2. Then row 4, column 2. Then row 5, column 2. Then row 6, column 2. Then row 7, column 2. Then row 8, column 3. So this seems inconsistent. But perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that they start from the original position and expand in a certain direction, but the direction depends on the original value's position.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are placed in positions that are a certain distance away from the original value. For example, in example 2, the 2 is at (1,1). The 3s are spread in a way that they are in positions where the row is greater than or equal to the original row, and the column is equal to the original column. But this doesn't explain example 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value, the 3s are placed in all positions that are at a certain distance from the original value. For example, in example 2, the 2 is at (1,1). The 3s are placed in positions (row, column) where row >= 1 and column >= 1. But this would mean that the 3s are spread in a square, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that they form a diagonal line from the original value, moving in a certain direction. For example, in example 4, the 1 is at (1,11), and the 3s form a diagonal line from (2,11) down and left. In example 2, the 2 is at (1,1), and the 3s form a diagonal line from (2,2) down and right. But this would mean that the direction depends on the position of the original value.\n\nBut how to determine that direction? It seems that the direction is determined by the original value's position. For example, if the original value is in a position where the column is at the edge of the grid, the 3s spread in a certain direction.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a general rule that can explain all examples.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the 3s are spread in a way that they form a diagonal line from the original value. For example, in example 4, the 3s form a diagonal line from (2,11) down and left. In example 2, the 3s form a diagonal line from (2,2) down and right. In example 3, the 3s form a diagonal line from (2,5) down and left. In example 1, the 3s form a diagonal line from (4,5) down and left. Wait, but in example 1, the 3s are in row 4, column 5, then row 5, column 5, then row 6, column 5, etc. So this is a vertical line, not a diagonal. So this contradicts the earlier assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a way that they form a diagonal line from the original value, but in some cases, the line is vertical or horizontal.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows: for each non-zero value in the input grid, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from that value, moving in a certain direction. The direction depends on the position of the original value.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nPerhaps the key is to find for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from that value, moving in the direction of increasing row and decreasing column, or increasing row and increasing column, depending on the original value's position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value, the 3s are placed in positions that are a certain distance away from the original value, but in a specific pattern.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for example 1, the 3s are spread in a way that they form a diagonal line from the 1 in row 10, column 1. The 3s start at row 4, column 5. Wait, that's a lot of rows above. How is that possible?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a way that they are placed in positions where the row is greater than or equal to the original row, and the column is less than or equal to the original column. For example, in example 1, the original value is at (3,11). The 3s are in positions where row is >= 3 and column is <= 11. But this doesn't explain the 3s in row 4, column 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a way that they are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original value. For example, the 3s are placed in positions that are a certain number of steps away from the original value, in a diagonal direction.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the 3s are spread in a way that they form a diagonal line from the original value. For example, in example 4, the 1 is at (1,11), and the 3s form a diagonal line from (2,11) down and left. In example 2, the 2 is at (1,1), and the 3s form a diagonal line from (2,2) down and right. In example 3, the 2 is at (1,6), and the 3s form a diagonal line from (2,5) down and left. In example 1, the 2 is at (3,11), and the 3s form a diagonal line from (4,5) down and left. Wait, but how does that fit?\n\nIn example 1, the original 2 is at (3,11). The first 3 is at (4,5). So the row increases by 1, and the column decreases by 6. That seems like a large jump. This suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each non-zero value, the 3s are spread in a certain way, but it's not clear. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should try to find a general rule that can handle the examples.\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from the original value, moving in a certain direction. For example, in example 4, the 3s move down and left. In example 2, the 3s move down and right. In example 3, the 3s move down and left. In example 1, the 3s move down and left. But how to determine the direction?\n\nPerhaps the direction depends on the original value's position. For example, if the original value is at the left edge of the grid, the 3s spread to the right and down. If it's at the right edge, the 3s spread to the left and down.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAnother idea: the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original value, but in a diagonal direction. For example, the 3s are placed in positions (r + i, c - i), where i is a certain value. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value, the 3s are placed in a diagonal line from that value, moving in a direction determined by the value's position. For example, if the value is in the left half of the grid, the 3s spread to the right and down. If it's in the right half, the 3s spread to the left and down.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nMaybe the transformation is: for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from that value, moving in a certain direction, such that the 3s form a line that starts at a certain position and extends downwards.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value, the 3s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original value, and the direction is determined by the original value's position.\n\nGiven the time, I'll try to code a solution that for each non-zero value, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from that value, moving in a certain direction. For example, if the value is at (r, c), then for each row below, the 3s are placed in (r + i, c - i), where i is a certain value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value, the 3s are placed in positions (r, c) where r >= r0 and c <= c0, where r0 and c0 are the original row and column. This would mean that the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from the original value, moving down and left. This would explain example 4, example 3, example 1, and example 2.\n\nWait, in example 2, the original value is at (1,1). The 3s are spread in positions where r >= 1 and c <= 1. But in the output, the 3s are in (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), etc. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in positions where r >= r0 and c >= c0. This would mean that the 3s are spread to the right and down. This would explain example 2, where the 3s are in (2,2), (3,2), etc. But this doesn't fit example 4.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I'll try to find a pattern that can explain the examples.\n\nLooking at example 4, the 1 is at (1,11). The 3s start at (2,11), then (3,10), (4,9), etc. This is a diagonal line from (2,11) down and left. So for each row i, the column is 11 - (i - 2). For row 2, column 11. Row 3: 11 - 1 = 10. Row 4: 11 - 2 = 9, etc. So the pattern is column = original_col - (row - original_row). For example, original_row is 1, original_col is 11. For row r >= original_row, column c = original_col - (r - original_row). This would give c = 11 - (r - 1) = 12 - r. So for row 2, c = 12-2=10? No, that doesn't match. Wait, original_row is 1, original_col is 11. For row r, column c = original_col - (r - original_row). So for r=2, c = 11 - (2-1) = 10. For r=3, c = 11 - (3-1) = 9. Yes, this matches example 4. So this is the pattern for example 4.\n\nSimilarly, in example 2, the original value is at (1,1). The 3s start at (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), etc. Wait, this doesn't fit the pattern. Let's see: for row r >= 1, column c = 1 - (r - 1) = 2 - r. For r=2, c=0, which is not the case. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is different. In example 2, the 3s start at (2,2), and then for each row below, the column remains the same. So for row r >= 2, column is 2. This would mean that the 3s are spread vertically in column 2, starting from row 2. But why?\n\nBut in example 2, the 3s are in row 2, column 2, then row 3, column 2, then row 4, column 2, etc. So this is a vertical line. So the pattern here is that for the original value at (r0, c0), the 3s are spread in a vertical line in column c0, starting from row r0 + 1.\n\nBut why would this be the case? It seems inconsistent with other examples.\n\nBut if this is the case, then for example 4, the original value is at (1,11), and the 3s are spread in a diagonal line, but for example 2, the 3s are spread vertically.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent, which is confusing.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original value, and the direction depends on the original value's position.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from that value, moving in a direction determined by the original value's position. Specifically, for each non-zero value at (r, c), the 3s are placed in positions (r + i, c - i) for i >= 1, as long as the new position is within the grid.\n\nThis would explain example 4, where the original value is at (1,11), and the 3s are placed at (2,10), (3,9), etc. But in example 4, the first 3 is at (2,11), not (2,10). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are placed in positions (r + i, c + i), but this would fit example 2, where the 3s are in (2,2), (3,3), etc. But in example 2, the 3s are in (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), etc. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that can explain all examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLooking at example 4, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from (2,11) down and left. This suggests that for each non-zero value at (r, c), the 3s are spread in positions (r + i, c - i), where i is the number of steps.\n\nIn example 2, the 3s are spread in positions (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), etc. This doesn't fit the diagonal pattern, but maybe it's a special case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value, the 3s are placed in a vertical line in the same column as the original value, starting from the row below.\n\nFor example, in example 2, the original value is at (1,1). The 3s are placed in column 1, starting from row 2. But in the output, the 3s are in column 2, not 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to code a function that for each non-zero value, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from that value, moving down and left, and see if it fits the examples.\n\nSo, for each non-zero value at (r, c), we start at (r+1, c-1), then (r+2, c-2), and so on, as long as the new position is within the grid.\n\nFor example, in example 4, the original value is at (1,11). So the 3s are placed at (2,10), (3,9), etc. But in the output for example 4, the 3s are at (2,11), (3,10), (4,9), etc. So this suggests that the initial step is (r+1, c), then (r+2, c-1), etc. This is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are placed in a way that for each step, the row increases by 1 and the column decreases by 1, but starting from the original row + 1, column.\n\nIn example 4, original row is 1, column 11. So the first 3 is at (2,11), then (3,10), (4,9), etc. This fits.\n\nIn example 2, original row is 1, column 1. So the first 3 is at (2,1), then (3,0) (which is out of bounds). So this doesn't fit the example 2's output.\n\nBut in example 2, the first 3 is at (2,2). So this suggests that the pattern is different.\n\nAt this point, I think the best way is to code a function that for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are placed in a diagonal line from that value, moving down and left, and see if it fits some examples.\n\nSo, for each cell (r, c) in the input grid, if the value is non-zero, then for each i from 1 to max_steps, we place a 3 at (r + i, c - i), as long as the new position is within the grid.\n\nBut in example 2, this would not work. But perhaps the examples are not all covered by this pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are placed in a diagonal line from the original value, moving down and right. For example, in example 2, the original value is at (1,1), and the 3s are placed at (2,2), (3,3), etc. But in the output, the 3s are in (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), etc. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from that value, moving down and left. This would explain example 4, example 3, and example 1, but not example 2. But perhaps the examples are not all covered, but this is the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- Iterate over each cell in the input grid.\n\n- For each cell with value != 0, add 3 to the positions (r + i, c - i) for i >= 1, as long as the new row and column are within the grid.\n\nBut this would require checking for each cell, and for each possible i.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlso, note that the output grid must be 13x12. So the rows are from 0 to 12, and columns from 0 to 11.\n\nSo, for each cell (r, c) in the input grid:\n\nif grid[r][c] != 0:\n\n   for i in 1 to ...:\n\n      new_r = r + i\n\n      new_c = c - i\n\n      if new_r < 13 and new_c >= 0:\n\n          set output[new_r][new_c] = 3\n\n      else:\n\n          break\n\nBut this would only handle the diagonal line from the original value.\n\nLet's test this with example 4:\n\nOriginal value is at (1,11). So for i=1: new_r=2, new_c=11-1=10. So (2,10). But in the output, the first 3 is at (2,11). So this doesn't fit. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut in the output for example 4, the first 3 is at (2,11), then (3,10), etc. So this suggests that the new_c is c - (i-1), not c - i.\n\nWait, for i=1, new_r = 1 + 1 = 2, new_c = 11 - 0 = 11. So for i=1, new_c is c - 0 = 11. For i=2, new_c = 11 - 1 = 10, etc. So this would mean that the pattern is new_r = r + i, new_c = c - (i-1). This would give for i=1: (r+1, c), for i=2: (r+2, c-1), etc.\n\nSo this would explain example 4: for i=1, new_c = 11, new_r=2. For i=2, new_c=10, new_r=3, etc.\n\nThis seems to fit example 4. Let's see for example 2:\n\nOriginal value is at (1,1). For i=1: new_r=2, new_c=1. So (2,1). But in the output, the first 3 is at (2,2). So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 2, the first 3 is at (2,2), which would be for i=1, new_r=2, new_c=2. So this suggests that the pattern is new_r = r + i, new_c = c + i. But this would give for i=1, new_c=2.\n\nBut this would fit example 2, but not example 4.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that for each non-zero value, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from the original value, moving down and left, but starting at (r+1, c), then (r+2, c-1), etc.\n\nThis would be:\n\nfor r in range(13):\n\n    for c in range(12):\n\n        if grid[r][c] != 0:\n\n            for i in range(1, 13 - r):\n\n                new_r = r + i\n\n                new_c = c - (i - 1)\n\n                if new_c >= 0 and new_r < 13:\n\n                    output[new_r][new_c] = 3\n\nBut this would generate for example 4, the 3s at (2,11), (3,10), (4,9), etc., which fits.\n\nFor example 2, the original value is at (1,1). For i=1, new_r=2, new_c=1 - 0 = 1. So (2,1). But in the output, the 3 is at (2,2). So this doesn't fit. So this suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from the original value, moving down and right. For example, for i=1, new_r = r + i, new_c = c + i.\n\nIn example 2, this would give for i=1: (2,2), which fits. For i=2: (3,3), etc. But in the output, the 3s are in (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), etc. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that for each non-zero value, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from the original value, moving down and left, and see if it passes some examples.\n\nBut I'm not confident. However, given the examples, this seems like the best approach I can think of.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let's take each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has a 2 in the 13th row (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), and the output has that 2 in the same position. But then there's a 0 in the 10th row (row index 9?), and the output has a 3 in that row, but the 11th row (row index 10?) has a 1. Wait, looking at the output for example 1, the 10th row (probably row index 9) has a 1 in the second column. Wait, the input for example 1 has a 1 in row 10 (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), but the output has that 1 in the same position. But then the output has 3s spreading out from that position. Let me check again.\n\nIn example 1's input, the 10th row (row 10, since it's 13 rows) has a 1 in column 1. The output for that row is 0 1 0 ... So the 1 is preserved. But then, in the rows below, there's a spread of 3s. For example, row 11 (original input row 11) has 0s, but in the output, row 11 (original input row 11?) is the same as input. Wait, maybe the 3s are spreading out from the 1 in the input. Wait, the input has a 1 in row 10 (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), and the output has 3s in the rows below. Let me think: the output for example 1 has 3s in positions that are expanding outward from the 1. For example, row 10 (original input row 10) has a 1. Then row 11 (original input row 11) is the same as input. Wait, maybe the 3s are expanding in a certain pattern. Let me look at the output for example 1:\n\nLooking at the output rows:\n\nRow 4 (input row 4) has a 0 in column 11 (original input row 4, column 11 is 0). The output for row 4 has a 3 in column 5? Wait, no. Let me check the output for example 1 again. The output for example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: all 0s.\n\nRow 2: all 0s.\n\nRow 3: all 0s except column 11 is 2.\n\nRow 4: 0s except column 5 is 3?\n\nWait, the output for example 1's row 4 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 but no, looking at the output:\n\nThe output for example 1 is:\n\nRow 3: 0s except column 11 is 2.\n\nRow 4: 0s except column 5 is 3?\n\nWait, the output for example 1 is:\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 \u2192 so in row 4, columns 6-9 are 3s?\n\nWait, the output for example 1's row 4 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. So that's 12 columns. Wait, the grid is 13x12? Wait the input is 13 rows and 12 columns. So each row has 12 elements. So for example, in example 1's output, row 4 has a 3 in column 7, 8, 9? Or maybe columns 6-9?\n\nWait, the input for example 1 has a 2 in row 3 (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), column 11. The output for that row is same. Then in row 4, the output has a 3 in column 5? Or maybe the 3s are expanding in some way.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1, row 4 has a 3 in column 5? Or maybe the 3s are expanding outward from the 1 in row 10, column 1. Let me check the output for example 1's row 10. The input for row 10 is 0 1 0 ... and the output is same. Then, in row 11, the output is same as input. But in row 12, the output is same as input. Wait, but the output for example 1 has 3s in rows 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc. So maybe the 3s are expanding in a diagonal or some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a certain direction. For example, in example 1, the 1 is in row 10, column 1. Then, the 3s start appearing in row 4, which is 6 rows above. That seems odd. Wait, maybe the 3s are expanding in a certain way based on the position of the 1. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a spiral or some pattern. But that's hard to see. Let's look at example 2.\n\nIn example 2, the input has a 2 in row 1, column 1. The output for that row is same. Then, in the output, rows 2-8 have 3s in column 2, then row 8 has a 3 in column 3. Wait, the output for example 2:\n\nRow 0: 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 2 0 ... \n\nRow 2: 0 0 3 0 ... \n\nRow 3: 0 0 3 0 ... \n\nRow 4: 0 0 3 0 ... \n\nRow 5: 0 0 3 0 ... \n\nRow 6: 0 0 3 0 ... \n\nRow 7: 0 0 3 0 ... \n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 3 ... \n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 3 ... \n\nAnd so on. So the 3s are expanding outward from the 2 in row 1, column 1. The 3s are spreading in a diagonal direction. For example, row 2 has a 3 in column 2. Then row 3 has 3 in column 2. Then row 8 has 3 in column 3. So it's like the 3s are expanding in a way that each row adds a new 3 further to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a diagonal pattern. For example, in example 2, the 2 is at (1,1). Then, the 3s start at (2,2), then (3,2), then (4,2), etc. But that seems inconsistent. Wait, maybe the 3s are expanding in a certain direction. For example, the 3s are spreading to the right and down. But in example 2, row 2 has 3 in column 2. Then row 3 has 3 in column 2. Then row 8 has 3 in column 3. So perhaps the 3s are expanding in a way that each row adds a new 3 in the next column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that depends on the distance from the original value. For example, in example 1, the 1 is in row 10, column 1. Then, the 3s spread out from that position. But in example 1, the 3s start in row 4, which is 6 rows above. That seems like a lot. Maybe the 3s are expanding in a certain pattern based on the position of the original value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a certain direction. For example, in example 2, the 2 is at (1,1). Then, the 3s are expanding to the right and down. So for each row below, the 3s spread to the right. But in example 2, row 2 has a 3 in column 2. Then row 3 has 3 in column 2. Then row 8 has 3 in column 3. So perhaps the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in the same column as the previous row, but then in the next row, they move to the next column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a diagonal pattern. For example, in example 2, the 3s are in positions (row, column) where row + column is a certain value. Let me check:\n\nOriginal 2 is at (1,1). Then, the first 3 is at (2,2) (row + column = 4). Then, row 3, column 2: row + column = 5. Then row 4, column 2: row + column = 6. Then row 5, column 2: 7. Then row 6, column 2: 8. Then row 7, column 2: 9. Then row 8, column 3: 11. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in the same column as the original position plus some offset. For example, in example 2, the original 2 is at (1,1). Then, in row 2, column 2. Then row 3, column 2. Then row 8, column 3. Maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the column is increasing by 1 every certain steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a spiral or some pattern that depends on the position of the original value. But how?\n\nLooking at example 3. The input has a 2 in row 1, column 6 (assuming rows are 0-indexed). The output for that row is same. Then, in the output, the 3s start spreading out. The output for example 3's row 2 has a 3 in column 5. Then row 3 has 3 in column 5. Then rows 4-8 have 3 in column 5. Then row 11 has 3 in column 5. Then row 12 has 3 in column 4. So the 3s are expanding in a way that they start from the original position and spread outward in a certain direction. For example, the original 2 is at (1,6). Then, the 3s start in row 2, column 5. Then row 3, column 5. Then row 4, column 5. Then row 5, column 5. Then row 6, column 5. Then row 7, column 5. Then row 8, column 5. Then row 9, column 5. Then row 10, column 5. Then row 11, column 5. Then row 12, column 4. So this seems like the 3s are spreading in a diagonal direction. For example, each row adds a 3 in column 5, but then in the next row, it moves left by one. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a certain pattern based on the distance from the original value. For example, the original value is at (row, col), and then the 3s are placed in positions that are a certain distance away. But how?\n\nLooking at example 4. The input has a 1 in row 1, column 11. The output for that row is same. Then, in the output, the 3s start spreading. For example, row 2 has 3 in column 11. Then row 3 has 3 in column 10. Then row 4 has 3 in column 9. Then row 5 has 3 in column 8. Then row 6 has 3 in column 7. Then row 7 has 3 in column 6. Then row 8 has 3 in column 5. Then row 9 has 3 in column 4. Then row 10 has 3 in column 3. Then row 11 has 3 in column 2. Then row 12 has 3 in column 1. Then row 13 has 3 in column 0. Wait, no. The input for example 4 is 14 rows? Wait, no. Wait the input for example 4 is 14 rows? Because the test input is 14 rows. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 13x12. So the input for example 4 is 14 rows? Or perhaps the input is 13 rows. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 13x12. So the input for each example is 13 rows, 12 columns. Let me check example 4's input:\n\nThe input for example 4 is 14 rows? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. The test input is 14 rows. But the training examples have 13 rows. For example, example 1's input has 13 rows, as per the input given. So example 4's input is 13 rows. Let me check the input for example 4:\n\nThe input for example 4 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 ... 0 (12 elements)\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 ... 1 ... 0 (column 11 is 1)\n\nRow 2: all 0s.\n\n...\n\nRow 13: all 0s.\n\nWait, but that would be 14 rows. But the output is 13x12. So maybe the input for example 4 is 13 rows. Wait, the problem says that the output is always 13x12. So the input for each example is 13 rows, 12 columns. So example 4's input has 13 rows. So the input for example 4 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 ... 1 ... 0 (column 11 is 1).\n\nRow 2: all 0s.\n\n...\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nRow 13: all 0s? No, that's 14 rows. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the example 4 input again:\n\nThe input for example 4 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n... and so on for 13 rows. So the input has 13 rows. Then, the output for example 4 has a 1 in row 1, column 11. Then, the output has 3s spreading out in a way that in row 2, column 11 is 3. Then row 3, column 10 is 3. Then row 4, column 9 is 3. And so on. So the 3s are spreading out to the left and down. So for each row, the 3s are moving left by one column. So in row 2, column 11 is 3. Then row 3, column 10 is 3. Then row 4, column 9, etc. So this seems like a pattern where the 3s are expanding in a diagonal direction, moving left and down.\n\nSo for example 4, the original 1 is at (1,11). Then, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from (2,11) to (13, 0), but since there are only 13 rows, maybe up to row 12. Wait, the output for example 4 is 13 rows. So the 3s start at row 2, column 11 (row 2, column 11 is 3), then row 3, column 10 is 3, etc., until row 12, column 0 is 3. So the 3s are expanding in a diagonal line from (row, column) where row increases by 1 and column decreases by 1 each step.\n\nSimilarly, in example 2, the original 2 is at (1,1). The 3s spread in a diagonal line where row increases by 1 and column increases by 1. Wait, no. Because in example 2, the 3s start at (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), etc. Wait, that's not a diagonal. Wait, perhaps the pattern is different. Let me check again.\n\nIn example 2, the original 2 is at (1,1). The output for row 2 has a 3 in column 2. Then row 3 has a 3 in column 2. Then row 4 has a 3 in column 2. Then row 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, etc. Then row 8 has a 3 in column 3. Hmm, that seems inconsistent. Wait, maybe there's a different pattern. Maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in the same column as the original position plus some offset. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are expanding in a spiral or some other pattern. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking at all examples, perhaps the transformation is that any non-zero value in the input is replaced by a certain value, and then the 3s are spread out in a certain way. But how?\n\nWait, looking at example 1, the original 2 is in row 3, column 11. The output for that row is same. Then, in row 4, there's a 3 in column 5. Then in row 5, column 5 is 3. Then row 6, column 5 is 3. Then row 7, column 5 is 3. Then row 8, column 5 is 3. Then row 9, column 5 is 3. Then row 10, column 5 is 3. Then row 11, column 5 is 3. Then row 12, column 5 is 3. Wait, but the output for example 1 has in row 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. So columns 7-10 are 3s. Then row 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0. So column 6 is 3. Then row 6: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. Column 5 is 3. Then row 7: 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Column 4 is 3. Then row 8: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Column 3 is 3. Then row 9: 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Column 2 is 3. Then row 10: 0 1 0 ... So the 1 is preserved. Then row 11 and 12 are same as input. So the 3s are expanding in a diagonal pattern, moving left and up. So for example, the 3s are in positions where row increases by 1 and column decreases by 1 each time. But how does that fit with the example 1's 3s?\n\nIn example 1, the original 2 is in row 3, column 11. Then, the 3s start in row 4, column 5. Then row 5, column 5. Then row 6, column 5. Then row 7, column 5. Then row 8, column 5. Then row 9, column 5. Then row 10, column 5. Then row 11, column 5. Then row 12, column 5. Wait, that doesn't fit. Because the 3s are not moving in a diagonal. So perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in positions that are a certain distance from the original value. For example, the original value is at (row, col), and then the 3s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are spread out in a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the original 2 is at (3,11). Then the 3s are spread in a way that starts from that position and expands outward. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the 3s are spreading from the 1 in row 10, column 1. The 1 is in the input. The output has 3s expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in columns that are moving left. For example, row 10 has 1 in column 1. Then row 11 (input row 11) has 0s. But in the output, row 11 has 0s. Then row 12 has 0s. But in the output, the 3s are in row 4, 5, 6, etc. So this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are expanding in a way that for each non-zero value, the 3s are spread in a certain direction. For example, in example 2, the 2 is at (1,1). The 3s spread to the right and down. In example 4, the 1 is at (1,11), and the 3s spread to the left and down. In example 3, the 2 is at (1,6), and the 3s spread to the left and down. So maybe the pattern is that for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are spread in a diagonal direction from that value, moving in a certain direction.\n\nBut how to determine the direction? For example, in example 2, the 2 is at (1,1). The 3s spread to the right and down. So for each row below, the 3s are placed in the same column. Then, in row 8, the 3s are in column 3. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in the same column as the original value plus some offset. For example, in example 2, the original 2 is at (1,1). Then, the 3s are placed in row 2, column 2 (so row + 1, column + 1). Then row 3, column 2 (row + 2, column + 0). Then row 4, column 2 (row + 3, column + 0). Then row 5, column 2, etc. So this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a spiral pattern. But that's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for example 1, the 3s are spread in a way that they are expanding from the 1 in row 10, column 1. The 3s are in positions that are diagonally to the left and up. For example, row 4, column 5 is 3. Then row 5, column 5 is 3. Then row 6, column 5 is 3. Then row 7, column 5 is 3. Then row 8, column 5 is 3. Then row 9, column 5 is 3. Then row 10, column 5 is 3. Then row 11, column 5 is 3. Then row 12, column 5 is 3. So the 3s are expanding in a vertical line, but that doesn't fit with the example 1's output.\n\nWait, in example 1's output, row 4 has 3 in column 7, 8, 9. Then row 5 has 3 in column 6. Then row 6 has 3 in column 5. Then row 7 has 3 in column 4. Then row 8 has 3 in column 3. Then row 9 has 3 in column 2. Then row 10 has 3 in column 1. But the original 1 is in row 10, column 1. So the 3s are spreading from that position upwards and to the left. So for each row above, the 3s are moving left by one column. So the 3s are expanding in a diagonal line from the original position, moving up and left. But how?\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from that position, moving in a certain direction. For example, if the original value is at (row, col), then the 3s are spread in positions where row decreases by 1 and column decreases by 1 for each step. But how does that fit with example 2?\n\nIn example 2, the original 2 is at (1,1). The output has 3s in row 2, column 2 (row+1, column+1). Then row 3, column 2 (row+2, column+0). Then row 4, column 2 (row+3, column+0). Then row 5, column 2. This doesn't fit the diagonal pattern. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in the same column as the original position, but for rows below. For example, in example 2, the 3s start at row 2, column 2. Then row 3, column 2. Then row 4, column 2. Then row 5, column 2. Then row 6, column 2. Then row 7, column 2. Then row 8, column 3. So this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a way that they form a diamond shape. For example, the original value is at (row, col), and the 3s are spread in all directions, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the transformation rules that can explain all examples.\n\nLooking at example 1: the 2 is in row 3, column 11. The output has a 2 there. Then, the 3s are spread in a way that in row 4, column 5 is 3. Then row 5, column 5 is 3. Then row 6, column 5 is 3. Then row 7, column 5 is 3. Then row 8, column 5 is 3. Then row 9, column 5 is 3. Then row 10, column 5 is 3. Then row 11, column 5 is 3. Then row 12, column 5 is 3. So this is a vertical line of 3s starting from row 4, column 5. But why?\n\nIn example 2, the 2 is at row 1, column 1. The output has 3s in row 2, column 2. Then row 3, column 2. Then row 4, column 2. Then row 5, column 2. Then row 6, column 2. Then row 7, column 2. Then row 8, column 3. So this is a vertical line of 3s starting from row 2, column 2, then continuing down, then moving to the right.\n\nIn example 3, the 2 is at row 1, column 6. The output has 3s in row 2, column 5. Then row 3, column 5. Then row 4, column 5. Then row 5, column 5. Then row 6, column 5. Then row 7, column 5. Then row 8, column 5. Then row 9, column 5. Then row 10, column 5. Then row 11, column 5. Then row 12, column 4. So this is a vertical line of 3s starting at row 2, column 5, then moving down, then moving left.\n\nIn example 4, the 1 is at row 1, column 11. The output has 3s in row 2, column 11. Then row 3, column 10. Then row 4, column 9. Then row 5, column 8. Then row 6, column 7. Then row 7, column 6. Then row 8, column 5. Then row 9, column 4. Then row 10, column 3. Then row 11, column 2. Then row 12, column 1. So this is a diagonal line from row 2, column 11 down and left.\n\nSo it seems that the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from the original value. The direction depends on the original value's position. For example, in example 2, the original value is at (1,1), and the 3s spread to the right and down. In example 4, the original value is at (1,11), and the 3s spread to the left and down. In example 3, the original value is at (1,6), and the 3s spread to the left and down. In example 1, the original value is at (3,11), and the 3s spread to the left and down. But in example 1, the 3s are in a vertical line, not a diagonal.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's a pattern where the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from the original value, moving in a certain direction. For example, if the original value is in row r, column c, then the 3s are spread in the direction of row increasing and column decreasing, or row decreasing and column increasing, depending on the position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in the same column as the original value plus a certain offset. For example, in example 4, the 1 is at (1,11). The 3s start at row 2, column 11. Then row 3, column 10. So for each row, the column decreases by 1. So the pattern is row increases by 1, column decreases by 1. This forms a diagonal line from (row, column) = (2, 11) to (12, 0). But in example 4, the output has 3s in row 2, column 11; row 3, column 10; ... up to row 12, column 0. So that's a diagonal line.\n\nSimilarly, in example 2, the original 2 is at (1,1). The 3s are in row 2, column 2; row 3, column 2; row 4, column 2; ... up to row 8, column 3. Wait, that doesn't fit. But in example 2, after row 8, the 3s move to column 3. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in the same column as the original value, but for rows below. So for example, in example 2, the 3s are in row 2, column 2. Then row 3, column 2. Then row 4, column 2. Then row 5, column 2. Then row 6, column 2. Then row 7, column 2. Then row 8, column 3. So this seems inconsistent. But perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that they start from the original position and expand in a certain direction, but the direction depends on the original value's position.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are placed in positions that are a certain distance away from the original value. For example, in example 2, the 2 is at (1,1). The 3s are spread in a way that they are in positions where the row is greater than or equal to the original row, and the column is equal to the original column. But this doesn't explain example 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value, the 3s are placed in all positions that are at a certain distance from the original value. For example, in example 2, the 2 is at (1,1). The 3s are placed in positions (row, column) where row >= 1 and column >= 1. But this would mean that the 3s are spread in a square, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that they form a diagonal line from the original value, moving in a certain direction. For example, in example 4, the 1 is at (1,11), and the 3s form a diagonal line from (2,11) down and left. In example 2, the 2 is at (1,1), and the 3s form a diagonal line from (2,2) down and right. But this would mean that the direction depends on the position of the original value.\n\nBut how to determine that direction? It seems that the direction is determined by the original value's position. For example, if the original value is in a position where the column is at the edge of the grid, the 3s spread in a certain direction.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a general rule that can explain all examples.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the 3s are spread in a way that they form a diagonal line from the original value. For example, in example 4, the 3s form a diagonal line from (2,11) down and left. In example 2, the 3s form a diagonal line from (2,2) down and right. In example 3, the 3s form a diagonal line from (2,5) down and left. In example 1, the 3s form a diagonal line from (4,5) down and left. Wait, but in example 1, the 3s are in row 4, column 5, then row 5, column 5, then row 6, column 5, etc. So this is a vertical line, not a diagonal. So this contradicts the earlier assumption.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a way that they form a diagonal line from the original value, but in some cases, the line is vertical or horizontal.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows: for each non-zero value in the input grid, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from that value, moving in a certain direction. The direction depends on the position of the original value.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nPerhaps the key is to find for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from that value, moving in the direction of increasing row and decreasing column, or increasing row and increasing column, depending on the original value's position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value, the 3s are placed in positions that are a certain distance away from the original value, but in a specific pattern.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for example 1, the 3s are spread in a way that they form a diagonal line from the 1 in row 10, column 1. The 3s start at row 4, column 5. Wait, that's a lot of rows above. How is that possible?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a way that they are placed in positions where the row is greater than or equal to the original row, and the column is less than or equal to the original column. For example, in example 1, the original value is at (3,11). The 3s are in positions where row is >= 3 and column is <= 11. But this doesn't explain the 3s in row 4, column 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in a way that they are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original value. For example, the 3s are placed in positions that are a certain number of steps away from the original value, in a diagonal direction.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the 3s are spread in a way that they form a diagonal line from the original value. For example, in example 4, the 1 is at (1,11), and the 3s form a diagonal line from (2,11) down and left. In example 2, the 2 is at (1,1), and the 3s form a diagonal line from (2,2) down and right. In example 3, the 2 is at (1,6), and the 3s form a diagonal line from (2,5) down and left. In example 1, the 2 is at (3,11), and the 3s form a diagonal line from (4,5) down and left. Wait, but how does that fit?\n\nIn example 1, the original 2 is at (3,11). The first 3 is at (4,5). So the row increases by 1, and the column decreases by 6. That seems like a large jump. This suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each non-zero value, the 3s are spread in a certain way, but it's not clear. Given the time constraints, perhaps I should try to find a general rule that can handle the examples.\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from the original value, moving in a certain direction. For example, in example 4, the 3s move down and left. In example 2, the 3s move down and right. In example 3, the 3s move down and left. In example 1, the 3s move down and left. But how to determine the direction?\n\nPerhaps the direction depends on the original value's position. For example, if the original value is at the left edge of the grid, the 3s spread to the right and down. If it's at the right edge, the 3s spread to the left and down.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAnother idea: the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original value, but in a diagonal direction. For example, the 3s are placed in positions (r + i, c - i), where i is a certain value. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value, the 3s are placed in a diagonal line from that value, moving in a direction determined by the value's position. For example, if the value is in the left half of the grid, the 3s spread to the right and down. If it's in the right half, the 3s spread to the left and down.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nMaybe the transformation is: for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from that value, moving in a certain direction, such that the 3s form a line that starts at a certain position and extends downwards.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value, the 3s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original value, and the direction is determined by the original value's position.\n\nGiven the time, I'll try to code a solution that for each non-zero value, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from that value, moving in a certain direction. For example, if the value is at (r, c), then for each row below, the 3s are placed in (r + i, c - i), where i is a certain value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value, the 3s are placed in positions (r, c) where r >= r0 and c <= c0, where r0 and c0 are the original row and column. This would mean that the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from the original value, moving down and left. This would explain example 4, example 3, example 1, and example 2.\n\nWait, in example 2, the original value is at (1,1). The 3s are spread in positions where r >= 1 and c <= 1. But in the output, the 3s are in (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), etc. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are spread in positions where r >= r0 and c >= c0. This would mean that the 3s are spread to the right and down. This would explain example 2, where the 3s are in (2,2), (3,2), etc. But this doesn't fit example 4.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I'll try to find a pattern that can explain the examples.\n\nLooking at example 4, the 1 is at (1,11). The 3s start at (2,11), then (3,10), (4,9), etc. This is a diagonal line from (2,11) down and left. So for each row i, the column is 11 - (i - 2). For row 2, column 11. Row 3: 11 - 1 = 10. Row 4: 11 - 2 = 9, etc. So the pattern is column = original_col - (row - original_row). For example, original_row is 1, original_col is 11. For row r >= original_row, column c = original_col - (r - original_row). This would give c = 11 - (r - 1) = 12 - r. So for row 2, c = 12-2=10? No, that doesn't match. Wait, original_row is 1, original_col is 11. For row r, column c = original_col - (r - original_row). So for r=2, c = 11 - (2-1) = 10. For r=3, c = 11 - (3-1) = 9. Yes, this matches example 4. So this is the pattern for example 4.\n\nSimilarly, in example 2, the original value is at (1,1). The 3s start at (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), etc. Wait, this doesn't fit the pattern. Let's see: for row r >= 1, column c = 1 - (r - 1) = 2 - r. For r=2, c=0, which is not the case. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is different. In example 2, the 3s start at (2,2), and then for each row below, the column remains the same. So for row r >= 2, column is 2. This would mean that the 3s are spread vertically in column 2, starting from row 2. But why?\n\nBut in example 2, the 3s are in row 2, column 2, then row 3, column 2, then row 4, column 2, etc. So this is a vertical line. So the pattern here is that for the original value at (r0, c0), the 3s are spread in a vertical line in column c0, starting from row r0 + 1.\n\nBut why would this be the case? It seems inconsistent with other examples.\n\nBut if this is the case, then for example 4, the original value is at (1,11), and the 3s are spread in a diagonal line, but for example 2, the 3s are spread vertically.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent, which is confusing.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original value, and the direction depends on the original value's position.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from that value, moving in a direction determined by the original value's position. Specifically, for each non-zero value at (r, c), the 3s are placed in positions (r + i, c - i) for i >= 1, as long as the new position is within the grid.\n\nThis would explain example 4, where the original value is at (1,11), and the 3s are placed at (2,10), (3,9), etc. But in example 4, the first 3 is at (2,11), not (2,10). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are placed in positions (r + i, c + i), but this would fit example 2, where the 3s are in (2,2), (3,3), etc. But in example 2, the 3s are in (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), etc. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that can explain all examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLooking at example 4, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from (2,11) down and left. This suggests that for each non-zero value at (r, c), the 3s are spread in positions (r + i, c - i), where i is the number of steps.\n\nIn example 2, the 3s are spread in positions (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), etc. This doesn't fit the diagonal pattern, but maybe it's a special case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are spread in a way that for each non-zero value, the 3s are placed in a vertical line in the same column as the original value, starting from the row below.\n\nFor example, in example 2, the original value is at (1,1). The 3s are placed in column 1, starting from row 2. But in the output, the 3s are in column 2, not 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to code a function that for each non-zero value, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from that value, moving down and left, and see if it fits the examples.\n\nSo, for each non-zero value at (r, c), we start at (r+1, c-1), then (r+2, c-2), and so on, as long as the new position is within the grid.\n\nFor example, in example 4, the original value is at (1,11). So the 3s are placed at (2,10), (3,9), etc. But in the output for example 4, the 3s are at (2,11), (3,10), (4,9), etc. So this suggests that the initial step is (r+1, c), then (r+2, c-1), etc. This is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are placed in a way that for each step, the row increases by 1 and the column decreases by 1, but starting from the original row + 1, column.\n\nIn example 4, original row is 1, column 11. So the first 3 is at (2,11), then (3,10), (4,9), etc. This fits.\n\nIn example 2, original row is 1, column 1. So the first 3 is at (2,1), then (3,0) (which is out of bounds). So this doesn't fit the example 2's output.\n\nBut in example 2, the first 3 is at (2,2). So this suggests that the pattern is different.\n\nAt this point, I think the best way is to code a function that for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are placed in a diagonal line from that value, moving down and left, and see if it fits some examples.\n\nSo, for each cell (r, c) in the input grid, if the value is non-zero, then for each i from 1 to max_steps, we place a 3 at (r + i, c - i), as long as the new position is within the grid.\n\nBut in example 2, this would not work. But perhaps the examples are not all covered by this pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are placed in a diagonal line from the original value, moving down and right. For example, in example 2, the original value is at (1,1), and the 3s are placed at (2,2), (3,3), etc. But in the output, the 3s are in (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), etc. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: for each non-zero value in the input, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from that value, moving down and left. This would explain example 4, example 3, and example 1, but not example 2. But perhaps the examples are not all covered, but this is the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- Iterate over each cell in the input grid.\n\n- For each cell with value != 0, add 3 to the positions (r + i, c - i) for i >= 1, as long as the new row and column are within the grid.\n\nBut this would require checking for each cell, and for each possible i.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlso, note that the output grid must be 13x12. So the rows are from 0 to 12, and columns from 0 to 11.\n\nSo, for each cell (r, c) in the input grid:\n\nif grid[r][c] != 0:\n\n   for i in 1 to ...:\n\n      new_r = r + i\n\n      new_c = c - i\n\n      if new_r < 13 and new_c >= 0:\n\n          set output[new_r][new_c] = 3\n\n      else:\n\n          break\n\nBut this would only handle the diagonal line from the original value.\n\nLet's test this with example 4:\n\nOriginal value is at (1,11). So for i=1: new_r=2, new_c=11-1=10. So (2,10). But in the output, the first 3 is at (2,11). So this doesn't fit. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut in the output for example 4, the first 3 is at (2,11), then (3,10), etc. So this suggests that the new_c is c - (i-1), not c - i.\n\nWait, for i=1, new_r = 1 + 1 = 2, new_c = 11 - 0 = 11. So for i=1, new_c is c - 0 = 11. For i=2, new_c = 11 - 1 = 10, etc. So this would mean that the pattern is new_r = r + i, new_c = c - (i-1). This would give for i=1: (r+1, c), for i=2: (r+2, c-1), etc.\n\nSo this would explain example 4: for i=1, new_c = 11, new_r=2. For i=2, new_c=10, new_r=3, etc.\n\nThis seems to fit example 4. Let's see for example 2:\n\nOriginal value is at (1,1). For i=1: new_r=2, new_c=1. So (2,1). But in the output, the first 3 is at (2,2). So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 2, the first 3 is at (2,2), which would be for i=1, new_r=2, new_c=2. So this suggests that the pattern is new_r = r + i, new_c = c + i. But this would give for i=1, new_c=2.\n\nBut this would fit example 2, but not example 4.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that for each non-zero value, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from the original value, moving down and left, but starting at (r+1, c), then (r+2, c-1), etc.\n\nThis would be:\n\nfor r in range(13):\n\n    for c in range(12):\n\n        if grid[r][c] != 0:\n\n            for i in range(1, 13 - r):\n\n                new_r = r + i\n\n                new_c = c - (i - 1)\n\n                if new_c >= 0 and new_r < 13:\n\n                    output[new_r][new_c] = 3\n\nBut this would generate for example 4, the 3s at (2,11), (3,10), (4,9), etc., which fits.\n\nFor example 2, the original value is at (1,1). For i=1, new_r=2, new_c=1 - 0 = 1. So (2,1). But in the output, the 3 is at (2,2). So this doesn't fit. So this suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from the original value, moving down and right. For example, for i=1, new_r = r + i, new_c = c + i.\n\nIn example 2, this would give for i=1: (2,2), which fits. For i=2: (3,3), etc. But in the output, the 3s are in (2,2), (3,2), (4,2), etc. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that for each non-zero value, the 3s are spread in a diagonal line from the original value, moving down and left, and see if it passes some examples.\n\nBut I'm not confident. However, given the examples, this seems like the best approach I can think of.\n"
