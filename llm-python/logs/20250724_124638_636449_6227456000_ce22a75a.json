    "content": "Let me analyze the training examples to understand the pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n- Input has 5s at positions (1,1), (4,4), and (7,7)\n- Output creates 3x3 blocks of 1s at positions corresponding to those 5s\n- The 5 at (1,1) creates a 3x3 block at rows 0-2, cols 0-2\n- The 5 at (4,4) creates a 3x3 block at rows 3-5, cols 3-5\n- The 5 at (7,7) creates a 3x3 block at rows 6-8, cols 6-8\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n- Input has 5s at positions (1,4), (4,4), (7,4), and (7,7)\n- Output creates 3x3 blocks of 1s:\n  - The 5s at (1,4) and (4,4) seem to merge into one larger vertical block at columns 3-5, rows 0-5\n  - The 5 at (7,4) extends this block down to rows 6-8 for columns 3-5\n  - The 5 at (7,7) creates a 3x3 block at rows 6-8, cols 6-8, which merges with the existing pattern\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. Each '5' in the input creates a 3x3 block of '1's in the output\n2. The position of the 3x3 block is determined by the position of the '5'\n3. Specifically, a '5' at position (r,c) creates a 3x3 block with top-left corner at (r-1, c-1) to (r+1, c+1)\n4. But if multiple 5s are aligned (same column or row), their blocks merge\n\nLet me refine this understanding:\n- A '5' at (r,c) affects the 3x3 area centered around that position\n- When multiple 5s influence the same area, they create a continuous block of 1s\n\nActually, looking more carefully:\n- The output grid is divided conceptually into 3x3 blocks\n- If there's a '5' in any position that maps to a particular 3x3 output block, that entire block becomes '1's\n- The mapping seems to be: input position (r,c) affects output block at floor(r/3)*3 to floor(r/3)*3+2, floor(c/3)*3 to floor(c/3)*3+2\n\nLet me verify:\nExample 1:\n- (1,1) -> block rows 0-2, cols 0-2 \u2713\n- (4,4) -> block rows 3-5, cols 3-5 \u2713  \n- (7,7) -> block rows 6-8, cols 6-8 \u2713\n\nExample 2:\n- (1,4) -> block rows 0-2, cols 3-5\n- (4,4) -> block rows 3-5, cols 3-5\n- (7,4) -> block rows 6-8, cols 3-5\n- (7,7) -> block rows 6-8, cols 6-8\n\nThis creates the pattern in the output.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid filled with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # For each position in the input grid\n    for r in range(9):\n        for c in range(9):\n            # If there's a '5' at this position\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                # Determine which 3x3 block this affects\n                block_r = (r // 3) * 3\n                block_c = (c // 3) * 3\n                \n                # Fill the entire 3x3 block with 1s\n                for i in range(3):\n                    for j in range(3):\n                        output[block_r + i][block_c + j] = 1\n    \n    return output\n```",

Each '5' in the input creates a 3x3 block of '1's in the output\n2. The position of the 3x3 block is determined by the position of the '5'\n3. Specifically, a '5' at position (r,c) creates a 3x3 block with top-left corner at (r-1, c-1) to (r+1, c+1)\n4. But if multiple 5s are aligned (same column or row), their blocks merge\n\nLet me refine this understanding:\n- A '5' at (r,c) affects the 3x3 area centered around that position\n- When multiple 5s influence the same area, they create a continuous block of 1s\n\nActually, looking more carefully:\n- The output grid is divided conceptually into 3x3 blocks\n- If there's a '5' in any position that maps to a particular 3x3 output block, that entire block becomes '1's\n- The mapping seems to be: input position (r,c) affects output block at floor(r/3)*3 to floor(r/3)*3+2, floor(c/3)*3 to floor(c/3)*3+2\n\nLet me verify:\nExample 1:\n- (1,1) -> block rows 0-2, cols 0-2 \u2713\n- (4,4) -> block rows 3-5, cols 3-5 \u2713  \n- (7,7) -> block rows 6-8, cols 6-8 \u2713\n\nExample 2:\n- (1,4) -> block rows 0-2, cols 3-5\n- (4,4) -> block rows 3-5, cols 3-5\n- (7,4) -> block rows 6-8, cols 3-5\n- (7,7) -> block rows 6-8, cols 6-8\n\nThis creates the pattern in the output.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid filled with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # For each position in the input grid\n    for r in range(9):\n        for c in range(9):\n            # If there's a '5' at this position\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                # Determine which 3x3 block this affects\n                block_r = (r // 3) * 3\n                block_c = (c // 3) * 3\n                \n                # Fill the entire 3x3 block with 1s\n                for i in range(3):\n                    for j in range(3):\n                        output[block_r + i][block_c + j] = 1\n    \n    return output\n```",
