              "Observations from training examples:\n\n- The grid size is always 5x11.\n- Each input has two distinct nonzero numbers located in the same row: one near the left edge (col=0) and one near the right edge (col=10).\n- The rest of the row is zeroes.\n- The output:\n  - For the row that has those two numbers, the entire row is filled with the left color on the left side, the right color on the right side.\n  - Exactly one middle cell (col=5) for that row is filled with color 5.\n  \nFor example 1:\n- Input row 1 has `1` at col=0 and `2` at col=10.\n- Output row 1 has:\n  - cols 0 to 4 filled with 1,\n  - col 5 filled with 5,\n  - cols 6 to 10 filled with 2.\n  \nExample 2:\n- Input row 3 has `3` at col=0 and `7` at col=10.\n- Output row 3 has:\n  - cols 0 to 4 filled with 3,\n  - col 5 filled with 5,\n  - cols 6 to 10 filled with 7.\n\nThe rest of the rows in output are zeros.\n\nThus, the transformation is:\n- Find the row that contains two colored cells at col=0 and col=10.\n- For that row:\n  - Fill cols 0 to 4 with the left cell's color,\n  - Fill col 5 with color 5,\n  - Fill cols 6 to 10 with the right cell's color.\n- Keep all other rows zeros.\n\nThe test input has two rows with colors at col=0 and col=10, so we must apply this independently for each such row.\n\nNote: The pattern from training only shows one such row, so we will replicate the same pattern for each row that matches this condition.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # grid is 5x11 list of lists\n    # Create output grid of zeros\n    height, width = 5, 11\n    output = [[0]*width for _ in range(height)]\n    \n    for r in range(height):\n        left_color = grid[r][0]\n        right_color = grid[r][width-1]\n        \n        if left_color != 0 and right_color != 0:\n            # Fill left side cols 0-4\n            for c in range(0,5):\n                output[r][c] = left_color\n            # Middle col with 5\n            output[r][5] = 5\n            # Fill right side cols 6-10\n            for c in range(6,width):\n                output[r][c] = right_color\n        else:\n            # If condition not met, output row stays zeros\n            # (Could also copy entire row of zeros)\n            pass\n    \n    return output\n```"
