    "content": "Let me analyze the training examples to identify the pattern.\n\nFirst, let me examine the input and output grids more carefully:\n\nExample 1:\nInput (3\u00d77):\n```\n1 0 0 5 0 1 0\n0 1 0 5 1 1 1\n1 0 0 5 0 0 0\n```\nOutput (3\u00d73):\n```\n0 0 0\n0 2 0\n0 0 0\n```\n\nExample 2:\nInput (3\u00d77):\n```\n1 1 0 5 0 1 0\n0 0 1 5 1 1 1\n1 1 0 5 0 1 0\n```\nOutput (3\u00d73):\n```\n0 2 0\n0 0 2\n0 2 0\n```\n\nExample 3:\nInput (3\u00d77):\n```\n0 0 1 5 0 0 0\n1 1 0 5 1 0 1\n0 1 1 5 1 0 1\n```\nOutput (3\u00d73):\n```\n0 0 0\n2 0 0\n0 0 2\n```\n\nI notice that all input grids have a column of 5s in the middle (column 3). Let me look at the patterns more carefully.\n\nLet me check if there's a relationship between the left side (columns 0-2) and the output grid, and/or the right side (columns 4-6) and the output grid.\n\nLooking at positions where 2 appears in the output:\n- Example 1: Only at position (1,1) in output\n- Example 2: At positions (0,1), (1,2), (2,1) in output\n- Example 3: At positions (1,0), (2,2) in output\n\nLet me try to see if there's a pattern based on matching cells between left and right sides of the input grid:\n\nFor each row, I'll compare columns 0-2 with columns 4-6:\n- Example 1: \n  - Row 0: [1,0,0] vs [0,1,0] -> No matches\n  - Row 1: [0,1,0] vs [1,1,1] -> Match at column 1\n  - Row 2: [1,0,0] vs [0,0,0] -> Match at column 1,2\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me look at the symmetry or specific patterns.\n\nActually, let me check if the output is based on some operation between corresponding positions in the left (cols 0-2) and right (cols 4-6) parts:\n\nFor each position (i,j) in the 3\u00d73 output, maybe it's based on the values at positions (i,j) in the left part and (i,j) in the right part.\n\nLet me recheck Example 1:\nLeft part (cols 0-2):\n```\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n```\n\nRight part (cols 4-6):\n```\n0 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 0 0\n```\n\nIf I compare element-wise:\n- Position (0,0): 1 vs 0\n- Position (0,1): 0 vs 1\n- Position (0,2): 0 vs 0 -> Match\n- Position (1,0): 0 vs 1\n- Position (1,1): 1 vs 1 -> Match\n- Position (1,2): 0 vs 1\n- Position (2,0): 1 vs 0\n- Position (2,1): 0 vs 0 -> Match\n- Position (2,2): 0 vs 0 -> Match\n\nSo matches at (0,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2). But output has 2 only at (1,1). This doesn't match.\n\nLet me try another approach. What if the output cell (i,j) is 2 when the sum of corresponding elements in left and right parts equals a certain value?\n\nSum of left and right parts element-wise:\n- Position (0,0): 1+0=1\n- Position (0,1): 0+1=1\n- Position (0,2): 0+0=0\n- Position (1,0): 0+1=1\n- Position (1,1): 1+1=2\n- Position (1,2): 0+1=1\n- Position (2,0): 1+0=1\n- Position (2,1): 0+0=0\n- Position (2,2): 0+0=0\n\nOnly position (1,1) has sum 2, and output has 2 at (1,1). This matches!\n\nLet me verify with Example 2:\nLeft part:\n```\n1 1 0\n0 0 1\n1 1 0\n```\n\nRight part:\n```\n0 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 1 0\n```\n\nSum:\n- Position (0,0): 1+0=1\n- Position (0,1): 1+1=2\n- Position (0,2): 0+0=0\n- Position (1,0): 0+1=1\n- Position (1,1): 0+1=1\n- Position (1,2): 1+1=2\n- Position (2,0): 1+0=1\n- Position (2,1): 1+1=2\n- Position (2,2): 0+0=0\n\nPositions with sum 2: (0,1), (1,2), (2,1). Output has 2 at (0,1), (1,2), (2,1). This matches!\n\nExample 3:\nLeft part:\n```\n0 0 1\n1 1 0\n0 1 1\n```\n\nRight part:\n```\n0 0 0\n1 0 1\n1 0 1\n```\n\nSum:\n- Position (0,0): 0+0=0\n- Position (0,1): 0+0=0\n- Position (0,2): 1+0=1\n- Position (1,0): 1+1=2\n- Position (1,1): 1+0=1\n- Position (1,2): 0+1=1\n- Position (2,0): 0+1=1\n- Position (2,1): 1+0=1\n- Position (2,2): 1+1=2\n\nPositions with sum 2: (1,0), (2,2). Output has 2 at (1,0), (2,2). This matches!\n\nSo the pattern is: For each position (i,j) in the 3\u00d73 output grid, place 2 if the sum of the elements at position (i,j) in the left part (columns 0-2) and the right part (columns 4-6) of the input equals 2, otherwise place 0.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize 3x3 output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # For each position in the 3x3 grid\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # Sum of corresponding elements in left part (cols 0-2) and right part (cols 4-6)\n            left_val = grid[i][j]\n            right_val = grid[i][j + 4]  # Columns 4,5,6 correspond to output columns 0,1,2\n            if left_val + right_val == 2:\n                output[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return output\n```",

All input grids are 3\u00d77, and output grids are 3\u00d73\n2. Column 3 (0-indexed) always contains 5s - this seems to be a divider\n3. The output seems to be related to the right side of the input (columns 4-6)\n\nLet me analyze the relationship more carefully:\n\nLooking at the right side (columns 4-6) of each input and comparing to output:\n\nExample 1 right side:\n```\n0 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 0 0\n```\nOutput:\n```\n0 0 0\n0 2 0\n0 0 0\n```\n\nExample 2 right side:\n```\n0 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 1 0\n```\nOutput:\n```\n0 2 0\n0 0 2\n0 2 0\n```\n\nExample 3 right side:\n```\n0 0 0\n1 0 1\n1 0 1\n```\nOutput:\n```\n0 0 0\n2 0 0\n0 0 2\n```\n\nI notice that in the output, 2s appear to correspond to positions where there are 1s in the input, but not in a direct mapping.\n\nLet me look at this differently. Perhaps the output represents some kind of transformation or counting.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- In example 1: There are 3 ones on the right side, but only one 2 in output at center\n- In example 2: There are 5 ones on the right side, two 2s in output\n- In example 3: There are 4 ones on the right side, two 2s in output\n\nLet me think about positions. Maybe it's about corners or specific positions.\n\nActually, let me look at it this way - maybe the output grid corresponds to a 3x3 window on the right side, and 2s are placed based on some pattern.\n\nWait, let me check if it's about symmetry or specific positions:\n- The middle column (col 5) of the right part seems important\n- Or maybe it's about corners of the right 3x3 section\n\nLet me try a different approach. What if we look at the 3x3 section on the right side (columns 4-6) and apply some transformation?\n\nRight side sections:\nExample 1:\n```\n0 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 0 0\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\n0 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 1 0\n```\n\nExample 3:\n```\n0 0 0\n1 0 1\n1 0 1\n```\n\nHmm, let me think about what operation could produce the outputs.\n\nLooking at example 2, which has a symmetric pattern on the right:\n```\n0 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 1 0\n```\nOutput:\n```\n0 2 0\n0 0 2\n0 2 0\n```\n\nThis looks like it might be placing 2s at positions that correspond to 1s, but not all of them.\n\nLet me try one more approach. What if we're looking for specific patterns like corners or edges?\n\nActually, let me check if it's about counting 1s in rows/columns:\n- Example 1: Row sums on right side are [1, 3, 0] \u2192 Output has one 2\n- Example 2: Row sums on right side are [1, 3, 1] \u2192 Output has two 2s  \n- Example 3: Row sums on right side are [0, 2, 2] \u2192 Output has two 2s\n\nThat's not quite right either.\n\nLet me look at individual positions more systematically. What if the output 2s correspond to specific positions in the input?\n\nLooking at example 2 again:\nInput right side:\n```\n(0,4)=0 (0,5)=1 (0,6)=0\n(1,4)=1 (1,5)=1 (1,6)=1\n(2,4)=0 (2,5)=1 (2,6)=0\n```\n\nOutput:\n```\n(0,0)=0 (0,1)=2 (0,2)=0\n(1,0)=0 (1,1)=0 (1,2)=2\n(2,0)=0 (2,1)=2 (2,2)=0\n```\n\nI notice that when I have a 1 at position (0,5) in input, I get a 2 at (0,1) in output.\nPosition (0,5) in input corresponds to (0,1) in a 3x3 grid if we map column 4\u21920, 5\u21921, 6\u21922.\nBut that would put the 2 at (0,1) which matches!\n\nLet me check this mapping:\n- Input column 4 \u2192 Output column 0  \n- Input column 5 \u2192 Output column 1\n- Input column 6 \u2192 Output column 2\n\nAnd rows stay the same:\n- Input row 0 \u2192 Output row 0\n- Input row 1 \u2192 Output row 1  \n- Input row 2 \u2192 Output row 2\n\nSo the mapping is direct: output[r][c] = 2 if input[r][c+4] == 1, else 0.\n\nLet me verify:\nExample 1:\nInput right side:\n```\n0 1 0\n1 1 1  \n0 0 0\n```\n\nApplying mapping:\n```\n0 2 0\n2 2 2\n0 0 0\n```\n\nBut actual output is:\n```\n0 0 0\n0 2 0\n0 0 0\n```\n\nSo that's not right.\n\nLet me think of another approach. What if it's about specific patterns or rules?\n\nLooking at the outputs, they all have 2s in specific positions. Let me see if there's a rule about which 1s in the input get mapped to 2s in output.\n\nActually wait, let me recheck the examples more carefully.\n\nLooking at where 2s appear in outputs:\n- Example 1: Only at (1,1) \n- Example 2: At (0,1), (1,2), (2,1)\n- Example 3: At (1,0), (2,2)\n\nIs there a pattern in the input that corresponds to these positions?\n\nLet me try a hypothesis: maybe we look at the right 3 columns and apply some kind of cellular automaton rule or pattern matching.\n\nAnother idea: maybe we count neighbors or apply some convolution.\n\nLet me try to think of it as: we take the right 3 columns (4-6) and do some operation.\n\nActually, let me look at this systematically. What if it's about the specific arrangement of 1s?\n\nExample 2 has a cross pattern:\n```\n0 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 1 0\n```\n\nAnd the output has 2s at positions that avoid the center:\n```\n0 2 0\n0 0 2  <- but there's also a 2 at (2,1)\n0 2 0\n```\n\nWait, that's not quite a cross avoidance.\n\nLet me just implement my best hypothesis. Looking at the patterns, it seems like there might be a mapping where we look at specific positions or apply a rule.\n\nMy best guess is that we look at the right 3 columns of the input and apply some transformation. Since I can't see the exact pattern, I'll implement a reasonable transformation that captures some of the behavior.\n\nLooking at it again, maybe it's about finding isolated 1s or 1s in specific configurations.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize 3x3 output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Extract the right 3 columns (columns 4, 5, 6) from input\n",

Let me look at the patterns more carefully.\n\nLet me check if there's a relationship between the left side (columns 0-2) and the output grid, and/or the right side (columns 4-6) and the output grid.\n\nLooking at positions where 2 appears in the output:\n- Example 1: Only at position (1,1) in output\n- Example 2: At positions (0,1), (1,2), (2,1) in output\n- Example 3: At positions (1,0), (2,2) in output\n\nLet me try to see if there's a pattern based on matching cells between left and right sides of the input grid:\n\nFor each row, I'll compare columns 0-2 with columns 4-6:\n- Example 1: \n  - Row 0: [1,0,0] vs [0,1,0] -> No matches\n  - Row 1: [0,1,0] vs [1,1,1] -> Match at column 1\n  - Row 2: [1,0,0] vs [0,0,0] -> Match at column 1,2\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me look at the symmetry or specific patterns.\n\nActually, let me check if the output is based on some operation between corresponding positions in the left (cols 0-2) and right (cols 4-6) parts:\n\nFor each position (i,j) in the 3\u00d73 output, maybe it's based on the values at positions (i,j) in the left part and (i,j) in the right part.\n\nLet me recheck Example 1:\nLeft part (cols 0-2):\n```\n1 0 0\n0 1 0\n1 0 0\n```\n\nRight part (cols 4-6):\n```\n0 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 0 0\n```\n\nIf I compare element-wise:\n- Position (0,0): 1 vs 0\n- Position (0,1): 0 vs 1\n- Position (0,2): 0 vs 0 -> Match\n- Position (1,0): 0 vs 1\n- Position (1,1): 1 vs 1 -> Match\n- Position (1,2): 0 vs 1\n- Position (2,0): 1 vs 0\n- Position (2,1): 0 vs 0 -> Match\n- Position (2,2): 0 vs 0 -> Match\n\nSo matches at (0,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2). But output has 2 only at (1,1). This doesn't match.\n\nLet me try another approach. What if the output cell (i,j) is 2 when the sum of corresponding elements in left and right parts equals a certain value?\n\nSum of left and right parts element-wise:\n- Position (0,0): 1+0=1\n- Position (0,1): 0+1=1\n- Position (0,2): 0+0=0\n- Position (1,0): 0+1=1\n- Position (1,1): 1+1=2\n- Position (1,2): 0+1=1\n- Position (2,0): 1+0=1\n- Position (2,1): 0+0=0\n- Position (2,2): 0+0=0\n\nOnly position (1,1) has sum 2, and output has 2 at (1,1). This matches!\n\nLet me verify with Example 2:\nLeft part:\n```\n1 1 0\n0 0 1\n1 1 0\n```\n\nRight part:\n```\n0 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 1 0\n```\n\nSum:\n- Position (0,0): 1+0=1\n- Position (0,1): 1+1=2\n- Position (0,2): 0+0=0\n- Position (1,0): 0+1=1\n- Position (1,1): 0+1=1\n- Position (1,2): 1+1=2\n- Position (2,0): 1+0=1\n- Position (2,1): 1+1=2\n- Position (2,2): 0+0=0\n\nPositions with sum 2: (0,1), (1,2), (2,1). Output has 2 at (0,1), (1,2), (2,1). This matches!\n\nExample 3:\nLeft part:\n```\n0 0 1\n1 1 0\n0 1 1\n```\n\nRight part:\n```\n0 0 0\n1 0 1\n1 0 1\n```\n\nSum:\n- Position (0,0): 0+0=0\n- Position (0,1): 0+0=0\n- Position (0,2): 1+0=1\n- Position (1,0): 1+1=2\n- Position (1,1): 1+0=1\n- Position (1,2): 0+1=1\n- Position (2,0): 0+1=1\n- Position (2,1): 1+0=1\n- Position (2,2): 1+1=2\n\nPositions with sum 2: (1,0), (2,2). Output has 2 at (1,0), (2,2). This matches!\n\nSo the pattern is: For each position (i,j) in the 3\u00d73 output grid, place 2 if the sum of the elements at position (i,j) in the left part (columns 0-2) and the right part (columns 4-6) of the input equals 2, otherwise place 0.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize 3x3 output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # For each position in the 3x3 grid\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # Sum of corresponding elements in left part (cols 0-2) and right part (cols 4-6)\n            left_val = grid[i][j]\n            right_val = grid[i][j + 4]  # Columns 4,5,6 correspond to output columns 0,1,2\n            if left_val + right_val == 2:\n                output[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return output\n```",
