It iterates through each cell in the grid and replaces the value with its corresponding value from the `value_mapping` dictionary. If the value is not in the dictionary, it remains unchanged. This approach captures the basic transformation observed in the training examples.",

The diagonal pattern can be achieved by iterating through the grid and checking the positions `(i, i)` and `(i, 9 - i)`.\n\n### Python Function\nHere is the Python function that implements the transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]  # Create a deep copy of the grid\n    \n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if i == j or i == 9 - j:\n                if grid[i][j] in [0, 2, 8, 7, 4, 5, 1, 3, 6]:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Deep Copy**: We create a deep copy of the input grid to avoid modifying the original grid.\n2. **Diagonal Iteration**: We iterate through the grid using two nested loops. For each cell `(i, j)`, we check if it lies on the main diagonal (`i == j`) or the anti-diagonal (`i == 9 - j`).\n3. **Replacement**: If the cell value is in the list `[0, 2, 8, 7, 4, 5, 1, 3, 6]`, we replace it with `3`.\n\nThis function should handle the transformation as described in the training examples.",
