In Example 1, the output grid has some cells set to 0 where the input had values, suggesting a transformation that zeroes out certain cells.\n2. In Example 2, similar patterns are observed where certain cells are set to 0.\n3. In Example 3, there are more complex patterns where certain cells are set to 0 based on their position relative to other cells.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves setting certain cells to 0 based on their position relative to other cells. Specifically, it seems like cells that are in certain positions (like the center of the grid) are being set to 0.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(20):\n        for j in range(20):\n            # Set cells in the center 4x4 area to 0\n            if 8 <= i <= 11 and 8 <= j <= 11:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(20):\n        for j in range(20):\n            # Set cells in the center 4x4 area to 0\n            if 8 <= i <= 11 and 8 <= j <= 11:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 1, the output grid has some cells set to 0 where the input had values, suggesting a transformation that zeroes out certain cells.\n2. In Example 2, similar patterns are observed where certain cells are set to 0.\n3. In Example 3, there are more complex patterns where certain cells are set to 0 based on their position relative to other cells.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves setting certain cells to 0 based on their position relative to other cells. Specifically, it seems like cells that are in certain positions (like the center of the grid) are being set to 0.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(20):\n        for j in range(20):\n            # Set cells in the center 4x4 area to 0\n            if 8 <= i <= 11 and 8 <= j <= 11:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(20):\n        for j in range(20):\n            # Set cells in the center 4x4 area to 0\n            if 8 <= i <= 11 and 8 <= j <= 11:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
