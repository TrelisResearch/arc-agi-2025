    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to take the input grid and transform it into the output grid. Let's look at the examples to see what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput is a 5x5 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. Wait, the input is 5 rows each with 5 elements? Wait, the input for example 1 is given as lines like \"1 0 0 0 9\" which is 5 elements. So the input is a 5x5 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. So the transformation is from 5x5 to 3x3.\n\nBut how? Let me check the outputs. For example 1, the output is three rows each with three numbers. Let me think about how each output cell is derived from the input.\n\nLooking at the first output row: 1 5 9. Let's see where these numbers come from in the input. The input's first row is 1 0 0 0 9. The first output row's first element is 1, which is from the first row, first column of the input. Then the second element in the output is 5. Looking at the input's second row: 0 5 0 8 0. The second element here is 5. Then the third element in the output is 9, which is from the first row's fifth element (since the first row's fifth element is 9). Hmm, maybe the output is taking elements from the input's first, second, and fifth columns? Or maybe some other pattern.\n\nWait, the output for example 1 is:\n\n1 5 9\n\n8 7 8\n\n9 5 1\n\nLooking at the first row of output: 1,5,9. The input's first row is 1 0 0 0 9. The second row is 0 5 0 8 0. The fifth row is 9 0 0 0 1. So maybe the first row of output is taking elements from the first, second, and fifth rows of the input? Like, first element is first row first column (1), second element is second row second column (5), third element is fifth row first column (9)? Wait, fifth row is 9 0 0 0 1. So first column is 9. That would make sense. Then the first output row is [input[0][0], input[1][1], input[4][0]]?\n\nBut then the second output row is 8 7 8. Let's see. The second row of output: 8 comes from input[1][3] (second row, fourth column is 8?), then 7 is input[2][2] (third row, third column is 7?), then 8 again from input[3][3] (fourth row, fourth column is 5? Wait no. Wait the third row of input is 0 0 7 0 0. So third row third column is 7. Fourth row is 0 8 0 5 0. Fourth row third column is 0? Wait maybe I need to look at the input rows again.\n\nWait example 1 input:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 0 0 9\n\nRow 1: 0 5 0 8 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 7 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 8 0 5 0\n\nRow 4: 9 0 0 0 1\n\nSo the output first row is 1,5,9. So 1 is from row 0, column 0. 5 is row 1, column 1. 9 is row 4, column 0. Then second output row is 8,7,8. Let's see: 8 is row 1, column 3 (value 8). 7 is row 2, column 2 (7). 8 is row 3, column 1 (8). Then third output row is 9,5,1. 9 is row 4, column 0 (from input). 5 is row 1, column 1 (again?), 1 is row 4, column 4 (value 1).\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe the output is taking elements from certain positions in the input. Let's think of the output as a 3x3 grid. Maybe each cell in the output is derived from some combination of input cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output's first row is [input[0][0], input[1][1], input[4][0]]? Then the second row is [input[1][3], input[2][2], input[3][1]]? And the third row is [input[4][0], input[1][1], input[4][4]]? That seems arbitrary, but maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first, second, and fifth rows of the input, and then taking certain columns. For example, the first row of the output is the first, second, and fifth rows' first, second, and first columns? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is derived from the input's cells in a certain way. For example, the output cell (i,j) is computed from some combination of input cells. Let's think of the output as being generated by some formula.\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nOutput row 0: 1,5,9\n\nOutput row 1: 8,7,8\n\nOutput row 2:9,5,1\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the output is taking the first, second, and fifth rows, and then taking certain columns. For example, the first row of output is from row 0, columns 0, 1, 4. Because row 0 is [1,0,0,0,9], so columns 0, 1, 4 would be 1, 0, 9. But the output is 1,5,9. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the first row is taking the first, second, and fifth rows' first, second, and fifth columns? Let's see:\n\nRow 0: first column is 1, second is 0, fifth is 9. But the output is 1,5,9. So the second element is 5, which comes from row 1's second column (5). So maybe the first output row is combining elements from row 0, row 1, and row 4. For example:\n\noutput[0][0] = input[0][0]\n\noutput[0][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[0][2] = input[4][0]\n\nSimilarly, output[1][0] = input[1][3], output[1][1] = input[2][2], output[1][2] = input[3][1]\n\nThen output[2][0] = input[4][0], output[2][1] = input[1][1], output[2][2] = input[4][4]\n\nBut how does that fit with the examples?\n\nIn example 1, the output row 2 is 9,5,1. The input row 4 is [9,0,0,0,1]. So input[4][0] is 9, input[4][4] is 1. So output row 2 would be 9,5,1. Which matches. So for output row 2, the first element is input[4][0], second is input[1][1], third is input[4][4].\n\nSo maybe the output is constructed by taking certain positions from the input. Let's try to see for each output cell.\n\nAnother way: the output is 3x3. Let's think of each output cell as being derived from the input's rows and columns in some way. For example, the output cell (i,j) is derived from input's row (i + something) and column (j + something). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first, second, and fifth rows of the input, and then taking certain columns. Let's look at the first output row: 1,5,9. These come from input row 0 (1), input row 1 (5), input row 4 (9). Then the second output row is 8,7,8. These come from input row 1 (8?), input row 2 (7?), input row 3 (8). Then third output row is 9,5,1. Which comes from input row 4 (9), input row 1 (5), input row 4 (1).\n\nSo for the first row of output, it's taking elements from rows 0, 1, 4. For the second row, rows 1, 2, 3. For the third row, rows 4, 1, 4.\n\nBut how to map this to columns? For the first row of output, the elements are input row 0, column 0; row 1, column 1; row 4, column 0. Then for the second row of output, input row 1, column 3; row 2, column 2; row 3, column 1. Third row: row 4, column 0; row 1, column 1; row 4, column 4.\n\nSo maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. Let's think of the output as being formed by:\n\nFor output row i, the elements are:\n\noutput[0][0] = input[0][0]\n\noutput[0][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[0][2] = input[4][0]\n\noutput[1][0] = input[1][3]\n\noutput[1][1] = input[2][2]\n\noutput[1][2] = input[3][1]\n\noutput[2][0] = input[4][0]\n\noutput[2][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[2][2] = input[4][4]\n\nBut how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nLet's check example 2:\n\nInput:\n\n6 0 0 0 7\n\n0 2 0 4 0\n\n0 0 3 0 0\n\n0 4 0 2 0\n\n7 0 0 0 6\n\nOutput:\n\n6 2 7\n\n4 3 4\n\n7 2 6\n\nSo output is 3x3. Let's see if the same pattern applies.\n\nFirst output row: 6,2,7.\n\nLooking at input rows 0,1,4.\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0 0 7 \u2192 column 0 is 6, column 1 is 0, column 4 is 7. So output[0][0] is 6, output[0][1] is 2 (from input row 1, column 1?), output[0][2] is 7 (from input row 4, column 0? Wait input row 4 is [7,0,0,0,6]. Column 0 is 7. So yes. So output[0][0] is input[0][0], output[0][1] is input[1][1], output[0][2] is input[4][0].\n\nThen second row of output is 4,3,4. Let's see:\n\ninput row 1, column 3 (row 1 is [0,2,0,4,0], column 3 is 4). Then input row 2, column 2 (row 2 is [0,0,3,0,0], column 2 is 3). Then input row 3, column 1 (row 3 is [0,4,0,2,0], column 1 is 4). So output[1][0] = 4, output[1][1] = 3, output[1][2] = 4. Which matches the output row 1 of example 2.\n\nThird row of output is 7,2,6. Which would be input row 4, column 0 (7), input row 1, column 1 (2), input row 4, column 4 (6). Which matches. So yes, the same pattern seems to apply here.\n\nSimilarly for example 3:\n\nInput:\n\n2 0 0 0 1\n\n0 3 0 6 0\n\n0 0 4 0 0\n\n0 6 0 3 0\n\n1 0 0 0 2\n\nOutput:\n\n2 3 1\n\n6 4 6\n\n1 3 2\n\nLet's check the first output row: 2,3,1.\n\nInput row 0: column 0 is 2, row 1 column 1 is 3, row 4 column 0 is 1. So yes.\n\nSecond output row is 6,4,6. Let's see:\n\nrow 1, column 3: row 1 is [0,3,0,6,0], column 3 is 6. row 2 column 2 is 4. row 3 column 1 is 6. So output row 1 is 6,4,6. Which matches.\n\nThird row: row 4 column 0 is 1, row 1 column 1 is 3, row 4 column 4 is 2. So output row 2 is 1,3,2. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output is constructed by taking:\n\nFor each output row i (0, 1, 2):\n\n- output[i][0] is input[ (i + 0) ][ (some column) ] ?\n\nWait, for output row 0:\n\noutput[0][0] = input[0][0]\n\noutput[0][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[0][2] = input[4][0]\n\nFor output row 1:\n\noutput[1][0] = input[1][3]\n\noutput[1][1] = input[2][2]\n\noutput[1][2] = input[3][1]\n\nFor output row 2:\n\noutput[2][0] = input[4][0]\n\noutput[2][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[2][2] = input[4][4]\n\nSo the output is constructed by taking specific positions from the input. Let's think of the output as follows:\n\nThe first row of output is taking elements from input rows 0, 1, 4, and columns 0, 1, 0 respectively.\n\nThe second row is taking elements from input rows 1, 2, 3, and columns 3, 2, 1 respectively.\n\nThe third row is taking elements from input rows 4, 1, 4, and columns 0, 1, 4 respectively.\n\nSo the output is constructed by:\n\noutput[0][0] = input[0][0]\n\noutput[0][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[0][2] = input[4][0]\n\noutput[1][0] = input[1][3]\n\noutput[1][1] = input[2][2]\n\noutput[1][2] = input[3][1]\n\noutput[2][0] = input[4][0]\n\noutput[2][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[2][2] = input[4][4]\n\nSo the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is taken from specific positions in the input.\n\nSo the code needs to take the input grid (which is 5x5) and extract these values.\n\nSo the function would take the input grid (a list of 5 lists, each with 5 elements), and return a 3x3 grid as per the above.\n\nSo for the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # grid is a 5x5 list of lists\n    # create the output grid\n    output = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    output[0][0] = grid[0][0]\n    output[0][1] = grid[1][1]\n    output[0][2] = grid[4][0]\n    output[1][0] = grid[1][3]\n    output[1][1] = grid[2][2]\n    output[1][2] = grid[3][1]\n    output[2][0] = grid[4][0]\n    output[2][1] = grid[1][1]\n    output[2][2] = grid[4][4]\n    return output\n\nWait, but in example 1, the output row 2 is 9,5,1. Which is grid[4][0] (9), grid[1][1] (5), grid[4][4] (1). Which is correct.\n\nTesting this code with the examples:\n\nFor example 1, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 0 0 9 \u2192 grid[0][0] = 1, grid[0][4] =9\n\nRow 1: 0 5 0 8 0 \u2192 grid[1][1] =5, grid[1][3]=8\n\nRow 2: 0 0 7 0 0 \u2192 grid[2][2] =7\n\nRow 3: 0 8 0 5 0 \u2192 grid[3][1] =8\n\nRow 4: 9 0 0 0 1 \u2192 grid[4][0] =9, grid[4][4]=1.\n\nSo output[0][0] is 1, output[0][1] is 5, output[0][2] is 9 (from grid[4][0] which is 9). So first row is [1,5,9], which matches.\n\nSecond row: output[1][0] is grid[1][3] =8, output[1][1] is grid[2][2] =7, output[1][2] is grid[3][1] =8. So [8,7,8], which matches.\n\nThird row: output[2][0] is grid[4][0] =9, output[2][1] is grid[1][1]=5, output[2][2] is grid[4][4] =1. So [9,5,1], which matches.\n\nSimilarly for example 2, the code would generate the correct output.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n7 0 0 0 5\n0 6 0 4 0\n0 0 2 0 0\n0 4 0 6 0\n5 0 0 0 7\n\nSo the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements.\n\nSo according to the code, the output would be:\n\noutput[0][0] = grid[0][0] =7\n\noutput[0][1] = grid[1][1] =6\n\noutput[0][2] = grid[4][0] =5\n\nSo first row: 7,6,5.\n\nSecond row:\n\noutput[1][0] = grid[1][3] =4\n\noutput[1][1] = grid[2][2] =2\n\noutput[1][2] = grid[3][1] =4\n\nSo second row: 4,2,4.\n\nThird row:\n\noutput[2][0] = grid[4][0] =5\n\noutput[2][1] = grid[1][1] =6\n\noutput[2][2] = grid[4][4] =7\n\nSo third row:5,6,7.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n7 6 5\n\n4 2 4\n\n5 6 7\n\nBut I need to make sure that this is the correct transformation. However, the code is based on the training examples, and the test input is just for context.\n\nSo the code would be as written above.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python. The function transform takes a 2D list (grid) as input, and returns a 3x3 grid.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [\n        [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[4][0]],\n        [grid[1][3], grid[2][2], grid[3][1]],\n        [grid[4][0], grid[1][1], grid[4][4]]\n    ]\n    return output\n\nYes, that's the code. Let me check again.\n\nYes, the output is constructed as follows:\n\nRow 0: [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[4][0]]\n\nRow 1: [grid[1][3], grid[2][2], grid[3][1]]\n\nRow 2: [grid[4][0], grid[1][1], grid[4][4]]\n\nThis seems to be the correct pattern based on the training examples.\n\nSo this should be the code.\n"

Wait, the input for example 1 is given as lines like \"1 0 0 0 9\" which is 5 elements. So the input is a 5x5 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. So the transformation is from 5x5 to 3x3.\n\nBut how? Let me check the outputs. For example 1, the output is three rows each with three numbers. Let me think about how each output cell is derived from the input.\n\nLooking at the first output row: 1 5 9. Let's see where these numbers come from in the input. The input's first row is 1 0 0 0 9. The first output row's first element is 1, which is from the first row, first column of the input. Then the second element in the output is 5. Looking at the input's second row: 0 5 0 8 0. The second element here is 5. Then the third element in the output is 9, which is from the first row's fifth element (since the first row's fifth element is 9). Hmm, maybe the output is taking elements from the input's first, second, and fifth columns? Or maybe some other pattern.\n\nWait, the output for example 1 is:\n\n1 5 9\n\n8 7 8\n\n9 5 1\n\nLooking at the first row of output: 1,5,9. The input's first row is 1 0 0 0 9. The second row is 0 5 0 8 0. The fifth row is 9 0 0 0 1. So maybe the first row of output is taking elements from the first, second, and fifth rows of the input? Like, first element is first row first column (1), second element is second row second column (5), third element is fifth row first column (9)? Wait, fifth row is 9 0 0 0 1. So first column is 9. That would make sense. Then the first output row is [input[0][0], input[1][1], input[4][0]]?\n\nBut then the second output row is 8 7 8. Let's see. The second row of output: 8 comes from input[1][3] (second row, fourth column is 8?), then 7 is input[2][2] (third row, third column is 7?), then 8 again from input[3][3] (fourth row, fourth column is 5? Wait no. Wait the third row of input is 0 0 7 0 0. So third row third column is 7. Fourth row is 0 8 0 5 0. Fourth row third column is 0? Wait maybe I need to look at the input rows again.\n\nWait example 1 input:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 0 0 9\n\nRow 1: 0 5 0 8 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 7 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 8 0 5 0\n\nRow 4: 9 0 0 0 1\n\nSo the output first row is 1,5,9. So 1 is from row 0, column 0. 5 is row 1, column 1. 9 is row 4, column 0. Then second output row is 8,7,8. Let's see: 8 is row 1, column 3 (value 8). 7 is row 2, column 2 (7). 8 is row 3, column 1 (8). Then third output row is 9,5,1. 9 is row 4, column 0 (from input). 5 is row 1, column 1 (again?), 1 is row 4, column 4 (value 1).\n\nHmm, not sure. Maybe the output is taking elements from certain positions in the input. Let's think of the output as a 3x3 grid. Maybe each cell in the output is derived from some combination of input cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output's first row is [input[0][0], input[1][1], input[4][0]]? Then the second row is [input[1][3], input[2][2], input[3][1]]? And the third row is [input[4][0], input[1][1], input[4][4]]? That seems arbitrary, but maybe there's a pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first, second, and fifth rows of the input, and then taking certain columns. For example, the first row of the output is the first, second, and fifth rows' first, second, and first columns? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is derived from the input's cells in a certain way. For example, the output cell (i,j) is computed from some combination of input cells. Let's think of the output as being generated by some formula.\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nOutput row 0: 1,5,9\n\nOutput row 1: 8,7,8\n\nOutput row 2:9,5,1\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the output is taking the first, second, and fifth rows, and then taking certain columns. For example, the first row of output is from row 0, columns 0, 1, 4. Because row 0 is [1,0,0,0,9], so columns 0, 1, 4 would be 1, 0, 9. But the output is 1,5,9. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the first row is taking the first, second, and fifth rows' first, second, and fifth columns? Let's see:\n\nRow 0: first column is 1, second is 0, fifth is 9. But the output is 1,5,9. So the second element is 5, which comes from row 1's second column (5). So maybe the first output row is combining elements from row 0, row 1, and row 4. For example:\n\noutput[0][0] = input[0][0]\n\noutput[0][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[0][2] = input[4][0]\n\nSimilarly, output[1][0] = input[1][3], output[1][1] = input[2][2], output[1][2] = input[3][1]\n\nThen output[2][0] = input[4][0], output[2][1] = input[1][1], output[2][2] = input[4][4]\n\nBut how does that fit with the examples?\n\nIn example 1, the output row 2 is 9,5,1. The input row 4 is [9,0,0,0,1]. So input[4][0] is 9, input[4][4] is 1. So output row 2 would be 9,5,1. Which matches. So for output row 2, the first element is input[4][0], second is input[1][1], third is input[4][4].\n\nSo maybe the output is constructed by taking certain positions from the input. Let's try to see for each output cell.\n\nAnother way: the output is 3x3. Let's think of each output cell as being derived from the input's rows and columns in some way. For example, the output cell (i,j) is derived from input's row (i + something) and column (j + something). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first, second, and fifth rows of the input, and then taking certain columns. Let's look at the first output row: 1,5,9. These come from input row 0 (1), input row 1 (5), input row 4 (9). Then the second output row is 8,7,8. These come from input row 1 (8?), input row 2 (7?), input row 3 (8). Then third output row is 9,5,1. Which comes from input row 4 (9), input row 1 (5), input row 4 (1).\n\nSo for the first row of output, it's taking elements from rows 0, 1, 4. For the second row, rows 1, 2, 3. For the third row, rows 4, 1, 4.\n\nBut how to map this to columns? For the first row of output, the elements are input row 0, column 0; row 1, column 1; row 4, column 0. Then for the second row of output, input row 1, column 3; row 2, column 2; row 3, column 1. Third row: row 4, column 0; row 1, column 1; row 4, column 4.\n\nSo maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. Let's think of the output as being formed by:\n\nFor output row i, the elements are:\n\noutput[0][0] = input[0][0]\n\noutput[0][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[0][2] = input[4][0]\n\noutput[1][0] = input[1][3]\n\noutput[1][1] = input[2][2]\n\noutput[1][2] = input[3][1]\n\noutput[2][0] = input[4][0]\n\noutput[2][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[2][2] = input[4][4]\n\nBut how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nLet's check example 2:\n\nInput:\n\n6 0 0 0 7\n\n0 2 0 4 0\n\n0 0 3 0 0\n\n0 4 0 2 0\n\n7 0 0 0 6\n\nOutput:\n\n6 2 7\n\n4 3 4\n\n7 2 6\n\nSo output is 3x3. Let's see if the same pattern applies.\n\nFirst output row: 6,2,7.\n\nLooking at input rows 0,1,4.\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0 0 7 \u2192 column 0 is 6, column 1 is 0, column 4 is 7. So output[0][0] is 6, output[0][1] is 2 (from input row 1, column 1?), output[0][2] is 7 (from input row 4, column 0? Wait input row 4 is [7,0,0,0,6]. Column 0 is 7. So yes. So output[0][0] is input[0][0], output[0][1] is input[1][1], output[0][2] is input[4][0].\n\nThen second row of output is 4,3,4. Let's see:\n\ninput row 1, column 3 (row 1 is [0,2,0,4,0], column 3 is 4). Then input row 2, column 2 (row 2 is [0,0,3,0,0], column 2 is 3). Then input row 3, column 1 (row 3 is [0,4,0,2,0], column 1 is 4). So output[1][0] = 4, output[1][1] = 3, output[1][2] = 4. Which matches the output row 1 of example 2.\n\nThird row of output is 7,2,6. Which would be input row 4, column 0 (7), input row 1, column 1 (2), input row 4, column 4 (6). Which matches. So yes, the same pattern seems to apply here.\n\nSimilarly for example 3:\n\nInput:\n\n2 0 0 0 1\n\n0 3 0 6 0\n\n0 0 4 0 0\n\n0 6 0 3 0\n\n1 0 0 0 2\n\nOutput:\n\n2 3 1\n\n6 4 6\n\n1 3 2\n\nLet's check the first output row: 2,3,1.\n\nInput row 0: column 0 is 2, row 1 column 1 is 3, row 4 column 0 is 1. So yes.\n\nSecond output row is 6,4,6. Let's see:\n\nrow 1, column 3: row 1 is [0,3,0,6,0], column 3 is 6. row 2 column 2 is 4. row 3 column 1 is 6. So output row 1 is 6,4,6. Which matches.\n\nThird row: row 4 column 0 is 1, row 1 column 1 is 3, row 4 column 4 is 2. So output row 2 is 1,3,2. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output is constructed by taking:\n\nFor each output row i (0, 1, 2):\n\n- output[i][0] is input[ (i + 0) ][ (some column) ] ?\n\nWait, for output row 0:\n\noutput[0][0] = input[0][0]\n\noutput[0][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[0][2] = input[4][0]\n\nFor output row 1:\n\noutput[1][0] = input[1][3]\n\noutput[1][1] = input[2][2]\n\noutput[1][2] = input[3][1]\n\nFor output row 2:\n\noutput[2][0] = input[4][0]\n\noutput[2][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[2][2] = input[4][4]\n\nSo the output is constructed by taking specific positions from the input. Let's think of the output as follows:\n\nThe first row of output is taking elements from input rows 0, 1, 4, and columns 0, 1, 0 respectively.\n\nThe second row is taking elements from input rows 1, 2, 3, and columns 3, 2, 1 respectively.\n\nThe third row is taking elements from input rows 4, 1, 4, and columns 0, 1, 4 respectively.\n\nSo the output is constructed by:\n\noutput[0][0] = input[0][0]\n\noutput[0][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[0][2] = input[4][0]\n\noutput[1][0] = input[1][3]\n\noutput[1][1] = input[2][2]\n\noutput[1][2] = input[3][1]\n\noutput[2][0] = input[4][0]\n\noutput[2][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[2][2] = input[4][4]\n\nSo the output is a 3x3 grid where each cell is taken from specific positions in the input.\n\nSo the code needs to take the input grid (which is 5x5) and extract these values.\n\nSo the function would take the input grid (a list of 5 lists, each with 5 elements), and return a 3x3 grid as per the above.\n\nSo for the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # grid is a 5x5 list of lists\n    # create the output grid\n    output = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    output[0][0] = grid[0][0]\n    output[0][1] = grid[1][1]\n    output[0][2] = grid[4][0]\n    output[1][0] = grid[1][3]\n    output[1][1] = grid[2][2]\n    output[1][2] = grid[3][1]\n    output[2][0] = grid[4][0]\n    output[2][1] = grid[1][1]\n    output[2][2] = grid[4][4]\n    return output\n\nWait, but in example 1, the output row 2 is 9,5,1. Which is grid[4][0] (9), grid[1][1] (5), grid[4][4] (1). Which is correct.\n\nTesting this code with the examples:\n\nFor example 1, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 0 0 9 \u2192 grid[0][0] = 1, grid[0][4] =9\n\nRow 1: 0 5 0 8 0 \u2192 grid[1][1] =5, grid[1][3]=8\n\nRow 2: 0 0 7 0 0 \u2192 grid[2][2] =7\n\nRow 3: 0 8 0 5 0 \u2192 grid[3][1] =8\n\nRow 4: 9 0 0 0 1 \u2192 grid[4][0] =9, grid[4][4]=1.\n\nSo output[0][0] is 1, output[0][1] is 5, output[0][2] is 9 (from grid[4][0] which is 9). So first row is [1,5,9], which matches.\n\nSecond row: output[1][0] is grid[1][3] =8, output[1][1] is grid[2][2] =7, output[1][2] is grid[3][1] =8. So [8,7,8], which matches.\n\nThird row: output[2][0] is grid[4][0] =9, output[2][1] is grid[1][1]=5, output[2][2] is grid[4][4] =1. So [9,5,1], which matches.\n\nSimilarly for example 2, the code would generate the correct output.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n7 0 0 0 5\n0 6 0 4 0\n0 0 2 0 0\n0 4 0 6 0\n5 0 0 0 7\n\nSo the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements.\n\nSo according to the code, the output would be:\n\noutput[0][0] = grid[0][0] =7\n\noutput[0][1] = grid[1][1] =6\n\noutput[0][2] = grid[4][0] =5\n\nSo first row: 7,6,5.\n\nSecond row:\n\noutput[1][0] = grid[1][3] =4\n\noutput[1][1] = grid[2][2] =2\n\noutput[1][2] = grid[3][1] =4\n\nSo second row: 4,2,4.\n\nThird row:\n\noutput[2][0] = grid[4][0] =5\n\noutput[2][1] = grid[1][1] =6\n\noutput[2][2] = grid[4][4] =7\n\nSo third row:5,6,7.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n7 6 5\n\n4 2 4\n\n5 6 7\n\nBut I need to make sure that this is the correct transformation. However, the code is based on the training examples, and the test input is just for context.\n\nSo the code would be as written above.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python. The function transform takes a 2D list (grid) as input, and returns a 3x3 grid.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [\n        [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[4][0]],\n        [grid[1][3], grid[2][2], grid[3][1]],\n        [grid[4][0], grid[1][1], grid[4][4]]\n    ]\n    return output\n\nYes, that's the code. Let me check again.\n\nYes, the output is constructed as follows:\n\nRow 0: [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[4][0]]\n\nRow 1: [grid[1][3], grid[2][2], grid[3][1]]\n\nRow 2: [grid[4][0], grid[1][1], grid[4][4]]\n\nThis seems to be the correct pattern based on the training examples.\n\nSo this should be the code.\n"
