          "Analyzing the training examples, here is what can be observed:\n\n- The input grids have various scattered colored points (values 1 to 4 in the numeric examples, or colors in the images).\n- The output grids are always 10x10, same size as input.\n- In all outputs, the points are arranged in columns on the left side of the grid.\n- Each column in the output corresponds to a particular color/value.\n- The columns appear sorted by color/value ascending from left to right (value 1 first column, 2 second column, 3 third, etc.).\n- The column height for each color is equal to the count of that color in the input.\n- The colors appear stacked from the bottom upward (the lower rows are filled first).\n- Colors not present in input do not appear in output.\n- No other transformations or shapes are created, just a vertical column per color on the left, stacked bottom-up according to counts.\n\nHence the main transformation is:\n\n**For each distinct color (nonzero) in the input:**\n- Count how many times the color appears.\n- On the output grid, create a vertical column on the left side for that color.\n- Fill that column from bottom to top with the color value repeated as many times as the count.\n- Move to the next column for the next color.\n\nThis explains the numerical examples and also the colored examples: colors arranged in vertical bars on the left side, with height proportional to count.\n\nThe approach to implement:\n\n- Extract unique non-zero colors from input, sorted ascending.\n- Initialize empty 10x10 grid of zeros.\n- For each color, count occurrences in input.\n- Fill the corresponding column at the left starting from bottom row upward with that color count times.\n- Return the output grid.\n\nThis matches all training outputs quite well.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # All outputs are always 10x10\n    out_rows, out_cols = 10, 10\n    out_grid = np.zeros((out_rows, out_cols), dtype=int)\n\n    # Find unique non-zero colors, sorted ascending\n    colors = np.unique(grid)\n    colors = colors[colors != 0]\n    colors = np.sort(colors)\n\n    # For each color, count total occurrences and fill a vertical\n    # column on the left of the output grid, stacked from bottom up\n    for idx, color in enumerate(colors):\n        count = np.sum(grid == color)\n        # The column index in output is 'idx'\n        # Fill bottom 'count' cells upwards in this column\n        start_row = out_rows - count  # start filling here\n        if start_row < 0:\n            # more colors than rows, fill only what fits\n            start_row = 0  \n            count = out_rows\n        out_grid[start_row:out_rows, idx] = color\n\n    return out_grid.tolist()\n```"

              "Analyzing the training examples, here is what can be observed:\n\n- The input grids have various scattered colored points (values 1 to 4 in the numeric examples, or colors in the images).\n- The output grids are always 10x10, same size as input.\n- In all outputs, the points are arranged in columns on the left side of the grid.\n- Each column in the output corresponds to a particular color/value.\n- The columns appear sorted by color/value ascending from left to right (value 1 first column, 2 second column, 3 third, etc.).\n- The column height for each color is equal to the count of that color in the input.\n- The colors appear stacked from the bottom upward (the lower rows are filled first).\n- Colors not present in input do not appear in output.\n- No other transformations or shapes are created, just a vertical column per color on the left, stacked bottom-up according to counts.\n\nHence the main transformation is:\n\n**For each distinct color (nonzero) in the input:**\n- Count how many times the color appears.\n- On the output grid, create a vertical column on the left side for that color.\n- Fill that column from bottom to top with the color value repeated as many times as the count.\n- Move to the next column for the next color.\n\nThis explains the numerical examples and also the colored examples: colors arranged in vertical bars on the left side, with height proportional to count.\n\nThe approach to implement:\n\n- Extract unique non-zero colors from input, sorted ascending.\n- Initialize empty 10x10 grid of zeros.\n- For each color, count occurrences in input.\n- Fill the corresponding column at the left starting from bottom row upward with that color count times.\n- Return the output grid.\n\nThis matches all training outputs quite well.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # All outputs are always 10x10\n    out_rows, out_cols = 10, 10\n    out_grid = np.zeros((out_rows, out_cols), dtype=int)\n\n    # Find unique non-zero colors, sorted ascending\n    colors = np.unique(grid)\n    colors = colors[colors != 0]\n    colors = np.sort(colors)\n\n    # For each color, count total occurrences and fill a vertical\n    # column on the left of the output grid, stacked from bottom up\n    for idx, color in enumerate(colors):\n        count = np.sum(grid == color)\n        # The column index in output is 'idx'\n        # Fill bottom 'count' cells upwards in this column\n        start_row = out_rows - count  # start filling here\n        if start_row < 0:\n            # more colors than rows, fill only what fits\n            start_row = 0  \n            count = out_rows\n        out_grid[start_row:out_rows, idx] = color\n\n    return out_grid.tolist()\n```"
