          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some 4s, 6s, 8s, 2s, 3s, etc. The output seems to have some changes. For instance, in the input, there's a 4 in position (3,6) and (4,5), and in the output, those 4s are still there but maybe expanded? Wait, looking at the output, the 4s are in the same positions but maybe the surrounding cells are changed. Wait, in the input, there's a 4 in row 3 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but the output has 4s in the same positions but maybe some other numbers are replaced. \n\nWait, looking at the first example's input and output. The input has a 4 in row 3 (maybe 4th row if 0-based?), and the output has 4s in the same positions. But in the output, there are 6s in some positions. For example, in the input, there's a 6 in row 7 (maybe 7th row?), and in the output, that 6 is replaced by 6s in adjacent cells? Or maybe the 6s are expanding. \n\nLooking at the output of example 1, there's a 6 in row 7, column 15 (assuming 0-based?), but in the input, that position was 1. So maybe the 6s are being expanded to their adjacent cells? Or perhaps the 6s are being mirrored or extended. \n\nAnother thing: in example 1, the 8s in the input are in positions (11, 4) and (12, 4). In the output, those 8s are replaced by 8s in the same positions but also their adjacent cells are changed. For example, in the output, there are 8s in row 11, column 4 and 5, and row 12, column 4 and 5? Or maybe the 8s are expanding to their adjacent cells. \n\nWait, looking at the input for example 1, there's a 8 in row 11 (assuming 0-based?), column 4. In the output, that 8 is in row 11, column 4, and also in row 11, column 5? Or maybe the 8s are being expanded to their adjacent cells. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about expanding certain numbers to their neighboring cells. For example, if there's a 4 in a cell, then the surrounding cells are changed to 4s. But that might not fit. \n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. In the input, there's a 4 in row 4 (maybe 4th row?), and in the output, there are 4s in that position and adjacent cells. Also, there's a 7 in the input, and in the output, it's expanded. \n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the 6s in the input are in positions (7, 15) and (10, 15). In the output, those 6s are expanded to their adjacent cells. For example, in row 7, the 6 is in column 15, and in the output, there's a 6 in column 15 and 16? Or maybe the 6s are expanding to the right and left. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell with a value greater than 1 is expanded to its neighboring cells. But that's just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that certain numbers are being replaced by their adjacent numbers. For example, if there's a 4, then the 4s are expanded to their surrounding cells. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the numbers change. For example, in example 1's input, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5), and in the output, those 4s are still there, but the surrounding cells are changed. \n\nWait, looking at the output of example 1, there's a 6 in row 7, column 15. In the input, that position was 1. So maybe the 6 is being expanded. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are being replaced by their adjacent numbers. For example, if there's a 4, then the 4s are expanded to their adjacent cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are being expanded to their adjacent cells, but only if they are in a certain pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value greater than 1, the surrounding cells are set to that value. But that might not fit. \n\nLooking at example 1's input and output. For example, in the input, there's a 4 in row 3, column 6 (assuming 0-based). In the output, that 4 is still there, but the surrounding cells are 4s. Wait, in the input, the row 3 is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n\nIn the output, the same row is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n\nSo the 4s are in the same positions. But in the output, there's a 6 in row 7, column 15. So maybe the 6s are being expanded. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are being replaced by their adjacent numbers. For example, if a cell has a value of 4, then the surrounding cells (up, down, left, right) are set to 4. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are being replaced by their adjacent numbers, but only if they are in a certain pattern. \n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2's input and output. In the input, there's a 4 in row 4 (assuming 0-based), and in the output, there are 4s in that position and adjacent cells. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the numbers change. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the input are in positions (11,4) and (12,4). In the output, those positions are 8s, but also their adjacent cells are 8s. For example, in the output, row 11 has 8s in column 4 and 5. \n\nWait, in the input for example 1, the 8s are in row 11 (assuming 0-based?), column 4. In the output, that row has 8s in column 4 and 5. Also, in row 12, column 4 is 8. So maybe the 8s are expanding to their adjacent cells. \n\nSimilarly, in example 2, the 7s are in the input and in the output, they are expanded. \n\nSo perhaps the rule is that any cell with a value greater than 1 is expanded to its neighboring cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, etc., the surrounding cells are set to that value. But how to determine which cells to expand?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, etc., the surrounding cells (up, down, left, right) are set to that value. But that might not be the case for all examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's input, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). In the output, those 4s are still there, but the surrounding cells are 4s. For example, in row 3, the 4s are in columns 6 and 7. In the output, those are still 4s. But maybe the 4s are expanding to their adjacent cells. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, etc., the cell is expanded to its neighboring cells. But how to determine which cells to expand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are being expanded to their adjacent cells. For example, any cell with a value of 4 is expanded to the left and right. But how to determine the exact pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell with a value greater than 1, the cell is replaced by the same value, but the surrounding cells are set to that value. But that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the positions where the output is different from the input. For example, in example 1, the 6s in the input are in positions (7,15) and (10,15). In the output, those positions are 6s, but also their adjacent cells are 6s. For example, in row 7, column 15 is 6, and in the output, row 7, column 16 is 6. Similarly, row 10, column 15 is 6, and row 10, column 16 is 6. \n\nSo maybe the rule is that for any cell with a value of 6, the adjacent cells (left, right, up, down) are set to 6. \n\nBut how does that fit with the other examples. For example, in example 1, the 8s are in positions (11,4) and (12,4). In the output, those positions are 8s, and their adjacent cells are 8s. For example, in row 11, column 4 is 8, and column 5 is 8. In row 12, column 4 is 8, and column 5 is 8. \n\nSo perhaps the rule is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the adjacent cells are set to that value. \n\nBut how to determine which values to expand. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2 is expanded to their adjacent cells. \n\nBut how to code that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the surrounding cells are also set to that value. \n\nBut how to determine which cells to expand. \n\nAnother approach: think about the test input. The test input has 8 in row 1 (assuming 0-based) and 8 in row 2. In the output, those 8s are expanded. \n\nBut since the test input is not provided with the output, I can't look at it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is expanded to the left and right, but not up and down. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are set to that value. \n\nBut how to implement that. \n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). In the output, those 4s are still there, but the cells to the left and right are 4s. For example, in row 3, the 4s are in columns 6 and 7. In the output, those are still 4s. But maybe the 4s are expanding to their left and right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell with a value of 4 is expanded to the left and right. \n\nBut how to code that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the surrounding cells (up, down, left, right) are also set to that value. \n\nBut how to determine which cells to expand. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are also set to that value. \n\nBut that would mean that for example, in example 1, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5), and their adjacent cells are set to 4. \n\nBut in the output, those positions are still 4s. So maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is expanded to the left and right. \n\nBut how to implement that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are also set to that value. \n\nSo for example, if a cell is 4, then the cell itself and its adjacent cells are 4. \n\nBut how to code that. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each cell in the grid, if the value is 4, 6, 8, or 2, then set the cell and its adjacent cells to that value. \n\nBut wait, in example 1, the 6s are in the input. In the output, those 6s are expanded. \n\nBut how to handle overlapping cells. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are also set to that value. \n\nBut this would require checking each cell and expanding it. However, this might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are set to that value. \n\nBut how to code this. \n\nAnother approach: think about the output of example 1. The 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). In the output, those 4s are still there, but their adjacent cells are also 4s. For example, in row 3, column 6 is 4, and column 5 is 4. \n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that the 4s are expanded to their left and right. \n\nBut how to determine which cells to expand. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are also set to that value. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\nif grid[i][j] is in {2,4,6,8}:\n\n   set the cell to the same value\n\n   then set the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to the same value\n\nBut this would overwrite the original values. \n\nBut how to handle this in code. \n\nBut this might not be the case. For example, in example 1, the 4s are in the input, and in the output, their adjacent cells are also 4s. \n\nBut in example 2, the 4s are in the input and the output has 4s in the same positions and adjacent cells. \n\nSo perhaps this is the pattern. \n\nBut then, how to handle overlapping cells. For example, if two cells are adjacent and both are 4, then their adjacent cells would be set to 4. \n\nBut this would lead to all 4s in the area. \n\nBut how to code this. \n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nCreate a new grid. \n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the original grid:\n\n   if the value is 2,4,6,8:\n\n      set the new grid's (i,j) to the same value.\n\n      then, check the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). For each of those cells, if they are within bounds, set them to the same value. \n\nBut this would cause the new grid to have the same value in the original cell and its adjacent cells. \n\nBut this may not be the case. For example, in example 1, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). Their adjacent cells would be set to 4. \n\nBut in the output, the 4s are still in those positions. \n\nBut perhaps this is the correct approach. \n\nBut let's test this with example 1. \n\nIn example 1's input, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). \n\nFor cell (3,6), set it to 4. Then check up (2,6), down (4,6), left (3,5), right (3,7). \n\nBut in the original input, (3,6) is 4. \n\nIn the output, those adjacent cells are 4. \n\nBut in the input, (3,5) is 1, so in the output, it would be set to 4. \n\nBut looking at the output of example 1, in row 3, the 4s are in columns 6 and 7. The original input's row 3 is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n\nSo columns 6 and 7 are 4s. \n\nIn the output, those are still 4s. \n\nBut according to the rule, the adjacent cells would be set to 4. For example, cell (3,5) is adjacent to (3,6). So in the output, (3,5) would be 4. But in the output of example 1, row 3, column 5 is 1. \n\nWait, that's a contradiction. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nHmm. So this approach may not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, but the adjacent cells are set to the same value only if they are not already set. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are set to that value. \n\nBut in example 1, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). In the output, those positions are 4s, but their adjacent cells are not 4s. \n\nWait, looking at the output of example 1, in row 3, columns 6 and 7 are 4s. The cell to the left of (3,6) is (3,5), which is 1. So according to the hypothesis, this cell should be set to 4. But in the output, it's 1. \n\nSo this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nHmm. So I need to think of another pattern. \n\nLooking at example 1's output, the 6s are in positions (7,15) and (10,15). In the input, those positions were 1. In the output, those positions are 6s, and their adjacent cells are also 6s. For example, in row 7, column 15 is 6. The cell to the right is 6. The cell to the left is 1. So in the output, the 6 is in column 15 and 16. \n\nBut how does that fit? \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 6, the cell is replaced by 6, and the adjacent cells are set to 6. \n\nBut why would the 6s in the input be expanded, but the 4s and 8s not? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are expanded to their adjacent cells, but only if they are in a certain pattern. \n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output, the 6s are expanded to the right. For example, in row 7, the 6 is in column 15 and 16. In the input, that position was 1. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 6, the cell is expanded to the right. \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 6, the cell is replaced by 6 and the cell to the right is also 6. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 6, the cell is replaced by 6 and the cell to the right is also 6. \n\nBut this would only expand to the right. \n\nBut then, how to handle other numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 6, the cell is replaced by 6 and the adjacent cells to the left and right are also 6. \n\nBut again, this is just a guess. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the input and output differ. For example, in example 1, the input has a 4 in row 3, column 6. The output has 4 in the same position. But the input has a 6 in row 7, column 15, and the output has 6 in that position. \n\nBut how to find the pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are set to that value. But this seems to not fit with the example. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are set to that value. But this may not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are set to that value only if they are not already set. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are set to that value. \n\nBut in example 1, the 4s are not expanded. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think of the transformation as expanding certain numbers to their neighboring cells. \n\nLooking at the output of example 1, there are 6s in the output that were not present in the input. So perhaps the 6s are being expanded to their neighboring cells. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 6, the cell is replaced by 6, and the cell to the right is also 6. \n\nBut this would only expand to the right. \n\nLooking at example 1's output, the 6s are in positions (7,15) and (10,15). In the output, the cell to the right of (7,15) is 6. Similarly, the cell to the right of (10,15) is 6. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 6, the cell to the right is set to 6. \n\nBut why would that be the case for other numbers? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 6, the cell is replaced by 6, and the cell to the right is also 6. \n\nBut this would explain the 6s in the output. \n\nBut what about the 4s and 8s? \n\nIn example 1's output, the 4s are still in the same positions, but their adjacent cells are not changed. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that only certain numbers are expanded. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 6, the cell is replaced by 6 and the cell to the right is also 6. For 8, the cell is replaced by 8 and the cell to the right is also 8. \n\nBut this would not explain the 4s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, the cell is replaced by 4 and the cell to the left and right are also 4. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time I have, I need to make a hypothesis. \n\nPerhaps the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are also set to that value. \n\nBut this may not fit the example, but it's the best I can think of. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell in the grid:\n\n   if the value is 2,4,6,8:\n\n       set the cell to that value\n\n       for each of the four adjacent cells:\n\n           if they are within bounds, set them to that value\n\nBut this would overwrite the original values. \n\nBut how to handle overlapping cells. \n\nBut in example 1, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). Their adjacent cells would be set to 4. \n\nBut in the output, the 4s are still in those positions. \n\nBut in the input, the cell (3,5) is 1, and in the output it's 1. \n\nSo this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are set to that value only if they are not already set. \n\nBut this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the cell to the right is also set to that value. \n\nThis would explain the 6s in example 1. \n\nFor example, the 6 in (7,15) is set to 6, and the cell to the right (7,16) is also 6. \n\nSimilarly, the 6 in (10,15) is set to 6, and the cell to the right (10,16) is also 6. \n\nBut what about the 4s and 8s? \n\nIn example 1, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). The cell to the right of (3,6) is (3,7), which is 4 in the output. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the cell to the right is also set to that value. \n\nThis would explain the 4s and 6s in example 1. \n\nBut how about the 8s in example 1? \n\nIn example 1, the 8s are in positions (11,4) and (12,4). In the output, the cell to the right of (11,4) is 8. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut what about the 2s? In example 1, there is a 2 in row 14, column 16. In the output, that cell is 2, and the cell to the right is 2. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nSo the transformation rule is: for each cell with a value of 2, 4, 6, or 8, set the cell to that value, and set the cell to the right to that value. \n\nBut what about the cell to the left? \n\nIn example 1, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). The cell to the right of (3,6) is 4, which is correct. \n\nBut what about the cell to the left of (3,6)? It's 1, which remains 1. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n   for each column in the row:\n\n       if the value is 2, 4, 6, or 8:\n\n           set the cell to the same value\n\n           if the column is not the last column:\n\n               set the cell to the right to the same value\n\nBut this would only expand to the right. \n\nBut this would explain the examples. \n\nLet me test this with example 1. \n\nIn the input, the 4 is in row 3, column 6. So the cell is 4, and the cell to the right (column 7) is set to 4. In the output, that's correct. \n\nThe 4 in row 4, column 5 is set to 4, and the cell to the right (column 6) is set to 4. \n\nIn the output, row 4, column 6 is 1, but according to this rule, it should be 4. But in the output of example 1, that cell is 1. So this contradicts. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the cell to the left and right are set to that value. \n\nBut in example 1, the 4 in row 3, column 6 is set to 4, and the cell to the left (column 5) is set to 4. But in the output, that cell is 1. \n\nSo this is not working. \n\nThis is very challenging. \n\nPerhaps I should look for another pattern. \n\nLooking at example 1's output, the 6s are in positions (7,15) and (10,15), and their adjacent cells to the right are 6. \n\nIn example 2, the 7s are in positions (12, 15) and (13, 15), and their adjacent cells to the right are 7. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for each cell with a value of 6, 7, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the cell to the right is also set to that value. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nBut how to handle this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the cell to the right is also set to that value. \n\nBut in example 1, the 4 in row 3, column 6 is set to 4, and the cell to the right is 4. In the output, this is correct. \n\nThe 4 in row 4, column 5 is set to 4, and the cell to the right is 4. But in the output, row 4, column 6 is 1. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nThis is very confusing. \n\nMaybe I should try to think of the transformation as expanding certain numbers to their neighboring cells in a specific pattern. \n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the 6s are in positions (7,15) and (10,15), and their adjacent cells to the right are 6. \n\nIn example 2's output, the 7s are in positions (12,15) and (13,15), and their adjacent cells to the right are 7. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for any cell with a value of 6, 7, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the cell to the right is also set to that value. \n\nBut how to handle the 4s. \n\nIn example 1, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). In the output, those positions are 4, and their adjacent cells to the right are 4. \n\nSo this would fit. \n\nBut in the output of example 1, row 4, column 6 is 1. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nBut perhaps I'm looking at the wrong positions. \n\nLet me recheck example 1's input and output. \n\nExample 1's input row 4 is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n\nWait, no.

In the output, those are still 4s. \n\nSo the transformation seems to be that the 4s are not expanded. \n\nBut the 6s are expanded to their right. \n\nIn the input, row 7 has 6 in column 15. In the output, that is 6, and the cell to the right is 6. \n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is that for cells with 6, 8, or 2, the cell to the right is set to the same value. \n\nBut what about the 4s? \n\nMaybe the 4s are not part of this transformation. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that for cells with 6, 8, or 2, the cell to the right is set to the same value. \n\nBut how to handle this. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n   for each column in the row:\n\n       if the value is 6, 8, or 2:\n\n           set the cell to the same value\n\n           if the column is not the last column:\n\n               set the cell to the right to the same value\n\nBut this would explain the 6s and 8s in example 1 and 2. \n\nBut what about the 2s? \n\nIn example 1, there is a 2 in row 14, column 16. In the output, that cell is 2, and the cell to the right is 2. \n\nSo this fits. \n\nBut what about the 4s? They are not part of this transformation. \n\nBut in example 1, the 4s are not expanded, so this fits. \n\nBut in example 2, the 4s are in the input and the output. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut how to handle the 4s in example 2. \n\nIn example 2's input, there is a 4 in row 4, column 8. In the output, that cell is 4. \n\nBut the 4 in row 4, column 8 is not expanded to the right. \n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is only for 6, 8, and 2. \n\nBut why? \n\nThis seems to be the only pattern that fits the examples. \n\nSo the code would be: for each cell with value 2, 6, or 8, set the cell to that value and the cell to the right to that value. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nNow, let's try to code this. \n\nThe function would iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, if the value is 2, 6, or 8, then set the cell to that value, and if the cell is not the last column, set the cell to the right to that value. \n\nBut wait, this would overwrite the original value. \n\nFor example, if a cell is 2, then set it to 2, and the cell to the right to 2. \n\nBut in the input, if the cell is 2, then in the output, it is 2 and the cell to the right is 2. \n\nThis would explain the 2s in example 1 and example 2. \n\nBut what about the 6s and 8s? \n\nIn example 1, the 6 in row 7, column 15 is set to 6, and the cell to the right is 6. \n\nIn example 1, the 8 in row 11, column 4 is set to 8, and the cell to the right is 8. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut what about the 4s? They are not part of this transformation, so they remain as is. \n\nBut in example 2, the 4s are in the input and output, so this fits. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. \n\nNow, let's code this. \n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Iterate over each cell\n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if transformed[i][j] in {2, 6, 8}:\n                # Set the current cell to the same value\n                # Set the cell to the right to the same value if possible\n                if j < 21:\n                    transformed[i][j+1] = transformed[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but this would set the cell to the right to the same value, but what if the cell to the right was already set? \n\nBut this code would overwrite it. \n\nBut according to the examples, this seems to work. \n\nLet's test this with example 1. \n\nIn example 1's input, the 6 in row 7, column 15 is 6. So transformed[i][j] is 6. Then, set transformed[i][j+1] to 6. \n\nIn the input, the cell to the right is 1, so in the output it becomes 6. \n\nIn the output of example 1, row 7, column 16 is 6. \n\nSimilarly, for the 6 in row 10, column 15, it is set to 6, and the cell to the right is 6. \n\nFor the 8 in row 11, column 4, it is set to 8, and the cell to the right is 8. \n\nFor the 2 in row 14, column 16, it is set to 2, and the cell to the right is 2. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nBut what about the 8 in row 12, column 4? \n\nIn the input, it is 8, and the cell to the right is 1. So in the output, it becomes 8, and the cell to the right is 8. \n\nThis would explain the 8s in the output. \n\nBut what about the 4s? They are not part of this transformation, so they remain as is. \n\nBut in example 1's input, the 4s are not changed. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut what about the 4s in example 2? \n\nIn example 2's input, there are 4s in row 4, column 8. The code does not change them, so they remain as 4. \n\nIn the output of example 2, the 4s are still 4. \n\nThis fits. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct transformation. \n\nBut what about the 6s in example 2? \n\nIn example 2's input, there is a 6 in row 11, column 1. In the output, that cell is 6, and the cell to the right is 6. \n\nThis fits. \n\nSo the code seems to work. \n\nBut what about the 8 in example 2's input, which is in row 14, column 4. \n\nIn the output, that cell is 8, and the cell to the right is 8. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this code would transform the grid as per the examples. \n\nBut wait, in example 1, the 8 in row 11, column 4 is set to 8, and the cell to the right is 8. \n\nIn the output, row 11, column 4 is 8, and column 5 is 8. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to work. \n\nThus, the code is as above. \n\nNow, I need to write this in Python. \n\nBut the code must return a 22x22 grid. \n\nThe code creates a copy of the grid, then for each cell, if the value is 2, 6, or 8, it sets the cell to the same value, and the cell to the right to the same value. \n\nBut wait, the code is setting the cell to the same value, but the original value is already that. So this is redundant. \n\nActually, the code is setting the cell to the same value, but since it's already that value, it's not changing anything. \n\nWait, no. The code is:\n\ntransformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j):\n\nif transformed[i][j] is 2, 6, or 8:\n\n   if j < 21:\n\n       transformed[i][j+1] = transformed[i][j]\n\nSo this code only sets the cell to the right to the same value. \n\nBut the current cell is already set to that value. \n\nSo this code is only expanding to the right. \n\nBut this would work for the examples. \n\nSo this is the code.\n"

I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some 4s, 6s, 8s, 2s, 3s, etc. The output seems to have some changes. For instance, in the input, there's a 4 in position (3,6) and (4,5), and in the output, those 4s are still there but maybe expanded? Wait, looking at the output, the 4s are in the same positions but maybe the surrounding cells are changed. Wait, in the input, there's a 4 in row 3 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but the output has 4s in the same positions but maybe some other numbers are replaced. \n\nWait, looking at the first example's input and output. The input has a 4 in row 3 (maybe 4th row if 0-based?), and the output has 4s in the same positions. But in the output, there are 6s in some positions. For example, in the input, there's a 6 in row 7 (maybe 7th row?), and in the output, that 6 is replaced by 6s in adjacent cells? Or maybe the 6s are expanding. \n\nLooking at the output of example 1, there's a 6 in row 7, column 15 (assuming 0-based?), but in the input, that position was 1. So maybe the 6s are being expanded to their adjacent cells? Or perhaps the 6s are being mirrored or extended. \n\nAnother thing: in example 1, the 8s in the input are in positions (11, 4) and (12, 4). In the output, those 8s are replaced by 8s in the same positions but also their adjacent cells are changed. For example, in the output, there are 8s in row 11, column 4 and 5, and row 12, column 4 and 5? Or maybe the 8s are expanding to their adjacent cells. \n\nWait, looking at the input for example 1, there's a 8 in row 11 (assuming 0-based?), column 4. In the output, that 8 is in row 11, column 4, and also in row 11, column 5? Or maybe the 8s are being expanded to their adjacent cells. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about expanding certain numbers to their neighboring cells. For example, if there's a 4 in a cell, then the surrounding cells are changed to 4s. But that might not fit. \n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. In the input, there's a 4 in row 4 (maybe 4th row?), and in the output, there are 4s in that position and adjacent cells. Also, there's a 7 in the input, and in the output, it's expanded. \n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the 6s in the input are in positions (7, 15) and (10, 15). In the output, those 6s are expanded to their adjacent cells. For example, in row 7, the 6 is in column 15, and in the output, there's a 6 in column 15 and 16? Or maybe the 6s are expanding to the right and left. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell with a value greater than 1 is expanded to its neighboring cells. But that's just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that certain numbers are being replaced by their adjacent numbers. For example, if there's a 4, then the 4s are expanded to their surrounding cells. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the numbers change. For example, in example 1's input, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5), and in the output, those 4s are still there, but the surrounding cells are changed. \n\nWait, looking at the output of example 1, there's a 6 in row 7, column 15. In the input, that position was 1. So maybe the 6 is being expanded. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are being replaced by their adjacent numbers. For example, if there's a 4, then the 4s are expanded to their adjacent cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are being expanded to their adjacent cells, but only if they are in a certain pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value greater than 1, the surrounding cells are set to that value. But that might not fit. \n\nLooking at example 1's input and output. For example, in the input, there's a 4 in row 3, column 6 (assuming 0-based). In the output, that 4 is still there, but the surrounding cells are 4s. Wait, in the input, the row 3 is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n\nIn the output, the same row is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n\nSo the 4s are in the same positions. But in the output, there's a 6 in row 7, column 15. So maybe the 6s are being expanded. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are being replaced by their adjacent numbers. For example, if a cell has a value of 4, then the surrounding cells (up, down, left, right) are set to 4. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are being replaced by their adjacent numbers, but only if they are in a certain pattern. \n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2's input and output. In the input, there's a 4 in row 4 (assuming 0-based), and in the output, there are 4s in that position and adjacent cells. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the numbers change. For example, in example 1, the 8s in the input are in positions (11,4) and (12,4). In the output, those positions are 8s, but also their adjacent cells are 8s. For example, in the output, row 11 has 8s in column 4 and 5. \n\nWait, in the input for example 1, the 8s are in row 11 (assuming 0-based?), column 4. In the output, that row has 8s in column 4 and 5. Also, in row 12, column 4 is 8. So maybe the 8s are expanding to their adjacent cells. \n\nSimilarly, in example 2, the 7s are in the input and in the output, they are expanded. \n\nSo perhaps the rule is that any cell with a value greater than 1 is expanded to its neighboring cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, etc., the surrounding cells are set to that value. But how to determine which cells to expand?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, etc., the surrounding cells (up, down, left, right) are set to that value. But that might not be the case for all examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's input, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). In the output, those 4s are still there, but the surrounding cells are 4s. For example, in row 3, the 4s are in columns 6 and 7. In the output, those are still 4s. But maybe the 4s are expanding to their adjacent cells. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, etc., the cell is expanded to its neighboring cells. But how to determine which cells to expand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are being expanded to their adjacent cells. For example, any cell with a value of 4 is expanded to the left and right. But how to determine the exact pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell with a value greater than 1, the cell is replaced by the same value, but the surrounding cells are set to that value. But that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the positions where the output is different from the input. For example, in example 1, the 6s in the input are in positions (7,15) and (10,15). In the output, those positions are 6s, but also their adjacent cells are 6s. For example, in row 7, column 15 is 6, and in the output, row 7, column 16 is 6. Similarly, row 10, column 15 is 6, and row 10, column 16 is 6. \n\nSo maybe the rule is that for any cell with a value of 6, the adjacent cells (left, right, up, down) are set to 6. \n\nBut how does that fit with the other examples. For example, in example 1, the 8s are in positions (11,4) and (12,4). In the output, those positions are 8s, and their adjacent cells are 8s. For example, in row 11, column 4 is 8, and column 5 is 8. In row 12, column 4 is 8, and column 5 is 8. \n\nSo perhaps the rule is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the adjacent cells are set to that value. \n\nBut how to determine which values to expand. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2 is expanded to their adjacent cells. \n\nBut how to code that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the surrounding cells are also set to that value. \n\nBut how to determine which cells to expand. \n\nAnother approach: think about the test input. The test input has 8 in row 1 (assuming 0-based) and 8 in row 2. In the output, those 8s are expanded. \n\nBut since the test input is not provided with the output, I can't look at it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is expanded to the left and right, but not up and down. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are set to that value. \n\nBut how to implement that. \n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). In the output, those 4s are still there, but the cells to the left and right are 4s. For example, in row 3, the 4s are in columns 6 and 7. In the output, those are still 4s. But maybe the 4s are expanding to their left and right. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell with a value of 4 is expanded to the left and right. \n\nBut how to code that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the surrounding cells (up, down, left, right) are also set to that value. \n\nBut how to determine which cells to expand. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are also set to that value. \n\nBut that would mean that for example, in example 1, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5), and their adjacent cells are set to 4. \n\nBut in the output, those positions are still 4s. So maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is expanded to the left and right. \n\nBut how to implement that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are also set to that value. \n\nSo for example, if a cell is 4, then the cell itself and its adjacent cells are 4. \n\nBut how to code that. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. For each cell in the grid, if the value is 4, 6, 8, or 2, then set the cell and its adjacent cells to that value. \n\nBut wait, in example 1, the 6s are in the input. In the output, those 6s are expanded. \n\nBut how to handle overlapping cells. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are also set to that value. \n\nBut this would require checking each cell and expanding it. However, this might not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are set to that value. \n\nBut how to code this. \n\nAnother approach: think about the output of example 1. The 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). In the output, those 4s are still there, but their adjacent cells are also 4s. For example, in row 3, column 6 is 4, and column 5 is 4. \n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that the 4s are expanded to their left and right. \n\nBut how to determine which cells to expand. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are also set to that value. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\nif grid[i][j] is in {2,4,6,8}:\n\n   set the cell to the same value\n\n   then set the adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to the same value\n\nBut this would overwrite the original values. \n\nBut how to handle this in code. \n\nBut this might not be the case. For example, in example 1, the 4s are in the input, and in the output, their adjacent cells are also 4s. \n\nBut in example 2, the 4s are in the input and the output has 4s in the same positions and adjacent cells. \n\nSo perhaps this is the pattern. \n\nBut then, how to handle overlapping cells. For example, if two cells are adjacent and both are 4, then their adjacent cells would be set to 4. \n\nBut this would lead to all 4s in the area. \n\nBut how to code this. \n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nCreate a new grid. \n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the original grid:\n\n   if the value is 2,4,6,8:\n\n      set the new grid's (i,j) to the same value.\n\n      then, check the four adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). For each of those cells, if they are within bounds, set them to the same value. \n\nBut this would cause the new grid to have the same value in the original cell and its adjacent cells. \n\nBut this may not be the case. For example, in example 1, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). Their adjacent cells would be set to 4. \n\nBut in the output, the 4s are still in those positions. \n\nBut perhaps this is the correct approach. \n\nBut let's test this with example 1. \n\nIn example 1's input, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). \n\nFor cell (3,6), set it to 4. Then check up (2,6), down (4,6), left (3,5), right (3,7). \n\nBut in the original input, (3,6) is 4. \n\nIn the output, those adjacent cells are 4. \n\nBut in the input, (3,5) is 1, so in the output, it would be set to 4. \n\nBut looking at the output of example 1, in row 3, the 4s are in columns 6 and 7. The original input's row 3 is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n\nSo columns 6 and 7 are 4s. \n\nIn the output, those are still 4s. \n\nBut according to the rule, the adjacent cells would be set to 4. For example, cell (3,5) is adjacent to (3,6). So in the output, (3,5) would be 4. But in the output of example 1, row 3, column 5 is 1. \n\nWait, that's a contradiction. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nHmm. So this approach may not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, but the adjacent cells are set to the same value only if they are not already set. \n\nBut this is getting complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are set to that value. \n\nBut in example 1, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). In the output, those positions are 4s, but their adjacent cells are not 4s. \n\nWait, looking at the output of example 1, in row 3, columns 6 and 7 are 4s. The cell to the left of (3,6) is (3,5), which is 1. So according to the hypothesis, this cell should be set to 4. But in the output, it's 1. \n\nSo this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nHmm. So I need to think of another pattern. \n\nLooking at example 1's output, the 6s are in positions (7,15) and (10,15). In the input, those positions were 1. In the output, those positions are 6s, and their adjacent cells are also 6s. For example, in row 7, column 15 is 6. The cell to the right is 6. The cell to the left is 1. So in the output, the 6 is in column 15 and 16. \n\nBut how does that fit? \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 6, the cell is replaced by 6, and the adjacent cells are set to 6. \n\nBut why would the 6s in the input be expanded, but the 4s and 8s not? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are expanded to their adjacent cells, but only if they are in a certain pattern. \n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output, the 6s are expanded to the right. For example, in row 7, the 6 is in column 15 and 16. In the input, that position was 1. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 6, the cell is expanded to the right. \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 6, the cell is replaced by 6 and the cell to the right is also 6. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 6, the cell is replaced by 6 and the cell to the right is also 6. \n\nBut this would only expand to the right. \n\nBut then, how to handle other numbers. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 6, the cell is replaced by 6 and the adjacent cells to the left and right are also 6. \n\nBut again, this is just a guess. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the input and output differ. For example, in example 1, the input has a 4 in row 3, column 6. The output has 4 in the same position. But the input has a 6 in row 7, column 15, and the output has 6 in that position. \n\nBut how to find the pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are set to that value. But this seems to not fit with the example. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are set to that value. But this may not be the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are set to that value only if they are not already set. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are set to that value. \n\nBut in example 1, the 4s are not expanded. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think of the transformation as expanding certain numbers to their neighboring cells. \n\nLooking at the output of example 1, there are 6s in the output that were not present in the input. So perhaps the 6s are being expanded to their neighboring cells. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 6, the cell is replaced by 6, and the cell to the right is also 6. \n\nBut this would only expand to the right. \n\nLooking at example 1's output, the 6s are in positions (7,15) and (10,15). In the output, the cell to the right of (7,15) is 6. Similarly, the cell to the right of (10,15) is 6. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 6, the cell to the right is set to 6. \n\nBut why would that be the case for other numbers? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 6, the cell is replaced by 6, and the cell to the right is also 6. \n\nBut this would explain the 6s in the output. \n\nBut what about the 4s and 8s? \n\nIn example 1's output, the 4s are still in the same positions, but their adjacent cells are not changed. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that only certain numbers are expanded. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 6, the cell is replaced by 6 and the cell to the right is also 6. For 8, the cell is replaced by 8 and the cell to the right is also 8. \n\nBut this would not explain the 4s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, the cell is replaced by 4 and the cell to the left and right are also 4. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time I have, I need to make a hypothesis. \n\nPerhaps the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are also set to that value. \n\nBut this may not fit the example, but it's the best I can think of. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell in the grid:\n\n   if the value is 2,4,6,8:\n\n       set the cell to that value\n\n       for each of the four adjacent cells:\n\n           if they are within bounds, set them to that value\n\nBut this would overwrite the original values. \n\nBut how to handle overlapping cells. \n\nBut in example 1, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). Their adjacent cells would be set to 4. \n\nBut in the output, the 4s are still in those positions. \n\nBut in the input, the cell (3,5) is 1, and in the output it's 1. \n\nSo this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the adjacent cells are set to that value only if they are not already set. \n\nBut this is getting too complicated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the cell to the right is also set to that value. \n\nThis would explain the 6s in example 1. \n\nFor example, the 6 in (7,15) is set to 6, and the cell to the right (7,16) is also 6. \n\nSimilarly, the 6 in (10,15) is set to 6, and the cell to the right (10,16) is also 6. \n\nBut what about the 4s and 8s? \n\nIn example 1, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). The cell to the right of (3,6) is (3,7), which is 4 in the output. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the cell to the right is also set to that value. \n\nThis would explain the 4s and 6s in example 1. \n\nBut how about the 8s in example 1? \n\nIn example 1, the 8s are in positions (11,4) and (12,4). In the output, the cell to the right of (11,4) is 8. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut what about the 2s? In example 1, there is a 2 in row 14, column 16. In the output, that cell is 2, and the cell to the right is 2. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nSo the transformation rule is: for each cell with a value of 2, 4, 6, or 8, set the cell to that value, and set the cell to the right to that value. \n\nBut what about the cell to the left? \n\nIn example 1, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). The cell to the right of (3,6) is 4, which is correct. \n\nBut what about the cell to the left of (3,6)? It's 1, which remains 1. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n   for each column in the row:\n\n       if the value is 2, 4, 6, or 8:\n\n           set the cell to the same value\n\n           if the column is not the last column:\n\n               set the cell to the right to the same value\n\nBut this would only expand to the right. \n\nBut this would explain the examples. \n\nLet me test this with example 1. \n\nIn the input, the 4 is in row 3, column 6. So the cell is 4, and the cell to the right (column 7) is set to 4. In the output, that's correct. \n\nThe 4 in row 4, column 5 is set to 4, and the cell to the right (column 6) is set to 4. \n\nIn the output, row 4, column 6 is 1, but according to this rule, it should be 4. But in the output of example 1, that cell is 1. So this contradicts. \n\nHmm, this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the cell to the left and right are set to that value. \n\nBut in example 1, the 4 in row 3, column 6 is set to 4, and the cell to the left (column 5) is set to 4. But in the output, that cell is 1. \n\nSo this is not working. \n\nThis is very challenging. \n\nPerhaps I should look for another pattern. \n\nLooking at example 1's output, the 6s are in positions (7,15) and (10,15), and their adjacent cells to the right are 6. \n\nIn example 2, the 7s are in positions (12, 15) and (13, 15), and their adjacent cells to the right are 7. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for each cell with a value of 6, 7, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the cell to the right is also set to that value. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nBut how to handle this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for any cell with a value of 4, 6, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the cell to the right is also set to that value. \n\nBut in example 1, the 4 in row 3, column 6 is set to 4, and the cell to the right is 4. In the output, this is correct. \n\nThe 4 in row 4, column 5 is set to 4, and the cell to the right is 4. But in the output, row 4, column 6 is 1. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nThis is very confusing. \n\nMaybe I should try to think of the transformation as expanding certain numbers to their neighboring cells in a specific pattern. \n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the 6s are in positions (7,15) and (10,15), and their adjacent cells to the right are 6. \n\nIn example 2's output, the 7s are in positions (12,15) and (13,15), and their adjacent cells to the right are 7. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for any cell with a value of 6, 7, 8, or 2, the cell is replaced by the same value, and the cell to the right is also set to that value. \n\nBut how to handle the 4s. \n\nIn example 1, the 4s are in positions (3,6) and (4,5). In the output, those positions are 4, and their adjacent cells to the right are 4. \n\nSo this would fit. \n\nBut in the output of example 1, row 4, column 6 is 1. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nBut perhaps I'm looking at the wrong positions. \n\nLet me recheck example 1's input and output. \n\nExample 1's input row 4 is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 \n\nWait, no.

In the output, those are still 4s. \n\nSo the transformation seems to be that the 4s are not expanded. \n\nBut the 6s are expanded to their right. \n\nIn the input, row 7 has 6 in column 15. In the output, that is 6, and the cell to the right is 6. \n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is that for cells with 6, 8, or 2, the cell to the right is set to the same value. \n\nBut what about the 4s? \n\nMaybe the 4s are not part of this transformation. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that for cells with 6, 8, or 2, the cell to the right is set to the same value. \n\nBut how to handle this. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n   for each column in the row:\n\n       if the value is 6, 8, or 2:\n\n           set the cell to the same value\n\n           if the column is not the last column:\n\n               set the cell to the right to the same value\n\nBut this would explain the 6s and 8s in example 1 and 2. \n\nBut what about the 2s? \n\nIn example 1, there is a 2 in row 14, column 16. In the output, that cell is 2, and the cell to the right is 2. \n\nSo this fits. \n\nBut what about the 4s? They are not part of this transformation. \n\nBut in example 1, the 4s are not expanded, so this fits. \n\nBut in example 2, the 4s are in the input and the output. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut how to handle the 4s in example 2. \n\nIn example 2's input, there is a 4 in row 4, column 8. In the output, that cell is 4. \n\nBut the 4 in row 4, column 8 is not expanded to the right. \n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is only for 6, 8, and 2. \n\nBut why? \n\nThis seems to be the only pattern that fits the examples. \n\nSo the code would be: for each cell with value 2, 6, or 8, set the cell to that value and the cell to the right to that value. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nNow, let's try to code this. \n\nThe function would iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, if the value is 2, 6, or 8, then set the cell to that value, and if the cell is not the last column, set the cell to the right to that value. \n\nBut wait, this would overwrite the original value. \n\nFor example, if a cell is 2, then set it to 2, and the cell to the right to 2. \n\nBut in the input, if the cell is 2, then in the output, it is 2 and the cell to the right is 2. \n\nThis would explain the 2s in example 1 and example 2. \n\nBut what about the 6s and 8s? \n\nIn example 1, the 6 in row 7, column 15 is set to 6, and the cell to the right is 6. \n\nIn example 1, the 8 in row 11, column 4 is set to 8, and the cell to the right is 8. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut what about the 4s? They are not part of this transformation, so they remain as is. \n\nBut in example 2, the 4s are in the input and output, so this fits. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. \n\nNow, let's code this. \n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Iterate over each cell\n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if transformed[i][j] in {2, 6, 8}:\n                # Set the current cell to the same value\n                # Set the cell to the right to the same value if possible\n                if j < 21:\n                    transformed[i][j+1] = transformed[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but this would set the cell to the right to the same value, but what if the cell to the right was already set? \n\nBut this code would overwrite it. \n\nBut according to the examples, this seems to work. \n\nLet's test this with example 1. \n\nIn example 1's input, the 6 in row 7, column 15 is 6. So transformed[i][j] is 6. Then, set transformed[i][j+1] to 6. \n\nIn the input, the cell to the right is 1, so in the output it becomes 6. \n\nIn the output of example 1, row 7, column 16 is 6. \n\nSimilarly, for the 6 in row 10, column 15, it is set to 6, and the cell to the right is 6. \n\nFor the 8 in row 11, column 4, it is set to 8, and the cell to the right is 8. \n\nFor the 2 in row 14, column 16, it is set to 2, and the cell to the right is 2. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nBut what about the 8 in row 12, column 4? \n\nIn the input, it is 8, and the cell to the right is 1. So in the output, it becomes 8, and the cell to the right is 8. \n\nThis would explain the 8s in the output. \n\nBut what about the 4s? They are not part of this transformation, so they remain as is. \n\nBut in example 1's input, the 4s are not changed. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut what about the 4s in example 2? \n\nIn example 2's input, there are 4s in row 4, column 8. The code does not change them, so they remain as 4. \n\nIn the output of example 2, the 4s are still 4. \n\nThis fits. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct transformation. \n\nBut what about the 6s in example 2? \n\nIn example 2's input, there is a 6 in row 11, column 1. In the output, that cell is 6, and the cell to the right is 6. \n\nThis fits. \n\nSo the code seems to work. \n\nBut what about the 8 in example 2's input, which is in row 14, column 4. \n\nIn the output, that cell is 8, and the cell to the right is 8. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this code would transform the grid as per the examples. \n\nBut wait, in example 1, the 8 in row 11, column 4 is set to 8, and the cell to the right is 8. \n\nIn the output, row 11, column 4 is 8, and column 5 is 8. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to work. \n\nThus, the code is as above. \n\nNow, I need to write this in Python. \n\nBut the code must return a 22x22 grid. \n\nThe code creates a copy of the grid, then for each cell, if the value is 2, 6, or 8, it sets the cell to the same value, and the cell to the right to the same value. \n\nBut wait, the code is setting the cell to the same value, but the original value is already that. So this is redundant. \n\nActually, the code is setting the cell to the same value, but since it's already that value, it's not changing anything. \n\nWait, no. The code is:\n\ntransformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n\nThen, for each cell (i,j):\n\nif transformed[i][j] is 2, 6, or 8:\n\n   if j < 21:\n\n       transformed[i][j+1] = transformed[i][j]\n\nSo this code only sets the cell to the right to the same value. \n\nBut the current cell is already set to that value. \n\nSo this code is only expanding to the right. \n\nBut this would work for the examples. \n\nSo this is the code.\n"
