          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a 13-column grid. The output is also 3x13. Let me look at the input and output for that example. \n\nIn the input, there are several rows with 0s except for some rows that have 2, 3, 5s. The output seems to have some 2s and 3s in specific positions. For instance, in the output, the second row has 0s except for positions 5, 6, 7 which are 2, 2, 3. Wait, maybe the output is taking some elements from the input and placing them in certain positions?\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has rows with 1s and 5s. The output has rows with 1s in the first 10 positions. For example, the second row of the output is all 1s except the last three. Hmm. Maybe the output is taking some rows from the input and modifying them?\n\nWait, let's look at the input and output for Example 1 more carefully. The input has 13 rows. The output is 3 rows. So maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input and combining them? \n\nIn Example 1, the input has rows that have 0s except for some rows. For instance, the second row is 0 2 2 3 0 ... and the output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 ... So maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from certain positions in the input and placing them in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking certain rows from the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has three rows. The input has 13 rows. Let me check the input rows for Example 1. \n\nLooking at the input for Example 1:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\nRow 1: 0 2 2 3 0 ... \nRow 2: all 0s.\nRow 3: all 5s.\nRow 4: all 0s.\nRow 5: 0 0 2 2 3 0 ...\nRow 6: all 0s.\nRow 7: all 5s.\nRow 8: all 0s.\nRow 9: 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 ...\nRow 10: all 0s.\nRow 11: all 5s.\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nThe output is three rows. The output's first row is all 0s. Second row has 0s except positions 5-7 (indices 5,6,7?), which are 2,2,3. The third row is all 0s. \n\nLooking at the input rows, maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row seems to be derived from row 1, row 5, row 9. Wait, row 1 has 0 2 2 3 0 ... row 5 has 0 0 2 2 3 0 ... row 9 has 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 ... So maybe the output is taking the positions where there are 2s and 3s in certain rows and combining them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain rows and combining them. For example, in the output, the second row has the 2s and 3s from rows 1, 5, 9. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for Example 1. The output is 3 rows. The input has 13 rows. Maybe the output is taking every 4th row? Let's see. For example, rows 1, 5, 9 in the input. But that's three rows. Then, maybe the output is taking those rows and modifying them. But how?\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1: the second row is 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0. The input row 1 is 0 2 2 3 0 ... So maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from certain positions and placing them in the output. But why would the output have 0s in other positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from the input and placing them in the output's second row. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has rows with 1s and 5s. The output has rows with 1s. For example, the output's second row is 1s in the first 10 positions. The input's rows have 1s in different positions. For example, row 1 has 1s in the first two positions, row 5 has 1s in the first four positions, row 9 has 1s in the first six positions, row 13 has 1s in the first eight positions. So the output's second row is combining these 1s. Maybe the output is taking the maximum number of 1s from certain rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking every other row and combining them. For example, in Example 2, the output's second row is all 1s in the first 10 positions. The input rows that have 1s are rows 1, 5, 9, 13. So maybe the output is taking the union of these 1s and placing them in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 1s and 5s and combining them. For example, in Example 2, the output's second row is all 1s in the first 10 positions. That might be because the input's rows 1, 5, 9, 13 have 1s in increasing numbers. So the output is taking the maximum of the positions where 1s are present.\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 1s and 5s, and in the output, the 1s are spread out. For example, in the output of Example 2, the second row is 1s in the first 10 positions. That could be the result of combining the 1s from multiple input rows. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 1s and 5s, and in the output, the 1s are placed in the first positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input and combining them. For example, in Example 1, the output is taking rows 1, 5, 9. Let's check:\n\nRow 1: 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf we combine these rows, maybe the output is taking the positions where 2s and 3s are present. But how? The output's second row has 2s and 3s in positions 5-7 (indices 5,6,7). Let's see:\n\nIn row 1, the 2s and 3s are at positions 1,2,3 (indices 1-3). But in the output, they are at positions 5-7. So maybe there's a shift? Or maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from certain rows and placing them in specific positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from the input and placing them in the output's second row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 2s and 3s and then combining them. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is the combination of the 2s and 3s from rows 1, 5, 9. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output has non-zero values. For Example 1, the output's second row has 2s and 3s starting at position 5 (index 5?), which is the sixth column. Let me check the input for that. \n\nIn row 1 of the input, the 2s and 3s are in columns 1, 2, 3. In row 5, they are in columns 2, 3, 4. In row 9, columns 3, 4, 5. So maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from these rows and shifting them to the right by 4 positions? Because in the output, they start at position 5. \n\nBut that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from the input and placing them in the output's second row, but only in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from the input and placing them in the output's second row, but only where they are present in the input. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 2s and 3s and then combining them. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is the combination of the 2s and 3s from rows 1, 5, 9. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 2s and 3s and then for each column, taking the maximum value. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain rows and then replacing the 0s with the values from the input. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then combining them. \n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for Example 2. The output's second row is all 1s in the first 10 positions. The input's rows that have 1s are rows 1, 5, 9, 13. For example, row 1 has 1s in positions 0 and 1. Row 5 has 1s in positions 0,1,2,3. Row 9 has 1s in positions 0,1,2,3,4,5. Row 13 has 1s in positions 0-7. So the output's second row has 1s in the first 10 positions. That could be the union of all the 1s from these rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the maximum number of 1s from each row. For example, in row 1, there are two 1s. In row 5, four. In row 9, six. In row 13, eight. The output's second row has ten 1s. That's more than any single row. So maybe the output is combining the 1s from multiple rows into a single row.\n\nBut how to translate that into code?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then combining them. For example, in Example 1, the output is taking the rows that have 2s and 3s and combining them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each column, taking the first occurrence of a non-zero value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each column, taking the maximum value. \n\nBut how to figure this out?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input and then replacing the 0s with the values from those rows. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is derived from the rows that have 2s and 3s. \n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input and combining them into the output. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 2s and 3s in columns 5-7. Looking at the input rows, maybe those columns are being taken from certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then combining them in a certain way. \n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for Example 1 and 2, the output is 3 rows. The input has 13 rows. Maybe the output is taking the first, fifth, ninth rows of the input. Because 1, 5, 9 are the first, fifth, ninth rows (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's check. In Example 1, the input has 13 rows. The output is 3 rows. So maybe the output is taking every fourth row? Let's see: rows 1, 5, 9 (assuming 0-based, that would be rows 1, 5, 9). But how does that fit with the output?\n\nIn Example 1, the output's second row is derived from rows 1, 5, 9. Let's look at those rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf we combine these rows, maybe the output is taking the positions where there are 2s and 3s. For example, in row 1, the 2s and 3s are at positions 1,2,3. In row 5, they are at 2,3,4. In row 9, they are at 3,4,5. So the output's second row has 2s and 3s starting at position 5 (index 5?), which is the sixth column. That seems like a shift. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from these rows and placing them in the output's second row, but only in certain positions. For example, in row 1, the 2s and 3s are in columns 1-3. In row 5, columns 2-4. In row 9, columns 3-5. So the output's second row has 2s and 3s in columns 5-7. That's a shift of 4 positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 2s and 3s and then for each column, taking the first occurrence of a non-zero value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from the input and placing them in the output's second row, but only in certain positions. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to look for another pattern. \n\nIn Example 2, the output's second row has 1s in the first 10 positions. The input rows that have 1s are rows 1, 5, 9, 13. The output's second row has 1s in the first 10 columns. That could be the result of combining all the 1s from these rows. For example, in row 1, the 1s are in the first two columns. In row 5, the 1s are in the first four columns. In row 9, the first six. In row 13, the first eight. So the output's second row is combining all these 1s into the first 10 columns. \n\nSo maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values (like 1s, 2s, 3s, 5s) and combining them into the output's rows. \n\nBut how to translate that into code?\n\nAnother idea: the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then combining them into the output. For example, in Example 1, the output is taking the rows that have 2s and 3s and combining them. \n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each row, the output is taking the first occurrence of a non-zero value and placing it in the output. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each column, the output is taking the first non-zero value from those rows. \n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each column, the output is taking the first non-zero value from those rows. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 2s and 3s in certain positions. \n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAnother approach: think about the test input. The test input has a 13-row grid. The output should be 3x13. Let's look at the test input's rows. \n\nThe test input's rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 1: 0 3 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0\nRow 2: 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 3: 5s all\nRow 4: 0 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 5: 0 3 3 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0\nRow 6: 3s and 2s\nRow 7: 5s all\nRow 8: same as row 4\nRow 9: same as row 5\nRow 10: 3s and 2s\nRow 11: 5s all\nRow 12: same as row 4\n\nSo the output is 3 rows. Maybe the output is taking certain rows from the test input. For example, rows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. But that's seven rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 2s, 3s, and 5s, and combining them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then combining them into the output. \n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 2s and 3s and 5s, and then for each row, the output is taking the first occurrence of a non-zero value and placing it in the output. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1 and 2, the output has 3 rows. The input has 13 rows. Maybe the output is taking the first, fifth, and ninth rows of the input. Because 1, 5, 9 are spaced by four. For example, in Example 1, the output is taking rows 1, 5, 9. Then, for each of these rows, the output is modifying them to have certain values. \n\nIn Example 1's output, the second row has 2s and 3s in positions 5-7. Looking at the rows 1,5,9:\n\nRow 1: 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf we take the 2s and 3s from these rows and shift them to the right by 4 positions, then in row 1, the 2s and 3s are in columns 1-3. Shifting right by 4 would put them in columns 5-7. That matches the output's second row. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is: for every fourth row (rows 1, 5, 9), take the 2s and 3s and shift them to the right by 4 positions. \n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, the output is taking every fourth row and then shifting the non-zero values to the right by 4 columns. \n\nIn Example 1, the output's second row is derived from row 1, shifted by 4 columns. But how?\n\nWait, in row 1, the non-zero values are in columns 1, 2, 3 (values 2, 2, 3). If we shift them to the right by 4 columns, they would be in columns 5, 6, 7. Which matches the output's second row. \n\nSimilarly, for row 5: non-zero values are in columns 2,3,4. Shifting right by 4 would put them in columns 6,7,8. But in the output's second row, the non-zero values are in columns 5,6,7. Hmm, that doesn't match. \n\nWait, maybe it's not shifting by 4, but by 4 columns, but the original positions are different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from the input rows and placing them in the output's second row, but only in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each of those rows, the non-zero values are placed in the output's second row. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then combining them into the output. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is the combination of the non-zero values from rows 1,5,9. \n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: think about the output for Example 2. The output's second row is all 1s in the first 10 positions. The input's rows that have 1s are rows 1,5,9,13. For each of these rows, the 1s are in increasing positions. So the output's second row is combining all the 1s from these rows. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is that the output's second row is the combination of the non-zero values from certain rows, and the output's other rows are filled with 0s. \n\nBut how to determine which rows to take?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each column, taking the first non-zero value from those rows. \n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each row, the output is taking the non-zero values and placing them in the output's rows. \n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's try to think of the test input. \n\nThe test input's output is supposed to be 3x13. Let's see what the output would look like if we apply the same pattern as in Example 1 and 2. \n\nIn Example 1, the output is taking every fourth row (rows 1,5,9) and shifting the non-zero values to the right by 4 columns. \n\nIn Example 2, the output is taking every fourth row (rows 1,5,9,13) and combining their non-zero values. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is that the output's rows are derived from every fourth row of the input, and then the non-zero values are shifted or combined in some way. \n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet's think about the test input. The test input has 13 rows. So the rows that are every fourth row would be rows 0, 4, 8, 12 (assuming 0-based). But in Example 1, the rows taken were 1,5,9. Which are 1-based. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows taken are the ones that are in positions 1,5,9 (1-based), which would be 0,4,8 in 0-based. \n\nIn the test input, the rows 0,4,8,12 would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nBut how would these rows be transformed? \n\nIf we take the non-zero values from these rows and shift them to the right by 4 columns, then for row 0, the non-zero values are at positions 2, 6, 10 (values 2, 2, 2). Shifting right by 4 would put them at positions 6, 10, 14. But the grid is 13 columns, so position 14 is out of bounds. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern may not be shifting by 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are placed in the output's second row. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and combining them into the output's rows. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother approach: look for the output's structure. The output has three rows. The first and third rows are all zeros. The second row has non-zero values. \n\nIn Example 1, the second row has 2s and 3s in positions 5-7. In Example 2, the second row has 1s in positions 0-9. \n\nSo maybe the output's second row is derived from the input's rows that have non-zero values, and the non-zero values are placed in the second row. \n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the output's second row is the combination of all non-zero values from certain rows. For example, in Example 1, the non-zero values are from rows 1,5,9. \n\nIn Example 2, the non-zero values are from rows 1,5,9,13. \n\nSo perhaps the output's second row is the combination of the non-zero values from every fourth row of the input. \n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe the output's second row is the combination of all non-zero values from the rows that are in positions 1,5,9 (1-based), which are rows 0,4,8 in 0-based. \n\nIn the test input, these rows are:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRow 8: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nSo the non-zero values are 2,2,2 in row 0; 3,2,2 in row 4; 3,2,2 in row 8. Combining these, the output's second row would have 2,2,2,3,2,2,3,2,2, ... but this seems messy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's second row is the combination of the non-zero values from these rows, but only in certain positions. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. \n\nAnother idea: the output's second row is derived from the input's rows that have non-zero values, and the non-zero values are placed in the output's second row. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 2s and 3s from rows 1,5,9. \n\nSo the code could be: \n\nFor the output's second row, collect all non-zero values from rows that are every fourth row (like rows 1,5,9 in Example 1), and place them in the second row. \n\nBut how to determine which rows to take? \n\nAlternatively, the output's second row is the combination of the non-zero values from rows that have 2s, 3s, or 5s. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each column in the output's second row, it takes the first non-zero value from those rows. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 2s and 3s in positions 5-7. \n\nThis is getting too ambiguous. \n\nMaybe I should look for a pattern that can be implemented. \n\nGiven that the output is 3 rows, and the first and third are all zeros, the second row is the key. \n\nMaybe the second row is derived from the input's rows that have non-zero values, and the non-zero values are placed in the second row. \n\nAlternatively, the second row is the combination of the non-zero values from the input's rows that are in positions where the row number is odd. \n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the second row is the combination of the non-zero values from the input's rows that are in positions where the row number is 1, 5, 9 (1-based), which are 0,4,8 in 0-based. \n\nSo for the test input, these rows are 0,4,8,12. \n\nLet's take those rows and combine their non-zero values. \n\nFor row 0: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRow 8: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRow 12: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nSo the non-zero values are in columns 2,6,10 for row 0, 2,6,10 for row 4, etc. \n\nIf we take these values and combine them into the second row, it would be [2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2]. But that's just a guess. \n\nBut the output for the test input is not known, so I can't check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's second row is the combination of the non-zero values from the rows that are every fourth row, but shifted to the right by 4 columns. \n\nFor example, in row 0, the non-zero values are at positions 2,6,10. Shifting right by 4 would make them at positions 6, 10, 14. But since there are 13 columns, position 14 is out of bounds. So this might not work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are placed in the second row, but only in the positions where they appear in the input rows. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nIn both examples, the output's second row is derived from the input's rows that are every fourth row (like rows 1,5,9 in Example 1). So perhaps the code should take every fourth row from the input and process them. \n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Take the input grid.\n2. For the output, the first and third rows are all zeros.\n3. The second row is derived from every fourth row of the input, combining their non-zero values. \n\nBut how to combine them? \n\nIn Example 1, the non-zero values from rows 1,5,9 are:\n\nRow 1: [2,2,3]\nRow 5: [2,2,3]\nRow 9: [2,2,3]\n\nCombined, they form [2,2,3,2,2,3,2,2,3], but the output's second row is [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,0,0,0,0]. So maybe the non-zero values are placed in the middle of the row. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are placed in the second row, but only in certain positions. \n\nAnother idea: the output's second row is the combination of the non-zero values from the input's rows that are every fourth row, but only the first occurrence of each value in the row. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's second row is the first non-zero value from each of the selected rows. \n\nBut again, not sure. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: \n\n- The output has three rows. \n- The first and third rows are all zeros. \n- The second row is derived from the input's rows that are every fourth row (like rows 1,5,9 in Example 1). \n- For each of these rows, the non-zero values are placed in the second row. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nMaybe for the second row, we take the non-zero values from the selected rows and place them in the second row. \n\nBut how to handle the positions. \n\nAlternatively, for the second row, we take the non-zero values from the selected rows and concatenate them. \n\nBut in Example 1, the selected rows have non-zero values in positions 1-3, 2-4, 3-5. So the output's second row has 2,2,3 in positions 5-7. \n\nThis suggests that the non-zero values are shifted to the right by 4 positions. \n\nSo the code could be: \n\nFor each selected row (every fourth row), take the non-zero values and shift them to the right by 4 positions. \n\nBut how to handle this in code. \n\nLet me try to think of code that would do this. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the selected rows are rows 1,5,9 (0-based: 1,5,9). For each of these rows, we take the non-zero values, then shift them to the right by 4 positions, and then combine them into the second row. \n\nBut how to handle overlapping or shifting. \n\nAlternatively, for each selected row, we take the non-zero values and insert them into the second row at positions 5-7. \n\nBut this is not generalizable. \n\nAlternatively, the code could be:\n\n- For the second row, iterate through each column, and if the column is in the selected rows, take the value from the selected row. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write code that takes every fourth row (rows 1,5,9 in 0-based) and for each of those rows, the non-zero values are placed in the second row. \n\nBut how to do that. \n\nAlternatively, the code could be:\n\n- The output's second row is the combination of the non-zero values from the rows that are every fourth row. \n\nBut how to determine which rows to take. \n\nMaybe the code is as follows: \n\nFor the output's second row, take the non-zero values from rows that are in positions 1,5,9 (1-based), which are 0,4,8 in 0-based. \n\nSo for each of these rows, we take the non-zero values and add them to the second row. \n\nBut in Example 1, the non-zero values from these rows are [2,2,3], [2,2,3], [2,2,3]. So combined, they would be [2,2,3,2,2,3,2,2,3], but the output's second row is [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,0,0,0,0]. \n\nThis suggests that the non-zero values are placed in the middle of the row. \n\nMaybe the code is taking the non-zero values from the selected rows and placing them in the second row, but only in the positions where they appear. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write code that takes the rows that are every fourth row (rows 1,5,9 in 1-based, which are 0,4,8 in 0-based) and for each of these rows, take the non-zero values and place them in the second row, but shifted to the right by 4 positions. \n\nSo for each row in the selected rows, we take the non-zero values and shift them to the right by 4. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nFor example, in row 1 (0-based), the non-zero values are at positions 1,2,3. Shifting right by 4 would put them at positions 5,6,7. \n\nSo the code could be:\n\nselected_rows = [1,5,9]  # assuming 0-based\n\nfor row in selected_rows:\n    for col in range(13):\n        if grid[row][col] != 0:\n            # shift by 4\n            new_col = col + 4\n            if new_col < 13:\n                output_row[new_col] = grid[row][col]\n\nBut this would place the non-zero values in the output's second row at positions col +4. \n\nBut in Example 1, this would work. \n\nLet's test this for Example 1:\n\nRow 1: [0, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFor each column in this row:\n\ncol=1: value 2 \u2192 new_col=5 \u2192 output_row[5] = 2\ncol=2: value 2 \u2192 new_col=6 \u2192 output_row[6] = 2\ncol=3: value 3 \u2192 new_col=7 \u2192 output_row[7] = 3\nOther columns are 0, so no change.\n\nRow 5: [0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\ncol=2 \u2192 new_col=6 \u2192 but output_row[6] is already 2. So it would overwrite. But in the example, the output_row[6] is 2, which is correct. \n\ncol=3 \u2192 new_col=7 \u2192 already 3. \n\ncol=4 \u2192 new_col=8 \u2192 output_row[8] = 3.\n\nRow 9: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\ncol=3 \u2192 new_col=7 \u2192 already 3. \n\ncol=4 \u2192 new_col=8 \u2192 already 3. \n\ncol=5 \u2192 new_col=9 \u2192 output_row[9] = 3. \n\nSo the output_row would have values at positions 5,6,7,8,9. But the example's output has 2,2,3 in positions 5-7. \n\nThis suggests that this approach is not correct. \n\nBut in the example, the output_row has 2,2,3 at positions 5-7, but according to this code, there are more values. \n\nHmm. So this approach may not be correct. \n\nBut maybe the code is supposed to take the first occurrence of non-zero values in the selected rows. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should take the non-zero values from the selected rows and place them in the output's second row, but only in the first occurrence of each column. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nThe output is 3 rows. The first and third are all zeros. The second row is derived from every fourth row of the input, and for each of these rows, the non-zero values are placed in the second row, shifted to the right by 4 columns. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid\n    output = [[0]*13 for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Process the second row\n    # Take every fourth row (rows 1,5,9 in 1-based, which are 0,4,8 in 0-based)\n    for row in [1, 5, 9]:\n        for col in range(13):\n            if grid[row][col] != 0:\n                new_col = col + 4\n                if new_col < 13:\n                    output[1][new_col] = grid[row][col]\n    \n    return output\n\nBut this may not work for the examples. \n\nIn Example 1, this code would process rows 1,5,9. \n\nFor row 1, col 1: new_col 5 \u2192 output[1][5] = 2\ncol 2: new_col 6 \u2192 2\ncol 3: new_col 7 \u2192 3\nSo output[1][5-7] = 2,2,3. \n\nFor row 5, col 2: new_col 6 \u2192 2 (overwriting previous 2)\ncol 3: new_col 7 \u2192 2 (overwriting previous 3)\ncol 4: new_col 8 \u2192 3\nSo output[1][6] is 2, [7] is 2, [8] is 3.\n\nFor row 9, col 3: new_col 7 \u2192 2 (overwriting previous 2)\ncol 4: new_col 8 \u2192 2 (overwriting previous 3)\ncol 5: new_col 9 \u2192 3.\n\nSo the output[1] would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]. \n\nBut the correct output for Example 1 is [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,0,0,0,0]. So this code would not produce the correct output. \n\nThis suggests that the approach is incorrect. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the non-zero values are placed in the second row, but only in the first occurrence of each column. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this code, even if it's not perfect, as it's the best I can do based on the examples.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a 13-column grid. The output is also 3x13. Let me look at the input and output for that example. \n\nIn the input, there are several rows with 0s except for some rows that have 2, 3, 5s. The output seems to have some 2s and 3s in specific positions. For instance, in the output, the second row has 0s except for positions 5, 6, 7 which are 2, 2, 3. Wait, maybe the output is taking some elements from the input and placing them in certain positions?\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has rows with 1s and 5s. The output has rows with 1s in the first 10 positions. For example, the second row of the output is all 1s except the last three. Hmm. Maybe the output is taking some rows from the input and modifying them?\n\nWait, let's look at the input and output for Example 1 more carefully. The input has 13 rows. The output is 3 rows. So maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input and combining them? \n\nIn Example 1, the input has rows that have 0s except for some rows. For instance, the second row is 0 2 2 3 0 ... and the output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 ... So maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from certain positions in the input and placing them in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking certain rows from the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has three rows. The input has 13 rows. Let me check the input rows for Example 1. \n\nLooking at the input for Example 1:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\nRow 1: 0 2 2 3 0 ... \nRow 2: all 0s.\nRow 3: all 5s.\nRow 4: all 0s.\nRow 5: 0 0 2 2 3 0 ...\nRow 6: all 0s.\nRow 7: all 5s.\nRow 8: all 0s.\nRow 9: 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 ...\nRow 10: all 0s.\nRow 11: all 5s.\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nThe output is three rows. The output's first row is all 0s. Second row has 0s except positions 5-7 (indices 5,6,7?), which are 2,2,3. The third row is all 0s. \n\nLooking at the input rows, maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row seems to be derived from row 1, row 5, row 9. Wait, row 1 has 0 2 2 3 0 ... row 5 has 0 0 2 2 3 0 ... row 9 has 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 ... So maybe the output is taking the positions where there are 2s and 3s in certain rows and combining them?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain rows and combining them. For example, in the output, the second row has the 2s and 3s from rows 1, 5, 9. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for Example 1. The output is 3 rows. The input has 13 rows. Maybe the output is taking every 4th row? Let's see. For example, rows 1, 5, 9 in the input. But that's three rows. Then, maybe the output is taking those rows and modifying them. But how?\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1: the second row is 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0. The input row 1 is 0 2 2 3 0 ... So maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from certain positions and placing them in the output. But why would the output have 0s in other positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from the input and placing them in the output's second row. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has rows with 1s and 5s. The output has rows with 1s. For example, the output's second row is 1s in the first 10 positions. The input's rows have 1s in different positions. For example, row 1 has 1s in the first two positions, row 5 has 1s in the first four positions, row 9 has 1s in the first six positions, row 13 has 1s in the first eight positions. So the output's second row is combining these 1s. Maybe the output is taking the maximum number of 1s from certain rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking every other row and combining them. For example, in Example 2, the output's second row is all 1s in the first 10 positions. The input rows that have 1s are rows 1, 5, 9, 13. So maybe the output is taking the union of these 1s and placing them in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 1s and 5s and combining them. For example, in Example 2, the output's second row is all 1s in the first 10 positions. That might be because the input's rows 1, 5, 9, 13 have 1s in increasing numbers. So the output is taking the maximum of the positions where 1s are present.\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 1s and 5s, and in the output, the 1s are spread out. For example, in the output of Example 2, the second row is 1s in the first 10 positions. That could be the result of combining the 1s from multiple input rows. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 1s and 5s, and in the output, the 1s are placed in the first positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input and combining them. For example, in Example 1, the output is taking rows 1, 5, 9. Let's check:\n\nRow 1: 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf we combine these rows, maybe the output is taking the positions where 2s and 3s are present. But how? The output's second row has 2s and 3s in positions 5-7 (indices 5,6,7). Let's see:\n\nIn row 1, the 2s and 3s are at positions 1,2,3 (indices 1-3). But in the output, they are at positions 5-7. So maybe there's a shift? Or maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from certain rows and placing them in specific positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from the input and placing them in the output's second row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 2s and 3s and then combining them. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is the combination of the 2s and 3s from rows 1, 5, 9. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output has non-zero values. For Example 1, the output's second row has 2s and 3s starting at position 5 (index 5?), which is the sixth column. Let me check the input for that. \n\nIn row 1 of the input, the 2s and 3s are in columns 1, 2, 3. In row 5, they are in columns 2, 3, 4. In row 9, columns 3, 4, 5. So maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from these rows and shifting them to the right by 4 positions? Because in the output, they start at position 5. \n\nBut that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from the input and placing them in the output's second row, but only in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from the input and placing them in the output's second row, but only where they are present in the input. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 2s and 3s and then combining them. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is the combination of the 2s and 3s from rows 1, 5, 9. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 2s and 3s and then for each column, taking the maximum value. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain rows and then replacing the 0s with the values from the input. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then combining them. \n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for Example 2. The output's second row is all 1s in the first 10 positions. The input's rows that have 1s are rows 1, 5, 9, 13. For example, row 1 has 1s in positions 0 and 1. Row 5 has 1s in positions 0,1,2,3. Row 9 has 1s in positions 0,1,2,3,4,5. Row 13 has 1s in positions 0-7. So the output's second row has 1s in the first 10 positions. That could be the union of all the 1s from these rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the maximum number of 1s from each row. For example, in row 1, there are two 1s. In row 5, four. In row 9, six. In row 13, eight. The output's second row has ten 1s. That's more than any single row. So maybe the output is combining the 1s from multiple rows into a single row.\n\nBut how to translate that into code?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then combining them. For example, in Example 1, the output is taking the rows that have 2s and 3s and combining them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each column, taking the first occurrence of a non-zero value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each column, taking the maximum value. \n\nBut how to figure this out?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input and then replacing the 0s with the values from those rows. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is derived from the rows that have 2s and 3s. \n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input and combining them into the output. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 2s and 3s in columns 5-7. Looking at the input rows, maybe those columns are being taken from certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then combining them in a certain way. \n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for Example 1 and 2, the output is 3 rows. The input has 13 rows. Maybe the output is taking the first, fifth, ninth rows of the input. Because 1, 5, 9 are the first, fifth, ninth rows (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's check. In Example 1, the input has 13 rows. The output is 3 rows. So maybe the output is taking every fourth row? Let's see: rows 1, 5, 9 (assuming 0-based, that would be rows 1, 5, 9). But how does that fit with the output?\n\nIn Example 1, the output's second row is derived from rows 1, 5, 9. Let's look at those rows:\n\nRow 1: 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf we combine these rows, maybe the output is taking the positions where there are 2s and 3s. For example, in row 1, the 2s and 3s are at positions 1,2,3. In row 5, they are at 2,3,4. In row 9, they are at 3,4,5. So the output's second row has 2s and 3s starting at position 5 (index 5?), which is the sixth column. That seems like a shift. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from these rows and placing them in the output's second row, but only in certain positions. For example, in row 1, the 2s and 3s are in columns 1-3. In row 5, columns 2-4. In row 9, columns 3-5. So the output's second row has 2s and 3s in columns 5-7. That's a shift of 4 positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 2s and 3s and then for each column, taking the first occurrence of a non-zero value. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from the input and placing them in the output's second row, but only in certain positions. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to look for another pattern. \n\nIn Example 2, the output's second row has 1s in the first 10 positions. The input rows that have 1s are rows 1, 5, 9, 13. The output's second row has 1s in the first 10 columns. That could be the result of combining all the 1s from these rows. For example, in row 1, the 1s are in the first two columns. In row 5, the 1s are in the first four columns. In row 9, the first six. In row 13, the first eight. So the output's second row is combining all these 1s into the first 10 columns. \n\nSo maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values (like 1s, 2s, 3s, 5s) and combining them into the output's rows. \n\nBut how to translate that into code?\n\nAnother idea: the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then combining them into the output. For example, in Example 1, the output is taking the rows that have 2s and 3s and combining them. \n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each row, the output is taking the first occurrence of a non-zero value and placing it in the output. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each column, the output is taking the first non-zero value from those rows. \n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each column, the output is taking the first non-zero value from those rows. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 2s and 3s in certain positions. \n\nBut how to find that?\n\nAnother approach: think about the test input. The test input has a 13-row grid. The output should be 3x13. Let's look at the test input's rows. \n\nThe test input's rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 1: 0 3 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0\nRow 2: 3 3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 3: 5s all\nRow 4: 0 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 5: 0 3 3 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0\nRow 6: 3s and 2s\nRow 7: 5s all\nRow 8: same as row 4\nRow 9: same as row 5\nRow 10: 3s and 2s\nRow 11: 5s all\nRow 12: same as row 4\n\nSo the output is 3 rows. Maybe the output is taking certain rows from the test input. For example, rows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. But that's seven rows. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 2s, 3s, and 5s, and combining them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then combining them into the output. \n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have 2s and 3s and 5s, and then for each row, the output is taking the first occurrence of a non-zero value and placing it in the output. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1 and 2, the output has 3 rows. The input has 13 rows. Maybe the output is taking the first, fifth, and ninth rows of the input. Because 1, 5, 9 are spaced by four. For example, in Example 1, the output is taking rows 1, 5, 9. Then, for each of these rows, the output is modifying them to have certain values. \n\nIn Example 1's output, the second row has 2s and 3s in positions 5-7. Looking at the rows 1,5,9:\n\nRow 1: 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 2 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIf we take the 2s and 3s from these rows and shift them to the right by 4 positions, then in row 1, the 2s and 3s are in columns 1-3. Shifting right by 4 would put them in columns 5-7. That matches the output's second row. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is: for every fourth row (rows 1, 5, 9), take the 2s and 3s and shift them to the right by 4 positions. \n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, the output is taking every fourth row and then shifting the non-zero values to the right by 4 columns. \n\nIn Example 1, the output's second row is derived from row 1, shifted by 4 columns. But how?\n\nWait, in row 1, the non-zero values are in columns 1, 2, 3 (values 2, 2, 3). If we shift them to the right by 4 columns, they would be in columns 5, 6, 7. Which matches the output's second row. \n\nSimilarly, for row 5: non-zero values are in columns 2,3,4. Shifting right by 4 would put them in columns 6,7,8. But in the output's second row, the non-zero values are in columns 5,6,7. Hmm, that doesn't match. \n\nWait, maybe it's not shifting by 4, but by 4 columns, but the original positions are different. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 2s and 3s from the input rows and placing them in the output's second row, but only in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each of those rows, the non-zero values are placed in the output's second row. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then combining them into the output. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is the combination of the non-zero values from rows 1,5,9. \n\nBut how?\n\nAnother approach: think about the output for Example 2. The output's second row is all 1s in the first 10 positions. The input's rows that have 1s are rows 1,5,9,13. For each of these rows, the 1s are in increasing positions. So the output's second row is combining all the 1s from these rows. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is that the output's second row is the combination of the non-zero values from certain rows, and the output's other rows are filled with 0s. \n\nBut how to determine which rows to take?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each column, taking the first non-zero value from those rows. \n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each row, the output is taking the non-zero values and placing them in the output's rows. \n\nBut I'm not making progress. Let's try to think of the test input. \n\nThe test input's output is supposed to be 3x13. Let's see what the output would look like if we apply the same pattern as in Example 1 and 2. \n\nIn Example 1, the output is taking every fourth row (rows 1,5,9) and shifting the non-zero values to the right by 4 columns. \n\nIn Example 2, the output is taking every fourth row (rows 1,5,9,13) and combining their non-zero values. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is that the output's rows are derived from every fourth row of the input, and then the non-zero values are shifted or combined in some way. \n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet's think about the test input. The test input has 13 rows. So the rows that are every fourth row would be rows 0, 4, 8, 12 (assuming 0-based). But in Example 1, the rows taken were 1,5,9. Which are 1-based. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows taken are the ones that are in positions 1,5,9 (1-based), which would be 0,4,8 in 0-based. \n\nIn the test input, the rows 0,4,8,12 would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nBut how would these rows be transformed? \n\nIf we take the non-zero values from these rows and shift them to the right by 4 columns, then for row 0, the non-zero values are at positions 2, 6, 10 (values 2, 2, 2). Shifting right by 4 would put them at positions 6, 10, 14. But the grid is 13 columns, so position 14 is out of bounds. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern may not be shifting by 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are placed in the output's second row. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and combining them into the output's rows. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother approach: look for the output's structure. The output has three rows. The first and third rows are all zeros. The second row has non-zero values. \n\nIn Example 1, the second row has 2s and 3s in positions 5-7. In Example 2, the second row has 1s in positions 0-9. \n\nSo maybe the output's second row is derived from the input's rows that have non-zero values, and the non-zero values are placed in the second row. \n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the output's second row is the combination of all non-zero values from certain rows. For example, in Example 1, the non-zero values are from rows 1,5,9. \n\nIn Example 2, the non-zero values are from rows 1,5,9,13. \n\nSo perhaps the output's second row is the combination of the non-zero values from every fourth row of the input. \n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe the output's second row is the combination of all non-zero values from the rows that are in positions 1,5,9 (1-based), which are rows 0,4,8 in 0-based. \n\nIn the test input, these rows are:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRow 8: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nSo the non-zero values are 2,2,2 in row 0; 3,2,2 in row 4; 3,2,2 in row 8. Combining these, the output's second row would have 2,2,2,3,2,2,3,2,2, ... but this seems messy. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's second row is the combination of the non-zero values from these rows, but only in certain positions. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. \n\nAnother idea: the output's second row is derived from the input's rows that have non-zero values, and the non-zero values are placed in the output's second row. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 2s and 3s from rows 1,5,9. \n\nSo the code could be: \n\nFor the output's second row, collect all non-zero values from rows that are every fourth row (like rows 1,5,9 in Example 1), and place them in the second row. \n\nBut how to determine which rows to take? \n\nAlternatively, the output's second row is the combination of the non-zero values from rows that have 2s, 3s, or 5s. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have non-zero values and then for each column in the output's second row, it takes the first non-zero value from those rows. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output's second row has 2s and 3s in positions 5-7. \n\nThis is getting too ambiguous. \n\nMaybe I should look for a pattern that can be implemented. \n\nGiven that the output is 3 rows, and the first and third are all zeros, the second row is the key. \n\nMaybe the second row is derived from the input's rows that have non-zero values, and the non-zero values are placed in the second row. \n\nAlternatively, the second row is the combination of the non-zero values from the input's rows that are in positions where the row number is odd. \n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the second row is the combination of the non-zero values from the input's rows that are in positions where the row number is 1, 5, 9 (1-based), which are 0,4,8 in 0-based. \n\nSo for the test input, these rows are 0,4,8,12. \n\nLet's take those rows and combine their non-zero values. \n\nFor row 0: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRow 4: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRow 8: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\nRow 12: [0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]\n\nSo the non-zero values are in columns 2,6,10 for row 0, 2,6,10 for row 4, etc. \n\nIf we take these values and combine them into the second row, it would be [2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3, 2, 2]. But that's just a guess. \n\nBut the output for the test input is not known, so I can't check. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's second row is the combination of the non-zero values from the rows that are every fourth row, but shifted to the right by 4 columns. \n\nFor example, in row 0, the non-zero values are at positions 2,6,10. Shifting right by 4 would make them at positions 6, 10, 14. But since there are 13 columns, position 14 is out of bounds. So this might not work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are placed in the second row, but only in the positions where they appear in the input rows. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nIn both examples, the output's second row is derived from the input's rows that are every fourth row (like rows 1,5,9 in Example 1). So perhaps the code should take every fourth row from the input and process them. \n\nSo the steps could be:\n\n1. Take the input grid.\n2. For the output, the first and third rows are all zeros.\n3. The second row is derived from every fourth row of the input, combining their non-zero values. \n\nBut how to combine them? \n\nIn Example 1, the non-zero values from rows 1,5,9 are:\n\nRow 1: [2,2,3]\nRow 5: [2,2,3]\nRow 9: [2,2,3]\n\nCombined, they form [2,2,3,2,2,3,2,2,3], but the output's second row is [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,0,0,0,0]. So maybe the non-zero values are placed in the middle of the row. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are placed in the second row, but only in certain positions. \n\nAnother idea: the output's second row is the combination of the non-zero values from the input's rows that are every fourth row, but only the first occurrence of each value in the row. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's second row is the first non-zero value from each of the selected rows. \n\nBut again, not sure. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: \n\n- The output has three rows. \n- The first and third rows are all zeros. \n- The second row is derived from the input's rows that are every fourth row (like rows 1,5,9 in Example 1). \n- For each of these rows, the non-zero values are placed in the second row. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nMaybe for the second row, we take the non-zero values from the selected rows and place them in the second row. \n\nBut how to handle the positions. \n\nAlternatively, for the second row, we take the non-zero values from the selected rows and concatenate them. \n\nBut in Example 1, the selected rows have non-zero values in positions 1-3, 2-4, 3-5. So the output's second row has 2,2,3 in positions 5-7. \n\nThis suggests that the non-zero values are shifted to the right by 4 positions. \n\nSo the code could be: \n\nFor each selected row (every fourth row), take the non-zero values and shift them to the right by 4 positions. \n\nBut how to handle this in code. \n\nLet me try to think of code that would do this. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the selected rows are rows 1,5,9 (0-based: 1,5,9). For each of these rows, we take the non-zero values, then shift them to the right by 4 positions, and then combine them into the second row. \n\nBut how to handle overlapping or shifting. \n\nAlternatively, for each selected row, we take the non-zero values and insert them into the second row at positions 5-7. \n\nBut this is not generalizable. \n\nAlternatively, the code could be:\n\n- For the second row, iterate through each column, and if the column is in the selected rows, take the value from the selected row. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write code that takes every fourth row (rows 1,5,9 in 0-based) and for each of those rows, the non-zero values are placed in the second row. \n\nBut how to do that. \n\nAlternatively, the code could be:\n\n- The output's second row is the combination of the non-zero values from the rows that are every fourth row. \n\nBut how to determine which rows to take. \n\nMaybe the code is as follows: \n\nFor the output's second row, take the non-zero values from rows that are in positions 1,5,9 (1-based), which are 0,4,8 in 0-based. \n\nSo for each of these rows, we take the non-zero values and add them to the second row. \n\nBut in Example 1, the non-zero values from these rows are [2,2,3], [2,2,3], [2,2,3]. So combined, they would be [2,2,3,2,2,3,2,2,3], but the output's second row is [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,0,0,0,0]. \n\nThis suggests that the non-zero values are placed in the middle of the row. \n\nMaybe the code is taking the non-zero values from the selected rows and placing them in the second row, but only in the positions where they appear. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write code that takes the rows that are every fourth row (rows 1,5,9 in 1-based, which are 0,4,8 in 0-based) and for each of these rows, take the non-zero values and place them in the second row, but shifted to the right by 4 positions. \n\nSo for each row in the selected rows, we take the non-zero values and shift them to the right by 4. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nFor example, in row 1 (0-based), the non-zero values are at positions 1,2,3. Shifting right by 4 would put them at positions 5,6,7. \n\nSo the code could be:\n\nselected_rows = [1,5,9]  # assuming 0-based\n\nfor row in selected_rows:\n    for col in range(13):\n        if grid[row][col] != 0:\n            # shift by 4\n            new_col = col + 4\n            if new_col < 13:\n                output_row[new_col] = grid[row][col]\n\nBut this would place the non-zero values in the output's second row at positions col +4. \n\nBut in Example 1, this would work. \n\nLet's test this for Example 1:\n\nRow 1: [0, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nFor each column in this row:\n\ncol=1: value 2 \u2192 new_col=5 \u2192 output_row[5] = 2\ncol=2: value 2 \u2192 new_col=6 \u2192 output_row[6] = 2\ncol=3: value 3 \u2192 new_col=7 \u2192 output_row[7] = 3\nOther columns are 0, so no change.\n\nRow 5: [0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\ncol=2 \u2192 new_col=6 \u2192 but output_row[6] is already 2. So it would overwrite. But in the example, the output_row[6] is 2, which is correct. \n\ncol=3 \u2192 new_col=7 \u2192 already 3. \n\ncol=4 \u2192 new_col=8 \u2192 output_row[8] = 3.\n\nRow 9: [0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\ncol=3 \u2192 new_col=7 \u2192 already 3. \n\ncol=4 \u2192 new_col=8 \u2192 already 3. \n\ncol=5 \u2192 new_col=9 \u2192 output_row[9] = 3. \n\nSo the output_row would have values at positions 5,6,7,8,9. But the example's output has 2,2,3 in positions 5-7. \n\nThis suggests that this approach is not correct. \n\nBut in the example, the output_row has 2,2,3 at positions 5-7, but according to this code, there are more values. \n\nHmm. So this approach may not be correct. \n\nBut maybe the code is supposed to take the first occurrence of non-zero values in the selected rows. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should take the non-zero values from the selected rows and place them in the output's second row, but only in the first occurrence of each column. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nThe output is 3 rows. The first and third are all zeros. The second row is derived from every fourth row of the input, and for each of these rows, the non-zero values are placed in the second row, shifted to the right by 4 columns. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid\n    output = [[0]*13 for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Process the second row\n    # Take every fourth row (rows 1,5,9 in 1-based, which are 0,4,8 in 0-based)\n    for row in [1, 5, 9]:\n        for col in range(13):\n            if grid[row][col] != 0:\n                new_col = col + 4\n                if new_col < 13:\n                    output[1][new_col] = grid[row][col]\n    \n    return output\n\nBut this may not work for the examples. \n\nIn Example 1, this code would process rows 1,5,9. \n\nFor row 1, col 1: new_col 5 \u2192 output[1][5] = 2\ncol 2: new_col 6 \u2192 2\ncol 3: new_col 7 \u2192 3\nSo output[1][5-7] = 2,2,3. \n\nFor row 5, col 2: new_col 6 \u2192 2 (overwriting previous 2)\ncol 3: new_col 7 \u2192 2 (overwriting previous 3)\ncol 4: new_col 8 \u2192 3\nSo output[1][6] is 2, [7] is 2, [8] is 3.\n\nFor row 9, col 3: new_col 7 \u2192 2 (overwriting previous 2)\ncol 4: new_col 8 \u2192 2 (overwriting previous 3)\ncol 5: new_col 9 \u2192 3.\n\nSo the output[1] would be:\n\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 0, 0, 0]. \n\nBut the correct output for Example 1 is [0,0,0,0,0,2,2,3,0,0,0,0,0]. So this code would not produce the correct output. \n\nThis suggests that the approach is incorrect. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the non-zero values are placed in the second row, but only in the first occurrence of each column. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this code, even if it's not perfect, as it's the best I can do based on the examples.\n"
