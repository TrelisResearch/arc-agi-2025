The output grid seems to have regions where values are increased from 1 to 2, but only in certain positions.\n2. The transformation appears to be related to the shape and position of the 1s in the input grid.\n3. The transformation seems to be a form of \"expansion\" or \"growth\" of the 1s, but only in specific patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that increases values

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid seems to have regions where values are increased from 1 to 2, but only in certain positions.\n2. The transformation appears to be related to the shape and position of the 1s in the input grid.\n3. The transformation seems to be a form of \"expansion\" or \"growth\" of the 1s, but only in specific patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that increases values from 1 to 2 in certain positions, based on the shape and position of the 1s in the input grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the
