There's also a pattern of replacing 1s with 8s in certain shapes and positions, particularly in the middle and around certain structures.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n1. Replacing certain patterns of 1s with 8s\n2. Replacing certain patterns of 8s with 1s\n3. Maintaining 0s in their original positions\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the pattern to search for (a cross shape with 1s)\n    pattern = [\n        [1, 1, 1],\n        [1, 0, 1],\n        [1, 1, 1]\n    ]\n    \n    # Define the pattern to replace with (a cross shape with 8s)\n    replacement = [\n        [8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 0, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8]\n    ]\n    \n    # Define the pattern to search for (a cross shape with 8s)\n    pattern_8 = [\n        [8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 0, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8]\n    ]\n    \n    # Define the pattern to replace with (a cross shape with 1s)\n    replacement_8 = [\n        [1, 1, 1],\n        [1, 0, 1],\n        [1, 1, 1]\n    ]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(24):\n        for j in range(28):\n            # Check if the current cell is part of a pattern\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Check if the pattern is present starting at (i,j)\n                if (i+2 < 24 and j+2 < 28 and\n                    all(grid[i+di][j+dj] == pattern[di][dj] for di in range(3) for dj in range(3))):\n                    # Replace the pattern with the replacement\n                    for di in range(3):\n                        for dj in range(3):\n                            transformed_grid[i+di][j+dj] = replacement[di][dj]\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Check if the pattern is present starting at (i,j)\n                if (i+2 < 24 and j+2 < 28 and\n                    all(grid[i+di][j+dj] == pattern_8[di][dj] for di in range(3) for dj in range(3))):\n                    # Replace the pattern with the replacement\n                    for di in range(3):\n                        for dj in range(3):\n                            transformed_grid[i+di][j+dj] = replacement_8[di][dj]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the pattern to search for (a cross shape with 1s)\n    pattern = [\n        [1, 1, 1],\n        [1, 0, 1],\n        [1, 1, 1]\n    ]\n    \n    # Define the pattern to replace with (a cross shape with 8s)\n    replacement = [\n        [8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 0, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8]\n    ]\n    \n    # Define the pattern to search for (a cross shape with 8s)\n    pattern_8 = [\n        [8, 8, 8],\n        [8, 0, 8],\n        [8, 8, 8]\n    ]\n    \n    # Define the pattern to replace with (a cross shape with 1s)\n    replacement_8 = [\n        [1, 1, 1],\n        [1, 0, 1],\n        [1, 1, 1]\n    ]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(24):\n        for j in range(28):\n            # Check if the current cell is part of a pattern\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Check if the pattern is present starting at (i,j)\n                if (i+2 < 24 and j+2 < 28 and\n                    all(grid[i+di][j+dj] == pattern[di][dj] for di in range(3) for dj in range(3))):\n                    # Replace the pattern with the replacement\n                    for di in range(3):\n                        for dj in range(3):\n                            transformed_grid[i+di][j+dj] = replacement[di][dj]\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Check if the pattern is present starting at (i,j)\n                if (i+2 < 24 and j+2 < 28 and\n                    all(grid[i+di][j+dj] == pattern_8[di][dj] for di in range(3) for dj in range(3))):\n                    # Replace the pattern with the replacement\n                    for di in range(3):\n                        for dj in range(3):\n                            transformed_grid[i+di][j+dj] = replacement_8[di][dj]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
