In Example 1, the numbers 2 and 8 seem to be replicated in specific patterns, especially in rows where they appear.\n2. In Example 2, numbers like 4 and 3 appear in specific positions and are replicated in a pattern.\n3. In Example 3, the number 8 appears in a specific pattern and is replicated in a certain way.\n4. There seems to be a pattern where certain numbers are replicated in a grid pattern, especially in rows where they appear.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replicating certain numbers in specific patterns, especially when they appear in certain positions.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

The transformation seems to involve spreading or expanding certain numbers (like 2, 3, 8) in specific patterns.\n2. Numbers like 2 and 3 appear to be spread out in a way that forms horizontal and vertical lines.\n3. Numbers like 8 appear to be spread out in a more scattered pattern.\n4. The transformation seems to involve replacing 0s with other numbers in specific patterns based on their positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads numbers in a way that matches the patterns observed in the training examples.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the size of the output grid\n    output_size = (16, 22)\n    \n    # Create a 2D array to track which cells to modify\n    modify_mask = [[False for _ in range(22)] for _ in range(16)]\n    \n    # Spread 2s in horizontal lines\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Spread 2s in horizontal lines\n                if j % 3 == 0:\n                    for k in range(3):\n                        if i + k < 16 and j + k < 22:\n                            modify_mask[i + k][j + k] = True\n    \n    # Spread 3s in horizontal lines\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Spread 3s in horizontal lines\n                if j % 3 == 0:\n                    for k in range(3):\n                        if i + k < 16 and j + k < 22:\n                            modify_mask[i + k][j + k] = True\n    \n    # Spread 8s in scattered pattern\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Spread 8s in scattered pattern\n                if j % 4 == 0:\n                    for k in range(4):\n                        if i + k < 16 and j + k < 22:\n                            modify_mask[i + k][j + k] = True\n    \n    # Apply the transformation\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if modify_mask[i][j]:\n                # Replace 0s with the corresponding number\n                if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the size of the output grid\n    output_size = (16, 22)\n    \n    # Create a 2D array to track which cells to modify\n    modify_mask = [[False for _ in range(22)] for _ in range(16)]\n    \n    # Spread 2s in horizontal lines\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Spread 2s in horizontal lines\n                if j % 3 == 0:\n                    for k in range(3):\n                        if i + k < 16 and j + k < 22:\n                            modify_mask[i + k][j + k] = True\n    \n    # Spread 3s in horizontal lines\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Spread 3s in horizontal lines\n                if j % 3 == 0:\n                    for k in range(3):\n                        if i + k < 16 and j + k < 22:\n                            modify_mask[i + k][j + k] = True\n    \n    # Spread 8s in scattered pattern\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Spread 8s in scattered pattern\n                if j % 4 == 0:\n                    for k in range(4):\n                        if i + k < 16 and j + k < 22:\n                            modify_mask[i + k][j + k] = True\n    \n    # Apply the transformation\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if modify_mask[i][j]:\n                # Replace 0s with the corresponding number\n                if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
