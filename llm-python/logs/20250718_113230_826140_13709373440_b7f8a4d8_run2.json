There appears to be a pattern where certain values (like 2, 3, 4) are replaced with other values based on their surrounding cells.\n3. There are patterns where specific values are replaced with 3 or 8 in certain positions.\n4. There seems to be a pattern where certain cells are modified based on the values in their immediate neighbors.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that modifies certain cells based on their neighbors.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

There appears to be a pattern where certain values (like 2, 3, 4) are replaced with other values based on their surrounding cells.\n3. There are patterns where specific values are replaced with 3 or 8 in certain positions.\n4. There seems to be a pattern where certain cells are modified based on the values in their immediate neighbors.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that modifies certain cells based on their neighbors.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
