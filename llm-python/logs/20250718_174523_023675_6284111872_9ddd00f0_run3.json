The output seems to be a transformation of the input grid where certain patterns are flipped or mirrored.\n2. In Example 1, the output seems to have a mirrored pattern in some rows.\n3. In Example 2, the output seems to have a pattern where certain elements are flipped or rotated.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that mirrors the grid horizontally and applies some pattern-based transformations.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Mirror the grid horizontally\n    for i in range(11):\n        for j in range(5, 11):\n            transformed_grid[i][j], transformed_grid[i][11 - j - 1] = transformed_grid[i][11 - j - 1], transformed_grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Apply some pattern-based transformations\n    for i in range(11):\n        for j in range(11):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Flip the value to 0 if it's in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                # Flip the value to 0 if it's in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
