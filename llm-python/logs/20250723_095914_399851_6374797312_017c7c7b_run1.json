    "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find a pattern that maps input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the output grid is always 9x3, while the input grids are 6x3. This suggests that the input grid is being transformed in a way that expands it to 9 rows.\n\nLooking at the values, I notice that the output grid seems to be replacing certain values with 2. For example, in Example 1, the input has 1s and 0s, and the output has 2s in certain positions.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n1. The output grid is always 9 rows high and 3 columns wide\n2. The input grid is 6 rows high and 3 columns wide\n3. The output grid seems to be a transformation of the input grid, possibly by expanding it or applying some pattern\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves expanding the input grid to 9 rows by repeating or extending the pattern in some way, and replacing certain values with 2.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The output grid is always 9x3\n    transformed_grid = []\n    \n    # The input grid is 6x3, so we need to expand it to 9x3\n    # I'll repeat the input grid's rows to reach 9 rows\n    # For the first 3 rows, we use the input rows as is\n    # For the next 3 rows, we repeat the first 3 rows\n    # For the last 3 rows, we repeat the first 3 rows again\n    \n    # First 3 rows: original input rows\n    for i in range(3):\n        transformed_grid.append(grid[i])\n    \n    # Next 3 rows: repeat the first 3 rows\n    for i in range(3):\n        transformed_grid.append(grid[i])\n    \n    # Last 3 rows: repeat the first 3 rows again\n    for i in range(3):\n        transformed_grid.append(grid[i])\n    \n    # Replace all 1s with 2s\n    for row in transformed_grid:\n        for i in range(3):\n            if row[i] == 1:\n                row[i] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
