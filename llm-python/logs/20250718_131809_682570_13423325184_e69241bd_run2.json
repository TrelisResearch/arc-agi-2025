          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 9x9 grid. The output is also 9x9. Let me compare some cells. For instance, the first row of input is 5 0 6 0 5 0 0 5 0. The output first row is 5 6 6 6 5 0 0 5 8. Hmm, so the first cell is the same (5). The second cell in input is 0, but in output it's 6. The third cell is 6 in input, but in output it's 6. Wait, maybe there's some kind of propagation or replacement based on neighboring cells?\n\nLooking at the first row of input and output. The output seems to have some numbers that are higher than the input. For example, the second cell in input is 0, but in output it's 6. Maybe there's a rule where if a cell is 0, it's replaced by some value based on surrounding cells. But how?\n\nLooking at the first row of input, the output's second cell is 6. The third cell is 6. The fourth cell is 6. The fifth is 5. The sixth is 0. The seventh is 0. The eighth is 5. The ninth is 8. Wait, maybe the output is replacing zeros with some value based on adjacent cells. Let me check the original input's first row. The first row is [5, 0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]. The output first row is [5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8]. So the second cell in input is 0, and in output it's 6. The third cell is 6 (same as input). The fourth is 0, output is 6. The fifth is 5 (same). The sixth is 0, output is 0. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, the sixth cell in input is 0, output is 0. But the seventh cell is 0 in input and 0 in output. The ninth cell is 0 in input and 8 in output. Hmm, that's a big difference. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by some kind of transformation where certain cells are replaced based on their neighbors. Let me check other examples. For example, in Example 2, the input is:\n\n5 1 0 5 0 5 0 0 5\n5 0 0 5 0 3 5 0 5\n0 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0\n0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 0\n5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5\n0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 0\n0 7 0 5 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 5\n0 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0\n\nThe output is:\n\n5 1 1 5 3 5 0 0 5\n5 1 1 5 3 3 5 0 5\n0 5 5 0 5 3 5 0 0\n0 0 5 0 5 3 3 5 0\n5 0 0 5 3 3 3 3 5\n7 5 5 0 5 5 3 5 0\n7 7 7 5 0 0 5 0 0\n7 7 5 0 5 5 0 0 5\n7 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0\n\nLooking at the first row of input and output. The input's first row is 5 1 0 5 0 5 0 0 5. The output is 5 1 1 5 3 5 0 0 5. So the third cell in input is 0, and in output it's 1. The fifth cell is 0 in input, output is 3. The fourth cell is 5 in input, same in output. The sixth cell is 5 in input, same in output. The seventh is 0, same as output. The ninth is 5, same as input. So maybe the third cell in input is replaced with 1, and fifth with 3. How does that happen?\n\nLooking at the third cell in input (row 0, column 2) is 0. The output is 1. Maybe the value is determined by some rule based on neighboring cells. Let me check the cells around it. The cell to the left is 1 (input), the cell to the right is 5. The cell above is nothing (since it's the first row). Maybe it's looking at the cells in the same row or column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing zeros with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row or column. But that might not fit. For example, in the first row of input, the third cell is 0. The first non-zero to the left is 1 (cell (0,1)), but in the output, the third cell is 1. So that's possible. But then the fifth cell in input is 0. The first non-zero in the row is 5 (cell (0,3)), but in output it's 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of propagation where certain cells are replaced with values based on their neighbors. For example, in Example 1, the first row of input has a 0 in column 1. The output for that cell is 6. Looking at the input's first row, the cells around it are 5 (left), 6 (right), 5 (column 4). Maybe the value is determined by the sum of surrounding cells divided by something, but that seems complicated.\n\nLooking at Example 2's first row: the third cell is 0, output is 1. The cell to the left is 1, the cell to the right is 5. The cell above is nothing. The cell below is row 1, column 2 is 0. Maybe it's looking for the nearest non-zero cell in the same row or column. For example, the third cell in input is 0. The cell to the left is 1. So maybe it's replacing with 1. But in the fifth cell (input is 0), the cell to the left is 5 (cell (0,4) is 0?), wait the input first row is 5 1 0 5 0 5 0 0 5. So the fifth cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5 (column 3), and to the right is 5 (column 5). So maybe the value is 5? But in output, it's 3. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The 0s in the input are being replaced by some values. The first row's sixth cell is 0 in input, output is 0. Wait, but the ninth cell is 0 in input and 8 in output. That's a big difference. So maybe the rule is not straightforward.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input is a 7x7 grid, but the output is 7x7. The input's first row is 0 0 5 0 0 5 0. The output is 0 0 5 4 4 5 0. So the fourth and fifth cells are 0 in input, but in output they are 4. The third cell is 5 in input and same in output. The sixth cell is 5 in input and same in output. The seventh is 0 in input and same in output. So maybe the fourth and fifth cells are being replaced with 4. How?\n\nLooking at the input's fourth row (row 3) is 0 5 0 5 0 5 0. The output's fourth row is 4 5 4 5 8 5 0. So the first cell is 0 in input, output is 4. The third cell is 0 in input, output is 4. The fifth cell is 0 in input, output is 8. Hmm. So maybe the value is determined by the surrounding cells. For example, in the fourth row, the first cell is 0. The cell to the right is 5. The cell below is row 4, column 0 is 5. So maybe it's looking for the nearest non-zero cell in the same row or column and taking that value. But in this case, the first cell is 0. The cell to the right is 5. So maybe the value is 5, but in the output it's 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by some kind of pattern where cells are replaced based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. But that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left or above, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The second row is 0 5 6 5 5 5 0 5 8. The third row is 5 6 6 6 6 5 5 8 8. The fourth row is 0 5 6 5 6 5 8 8 5. The fifth row is 0 5 5 6 6 6 5 8 5. The sixth row is 5 0 5 5 5 5 8 8 5. The seventh row is 5 0 0 0 5 5 8 5 0. The eighth row is 0 5 5 5 0 0 5 0 0. The ninth row is 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 0.\n\nLooking at the output, there are some repeated numbers. For example, in the first row, the second, third, and fourth cells are 6. Maybe these are being filled based on some rule. Let me check the input's first row again. The input's first row is 5 0 6 0 5 0 0 5 0. So the third cell is 6. The output's second, third, and fourth cells are 6. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 6s if there's a 6 in the same row or column. But that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing 0s with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row. For example, in the first row of input, the first non-zero is 5 (cell 0,0). But in the output, the second cell is 6. That doesn't fit. Wait, the third cell in input is 6, so maybe the 0s are replaced with the value of the nearest non-zero cell in the same row or column. For example, the second cell in input is 0. The nearest non-zero to the left is 5 (cell 0,0), to the right is 6 (cell 0,2). So maybe it's taking the value of the first non-zero to the left or right. But in this case, the output is 6. So maybe that's the case. But how to determine which one to take.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing 0s with the value of the cell in the same column, but in the same row. For example, in the first row's second cell (0), the cell in the same column (column 1) is 0 in input. But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of matrix transformation, like a convolution or a filter. But that's more complex.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the first row's third cell is 1. The input's third cell is 0. The cell to the left is 1, the cell to the right is 5. So maybe the value is taken from the left. But in the fifth cell of the first row, the input is 0. The cell to the left is 5 (cell 0,3), and the cell to the right is 5 (cell 0,5). So maybe the value is 5, but in the output it's 3. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the sum of the surrounding cells. For example, the cell in the first row, second column (input 0) has neighbors to the left (1), right (5), above (nothing), below (row 1, column 1 is 0). The sum would be 1 + 5 = 6. But the output is 6. That fits. Then the fifth cell (input 0) has neighbors to the left (5), right (5), and below (row 1, column 4 is 0). The sum is 5 + 5 = 10. But the output is 3. That doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of pattern where 0s are replaced with the value of the cell in the same row or column that is closest to them. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the second cell (0) is replaced with 6, which is the value of the cell to the right (third cell). But the third cell is 6, so that's possible. The fourth cell in the first row is 0, and the fifth cell is 5. But the output is 6. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing zeros with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row. For example, in the first row of input, the first non-zero is 5 (cell 0,0). So if the cell is 0, replace with 5. But in the first row of output, the second cell is 6, which is not 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the output has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The 6s appear in the second, third, fourth positions. Maybe those positions are being filled based on the value of the cell to the left. For example, the second cell is 6, which is the same as the third cell. But the third cell is 6 in input. So maybe that's not helpful.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input's first row is 0 0 5 0 0 5 0. The output is 0 0 5 4 4 5 0. So the fourth and fifth cells are 0 in input, replaced with 4 and 4. The third cell is 5, same as input. The sixth is 5, same. The seventh is 0. So maybe the fourth and fifth cells are being replaced with 4, which is the value of the cell in the same column. For example, in column 3, the input's first row is 0. The cell in column 3, row 3 (fourth row of input) is 5. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the cell in the same column but in the next row. For example, in the fourth row of input, column 3 is 5. So in the first row, column 3 is 0, replaced with 4. But why 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing 0s with the value of the cell in the same row, but to the right, if it's non-zero. For example, in the first row of input, the second cell is 0. The third cell is 6. So replace with 6. The fourth cell is 0, the fifth is 5. So replace with 5. But in the output, the fourth cell is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of pattern where 0s are replaced with the value of the cell in the same row, but to the left or right, whichever is closer. For example, in the first row of input, the second cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5, to the right is 6. The closest non-zero is to the right (distance 1), so replace with 6. The fourth cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5 (distance 1), to the right is 5 (distance 1). So maybe replace with 5, but in the output it's 6. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row's ninth cell is 8. The input's ninth cell is 0. So maybe that's a special case. How is 8 determined?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the sum of the cell's row and column indices. But that's unlikely since the values are between 0-9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the first row's second, third, fourth cells are 6. The fifth is 5. The ninth is 8. Maybe the 6s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like positions where the column is even or odd. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values and some transformation that replaces 0s with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row or column. For example, in Example 1's first row, the first non-zero is 5 (cell 0,0). But the second cell is 0, which is replaced with 6. That doesn't fit. But maybe the first non-zero in the row is 5, and the first non-zero in the column is 5. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of matrix propagation. For example, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise to the right. But this is just a guess.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the first row's third cell is 1. The input's third cell is 0. The cell to the left is 1, so maybe it's replaced with that. The fifth cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5, but in the output it's 3. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the sum of the cell's row and column. For example, cell (i,j) in input is replaced with (i + j) mod 10. But that's unlikely since the values are not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on the number of non-zero cells in the row or column. For example, if there are multiple non-zero cells, replace 0s with the average or something.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to think of a possible transformation that could work for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The second row is 0 5 6 5 5 5 0 5 8. The third row is 5 6 6 6 6 5 5 8 8. The fourth row is 0 5 6 5 6 5 8 8 5. The fifth row is 0 5 5 6 6 6 5 8 5. The sixth row is 5 0 5 5 5 5 8 8 5. The seventh row is 5 0 0 0 5 5 8 5 0. The eighth row is 0 5 5 5 0 0 5 0 0. The ninth row is 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 0.\n\nLooking at the output, there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced with 6, 5, 8, etc. It's possible that the transformation involves replacing 0s with the value of the cell to the left or right, or some other neighbor.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output's first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The third cell is 6, which is the same as the input. The second cell is 6. So maybe the 0s are replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row. For example, in the first row of input, the first non-zero is 5. But the second cell is 0, which is replaced with 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the sum of the cell's row and column indices. For example, if the cell is in row i, column j, then the value is (i + j) mod 10. But that would not fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values, and for each cell, if it's zero, replace it with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's zero, then the cell to the right, etc. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, input is [5, 0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]. The second cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5. So replace with 5. But the output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise to the right. For the second cell in the first row, the cell to the left is 5, so replace with 5. But the output is 6. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to multiple examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the first row's third cell is 1. The input's third cell is 0. The cell to the left is 1. So maybe it's replaced with the left cell's value. Similarly, the fifth cell in the first row is 0, and the cell to the left is 5. But in the output, it's 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is derived by replacing each 0 with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in Example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell in column 1, row 0 is 0. The cell above is nothing. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of matrix transformation where each 0 is replaced with the value of the cell in the same row, but to the left, if it's non-zero. If that's zero, then to the right. Let's try this for Example 1's first row. The second cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5, so replace with 5. But the output is 6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the closest non-zero cell in the same row or column. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the second cell is 0. The closest non-zero to the left is 5 (distance 1), to the right is 6 (distance 1). So maybe take the average? 5 and 6 average to 5.5, which is not 6. So that's not helpful.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 2's output, the third row is 0 5 5 0 5 3 5 0 0. The input's third row is 0 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0. So the sixth cell in input is 0, and in output it's 3. The cell to the left is 5, to the right is 5. So maybe it's based on some rule involving the cells around it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of matrix transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the cell in the same row, but shifted by some amount. For example, if the cell is 0, replace with the value of the cell in the same row, but to the right, if it's non-zero. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a rule where each 0 is replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but if that cell is in the same column, then replace with that value. For example, in Example 1's first row, the first non-zero is 5. The second cell is 0. So replace with 5. But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for a different approach. Let me think of the output as a transformation that replaces zeros with some value based on their position or neighboring cells. Let's consider that for each cell in the input grid, if it's zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or to the right, or above, or below. But how to determine which one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the sum of the cell's row and column. For example, if the sum is even, replace with 6, if odd, replace with 5. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the cell in the same row, but shifted by one. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the input is [5, 0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]. The output is [5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8]. So the second cell is 6, which is the same as the third cell. The fourth cell is 6, which is the same as the third cell. So maybe the 0s are replaced with the value of the next non-zero cell in the row. For example, the second cell is 0, and the next non-zero is 6 (third cell), so replace with 6. The fourth cell is 0, next non-zero is 5 (fifth cell), but in the output it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the first non-zero cell to the left or right, whichever is closer. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the second cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5 (distance 1), to the right is 6 (distance 1). So maybe it's replaced with 6, which is the value to the right. The fourth cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5 (distance 1), to the right is 5 (distance 1). So replace with 5, but in the output it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a kind of propagation where zeros are replaced with the value of the nearest non-zero cell in the same row or column. But how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a rule where each 0 is replaced with the value of the cell in the same column, but in the row above. For example, in Example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell in the same column (column 1) in the row above is nothing (since it's the first row). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of pattern where the value of the cell is the sum of the cell's row and column indices. For example, cell (i,j) in output is (i + j) % 10. But that would not fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of matrix transformation, like a convolution with a kernel. But without knowing the kernel, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's output, the first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The third row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 8, 8. The fourth row has 0, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 8, 8, 5. The fifth row has 0, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 8, 5. The sixth row has 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 5. The seventh row has 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 8, 5, 0. The eighth row has 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0. The ninth row has 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0.\n\nLooking at these rows, there seems to be a pattern where certain cells are replaced with 6, 5, 8, etc. For example, in the first row, the second, third, and fourth cells are 6. In the third row, the second, third, and fourth cells are 6. In the fourth row, the third cell is 6. In the fifth row, the third cell is 5. This suggests that the transformation is not based on row or column indices, but on some other pattern.\n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and some kind of propagation where zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row or column. But how to determine which one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of rule where each zero is replaced with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise to the right, and so on. For example, in the first row of Example 1:\n\nInput: [5, 0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\nProcessing each cell:\n\n- First cell is 5, remains 5.\n- Second cell is 0. To the left is 5, so replace with 5. But output is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n- Third cell is 6, remains 6.\n- Fourth cell is 0. To the left is 6, so replace with 6. Output is 6. That fits.\n- Fifth cell is 5, remains 5.\n- Sixth cell is 0. To the left is 5, replace with 5. Output is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n- Seventh cell is 0. To the left is 5, replace with 5. Output is 0. No.\n- Eighth cell is 5, remains 5.\n- Ninth cell is 0. To the left is 5, replace with 5. Output is 8. No.\n\nThis doesn't fit. But the ninth cell in the output is 8, which is not 5. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is based on the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in Example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell in column 1, row 0 is 0. The cell above is nothing. So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the cell in the same row, but shifted by one. For example, the second cell is replaced with the value of the third cell. But in the first row, the third cell is 6, so the second cell becomes 6. The fourth cell is 0, replaced with the value of the fifth cell (5). But in the output, the fourth cell is 6, not 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the test input and see if there's any pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 5 0 3 0 5 0\n5 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0\n0 8 5 5 0 5 0 5 0\n0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 5\n5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0\n5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 5\n0 5 0 0 5 0 5 5 0\n0 0 5 5 0 6 0 0 5\n\nThe output is not given, but I need to write a transformation that works for the training examples.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look for a pattern where zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left or right in the same row. For example, if a cell is zero, replace it with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left, or if none, then to the right. If both are non-zero, choose the one with the smaller value, or something.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The first non-zero to the left is 5 (cell 0,0). The first non-zero to the right is 6 (cell 0,2). So maybe replace with 6. The fourth cell is 0. The first non-zero to the left is 5 (cell 0,3 is 0, so the first non-zero to the left is cell 0,3? No, cell 0,3 is 0. Wait, the fourth cell is at index 3. The cells to the left are 5 (cell 0,0), 0 (cell 0,1), 6 (cell 0,2), and then cell 0,3 is 0. So the first non-zero to the left is 6 (cell 0,2). So replace with 6. The fifth cell is 5, so remains 5. The sixth cell is 0. The first non-zero to the left is 5 (cell 0,4), so replace with 5. But in the output, the sixth cell is 0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first non-zero to the left or right is chosen, and if both exist, the one with the higher value is chosen. For example, the second cell is 0. Left is 5, right is 6. Choose 6. Fourth cell is 0. Left is 6, right is 5. Choose 6. Sixth cell is 0. Left is 5, right is 0. So choose 5. But in the output, sixth cell is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to look for a pattern where each zero is replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's zero, then to the right, and so on.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Let's assume that for each cell in the input, if it's zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, if that's non-zero, otherwise to the right, and so on.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\nif grid[i][j] is 0, then look to the left in the same row. If there's a non-zero value, replace with that. If not, look to the right in the same row. If there's a non-zero value, replace with that. If not, look up or down in the same column. If not, leave as 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this for Example 1's first row.\n\nFirst row: [5, 0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\nFor the second cell (0,1), it's 0. Look to the left (cell 0,0 is 5). Replace with 5. But in the output it's 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the value of the cell to the right. For the second cell, the right is 6. So replace with 6. For the fourth cell (0,3), the right is 5 (cell 0,4). But in the output it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise to the right if it's non-zero, otherwise the cell above or below. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell, if it's 0, replace it with the value of the cell to the left in the same row, if that's non-zero. Otherwise, replace with the value of the cell to the right in the same row. If both are zero, then look up or down in the same column.\n\nThis is a possible approach, but I'll implement it and see if it fits the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's first row:\n\nSecond cell (0,1) is 0. Left is 5 (non-zero), so replace with 5. But output is 6. So this doesn't fit. But maybe the rule is to look for the first non-zero to the left or right, and if both exist, choose the one with the higher value.\n\nFor the second cell, left is 5, right is 6. Choose 6. So replace with 6. For the fourth cell (0,3), left is 6 (cell 0,2), right is 5 (cell 0,4). Choose 6. So replace with 6. For the sixth cell (0,5), left is 5 (cell 0,4), right is 0. So replace with 5. But in the output, it's 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is not working. Maybe the rule is to replace with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise the cell to the right, and if both are zero, then the cell above or below.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess. Given that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces zeros with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row, and if that's zero, then to the right, and so on.\n\nLet's implement this.\n\nThe code would look something like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(9):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Look to the left in the same row\n                found = False\n                for k in range(j-1, -1, -1):\n                    if transformed[i][k] != 0:\n                        transformed[i][j] = transformed[i][k]\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                if not found:\n                    # Look to the right in the same row\n                    for k in range(j+1, 9):\n                        if transformed[i][k] != 0:\n                            transformed[i][j] = transformed[i][k]\n                            found = True\n                            break\n                if not found:\n                    # Look up in the same column\n                    for k in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n                        if transformed[k][j] != 0:\n                            transformed[i][j] = transformed[k][j]\n                            found = True\n                            break\n                if not found:\n                    # Look down in the same column\n                    for k in range(i+1, 9):\n                        if transformed[k][j] != 0:\n                            transformed[i][j] = transformed[k][j]\n                            found = True\n                            break\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this with Example 1's first row.\n\nFor the second cell (0,1), the code would look to the left (j=0, value 5). So transformed[0][1] becomes 5. But in the output, it's 6. So this doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe the code should look for the first non-zero in the same row, but in the case where there are multiple non-zeros, it replaces with the first one encountered. But in Example 1, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should replace with the value of the first non-zero in the same row, but if that's not possible, then the first non-zero in the same column.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find the correct pattern, I'll have to proceed with this approach, even if it doesn't fit all examples. It's possible that the correct pattern is this, and I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell in the same row, but shifted by one. For example, if the cell is 0, replace with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's also 0, then to the right, and so on.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nIn the end, I'll proceed with writing a function that replaces zeros with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row, or to the right if not found, and so on. This is the best I can do given the time I've spent.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 9x9 grid. The output is also 9x9. Let me compare some cells. For instance, the first row of input is 5 0 6 0 5 0 0 5 0. The output first row is 5 6 6 6 5 0 0 5 8. Hmm, so the first cell is the same (5). The second cell in input is 0, but in output it's 6. The third cell is 6 in input, but in output it's 6. Wait, maybe there's some kind of propagation or replacement based on neighboring cells?\n\nLooking at the first row of input and output. The output seems to have some numbers that are higher than the input. For example, the second cell in input is 0, but in output it's 6. Maybe there's a rule where if a cell is 0, it's replaced by some value based on surrounding cells. But how?\n\nLooking at the first row of input, the output's second cell is 6. The third cell is 6. The fourth cell is 6. The fifth is 5. The sixth is 0. The seventh is 0. The eighth is 5. The ninth is 8. Wait, maybe the output is replacing zeros with some value based on adjacent cells. Let me check the original input's first row. The first row is [5, 0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]. The output first row is [5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8]. So the second cell in input is 0, and in output it's 6. The third cell is 6 (same as input). The fourth is 0, output is 6. The fifth is 5 (same). The sixth is 0, output is 0. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, the sixth cell in input is 0, output is 0. But the seventh cell is 0 in input and 0 in output. The ninth cell is 0 in input and 8 in output. Hmm, that's a big difference. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by some kind of transformation where certain cells are replaced based on their neighbors. Let me check other examples. For example, in Example 2, the input is:\n\n5 1 0 5 0 5 0 0 5\n5 0 0 5 0 3 5 0 5\n0 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0\n0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 0\n5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5\n0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 0\n0 7 0 5 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 5\n0 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0\n\nThe output is:\n\n5 1 1 5 3 5 0 0 5\n5 1 1 5 3 3 5 0 5\n0 5 5 0 5 3 5 0 0\n0 0 5 0 5 3 3 5 0\n5 0 0 5 3 3 3 3 5\n7 5 5 0 5 5 3 5 0\n7 7 7 5 0 0 5 0 0\n7 7 5 0 5 5 0 0 5\n7 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0\n\nLooking at the first row of input and output. The input's first row is 5 1 0 5 0 5 0 0 5. The output is 5 1 1 5 3 5 0 0 5. So the third cell in input is 0, and in output it's 1. The fifth cell is 0 in input, output is 3. The fourth cell is 5 in input, same in output. The sixth cell is 5 in input, same in output. The seventh is 0, same as output. The ninth is 5, same as input. So maybe the third cell in input is replaced with 1, and fifth with 3. How does that happen?\n\nLooking at the third cell in input (row 0, column 2) is 0. The output is 1. Maybe the value is determined by some rule based on neighboring cells. Let me check the cells around it. The cell to the left is 1 (input), the cell to the right is 5. The cell above is nothing (since it's the first row). Maybe it's looking at the cells in the same row or column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing zeros with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row or column. But that might not fit. For example, in the first row of input, the third cell is 0. The first non-zero to the left is 1 (cell (0,1)), but in the output, the third cell is 1. So that's possible. But then the fifth cell in input is 0. The first non-zero in the row is 5 (cell (0,3)), but in output it's 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of propagation where certain cells are replaced with values based on their neighbors. For example, in Example 1, the first row of input has a 0 in column 1. The output for that cell is 6. Looking at the input's first row, the cells around it are 5 (left), 6 (right), 5 (column 4). Maybe the value is determined by the sum of surrounding cells divided by something, but that seems complicated.\n\nLooking at Example 2's first row: the third cell is 0, output is 1. The cell to the left is 1, the cell to the right is 5. The cell above is nothing. The cell below is row 1, column 2 is 0. Maybe it's looking for the nearest non-zero cell in the same row or column. For example, the third cell in input is 0. The cell to the left is 1. So maybe it's replacing with 1. But in the fifth cell (input is 0), the cell to the left is 5 (cell (0,4) is 0?), wait the input first row is 5 1 0 5 0 5 0 0 5. So the fifth cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5 (column 3), and to the right is 5 (column 5). So maybe the value is 5? But in output, it's 3. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The 0s in the input are being replaced by some values. The first row's sixth cell is 0 in input, output is 0. Wait, but the ninth cell is 0 in input and 8 in output. That's a big difference. So maybe the rule is not straightforward.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input is a 7x7 grid, but the output is 7x7. The input's first row is 0 0 5 0 0 5 0. The output is 0 0 5 4 4 5 0. So the fourth and fifth cells are 0 in input, but in output they are 4. The third cell is 5 in input and same in output. The sixth cell is 5 in input and same in output. The seventh is 0 in input and same in output. So maybe the fourth and fifth cells are being replaced with 4. How?\n\nLooking at the input's fourth row (row 3) is 0 5 0 5 0 5 0. The output's fourth row is 4 5 4 5 8 5 0. So the first cell is 0 in input, output is 4. The third cell is 0 in input, output is 4. The fifth cell is 0 in input, output is 8. Hmm. So maybe the value is determined by the surrounding cells. For example, in the fourth row, the first cell is 0. The cell to the right is 5. The cell below is row 4, column 0 is 5. So maybe it's looking for the nearest non-zero cell in the same row or column and taking that value. But in this case, the first cell is 0. The cell to the right is 5. So maybe the value is 5, but in the output it's 4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by some kind of pattern where cells are replaced based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. But that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left or above, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The second row is 0 5 6 5 5 5 0 5 8. The third row is 5 6 6 6 6 5 5 8 8. The fourth row is 0 5 6 5 6 5 8 8 5. The fifth row is 0 5 5 6 6 6 5 8 5. The sixth row is 5 0 5 5 5 5 8 8 5. The seventh row is 5 0 0 0 5 5 8 5 0. The eighth row is 0 5 5 5 0 0 5 0 0. The ninth row is 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 0.\n\nLooking at the output, there are some repeated numbers. For example, in the first row, the second, third, and fourth cells are 6. Maybe these are being filled based on some rule. Let me check the input's first row again. The input's first row is 5 0 6 0 5 0 0 5 0. So the third cell is 6. The output's second, third, and fourth cells are 6. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 6s if there's a 6 in the same row or column. But that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing 0s with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row. For example, in the first row of input, the first non-zero is 5 (cell 0,0). But in the output, the second cell is 6. That doesn't fit. Wait, the third cell in input is 6, so maybe the 0s are replaced with the value of the nearest non-zero cell in the same row or column. For example, the second cell in input is 0. The nearest non-zero to the left is 5 (cell 0,0), to the right is 6 (cell 0,2). So maybe it's taking the value of the first non-zero to the left or right. But in this case, the output is 6. So maybe that's the case. But how to determine which one to take.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing 0s with the value of the cell in the same column, but in the same row. For example, in the first row's second cell (0), the cell in the same column (column 1) is 0 in input. But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of matrix transformation, like a convolution or a filter. But that's more complex.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the first row's third cell is 1. The input's third cell is 0. The cell to the left is 1, the cell to the right is 5. So maybe the value is taken from the left. But in the fifth cell of the first row, the input is 0. The cell to the left is 5 (cell 0,3), and the cell to the right is 5 (cell 0,5). So maybe the value is 5, but in the output it's 3. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the sum of the surrounding cells. For example, the cell in the first row, second column (input 0) has neighbors to the left (1), right (5), above (nothing), below (row 1, column 1 is 0). The sum would be 1 + 5 = 6. But the output is 6. That fits. Then the fifth cell (input 0) has neighbors to the left (5), right (5), and below (row 1, column 4 is 0). The sum is 5 + 5 = 10. But the output is 3. That doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of pattern where 0s are replaced with the value of the cell in the same row or column that is closest to them. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the second cell (0) is replaced with 6, which is the value of the cell to the right (third cell). But the third cell is 6, so that's possible. The fourth cell in the first row is 0, and the fifth cell is 5. But the output is 6. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing zeros with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row. For example, in the first row of input, the first non-zero is 5 (cell 0,0). So if the cell is 0, replace with 5. But in the first row of output, the second cell is 6, which is not 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the output has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The 6s appear in the second, third, fourth positions. Maybe those positions are being filled based on the value of the cell to the left. For example, the second cell is 6, which is the same as the third cell. But the third cell is 6 in input. So maybe that's not helpful.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input's first row is 0 0 5 0 0 5 0. The output is 0 0 5 4 4 5 0. So the fourth and fifth cells are 0 in input, replaced with 4 and 4. The third cell is 5, same as input. The sixth is 5, same. The seventh is 0. So maybe the fourth and fifth cells are being replaced with 4, which is the value of the cell in the same column. For example, in column 3, the input's first row is 0. The cell in column 3, row 3 (fourth row of input) is 5. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the cell in the same column but in the next row. For example, in the fourth row of input, column 3 is 5. So in the first row, column 3 is 0, replaced with 4. But why 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing 0s with the value of the cell in the same row, but to the right, if it's non-zero. For example, in the first row of input, the second cell is 0. The third cell is 6. So replace with 6. The fourth cell is 0, the fifth is 5. So replace with 5. But in the output, the fourth cell is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of pattern where 0s are replaced with the value of the cell in the same row, but to the left or right, whichever is closer. For example, in the first row of input, the second cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5, to the right is 6. The closest non-zero is to the right (distance 1), so replace with 6. The fourth cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5 (distance 1), to the right is 5 (distance 1). So maybe replace with 5, but in the output it's 6. Hmm.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row's ninth cell is 8. The input's ninth cell is 0. So maybe that's a special case. How is 8 determined?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the sum of the cell's row and column indices. But that's unlikely since the values are between 0-9.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the first row's second, third, fourth cells are 6. The fifth is 5. The ninth is 8. Maybe the 6s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like positions where the column is even or odd. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values and some transformation that replaces 0s with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row or column. For example, in Example 1's first row, the first non-zero is 5 (cell 0,0). But the second cell is 0, which is replaced with 6. That doesn't fit. But maybe the first non-zero in the row is 5, and the first non-zero in the column is 5. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of matrix propagation. For example, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise to the right. But this is just a guess.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the first row's third cell is 1. The input's third cell is 0. The cell to the left is 1, so maybe it's replaced with that. The fifth cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5, but in the output it's 3. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the sum of the cell's row and column. For example, cell (i,j) in input is replaced with (i + j) mod 10. But that's unlikely since the values are not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on the number of non-zero cells in the row or column. For example, if there are multiple non-zero cells, replace 0s with the average or something.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to think of a possible transformation that could work for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The second row is 0 5 6 5 5 5 0 5 8. The third row is 5 6 6 6 6 5 5 8 8. The fourth row is 0 5 6 5 6 5 8 8 5. The fifth row is 0 5 5 6 6 6 5 8 5. The sixth row is 5 0 5 5 5 5 8 8 5. The seventh row is 5 0 0 0 5 5 8 5 0. The eighth row is 0 5 5 5 0 0 5 0 0. The ninth row is 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 0.\n\nLooking at the output, there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced with 6, 5, 8, etc. It's possible that the transformation involves replacing 0s with the value of the cell to the left or right, or some other neighbor.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output's first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The third cell is 6, which is the same as the input. The second cell is 6. So maybe the 0s are replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row. For example, in the first row of input, the first non-zero is 5. But the second cell is 0, which is replaced with 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the sum of the cell's row and column indices. For example, if the cell is in row i, column j, then the value is (i + j) mod 10. But that would not fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values, and for each cell, if it's zero, replace it with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's zero, then the cell to the right, etc. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, input is [5, 0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]. The second cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5. So replace with 5. But the output is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise to the right. For the second cell in the first row, the cell to the left is 5, so replace with 5. But the output is 6. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to multiple examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the first row's third cell is 1. The input's third cell is 0. The cell to the left is 1. So maybe it's replaced with the left cell's value. Similarly, the fifth cell in the first row is 0, and the cell to the left is 5. But in the output, it's 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is derived by replacing each 0 with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in Example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell in column 1, row 0 is 0. The cell above is nothing. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of matrix transformation where each 0 is replaced with the value of the cell in the same row, but to the left, if it's non-zero. If that's zero, then to the right. Let's try this for Example 1's first row. The second cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5, so replace with 5. But the output is 6. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the closest non-zero cell in the same row or column. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the second cell is 0. The closest non-zero to the left is 5 (distance 1), to the right is 6 (distance 1). So maybe take the average? 5 and 6 average to 5.5, which is not 6. So that's not helpful.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 2's output, the third row is 0 5 5 0 5 3 5 0 0. The input's third row is 0 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0. So the sixth cell in input is 0, and in output it's 3. The cell to the left is 5, to the right is 5. So maybe it's based on some rule involving the cells around it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of matrix transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the cell in the same row, but shifted by some amount. For example, if the cell is 0, replace with the value of the cell in the same row, but to the right, if it's non-zero. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a rule where each 0 is replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row, but if that cell is in the same column, then replace with that value. For example, in Example 1's first row, the first non-zero is 5. The second cell is 0. So replace with 5. But in the output, it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for a different approach. Let me think of the output as a transformation that replaces zeros with some value based on their position or neighboring cells. Let's consider that for each cell in the input grid, if it's zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or to the right, or above, or below. But how to determine which one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the sum of the cell's row and column. For example, if the sum is even, replace with 6, if odd, replace with 5. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the cell in the same row, but shifted by one. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the input is [5, 0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]. The output is [5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8]. So the second cell is 6, which is the same as the third cell. The fourth cell is 6, which is the same as the third cell. So maybe the 0s are replaced with the value of the next non-zero cell in the row. For example, the second cell is 0, and the next non-zero is 6 (third cell), so replace with 6. The fourth cell is 0, next non-zero is 5 (fifth cell), but in the output it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the first non-zero cell to the left or right, whichever is closer. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the second cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5 (distance 1), to the right is 6 (distance 1). So maybe it's replaced with 6, which is the value to the right. The fourth cell is 0. The cell to the left is 5 (distance 1), to the right is 5 (distance 1). So replace with 5, but in the output it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a kind of propagation where zeros are replaced with the value of the nearest non-zero cell in the same row or column. But how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a rule where each 0 is replaced with the value of the cell in the same column, but in the row above. For example, in Example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell in the same column (column 1) in the row above is nothing (since it's the first row). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of pattern where the value of the cell is the sum of the cell's row and column indices. For example, cell (i,j) in output is (i + j) % 10. But that would not fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of matrix transformation, like a convolution with a kernel. But without knowing the kernel, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's output, the first row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 0, 0, 5, 8. The third row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 5, 8, 8. The fourth row has 0, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 8, 8, 5. The fifth row has 0, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6, 5, 8, 5. The sixth row has 5, 0, 5, 5, 5, 5, 8, 8, 5. The seventh row has 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 8, 5, 0. The eighth row has 0, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0. The ninth row has 0, 0, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0.\n\nLooking at these rows, there seems to be a pattern where certain cells are replaced with 6, 5, 8, etc. For example, in the first row, the second, third, and fourth cells are 6. In the third row, the second, third, and fourth cells are 6. In the fourth row, the third cell is 6. In the fifth row, the third cell is 5. This suggests that the transformation is not based on row or column indices, but on some other pattern.\n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and some kind of propagation where zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell in the same row or column. But how to determine which one.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of rule where each zero is replaced with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise to the right, and so on. For example, in the first row of Example 1:\n\nInput: [5, 0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\nProcessing each cell:\n\n- First cell is 5, remains 5.\n- Second cell is 0. To the left is 5, so replace with 5. But output is 6. So this doesn't fit.\n- Third cell is 6, remains 6.\n- Fourth cell is 0. To the left is 6, so replace with 6. Output is 6. That fits.\n- Fifth cell is 5, remains 5.\n- Sixth cell is 0. To the left is 5, replace with 5. Output is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n- Seventh cell is 0. To the left is 5, replace with 5. Output is 0. No.\n- Eighth cell is 5, remains 5.\n- Ninth cell is 0. To the left is 5, replace with 5. Output is 8. No.\n\nThis doesn't fit. But the ninth cell in the output is 8, which is not 5. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is based on the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in Example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The cell in column 1, row 0 is 0. The cell above is nothing. So that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the cell in the same row, but shifted by one. For example, the second cell is replaced with the value of the third cell. But in the first row, the third cell is 6, so the second cell becomes 6. The fourth cell is 0, replaced with the value of the fifth cell (5). But in the output, the fourth cell is 6, not 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the test input and see if there's any pattern.\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 5 0 3 0 5 0\n5 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0\n0 8 5 5 0 5 0 5 0\n0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 5\n5 0 5 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0\n5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 5\n0 5 0 0 5 0 5 5 0\n0 0 5 5 0 6 0 0 5\n\nThe output is not given, but I need to write a transformation that works for the training examples.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look for a pattern where zeros are replaced with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left or right in the same row. For example, if a cell is zero, replace it with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left, or if none, then to the right. If both are non-zero, choose the one with the smaller value, or something.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's first row, the second cell is 0. The first non-zero to the left is 5 (cell 0,0). The first non-zero to the right is 6 (cell 0,2). So maybe replace with 6. The fourth cell is 0. The first non-zero to the left is 5 (cell 0,3 is 0, so the first non-zero to the left is cell 0,3? No, cell 0,3 is 0. Wait, the fourth cell is at index 3. The cells to the left are 5 (cell 0,0), 0 (cell 0,1), 6 (cell 0,2), and then cell 0,3 is 0. So the first non-zero to the left is 6 (cell 0,2). So replace with 6. The fifth cell is 5, so remains 5. The sixth cell is 0. The first non-zero to the left is 5 (cell 0,4), so replace with 5. But in the output, the sixth cell is 0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first non-zero to the left or right is chosen, and if both exist, the one with the higher value is chosen. For example, the second cell is 0. Left is 5, right is 6. Choose 6. Fourth cell is 0. Left is 6, right is 5. Choose 6. Sixth cell is 0. Left is 5, right is 0. So choose 5. But in the output, sixth cell is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to look for a pattern where each zero is replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's zero, then to the right, and so on.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Let's assume that for each cell in the input, if it's zero, it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, if that's non-zero, otherwise to the right, and so on.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\nif grid[i][j] is 0, then look to the left in the same row. If there's a non-zero value, replace with that. If not, look to the right in the same row. If there's a non-zero value, replace with that. If not, look up or down in the same column. If not, leave as 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this for Example 1's first row.\n\nFirst row: [5, 0, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 5, 0]\n\nFor the second cell (0,1), it's 0. Look to the left (cell 0,0 is 5). Replace with 5. But in the output it's 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the value of the cell to the right. For the second cell, the right is 6. So replace with 6. For the fourth cell (0,3), the right is 5 (cell 0,4). But in the output it's 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise to the right if it's non-zero, otherwise the cell above or below. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell, if it's 0, replace it with the value of the cell to the left in the same row, if that's non-zero. Otherwise, replace with the value of the cell to the right in the same row. If both are zero, then look up or down in the same column.\n\nThis is a possible approach, but I'll implement it and see if it fits the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's first row:\n\nSecond cell (0,1) is 0. Left is 5 (non-zero), so replace with 5. But output is 6. So this doesn't fit. But maybe the rule is to look for the first non-zero to the left or right, and if both exist, choose the one with the higher value.\n\nFor the second cell, left is 5, right is 6. Choose 6. So replace with 6. For the fourth cell (0,3), left is 6 (cell 0,2), right is 5 (cell 0,4). Choose 6. So replace with 6. For the sixth cell (0,5), left is 5 (cell 0,4), right is 0. So replace with 5. But in the output, it's 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is not working. Maybe the rule is to replace with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, otherwise the cell to the right, and if both are zero, then the cell above or below.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess. Given that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces zeros with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row, and if that's zero, then to the right, and so on.\n\nLet's implement this.\n\nThe code would look something like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(9):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Look to the left in the same row\n                found = False\n                for k in range(j-1, -1, -1):\n                    if transformed[i][k] != 0:\n                        transformed[i][j] = transformed[i][k]\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                if not found:\n                    # Look to the right in the same row\n                    for k in range(j+1, 9):\n                        if transformed[i][k] != 0:\n                            transformed[i][j] = transformed[i][k]\n                            found = True\n                            break\n                if not found:\n                    # Look up in the same column\n                    for k in range(i-1, -1, -1):\n                        if transformed[k][j] != 0:\n                            transformed[i][j] = transformed[k][j]\n                            found = True\n                            break\n                if not found:\n                    # Look down in the same column\n                    for k in range(i+1, 9):\n                        if transformed[k][j] != 0:\n                            transformed[i][j] = transformed[k][j]\n                            found = True\n                            break\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this with Example 1's first row.\n\nFor the second cell (0,1), the code would look to the left (j=0, value 5). So transformed[0][1] becomes 5. But in the output, it's 6. So this doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe the code should look for the first non-zero in the same row, but in the case where there are multiple non-zeros, it replaces with the first one encountered. But in Example 1, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should replace with the value of the first non-zero in the same row, but if that's not possible, then the first non-zero in the same column.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find the correct pattern, I'll have to proceed with this approach, even if it doesn't fit all examples. It's possible that the correct pattern is this, and I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell in the same row, but shifted by one. For example, if the cell is 0, replace with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's also 0, then to the right, and so on.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nIn the end, I'll proceed with writing a function that replaces zeros with the value of the first non-zero cell to the left in the same row, or to the right if not found, and so on. This is the best I can do given the time I've spent.\n"
