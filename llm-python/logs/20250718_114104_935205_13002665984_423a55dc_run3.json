              "content": "Looking at the training examples, I observe the following pattern:\n\n1. The input grid contains a \"block\" of numbers (8, 6, 3, 2, 7) that are surrounded by 0s.\n2. The output grid transforms these blocks by \"expanding\" them in a specific way:\n   - The block is expanded to the left and right\n   - The block is expanded upwards\n   - The block is expanded downwards\n   - The block is expanded in a way that creates a \"frame\" around the original block\n3. The transformation seems to be a combination of expanding the block and filling the surrounding area with 0s.\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Identifies blocks of numbers (not 0) in the input grid\n- Expands these blocks to the left and right by one column\n- Expands these blocks upwards by one row\n- Expands these blocks downwards by one row\n- Fills the surrounding area with 0s\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Find all blocks of numbers (not 0)\n    rows, cols = grid_np.shape\n    blocks = []\n    \n    # Find all blocks of numbers (not 0)\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                # Start of a new block\n                block = []\n                x, y = i, j\n                while x < rows and grid_np[x][y] != 0:\n                    x += 1\n                while y < cols and grid_np[x][y] != 0:\n                    y += 1\n                # Find the block\n                block_rows = []\n                for x in range(i, x):\n                    row = []\n                    for y in range(j, y):\n                        row.append(grid_np[x][y])\n                    block_rows.append(row)\n                blocks.append(block_rows)\n    \n    # Create a new grid filled with 0s\n    new_grid = np.zeros((rows, cols), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Apply the transformation to each block\n    for block in blocks:\n        # Find the position of the block in the original grid\n        block_row = 0\n        block_col = 0\n        for i in range(rows):\n            for j in range(cols):\n                if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                    block_row = i\n                    block_col = j\n                    break\n            if block_row != 0:\n                break\n        \n        # Expand the block to the left and right by one column\n        new_block = np.zeros((len(block), cols), dtype=int)\n        for i in range(len(block)):\n            for j in range(cols):\n                if j < len(block[i]):\n                    new_block[i][j] = block[i][j]\n                else:\n                    new_block[i][j] = 0\n        \n        # Expand the block upwards by one row\n        for i in range(len(new_block)):\n            new_block[i] = [0] + new_block[i]\n        \n        # Expand the block downwards by one row\n        new_block = [np.zeros_like(new_block[0], dtype=int)] + new_block + [np.zeros_like(new_block[0], dtype=int)]\n        \n        # Place the new block in the new grid\n        for i in range(len(new_block)):\n            for j in range(len(new_block[i])):\n                new_grid[block_row + i][block_col + j] = new_block[i][j]\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    transformed_grid = new_grid.tolist()\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
