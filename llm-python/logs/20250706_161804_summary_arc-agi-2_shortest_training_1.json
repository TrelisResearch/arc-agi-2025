              "The previous approaches did not succeed. Let's look more closely at the examples:  \n\n**Example 1:**  \n- Input: `[[0], [1], [6], [8], [9]]`  \n- Expected output: `[[0], [9], [1], [8], [6]]`  \n\n**Example 2:**  \n- Input: `[[3], [6], [2], [8], [4]]`  \n- Expected output: `[[3], [4], [6], [8], [2]]`  \n\n---\n\n### Key observations:\n- In **Example 1**, the first element (`0`) stays at position 0.\n- The second element in the output (`9`) is the last input element.\n- Element `1` (originally at position 1) remains at position 2.\n- The last two elements `8` and `6` seem to swap positions from input to output.\n\nIn **Example 2**:\n- First element (`3`) stays fixed.\n- Second element (`4`) comes from the last input element (`4`).\n- Middle elements (`6`, `2`) are rearranged to `[6, 8, 2]` but in the output, it is `[4], [6], [8], [2]` with `4` (original last) at position 1.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\n- The first element remains fixed.\n- The last element of the input moves to position 1 (second in output).\n- The remaining middle elements seem to be permuted with no trivial pattern in their order, but maybe the flipping or shifting shifts.\n\n---\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\nBased on the outputs, the simplest pattern consistent with the given examples is:\n\n- Keep the first element in place.\n- Place the last element in position 1.\n- Keep the middle elements in their original order but place them after the second position.\n\n**In essence:**\n\n```\nOutput = [first_element, last_element] + middle_elements\n```\n\nBut the expected answers show that **the last two elements of the original sequence swap positions**.\n\n---\n\n### Final distilled observation:\n\n**It appears that:**\n\n- The first element is unchanged.\n- The last element of the input becomes the second element.\n- The second element of the input (originally) now moves to the last position.\n\nThis is consistent in both examples:\n- Example 1:\n  - Input: `[0, 1, 6, 8, 9]`\n  - Output: `[0, 9, 1, 8, 6]`\n  - Last element `9` has moved to position 1.\n  - The second element `1` (original position 1) has moved to second last position, swapping with `6`.\n- Example 2:\n  - Input: `[3, 6, 2, 8, 4]`\n  - Output: `[3, 4, 6, 8, 2]`\n  - Last element `4` moves to position 1.\n  - The second element `6` shifts to the last position, swapping `2`.\n\n---\n\n### Simplest consistent pattern:\n\n- **First element stays**\n- **Last element moves to position 1**\n- **Swap the second element and the last element**\n\n---\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    sequence = [row[0] for row in grid]\n    if len(sequence) < 2:\n        return [[val] for val in sequence]\n    first = sequence[0]\n    second = sequence[1]\n    last = sequence[-1]\n    middle = sequence[2:-1]\n    \n    # Place last element in position 1, first element in position 0\n    # Swap the second element with the last\n    new_sequence = [first, last] + middle\n    \n    # Swap second element with last element if sequence length > 2\n    if len(new_sequence) > 2:\n        new_sequence[1], new_sequence[-1] = new_sequence[-1], new_sequence[1]\n    \n    return [[val] for val in new_sequence]\n```\n\n---\n\n### Final implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    sequence = [row[0] for row in grid]\n    if len(sequence) < 2:\n        return [[val] for val in sequence]\n    \n    first = sequence[0]\n    second = sequence[1]\n    last = sequence[-1]\n    middle = sequence[2:-1]\n    \n    # Rearrange: first, last, middle..., swap second and last\n    new_sequence = [first, last] + middle\n    \n    if len(new_sequence) > 2:\n        new_sequence[1], new_sequence[-1] = new_sequence[-1], new_sequence[1]\n    \n    return [[val] for val in new_sequence]\n```\n\n---\n\nThis approach respects the observed behavior and should produce the expected output based on your examples."
