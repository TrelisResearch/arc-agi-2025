          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input grid. For example, in Example 1, the 3x3 input grid is expanded to a 9x9 output grid by repeating the rows and columns in a certain pattern.\n2. In Example 2, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid where the input pattern is repeated in a specific way.\n3. In Example 3, the input is a 4x4 grid, and the output is a 16x16 grid, suggesting a more complex pattern of expansion.\n4. In Example 4, the input is a 4x4 grid, and the output is a 16x16 grid with a specific pattern of repetition and expansion.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves expanding the input grid by repeating its rows and columns in a specific pattern. The exact pattern is not clear, but I will implement a transformation that expands the input grid by repeating its rows and columns in a way that matches the examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the dimensions of the input grid\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Create a new 9x9 grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Fill the transformed grid based on the input grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Repeat the input value in a pattern that matches the examples\n            # This is a simple pattern that repeats the input grid in a 3x3 pattern\n            # This is a hypothesis based on the examples\n            transformed_row = (i // 3) * 3 + (i % 3)\n            transformed_col = (j // 3) * 3 + (j % 3)\n            transformed_grid[transformed_row][transformed_col] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid seems to be an expansion of the input grid. For example, in Example 1, the 3x3 input grid is expanded to a 9x9 output grid by repeating the rows and columns in a certain pattern.\n2. In Example 2, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid where the input pattern is repeated in a specific way.\n3. In Example 3, the input is a 4x4 grid, and the output is a 16x16 grid, suggesting a more complex pattern of expansion.\n4. In Example 4, the input is a 4x4 grid, and the output is a 16x16 grid with a specific pattern of repetition and expansion.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves expanding the input grid by repeating its rows and columns in a specific pattern. The exact pattern is not clear, but I will implement a transformation that expands the input grid by repeating its rows and columns in a way that matches the examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the dimensions of the input grid\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Create a new 9x9 grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Fill the transformed grid based on the input grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Repeat the input value in a pattern that matches the examples\n            # This is a simple pattern that repeats the input grid in a 3x3 pattern\n            # This is a hypothesis based on the examples\n            transformed_row = (i // 3) * 3 + (i % 3)\n            transformed_col = (j // 3) * 3 + (j % 3)\n            transformed_grid[transformed_row][transformed_col] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
