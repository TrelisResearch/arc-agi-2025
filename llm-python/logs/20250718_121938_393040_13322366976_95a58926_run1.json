          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1 first. The input is a 19x13 grid, and the output is also 19x13. The input has some numbers, and the output seems to have some transformations. Let me compare some rows.\n\nIn the input, the fifth row is all 2s and 5s. The output for that row (row 4 in 0-based index) is 5s and 2s. Wait, looking at the output for example 1, the fifth row of output is \"5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5\". So the original input's fifth row was \"2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5\". So it seems like there's a change in the middle. Maybe the 5s and 2s are being swapped in some positions?\n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified. Let me check another row. For example, the first input row is all 0s except for some 2s and 5s. The output's first row is all 0s except for 5s in the fifth position. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a lot of 3s and 5s, and the output seems to have some 0s and 5s. For instance, in the first input row, the output is all 0s except for 5s in certain positions. Wait, the output for example 2's first row is all 0s except for 5s in the sixth position. But the input's first row has 0s and 3s and 5s. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern based on positions. For example, maybe certain cells are being set to 5 based on their position. Let's look at example 1's output. The output's first few rows are all 0s except for 5 in the fifth column. Then, in the fifth row of output, there's a 2 in the fifth column. Wait, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain cells are set to 5 if they are in certain positions. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 5 in column 4 (0-based index 4?), but the input's first row has 0s. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. The input has a lot of 0s, 4s, 5s. The output seems to have more 5s and some 4s. For instance, the first row of the input is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 0 0 5 0 4 0 5. The output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5. So the 4 in column 3 (input) is replaced with 5. Similarly, the 4 in column 16 (input) is replaced with 5. Also, the 5 in column 7 is kept. So maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being set to 5, but how?\n\nLooking at the output of example 3, the first row of output has 5 in columns 3, 7, 11, 15. Wait, the input's first row has 4 in column 3, 5 in column 7, 5 in column 11, 5 in column 15. The output has 5 in those positions. But the input's column 3 is 4, which is changed to 5. So maybe the transformation is that certain positions are being set to 5 if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position's row and column. For example, in example 3's output, the first row has 5s in positions where the column is even? Or maybe in certain positions.\n\nLooking at example 3's output for row 0 (the first row of output), the 5s are in columns 3, 7, 11, 15. Let's see the input's first row. The original input's first row is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 0 0 5 0 4 0 5. So columns 3 (value 4), 7 (5), 11 (5), 15 (5), and 17 (4). The output for these positions is 5. So maybe the transformation is replacing 4s with 5s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position's parity. For example, in example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns where the column index is odd? Let's check: columns 3 (index 3, which is odd?), 7 (odd), 11 (odd), 15 (odd). But 3 is odd. So maybe for columns where the column index is odd, the value is set to 5. But in the input, the first row's column 3 is 4, which is changed to 5. But column 7 is 5, which is kept. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in certain positions, the value is set to 5 if the original value is 4 or 5. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 1's output. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The input's first row is 0 0 0 2 5 0 0 2 0 5 0 0 0. So the 5 in column 4 (input) is kept, and the 2 in column 3 is changed to 0? Or maybe the 2 is changed to 0. But the output's first row has 5 in column 4 and 9. The input's first row has 5 in column 4 and 9. So maybe those positions are kept as 5. But other positions are changed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have 5s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in a certain position (like column 4 or 9), it's set to 5. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping certain patterns. For example, in example 1, the input's fifth row is 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5. The output's fifth row is 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5. So the 2 in the fifth column (index 4) is kept, but the 2s at the start and end are replaced with 5s. Wait, the original fifth row of input is 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5. The output for that row is 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5. So the first two elements (2 and 5) are changed to 5s, but the fifth element (2) is kept. Wait, no. Let me check again. The input's fifth row is [2,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,5]. The output's fifth row is [5,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,5,2,5,5,5]. So the first two elements (2 and 5) are changed to 5, but the fifth element (5) is kept. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in the fifth row, the 2s are moved to the middle?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are set to 5 based on their position. For example, in the output of example 1, the first row has 5 in column 4 (index 4) and 9 (index 9). The input's first row has 5 in column 4 and 9. So maybe those positions are kept. But other positions are changed to 0. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in a certain pattern, it's set to 5. For example, in example 3, the output's first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11,15. The input's first row has 4 in column 3, 5 in 7, 5 in 11, 5 in 15. So maybe the transformation is to set certain positions to 5 regardless of their original value. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at example 3's output, the first row of output has 5s in columns 3,7,11,15. Let's see the input's first row: columns 3 is 4, 7 is 5, 11 is 5, 15 is 5. So maybe the transformation is to set those columns to 5. But why those columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions are based on their row and column indices. For example, in example 3, the output's first row has 5s in columns where column index is 3, 7, 11, 15. These are columns that are 3 more than multiples of 4. For example, 3 = 0*4 +3, 7=1*4+3, 11=2*4+3, 15=3*4+3. So maybe for columns where column index mod 4 is 3, set to 5. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 1's output. For the first row, 5 is in column 4 and 9. Let's check if those are in positions where column index mod 4 is 0. 4 mod4 is 0, 9 mod4 is 1. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe columns where the index is even or odd. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are set to 5. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 5 in columns 4 and 9. Let's see if those are positions that are in the middle of the row. The row has 13 columns. The middle is around 6 (0-based index 6). So 4 and 9 are not the middle. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 5th column (index 4) is set to 5, and the 9th column (index 8) is set to 5. But that's just for example 1's first row. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to all examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The output for example 2's first row is all 0s except for 5 in column 5 (index 5). The input's first row has 0s and 3s and 5s. So maybe the output is replacing certain positions with 5s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the row is even, then set to 5 if column is even. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output grid is a copy of the input grid, but with certain cells changed. For example, in example 1, the output has 5s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is to set all cells in certain positions to 5. For example, in example 1, the output's first row has 5 in column 4 and 9. Maybe that's because those positions are in the middle of the row. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11,15. Let's see: 3,7,11,15. These are columns where the column index is 3 mod 4. So for example, 3 = 0*4 +3, 7=1*4 +3, 11=2*4 +3, 15=3*4 +3. So maybe the transformation is that for each row, every column where column index mod 4 == 3 is set to 5. Let's check example 1's output. For example 1's first row, the output has 5 in column 4 (index 4) and 9 (index 9). Let's see 4 mod4 is 0, 9 mod4 is 1. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 5th column (index 4) is set to 5. Let's check example 1's first row. The input's first row has 2 in column 3 (index 3) and 5 in column 4 (index 4). The output's first row has 5 in column 4 (index 4). So maybe that's kept. But the input's column 3 is 2, which is changed to 0 in the output. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values with others based on their positions. For example, in example 3, the output's first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11,15. Let me check the input's first row: the original input's first row has 4 in column 3, 5 in 7, 5 in 11, 5 in 15. So maybe those columns are set to 5 regardless of their original value. So the transformation could be that for certain columns, set to 5. But which columns?\n\nIn example 3's output, for the first row, the columns 3,7,11,15 are set to 5. Let's see if those are columns that are in the same positions for all rows. For example, maybe columns 3,7,11,15 are set to 5 in every row. But looking at example 1's output, the first row has 5 in column 4 and 9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are set to 5 based on their row index. For example, in example 3, the output for the first row (row 0) has 5s in columns 3,7,11,15. For row 1, maybe the same columns are set to 5. But looking at example 3's output, row 1 is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5. So columns 3,7,11,15 again. So maybe for every row, columns 3,7,11,15 are set to 5. But in example 1's output, the first row has 5 in column 4 and 9, not those positions. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3's output, the fifth row (row 4) of the output is 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4. The input's fifth row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5. So the output's fifth row has 4s in columns 3,7,11,15. But the input's fifth row has 5s in those positions. So maybe the transformation is that for certain columns, the value is set to 5 if it's in a certain row. Or maybe for certain rows, the columns are changed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the column is even, set to 5. But in example 3's output, the first row has 5 in column 3 (odd), so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values with others based on their position. For example, in example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11,15. These are columns where the column index is 3,7,11,15. These are columns that are 3 more than multiples of 4. So for each row, columns where (column index) % 4 == 3 are set to 5. Let's check example 1's output. The first row has 5 in column 4 (index 4) and 9 (index 9). 4 mod4 is 0, 9 mod4 is 1. So that doesn't fit. So that pattern isn't consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11,15. Let's see the input's first row. The original input's first row has 4 in column 3, 5 in 7, 5 in 11, 5 in 15. So the output's first row has 5 in those positions. So maybe the transformation is to set those columns to 5 regardless of the original value. So for example, in every row, columns 3,7,11,15 are set to 5. But how does that fit with example 1's output?\n\nIn example 1's output, the first row has 5 in column 4 and 9. But according to this hypothesis, columns 3,7,11,15 should be set to 5. But in the first row of example 1's output, those columns are 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's look at example 2's output. For example 2's first row, the output is all 0s except for 5 in column 5 (index 5). The input's first row has 0s and 3s and 5s. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 5 based on their row and column. For example, in row 0, column 5 is set to 5. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all values with 5 in certain positions. For example, in example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11,15. These are columns that are 3,7,11,15. Let's see: for a 13-column grid, columns are 0-12. 3 is 3, 7 is 7, 11 is 11, 15 is out of range. Wait, 15 is not a valid column index for a 13-column grid. Oh, wait, the test input has 13 columns. So maybe the columns are 0-12. So 15 is not possible. So maybe that's a mistake in my thinking.\n\nWait, the input and output grids are 19x13. So each row has 13 elements. So column indices are 0-12. So in example 3's output for the first row, the 5s are in columns 3,7,11, and 15 is not possible. Wait, the first row of example 3's output is:\n\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n\nWait, that's 24 elements? No, the input and output are 19 rows by 13 columns. So each row has 13 elements. Let me check the example 3's output. The output for example 3 is given as:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n\nSo each row has 24 elements? No, wait, the example 3's input has 19 rows and 13 columns. So each row in the output should have 13 elements. Let me count the elements in the first line of the output for example 3:\n\n\"0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\" \u2014 that's 24 numbers. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the example 3's output again. Oh, the output for example 3 is given as:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n\nEach line has 24 numbers, which is impossible for a 13-column grid. So I must have made a mistake in counting. Let me check the first line again. The first line is:\n\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n\nThat's 24 numbers. But that's not possible. Wait, the input and output for example 3 are 19x13. So each row should have 13 elements. So this must be a formatting error. Maybe the actual output for example 3 is 13 elements per row. Let me recheck. For example, the first line of the output is:\n\n\"0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\" \u2014 but that's 24 elements. This suggests that there's a mistake in the way the example is presented. Perhaps the actual output is different. Maybe the example is not properly formatted, and I should focus on the other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nIn example 1's output, the first row is 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The input's first row is 0 0 0 2 5 0 0 2 0 5 0 0 0. So the 5 in column 4 (index 4) is kept, and the 2 in column 3 is changed to 0. The 2 in column 7 is changed to 0. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 0. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 2s with 0s in certain positions. But that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 5 if they are in certain positions, and others with 0. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 5 in columns 4 and 9. These are positions where column index is 4 and 9. Let's see: 4 is 4, 9 is 9. For a 13-column grid, these are positions that are 4 and 9. Maybe these are positions where column index is 4 or 9, and in those positions, the value is set to 5. But in example 3's output, the first row has 5 in columns 3,7,11,15. But 15 is out of range for a 13-column grid. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all cells in even rows with 5 in certain columns. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all cells in certain positions with 5 based on their row and column. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 5 in column 4 and 9. In the fifth row of example 1's output, the 5 is in column 4 and 9. Wait, the fifth row of example 1's output is 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5. So the 2 is in column 4 and 9. So maybe the transformation is to set 5 in certain positions, but it's not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern from the examples. Maybe I should look for other patterns, like the number of 5s or 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions, and replace other values with 0s. But without more data, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in even rows and columns. But again, not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that applies to all examples. Let's look at example 3's output. In the first row of the output, the 5s are in columns 3,7,11. Let's see, for a 13-column grid, columns 3,7,11 are 3,7,11. These are positions that are 3,7,11. These are columns that are 3 more than multiples of 4 (3=0*4+3, 7=1*4+3, 11=2*4+3). So for each row, columns where column index mod 4 == 3 are set to 5. Let's check example 1's output. For example 1's first row, the output has 5 in columns 4 and 9. 4 mod4 is 0, 9 mod4 is 1. So that doesn't fit. But perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set columns 3,7,11 to 5 in every row. Let's check example 1's output. For example, the first row of example 1's output is 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So column 3 is 0, not 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set columns 4 and 9 to 5 in every row. Let's check example 1's first row: columns 4 and 9 are 5. For example 3's first row, columns 3,7,11 are 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set certain columns to 5 based on their position in the row. For example, in example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11. These are columns that are 3,7,11, which are 3 more than multiples of 4. So for each row, columns where (column index) % 4 == 3 are set to 5. Let's check example 1's output. For example 1's first row, column 3 is 0, but according to this pattern, it should be 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the pattern is different. Maybe it's columns where (column index + row index) is even. But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions, and leave others as is. But how?\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11. These are columns that are 3,7,11. Let's see, for a 13-column grid, these are columns 3,7,11. These are columns that are 3,7,11. These are columns that are 3 more than multiples of 4. So maybe the pattern is to set these columns to 5 in every row.\n\nBut in example 1's output, the first row has 5 in columns 4 and 9, which are not 3,7,11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set certain columns to 5 based on their row. For example, in even rows, set columns 3,7,11 to 5, and in odd rows, set columns 4,9 to 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions, and replace 2s with 0s in others. But without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll try to find a pattern that fits at least some of the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row has 5 in columns 4 and 9. The input's first row has 5 in columns 4 and 9. So maybe those positions are kept as 5. The other positions are changed to 0. So perhaps the transformation is to set certain positions to 5 and others to 0. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions and replace 2s with 0s in others. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions and keep others as they are. For example, in example 1's input, the first row has 0s in positions 0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11,12. The output has 0s in some of these positions, but 5s in 4 and 9. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 5s and others with 0s.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions, and leave others as is. For example, in example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11. So maybe the transformation is to set those columns to 5.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nMaybe the columns are 3,7,11, which are 3,7,11 in a 13-column grid. These are columns that are 3,7,11, which are 3,7,11. Let's see: 3 is 3, 7 is 7, 11 is 11. These are columns that are 3 more than multiples of 4. So for each row, columns where (column index) % 4 == 3 are set to 5. Let's check example 3's output. For the first row, columns 3,7,11 are set to 5. For example, column 3 is 3 mod4=3, column 7 is 7 mod4=3, column 11 is 11 mod4=3. So this fits. For example 1's output, the first row has 5 in columns 4 and 9. 4 mod4 is 0, 9 mod4 is 1. So this doesn't fit. But maybe there's a different pattern for other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set columns 3,7,11 to 5 for every row. But in example 1's first row, these columns are 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the pattern is that for even rows, set columns 3,7,11 to 5, and for odd rows, set columns 4,9 to 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, certain columns are set to 5 based on their column index mod 4. For example, columns where (column index) % 4 == 3 are set to 5. Let's try to implement this and see if it fits some of the examples.\n\nFor example, in example 3's first row, columns 3,7,11 are set to 5. This fits. In example 1's first row, columns 3,7,11 would be set to 5. But in the output, they are 0. So this doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set columns 3,7,11 to 5 for certain rows. For example, rows where the row index is even.\n\nBut this is too arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: in example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11, and the fifth row has 4s in those columns. So maybe the transformation is to set those columns to 5 in certain rows and to 4 in others. But this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see.\n\nLooking at example 3's output, it seems that the transformation is to replace certain columns with 5s. For example, in the first row, columns 3,7,11 are set to 5. In the fourth row of example 3's output, the first row is 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4. So columns 3,7,11 are 4, which is different from the 5s in other rows. So this suggests that the transformation is not consistent.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll try to think of a transformation that could explain some of the examples.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions, and replace 2s with 0s in others. For example, in example 1's first row, the input has 2s in columns 3 and 7, which are replaced with 0s in the output. The 5s in columns 4 and 9 are kept. So maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 0s in certain positions and 0s with 5s in others.\n\nBut this is not helpful for other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions and leave others as is. For example, in example 3's first row, the 4 in column 3 is replaced with 5. So maybe the transformation is to replace 4s with 5s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation replaces all 0s with 5s in certain positions, and replaces 2s with 0s in others. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to set all cells to 5 if the row is even, and to 0 if the row is odd. But this is not supported by the examples.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess. Perhaps the transformation is to set all cells in even columns to 5, and others to 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to set all cells in columns 4 and 9 to 5, and others to 0. This fits example 1's output, but not example 3's.\n\nBut given the examples, I'll proceed with this hypothesis.\n\nSo, the transformation is to set columns 4 and 9 to 5, and others to 0. But this is not correct for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to set all cells to 5 if the column is 4 or 9, and 0 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut in example 3's output, the first row has 5 in columns 3,7,11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to write a function that replaces certain columns with 5s. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 5 in columns 4 and 9. So perhaps the transformation is to set columns 4 and 9 to 5, and others to 0.\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions, and leave others as is. For example, in example 1's first row, the 5s are kept, and the 2s are replaced with 0s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAt this point, I think I'll have to make a function that replaces certain columns with 5s based on their position. For example, in example 3's output, columns 3,7,11 are set to 5. So for each row, set those columns to 5. This would be:\n\nfor each row in grid:\n    for column in 3,7,11:\n        set to 5\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are 3,7,11, which are 3,7,11. These are columns where (column index) % 4 == 3. So for each row, set columns where column index mod 4 == 3 to 5.\n\nLet's try this for example 1's first row. Columns 3,7,11 are set to 5. But in the output, the first row has 5 in columns 4 and 9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the transformation is to set columns 3,7,11 to 5 in every row, and for other rows, set other columns to 5.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell, if the column is 3,7,11, set to 5. This would fit example 3's output, but not example 1's.\n\nBut since the test input has 13 columns, columns 3,7,11 are valid.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for i, val in enumerate(row):\n            if i in [3,7,11]:\n                new_row.append(5)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit example 1's output. For example, in example 1's first row, the output has 5 in columns 4 and 9, but according to this code, columns 3,7,11 are set to 5. So this code would not match example 1's output.\n\nBut maybe the transformation is different. Perhaps for each row, set columns 3,7,11 to 5, and for other rows, set other columns to 5.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set all cells to 5 in certain positions based on their row. For example, for even rows, set columns 3,7,11 to 5, and for odd rows, set columns 4,9 to 5.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the code that sets columns 3,7,11 to 5, and see if it fits any of the examples.\n\nBut this is not correct for example 1, but maybe it's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions. For example, in example 1's first row, the 0s are replaced with 5s in columns 4 and 9, and 2s are replaced with 0s in columns 3 and 7.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the code that sets columns 3,7,11 to 5 for every row, even though it may not fit all examples. This is the best I can do given the information.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1 first. The input is a 19x13 grid, and the output is also 19x13. The input has some numbers, and the output seems to have some transformations. Let me compare some rows.\n\nIn the input, the fifth row is all 2s and 5s. The output for that row (row 4 in 0-based index) is 5s and 2s. Wait, looking at the output for example 1, the fifth row of output is \"5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5\". So the original input's fifth row was \"2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5\". So it seems like there's a change in the middle. Maybe the 5s and 2s are being swapped in some positions?\n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified. Let me check another row. For example, the first input row is all 0s except for some 2s and 5s. The output's first row is all 0s except for 5s in the fifth position. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a lot of 3s and 5s, and the output seems to have some 0s and 5s. For instance, in the first input row, the output is all 0s except for 5s in certain positions. Wait, the output for example 2's first row is all 0s except for 5s in the sixth position. But the input's first row has 0s and 3s and 5s. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern based on positions. For example, maybe certain cells are being set to 5 based on their position. Let's look at example 1's output. The output's first few rows are all 0s except for 5 in the fifth column. Then, in the fifth row of output, there's a 2 in the fifth column. Wait, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain cells are set to 5 if they are in certain positions. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 5 in column 4 (0-based index 4?), but the input's first row has 0s. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. The input has a lot of 0s, 4s, 5s. The output seems to have more 5s and some 4s. For instance, the first row of the input is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 0 0 5 0 4 0 5. The output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5. So the 4 in column 3 (input) is replaced with 5. Similarly, the 4 in column 16 (input) is replaced with 5. Also, the 5 in column 7 is kept. So maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being set to 5, but how?\n\nLooking at the output of example 3, the first row of output has 5 in columns 3, 7, 11, 15. Wait, the input's first row has 4 in column 3, 5 in column 7, 5 in column 11, 5 in column 15. The output has 5 in those positions. But the input's column 3 is 4, which is changed to 5. So maybe the transformation is that certain positions are being set to 5 if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position's row and column. For example, in example 3's output, the first row has 5s in positions where the column is even? Or maybe in certain positions.\n\nLooking at example 3's output for row 0 (the first row of output), the 5s are in columns 3, 7, 11, 15. Let's see the input's first row. The original input's first row is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 0 0 5 0 4 0 5. So columns 3 (value 4), 7 (5), 11 (5), 15 (5), and 17 (4). The output for these positions is 5. So maybe the transformation is replacing 4s with 5s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position's parity. For example, in example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns where the column index is odd? Let's check: columns 3 (index 3, which is odd?), 7 (odd), 11 (odd), 15 (odd). But 3 is odd. So maybe for columns where the column index is odd, the value is set to 5. But in the input, the first row's column 3 is 4, which is changed to 5. But column 7 is 5, which is kept. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in certain positions, the value is set to 5 if the original value is 4 or 5. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 1's output. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The input's first row is 0 0 0 2 5 0 0 2 0 5 0 0 0. So the 5 in column 4 (input) is kept, and the 2 in column 3 is changed to 0? Or maybe the 2 is changed to 0. But the output's first row has 5 in column 4 and 9. The input's first row has 5 in column 4 and 9. So maybe those positions are kept as 5. But other positions are changed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have 5s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in a certain position (like column 4 or 9), it's set to 5. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping certain patterns. For example, in example 1, the input's fifth row is 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5. The output's fifth row is 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5. So the 2 in the fifth column (index 4) is kept, but the 2s at the start and end are replaced with 5s. Wait, the original fifth row of input is 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5. The output for that row is 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5. So the first two elements (2 and 5) are changed to 5s, but the fifth element (2) is kept. Wait, no. Let me check again. The input's fifth row is [2,5,5,5,5,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,5]. The output's fifth row is [5,5,5,5,2,5,5,5,5,2,5,5,5]. So the first two elements (2 and 5) are changed to 5, but the fifth element (5) is kept. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in the fifth row, the 2s are moved to the middle?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are set to 5 based on their position. For example, in the output of example 1, the first row has 5 in column 4 (index 4) and 9 (index 9). The input's first row has 5 in column 4 and 9. So maybe those positions are kept. But other positions are changed to 0. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in a certain pattern, it's set to 5. For example, in example 3, the output's first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11,15. The input's first row has 4 in column 3, 5 in 7, 5 in 11, 5 in 15. So maybe the transformation is to set certain positions to 5 regardless of their original value. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at example 3's output, the first row of output has 5s in columns 3,7,11,15. Let's see the input's first row: columns 3 is 4, 7 is 5, 11 is 5, 15 is 5. So maybe the transformation is to set those columns to 5. But why those columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions are based on their row and column indices. For example, in example 3, the output's first row has 5s in columns where column index is 3, 7, 11, 15. These are columns that are 3 more than multiples of 4. For example, 3 = 0*4 +3, 7=1*4+3, 11=2*4+3, 15=3*4+3. So maybe for columns where column index mod 4 is 3, set to 5. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 1's output. For the first row, 5 is in column 4 and 9. Let's check if those are in positions where column index mod 4 is 0. 4 mod4 is 0, 9 mod4 is 1. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe columns where the index is even or odd. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are set to 5. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 5 in columns 4 and 9. Let's see if those are positions that are in the middle of the row. The row has 13 columns. The middle is around 6 (0-based index 6). So 4 and 9 are not the middle. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 5th column (index 4) is set to 5, and the 9th column (index 8) is set to 5. But that's just for example 1's first row. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to all examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The output for example 2's first row is all 0s except for 5 in column 5 (index 5). The input's first row has 0s and 3s and 5s. So maybe the output is replacing certain positions with 5s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the row is even, then set to 5 if column is even. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output grid is a copy of the input grid, but with certain cells changed. For example, in example 1, the output has 5s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is to set all cells in certain positions to 5. For example, in example 1, the output's first row has 5 in column 4 and 9. Maybe that's because those positions are in the middle of the row. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11,15. Let's see: 3,7,11,15. These are columns where the column index is 3 mod 4. So for example, 3 = 0*4 +3, 7=1*4 +3, 11=2*4 +3, 15=3*4 +3. So maybe the transformation is that for each row, every column where column index mod 4 == 3 is set to 5. Let's check example 1's output. For example 1's first row, the output has 5 in column 4 (index 4) and 9 (index 9). Let's see 4 mod4 is 0, 9 mod4 is 1. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 5th column (index 4) is set to 5. Let's check example 1's first row. The input's first row has 2 in column 3 (index 3) and 5 in column 4 (index 4). The output's first row has 5 in column 4 (index 4). So maybe that's kept. But the input's column 3 is 2, which is changed to 0 in the output. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values with others based on their positions. For example, in example 3, the output's first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11,15. Let me check the input's first row: the original input's first row has 4 in column 3, 5 in 7, 5 in 11, 5 in 15. So maybe those columns are set to 5 regardless of their original value. So the transformation could be that for certain columns, set to 5. But which columns?\n\nIn example 3's output, for the first row, the columns 3,7,11,15 are set to 5. Let's see if those are columns that are in the same positions for all rows. For example, maybe columns 3,7,11,15 are set to 5 in every row. But looking at example 1's output, the first row has 5 in column 4 and 9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are set to 5 based on their row index. For example, in example 3, the output for the first row (row 0) has 5s in columns 3,7,11,15. For row 1, maybe the same columns are set to 5. But looking at example 3's output, row 1 is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5. So columns 3,7,11,15 again. So maybe for every row, columns 3,7,11,15 are set to 5. But in example 1's output, the first row has 5 in column 4 and 9, not those positions. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3's output, the fifth row (row 4) of the output is 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4. The input's fifth row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5. So the output's fifth row has 4s in columns 3,7,11,15. But the input's fifth row has 5s in those positions. So maybe the transformation is that for certain columns, the value is set to 5 if it's in a certain row. Or maybe for certain rows, the columns are changed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the column is even, set to 5. But in example 3's output, the first row has 5 in column 3 (odd), so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values with others based on their position. For example, in example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11,15. These are columns where the column index is 3,7,11,15. These are columns that are 3 more than multiples of 4. So for each row, columns where (column index) % 4 == 3 are set to 5. Let's check example 1's output. The first row has 5 in column 4 (index 4) and 9 (index 9). 4 mod4 is 0, 9 mod4 is 1. So that doesn't fit. So that pattern isn't consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11,15. Let's see the input's first row. The original input's first row has 4 in column 3, 5 in 7, 5 in 11, 5 in 15. So the output's first row has 5 in those positions. So maybe the transformation is to set those columns to 5 regardless of the original value. So for example, in every row, columns 3,7,11,15 are set to 5. But how does that fit with example 1's output?\n\nIn example 1's output, the first row has 5 in column 4 and 9. But according to this hypothesis, columns 3,7,11,15 should be set to 5. But in the first row of example 1's output, those columns are 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's look at example 2's output. For example 2's first row, the output is all 0s except for 5 in column 5 (index 5). The input's first row has 0s and 3s and 5s. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 5 based on their row and column. For example, in row 0, column 5 is set to 5. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all values with 5 in certain positions. For example, in example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11,15. These are columns that are 3,7,11,15. Let's see: for a 13-column grid, columns are 0-12. 3 is 3, 7 is 7, 11 is 11, 15 is out of range. Wait, 15 is not a valid column index for a 13-column grid. Oh, wait, the test input has 13 columns. So maybe the columns are 0-12. So 15 is not possible. So maybe that's a mistake in my thinking.\n\nWait, the input and output grids are 19x13. So each row has 13 elements. So column indices are 0-12. So in example 3's output for the first row, the 5s are in columns 3,7,11, and 15 is not possible. Wait, the first row of example 3's output is:\n\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n\nWait, that's 24 elements? No, the input and output are 19 rows by 13 columns. So each row has 13 elements. Let me check the example 3's output. The output for example 3 is given as:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n\nSo each row has 24 elements? No, wait, the example 3's input has 19 rows and 13 columns. So each row in the output should have 13 elements. Let me count the elements in the first line of the output for example 3:\n\n\"0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\" \u2014 that's 24 numbers. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the example 3's output again. Oh, the output for example 3 is given as:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4\n\nEach line has 24 numbers, which is impossible for a 13-column grid. So I must have made a mistake in counting. Let me check the first line again. The first line is:\n\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\n\nThat's 24 numbers. But that's not possible. Wait, the input and output for example 3 are 19x13. So each row should have 13 elements. So this must be a formatting error. Maybe the actual output for example 3 is 13 elements per row. Let me recheck. For example, the first line of the output is:\n\n\"0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5\" \u2014 but that's 24 elements. This suggests that there's a mistake in the way the example is presented. Perhaps the actual output is different. Maybe the example is not properly formatted, and I should focus on the other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let's try to look for another pattern.\n\nIn example 1's output, the first row is 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The input's first row is 0 0 0 2 5 0 0 2 0 5 0 0 0. So the 5 in column 4 (index 4) is kept, and the 2 in column 3 is changed to 0. The 2 in column 7 is changed to 0. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 0. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 2s with 0s in certain positions. But that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 5 if they are in certain positions, and others with 0. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 5 in columns 4 and 9. These are positions where column index is 4 and 9. Let's see: 4 is 4, 9 is 9. For a 13-column grid, these are positions that are 4 and 9. Maybe these are positions where column index is 4 or 9, and in those positions, the value is set to 5. But in example 3's output, the first row has 5 in columns 3,7,11,15. But 15 is out of range for a 13-column grid. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all cells in even rows with 5 in certain columns. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all cells in certain positions with 5 based on their row and column. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 5 in column 4 and 9. In the fifth row of example 1's output, the 5 is in column 4 and 9. Wait, the fifth row of example 1's output is 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5. So the 2 is in column 4 and 9. So maybe the transformation is to set 5 in certain positions, but it's not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern from the examples. Maybe I should look for other patterns, like the number of 5s or 2s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions, and replace other values with 0s. But without more data, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in even rows and columns. But again, not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that applies to all examples. Let's look at example 3's output. In the first row of the output, the 5s are in columns 3,7,11. Let's see, for a 13-column grid, columns 3,7,11 are 3,7,11. These are positions that are 3,7,11. These are columns that are 3 more than multiples of 4 (3=0*4+3, 7=1*4+3, 11=2*4+3). So for each row, columns where column index mod 4 == 3 are set to 5. Let's check example 1's output. For example 1's first row, the output has 5 in columns 4 and 9. 4 mod4 is 0, 9 mod4 is 1. So that doesn't fit. But perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set columns 3,7,11 to 5 in every row. Let's check example 1's output. For example, the first row of example 1's output is 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So column 3 is 0, not 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set columns 4 and 9 to 5 in every row. Let's check example 1's first row: columns 4 and 9 are 5. For example 3's first row, columns 3,7,11 are 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set certain columns to 5 based on their position in the row. For example, in example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11. These are columns that are 3,7,11, which are 3 more than multiples of 4. So for each row, columns where (column index) % 4 == 3 are set to 5. Let's check example 1's output. For example 1's first row, column 3 is 0, but according to this pattern, it should be 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the pattern is different. Maybe it's columns where (column index + row index) is even. But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions, and leave others as is. But how?\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11. These are columns that are 3,7,11. Let's see, for a 13-column grid, these are columns 3,7,11. These are columns that are 3,7,11. These are columns that are 3 more than multiples of 4. So maybe the pattern is to set these columns to 5 in every row.\n\nBut in example 1's output, the first row has 5 in columns 4 and 9, which are not 3,7,11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set certain columns to 5 based on their row. For example, in even rows, set columns 3,7,11 to 5, and in odd rows, set columns 4,9 to 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions, and replace 2s with 0s in others. But without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll try to find a pattern that fits at least some of the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row has 5 in columns 4 and 9. The input's first row has 5 in columns 4 and 9. So maybe those positions are kept as 5. The other positions are changed to 0. So perhaps the transformation is to set certain positions to 5 and others to 0. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions and replace 2s with 0s in others. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions and keep others as they are. For example, in example 1's input, the first row has 0s in positions 0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,10,11,12. The output has 0s in some of these positions, but 5s in 4 and 9. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 5s and others with 0s.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions, and leave others as is. For example, in example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11. So maybe the transformation is to set those columns to 5.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nMaybe the columns are 3,7,11, which are 3,7,11 in a 13-column grid. These are columns that are 3,7,11, which are 3,7,11. Let's see: 3 is 3, 7 is 7, 11 is 11. These are columns that are 3 more than multiples of 4. So for each row, columns where (column index) % 4 == 3 are set to 5. Let's check example 3's output. For the first row, columns 3,7,11 are set to 5. For example, column 3 is 3 mod4=3, column 7 is 7 mod4=3, column 11 is 11 mod4=3. So this fits. For example 1's output, the first row has 5 in columns 4 and 9. 4 mod4 is 0, 9 mod4 is 1. So this doesn't fit. But maybe there's a different pattern for other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set columns 3,7,11 to 5 for every row. But in example 1's first row, these columns are 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the pattern is that for even rows, set columns 3,7,11 to 5, and for odd rows, set columns 4,9 to 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, certain columns are set to 5 based on their column index mod 4. For example, columns where (column index) % 4 == 3 are set to 5. Let's try to implement this and see if it fits some of the examples.\n\nFor example, in example 3's first row, columns 3,7,11 are set to 5. This fits. In example 1's first row, columns 3,7,11 would be set to 5. But in the output, they are 0. So this doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set columns 3,7,11 to 5 for certain rows. For example, rows where the row index is even.\n\nBut this is too arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: in example 3's output, the first row has 5s in columns 3,7,11, and the fifth row has 4s in those columns. So maybe the transformation is to set those columns to 5 in certain rows and to 4 in others. But this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see.\n\nLooking at example 3's output, it seems that the transformation is to replace certain columns with 5s. For example, in the first row, columns 3,7,11 are set to 5. In the fourth row of example 3's output, the first row is 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4 5 5 5 4. So columns 3,7,11 are 4, which is different from the 5s in other rows. So this suggests that the transformation is not consistent.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll try to think of a transformation that could explain some of the examples.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions, and replace 2s with 0s in others. For example, in example 1's first row, the input has 2s in columns 3 and 7, which are replaced with 0s in the output. The 5s in columns 4 and 9 are kept. So maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 0s in certain positions and 0s with 5s in others.\n\nBut this is not helpful for other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions and leave others as is. For example, in example 3's first row, the 4 in column 3 is replaced with 5. So maybe the transformation is to replace 4s with 5s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation replaces all 0s with 5s in certain positions, and replaces 2s with 0s in others. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to set all cells to 5 if the row is even, and to 0 if the row is odd. But this is not supported by the examples.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess. Perhaps the transformation is to set all cells in even columns to 5, and others to 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to set all cells in columns 4 and 9 to 5, and others to 0. This fits example 1's output, but not example 3's.\n\nBut given the examples, I'll proceed with this hypothesis.\n\nSo, the transformation is to set columns 4 and 9 to 5, and others to 0. But this is not correct for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to set all cells to 5 if the column is 4 or 9, and 0 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut in example 3's output, the first row has 5 in columns 3,7,11. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to write a function that replaces certain columns with 5s. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 5 in columns 4 and 9. So perhaps the transformation is to set columns 4 and 9 to 5, and others to 0.\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions, and leave others as is. For example, in example 1's first row, the 5s are kept, and the 2s are replaced with 0s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAt this point, I think I'll have to make a function that replaces certain columns with 5s based on their position. For example, in example 3's output, columns 3,7,11 are set to 5. So for each row, set those columns to 5. This would be:\n\nfor each row in grid:\n    for column in 3,7,11:\n        set to 5\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are 3,7,11, which are 3,7,11. These are columns where (column index) % 4 == 3. So for each row, set columns where column index mod 4 == 3 to 5.\n\nLet's try this for example 1's first row. Columns 3,7,11 are set to 5. But in the output, the first row has 5 in columns 4 and 9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the transformation is to set columns 3,7,11 to 5 in every row, and for other rows, set other columns to 5.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell, if the column is 3,7,11, set to 5. This would fit example 3's output, but not example 1's.\n\nBut since the test input has 13 columns, columns 3,7,11 are valid.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for i, val in enumerate(row):\n            if i in [3,7,11]:\n                new_row.append(5)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit example 1's output. For example, in example 1's first row, the output has 5 in columns 4 and 9, but according to this code, columns 3,7,11 are set to 5. So this code would not match example 1's output.\n\nBut maybe the transformation is different. Perhaps for each row, set columns 3,7,11 to 5, and for other rows, set other columns to 5.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set all cells to 5 in certain positions based on their row. For example, for even rows, set columns 3,7,11 to 5, and for odd rows, set columns 4,9 to 5.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the code that sets columns 3,7,11 to 5, and see if it fits any of the examples.\n\nBut this is not correct for example 1, but maybe it's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s in certain positions. For example, in example 1's first row, the 0s are replaced with 5s in columns 4 and 9, and 2s are replaced with 0s in columns 3 and 7.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the code that sets columns 3,7,11 to 5 for every row, even though it may not fit all examples. This is the best I can do given the information.\n"
