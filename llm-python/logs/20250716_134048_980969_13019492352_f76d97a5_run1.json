    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input is a 3x3 grid. The output is also 3x3. The input has 4s and 5s. The output has 0s and 4s. Hmm. The output seems to have a cross shape. The center is 4, and the edges are 4s. The corners are 0s. Wait, the input's center is 5, but the output's center is 4. Maybe it's replacing the center with 4 and surrounding with 4s? But the input's center is 5, but output's center is 4. Wait, maybe it's something else. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the input for example 1 is:\n\n4 5 4\n5 5 5\n4 5 4\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 4 0\n4 4 4\n0 4 0\n\nSo the output has 0s in the corners and 4s in the edges and center. The input's center is 5, but output's center is 4. The input's edges are 5s and 4s. So maybe the output is replacing the center with 4, and the edges with 4s? But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a pattern where the center is 4, and the surrounding cells are 4, but the corners are 0. So the input's center is 5, which is replaced by 4. The input's corners are 4, which are replaced by 0. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 where the original value is 4? Or maybe not. Let me check. The original input's corners are 4, and output's corners are 0. The original input's edges (non-corner) are 5, and output's edges are 4. So maybe the output is replacing 5s with 4s and 4s with 0s? But that doesn't fit. Because in the input, the center is 5, which becomes 4. The corners are 4, which become 0. So maybe the output is 0 where the original value is 4, and 4 where the original value is 5? But then, the edges (non-corner) in the input are 5, which become 4. So that seems to fit. But why would that be the case?\n\nBut then, in example 2, the input is a 5x5 grid. The output is a 5x5 grid. Let's look at example 2's input and output.\n\nInput for example 2:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 6 6 6\nRow 1: 6 5 5 6 6\nRow 2: 6 6 5 5 6\nRow 3: 6 6 6 5 5\nRow 4: 5 6 6 6 5\n\nOutput:\n\n6 6 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0\n0 0 0 6 6\n6 0 0 0 6\n\nHmm. The output seems to have a diagonal pattern. The first row has 6s followed by 0s. The second row starts with 0, then 6s, then 0s. The third row starts with two 0s, then 6s, then 0. And so on. The last row has 6 followed by 0s and then 6. So the pattern is that the output is 0s in positions where the original value is 6? Or maybe not. Wait, looking at the output, the 0s are in positions that form a diagonal. For example, the first row's third, fourth, fifth elements are 0. The second row's first element is 0, then third and fourth are 0. Wait, maybe it's a pattern where the output is 0s in positions that are on the diagonal or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values. For example, in example 2, the output is 0 where the original value is 6. But looking at the output, the first row has 6s in the first two positions, then 0s. The original input's first row is 5,5,6,6,6. So the first two elements are 5, which in the output are 6. The third, fourth, fifth are 6, which in output are 0. So maybe the output is 6 where the original value is 5, and 0 where the original value is 6? But that's not the case for the other rows. Let's check row 1 of input: 6,5,5,6,6. The output row is 0,6,6,0,0. So the first element is 6 (original is 6) becomes 0. The second and third are 5, which become 6. The fourth and fifth are 6, which become 0. So that's not matching. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the position. For example, in example 2, the output has 0s along a diagonal. Let's see: the output's first row has 0s starting from column 2. The second row has 0s starting from column 0. Third row from column 0, etc. Wait, maybe the output is a pattern where the 0s are in positions where the row + column is equal to some value. For example, in example 2, the output's 0s are in positions where row + column is equal to 2, 3, 4, etc. Or maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values, but in a way that depends on their position. For example, in example 1, the output is 0s in the corners and 4s elsewhere. But in example 2, the output is 0s in a diagonal pattern. So maybe the pattern is different for different examples. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's value being 5 or 6. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 where the original value is 4, and 4 where the original is 5. But in example 2, the output is 0 where the original is 6, and 6 where the original is 5. But that's not consistent. For example, in example 2, the first row of input is 5,5,6,6,6. The output first row is 6,6,0,0,0. So the first two 5s become 6, and the 6s become 0. So that would fit. Then in row 1, the input is 6,5,5,6,6. The output is 0,6,6,0,0. So the 6s become 0, and the 5s become 6. That seems to fit. Then in row 2, input is 6,6,5,5,6. Output is 0,0,6,6,0. The 6s become 0, the 5s become 6. So this seems to fit. Similarly for the other rows. So the pattern here is that in example 2, the output is 6 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 6. But then why? What's the logic here?\n\nBut in example 1, the input has 4s and 5s. The output has 0s where the original is 4 and 4s where the original is 5. So maybe the pattern is that the output is 0 where the original is 4, and 4 where the original is 5. But then in example 2, the output is 6 where the original is 5 and 0 where the original is 6. So perhaps the pattern is that the output is 0 where the original is 4 or 6, and 4 or 6 where the original is 5? But that doesn't fit. Because in example 1, the output is 0 where the original is 4, and 4 where the original is 5. In example 2, the output is 0 where the original is 6, and 6 where the original is 5. So maybe the transformation depends on the value of the original cell. For example, if the original cell is 5, then output is 4 or 6 depending on the example. But that's not possible. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the position of the cell. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 in the corners and 4 elsewhere. The input is a 3x3 grid. The corners are (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). The output is 0 in those positions. The other positions are 4. So maybe the output is 0 where the cell is a corner, and 4 elsewhere. But how does that fit with example 2?\n\nIn example 2, the output seems to have a diagonal pattern. For example, the first row's third, fourth, fifth elements are 0. The second row's first element is 0, then third and fourth are 0. Third row's first two elements are 0, then third and fourth are 0. Fourth row's first three elements are 0, then fourth and fifth are 0. Fifth row's first element is 6, then third and fourth are 0, fifth is 6. Hmm. It seems that the 0s are in positions where the row index plus column index equals some value. For example, in the first row (row 0), the 0s start at column 2. So 0+2=2. In row 1, the 0s start at column 0 (1+0=1?), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's based on the diagonal. For example, the 0s are in positions where the row index is equal to the column index. But in the first row, column 2 is 0. So that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the 0s are in positions where the row index is greater than the column index. Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's value and the position. For example, in example 2, the output is 0 where the original value is 6 and the position is on a certain diagonal. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's value and the position. For example, if the original cell is 5, then output is 6 if it's on a certain diagonal, and 4 otherwise. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original cell's value and the position in a way that depends on the original grid's structure. For example, in example 1, the input has a cross shape (center is 5, and edges are 5, corners are 4). The output is a cross with 0s in the corners and 4s in the edges and center. So maybe the output is replacing the 5s with 4s and the 4s with 0s. But that's not the case for example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's value and the position. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 where the original value is 4, and 4 where the original value is 5. In example 2, the output is 0 where the original value is 6 and 6 where the original value is 5. But that would mean that the transformation is different for different values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's value and the position. For example, in example 1, the corners are 4, which are replaced by 0. The edges (non-corner) are 5, which are replaced by 4. In example 2, the 5s are replaced by 6s, and the 6s are replaced by 0s. So perhaps the transformation is that the output is 0 where the original value is 4 or 6, and 4 or 6 where the original is 5. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value being 5. For example, in example 1, the output is 4 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 4. In example 2, the output is 6 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 6. But that seems inconsistent. But maybe the transformation depends on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 5, then output is 4 or 6 depending on the position. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 where the original is 4 and the position is a corner. In example 2, the output is 0 where the original is 6 and the position is on a certain diagonal. But how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's distance from the center. For example, in example 1, the center is 5, and the output is 4. The corners are 4, which become 0. So maybe the output is 0 where the cell is a corner, and 4 where it's not. But how does that fit with example 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's value and whether it's part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the input has a cross shape. The output is a cross with 0s in the corners and 4s elsewhere. In example 2, the input has a pattern where the 5s are in the center and the 6s are surrounding them. The output is a diagonal pattern of 0s and 6s. So maybe the output is based on the original grid's value and the position in a way that depends on the original grid's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value being 5, and then the output is 4 or 6 based on the position. For example, in example 1, the output is 4 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 4. In example 2, the output is 6 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 6. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value being 5. If the original value is 5, then output is 4 or 6 depending on the position. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's distance from the center. For example, in example 1, the center is 5. The corners are 4, which are replaced by 0. The edges are 5, which are replaced by 4. In example 2, the center is 5. The 6s are surrounding it, and the output is 0 where the original is 6. So perhaps the output is 0 where the original value is 4 or 6, and 4 or 6 where the original is 5. But this seems to be inconsistent with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original value being 5 and then the output is 4 or 6 based on the position. For example, in example 1, the output is 4 where the original is 5. In example 2, the output is 6 where the original is 5. So maybe the output is 4 or 6 depending on the original grid's structure. But how to determine that?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at example 3.\n\nExample 3 input:\n\n9 5 9 9 9\n9 9 5 5 9\n9 5 9 9 9\n9 9 5 9 9\n9 9 9 5 5\n\nOutput:\n\n0 9 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 0\n0 9 0 0 0\n0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 0 9 9\n\nSo the output has 0s in certain positions. The first row is 0 9 0 0 0. The second row is 0 0 9 9 0. Third row is 0 9 0 0 0. Fourth row is 0 0 9 0 0. Fifth row is 0 0 0 9 9.\n\nLooking at the input, the original values are 9s and 5s. The output has 0s in positions where the original value is 9? Or maybe not. Let's check. For example, in the first row of input, the original values are 9,5,9,9,9. The output is 0,9,0,0,0. So the first element is 9, which becomes 0. The second element is 5, which becomes 9. The third is 9, which becomes 0. Fourth and fifth are 9, which become 0. So in this case, the output is 0 where the original is 9, and 9 where the original is 5. But in the second row of input, the original is 9,9,5,5,9. The output is 0,0,9,9,0. So the first two elements are 9, which become 0. The third and fourth are 5, which become 9. The fifth is 9, which becomes 0. So again, the pattern seems to be that the output is 0 where the original is 9, and 9 where the original is 5. But why?\n\nSo for example 1, the input has 4 and 5. Output is 0 where the original is 4, and 4 where the original is 5. For example 2, input has 5 and 6. Output is 6 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 6. For example 3, input has 9 and 5. Output is 0 where the original is 9, and 9 where the original is 5. \n\nWait, this seems like the pattern is that the output is 0 where the original is a certain value, and another value where the original is another value. But what's the pattern here? \n\nLooking at the three examples:\n\nExample 1: input has 4 and 5. Output is 0 where input is 4, and 4 where input is 5.\n\nExample 2: input has 5 and 6. Output is 6 where input is 5, and 0 where input is 6.\n\nExample 3: input has 5 and 9. Output is 9 where input is 5, and 0 where input is 9.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output is the value of the original cell if it's 5, and 0 otherwise. But that doesn't fit. Wait, in example 1, the output is 4 where the input is 5. But in example 2, the output is 6 where the input is 5. In example 3, the output is 9 where the input is 5. So the output for 5 is different in each example. That can't be right. So there must be another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 where the original is 4 (corners), and 4 where the original is 5 (edges and center). In example 2, the output is 0 where the original is 6 (positions along a diagonal), and 6 where the original is 5 (positions not on the diagonal). In example 3, the output is 0 where the original is 9 (positions along a diagonal), and 9 where the original is 5 (positions not on the diagonal).\n\nSo perhaps the output is based on the original value and whether the cell is on a certain pattern (like a diagonal or a cross). But how to determine what that pattern is?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's relation to the center. For example, in example 1, the center is 5. The output is 4 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 4 (corners). In example 2, the center is 5. The output is 6 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 6 (positions along a diagonal). In example 3, the center is 5. The output is 9 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 9 (positions along a diagonal). So the pattern seems to be that the output is the same as the original value if it's 5, and 0 otherwise. But that can't be, because in example 1, the output is 4 where the original is 5. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value being 5 and the position being part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the output is 4 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 4. In example 2, the output is 6 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 6. In example 3, the output is 9 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 9. So the output is the value of the original cell if it's 5, and 0 otherwise. But that's not possible. Because in example 1, the output for 5 is 4, which is not the original value. So that's not correct.\n\nHmm. This is getting really confusing. Maybe there's another way. Let's think about what the output represents. For example, in example 1, the output is a cross with 0s in the corners. In example 2, the output has a diagonal pattern of 0s. In example 3, the output has a diagonal pattern of 0s. So maybe the output is based on the position of the cell in the grid. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 in the corners and 4 elsewhere. In example 2, the output is 0 in positions where row + column is equal to some value. For example, in example 2, the 0s are in positions where row + column is equal to 2, 3, 4, etc. Let's check:\n\nExample 2's output:\n\nRow 0: 6 6 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 2,3,4 \u2192 row + column = 0+2=2, 0+3=3, 0+4=4.\n\nRow 1: 0 6 6 0 0 \u2192 column 0 (1+0=1), column 3 (1+3=4), column 4 (1+4=5).\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6 6 0 \u2192 columns 0 (2+0=2), 1 (2+1=3), 3 (2+3=5), 4 (2+4=6).\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's based on the row index and column index. For example, the 0s are in positions where row is greater than column. Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's value and the position. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 in the corners. So the corners are positions (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). In example 2, the 0s are in positions where row + column is equal to 2, 3, etc. For example, the first row has 0s starting at column 2. So row 0, column 2: 0+2=2. Row 1, column 0: 1+0=1. Row 2, column 0: 2+0=2. Row 2, column 1: 2+1=3. So it's not a consistent pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's relation to a certain line. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 where the cell is a corner. In example 2, the output is 0 where the cell is on the diagonal. In example 3, the output is 0 where the cell is on the diagonal. So maybe the pattern is that the output is 0 where the cell is on a certain line (like a diagonal), and the original value is replaced with some other value.\n\nBut how to determine what that line is. For example, in example 1, the line is the corners. In example 2, it's a diagonal. In example 3, it's a diagonal. So maybe the pattern is that the output is 0 where the cell is on a certain line (like a diagonal), and the original value is replaced with some other value.\n\nBut how to determine which line it is. For example, in example 1, the line is the corners. In example 2 and 3, the line is a diagonal. So maybe the pattern is that the output is 0 where the cell is on a certain line, and the original value is replaced with some value. But what determines which line?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original value being 5 and the position being on a certain line. For example, in example 1, the center is 5, and the output is 4. In example 2, the center is 5, and the output is 6. In example 3, the center is 5, and the output is 9. So the output for 5 is the value of the original cell's value if it's not 5. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's relation to the center. For example, in example 1, the center is 5. The output is 4 where the original is 5. In example 2, the center is 5. The output is 6 where the original is 5. In example 3, the center is 5. The output is 9 where the original is 5. So the output for 5 is the value of the original cell's value if it's not 5. But that's not possible.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look at the test input and see what it could look like.\n\nTest input is a 5x5 grid:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 3 5 3\nRow 1: 3 5 3 3 3\nRow 2: 3 5 5 3 5\nRow 3: 3 3 3 5 3\nRow 4: 5 5 5 3 3\n\nThe output is not known, but the transformation must be applied to this. Let's think about what the output could be based on the previous examples.\n\nIf the pattern is that the output is 0 where the original is 5 and the position is on a certain line, and other values otherwise. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's relation to the center. For example, in example 1, the center is 5, and the output is 4. In example 2, the center is 5, and the output is 6. In example 3, the center is 5, and the output is 9. So perhaps the output for 5 is the value of the original cell's value if it's not 5. But this doesn't make sense. Or maybe the output for 5 is the value of the original cell's value if it's not 5, and 4, 6, or 9 otherwise. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value being 5 and the position being on a certain line. For example, in example 1, the center is 5, and the output is 4. In example 2, the center is 5, and the output is 6. In example 3, the center is 5, and the output is 9. So the output for 5 is the value of the original cell's value if it's not 5. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's relation to a certain pattern. For example, the output is 0 where the original value is 4, 6, or 9, and the other values are replaced with the original value. But that doesn't fit with example 2, where the output for 5 is 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's relation to the center. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 in the corners. In example 2, the output is 0 in positions along a diagonal. In example 3, the output is 0 in positions along a diagonal. So the pattern is that the output is 0 in certain positions, and the other values are replaced with the original value.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are those. For example, in example 1, the corners are the positions where the output is 0. In example 2, the diagonal positions are the ones where the output is 0. In example 3, the diagonal positions are the ones where the output is 0.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that the output is 0 where the position is on a certain line (like a diagonal or corners), and the other values are replaced with the original value. But what determines which line?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 where the position is on a certain line, and the other values are replaced with the original value. For example, in example 1, the line is the corners. In example 2, the line is a diagonal. In example 3, the line is a diagonal.\n\nBut how to determine which line. Maybe the line is determined by the original grid's structure. For example, in example 1, the input has a cross shape. The output is 0 in the corners. In example 2, the input has a pattern where the 5 is in the center, and the 6s are around it. The output is 0 in a diagonal. In example 3, the input has a pattern where the 5 is in the center, and the 9s are around it. The output is 0 in a diagonal.\n\nSo maybe the output is 0 in positions that are on a diagonal, and the other values are replaced with the original value. But how to determine which diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 in positions where the row and column are equal. For example, in example 2, the output has 0s in positions where row + column is equal to 2, 3, 4, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 0 in positions where the row is equal to the column. For example, in example 2, the output has 0s in positions (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), etc. This doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 in positions where the row is greater than the column. For example, in example 2, the first row has 0s from column 2 onwards. So row 0, column 2: 0 >= 2? No. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits all three examples.\n\nLooking at example 1: the output is 0 in the corners. The corners are positions (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). So for a 3x3 grid, these are the positions where row == column or row + column == 2.\n\nIn example 2, the output has 0s in positions that form a diagonal. For example, in the first row, the 0s start at column 2. In row 1, the 0 is at column 0. In row 2, the 0s are at columns 0 and 1. This seems like the positions where row + column is equal to 2, 3, 4, etc. For example, row 0, column 2: 0+2=2. Row 1, column 0: 1+0=1. Row 2, column 0: 2+0=2. Row 2, column 1: 2+1=3. So it's not a consistent pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's relation to the center. For example, in example 1, the center is (2,2) (assuming 0-based indexing). The output is 0 in the corners. In example 2, the center is (2,2). The output is 0 in positions along a diagonal. In example 3, the center is (2,2). The output is 0 in positions along a diagonal.\n\nSo maybe the output is 0 in positions that are on a certain diagonal, and the other values are replaced with the original value. But how to determine which diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 in positions where the row and column are equal. For example, in example 1, the center is (1,1). The output is 0 in the corners, which are not on the diagonal. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 in positions where the row is equal to the column. In example 1, the center is (1,1), which is on the diagonal. But the output for the center is 4, not 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really difficult. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the output for example 1. The output is 0 in the corners, and 4 elsewhere. The input has 4 and 5. So the output is 0 where the input is 4, and 4 where the input is 5. But why? Because the input's corners are 4, and the output's corners are 0. The input's edges are 5, and the output's edges are 4.\n\nIn example 2, the output is 0 where the input is 6, and 6 where the input is 5. In example 3, the output is 0 where the input is 9, and 9 where the input is 5.\n\nSo for each example, the output is 0 where the input is a certain value, and the other value is replaced with the original value. But what determines which value?\n\nIn example 1, the value is 4 and 5. The output is 0 for 4, and 4 for 5.\n\nIn example 2, the value is 5 and 6. Output is 6 for 5, and 0 for 6.\n\nIn example 3, the value is 5 and 9. Output is 9 for 5, and 0 for 9.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output is 0 where the input is a certain value, and the other value is replaced with the original value. But what determines which value is replaced with what?\n\nMaybe the value that is replaced is the one that is not 5. For example, in example 1, the input has 4 and 5. The output is 0 for 4, and 4 for 5. So 5 is replaced with 4, which is the other value.\n\nIn example 2, the input has 5 and 6. The output is 6 for 5, and 0 for 6. So 5 is replaced with 6.\n\nIn example 3, the input has 5 and 9. The output is 9 for 5, and 0 for 9. So 5 is replaced with 9.\n\nThis suggests that the replacement value depends on the input's values. But how?\n\nMaybe the replacement value is the value that is not 5. For example, in example 1, the value not 5 is 4. So 5 is replaced with 4. In example 2, the value not 5 is 6, so 5 is replaced with 6. In example 3, the value not 5 is 9, so 5 is replaced with 9.\n\nSo the pattern is: for any cell in the input, if the value is 5, then the output is the value that is not 5 in the input. If the value is not 5, then the output is 0.\n\nBut this would mean that in example 1, the output is 0 where the input is 4, and 4 where the input is 5. In example 2, the output is 0 where the input is 6, and 6 where the input is 5. In example 3, the output is 0 where the input is 9, and 9 where the input is 5. This fits all three examples.\n\nBut how to determine what the value that is not 5 is. For example, in example 1, the input has 4 and 5. The value not 5 is 4. In example 2, the input has 5 and 6. The value not 5 is 6. In example 3, the input has 5 and 9. The value not 5 is 9. So for each example, the value that is not 5 is the one that is replaced with the other value.\n\nBut how to determine this in the general case. For example, if the input has multiple values, like 5, 6, 7, etc., what would be the replacement?\n\nBut according to the examples, the replacement is the value that is not 5. So if the input cell is 5, the output is the value that is not 5. If the input cell is not 5, the output is 0.\n\nBut how to determine what the value that is not 5 is. For example, in example 1, the input has 4 and 5. So the value not 5 is 4. In example 2, the input has 5 and 6. The value not 5 is 6. In example 3, the input has 5 and 9. The value not 5 is 9. So the replacement value is the other value in the input. But what if the input has more than two values?\n\nBut according to the examples, it seems that the replacement value is the value that is not 5. So for any cell in the input, if the cell is 5, the output is the value that is not 5. If the cell is not 5, the output is 0.\n\nBut how to determine what the value that is not 5 is. For example, if the input has multiple values, like 5, 6, 7, then what is the replacement value? But according to the examples, it seems that the replacement is the value that is not 5, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement value is the value that is not 5 in the input. So for example, if the input has 5 and 6, then 5 is replaced with 6. If the input has 5 and 9, then 5 is replaced with 9. So the replacement value is the other value in the input. But how to determine that.\n\nBut in the test input, what would be the replacement? The test input has values 3, 5, 3, 5, 3, etc. So the input has 3 and 5. According to this pattern, the output would be 0 where the input is not 5, and 3 where the input is 5. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nBut let's check if this hypothesis fits the examples.\n\nExample 1: input has 4 and 5. So for cells with 4, output is 0. For cells with 5, output is 4. Which matches the example.\n\nExample 2: input has 5 and 6. So for cells with 5, output is 6. For cells with 6, output is 0. Which matches the example.\n\nExample 3: input has 5 and 9. For cells with 5, output is 9. For cells with 9, output is 0. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. So the transformation is: for each cell, if the value is 5, then output is the value that is not 5 in the input. If the value is not 5, output is 0.\n\nBut how to determine what the value that is not 5 is. For example, in the test input, the input has 3 and 5. So the value that is not 5 is 3. So for cells with 5, output is 3. For cells with 3, output is 0.\n\nBut what if the input has multiple values, like 5, 6, 7? How to determine which value to replace 5 with? According to the examples, it seems that the replacement is the value that is not 5 in the input. But if the input has multiple values, how to choose?\n\nBut according to the examples, it's possible that the replacement is the value that is not 5 in the input. So for each cell, if the value is 5, the output is the value that is not 5 in the input. If the value is not 5, the output is 0.\n\nBut how to determine what the value that is not 5 is. For example, in the test input, the input has 3 and 5. So the value that is not 5 is 3. So the output would be 0 for 3, and 3 for 5.\n\nBut this is a hypothesis. Let's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the input has 4 and 5. The value that is not 5 is 4. So output is 4 for 5. Which matches the example.\n\nIn example 2, input has 5 and 6. The value that is not 5 is 6. So output is 6 for 5. Which matches the example.\n\nIn example 3, input has 5 and 9. The value that is not 5 is 9. So output is 9 for 5. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. So the transformation is: for each cell, if the value is 5, then the output is the value that is not 5 in the input. If the value is not 5, then output is 0.\n\nBut how to determine what the value that is not 5 is in the input. For example, if the input has multiple values, like 5, 6, 7, then what is the value to replace 5 with? According to the examples, it seems that the value is the one that is not 5 in the input. But how to determine that.\n\nBut in the examples, the input has only two values: 5 and another value. So for each example, the other value is the one that is replaced.\n\nSo the code would need to find the value that is not 5 in the input grid. But how? For example, if the input has multiple values, how to determine which one to use.\n\nBut according to the examples, it's possible that the replacement value is the value that is not 5 in the input. So for the input grid, we need to find the value that is not 5. If there are multiple values, but only one is not 5, then that's the one.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the input has multiple values, like 5, 6, 7. In that case, what value to use? But according to the examples, it seems that the replacement is the value that is not 5 in the input. So perhaps the code would need to find the value that is not 5 in the input, and use that as the replacement.\n\nBut how to find that value. For example, in the test input, the input has 3 and 5. So the value that is not 5 is 3. So for cells with 5, output is 3. For cells with 3, output is 0.\n\nSo the code would need to find the value that is not 5 in the input. But how?\n\nWait, but in the examples, the input has exactly two values: 5 and another value. So for the input grid, the code would check for the value that is not 5, and use that as the replacement.\n\nSo the code could do the following:\n\n- For each cell in the input grid:\n   - If the cell's value is 5, then the output is the value that is not 5 in the input grid.\n   - Else, the output is 0.\n\nBut how to find the value that is not 5 in the input grid.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the input grid has 4 and 5. So the value that is not 5 is 4.\n\nIn example 2, the input grid has 5 and 6. So the value that is not 5 is 6.\n\nIn example 3, the input grid has 5 and 9. So the value that is not 5 is 9.\n\nSo the code would need to find the value that is not 5 in the input grid.\n\nBut how to do that. For example, if the input grid has multiple values, but only one of them is not 5, then that's the value to use.\n\nSo the code would need to find all the unique values in the input grid, filter out the 5, and take the first one.\n\nBut how to handle cases where there are multiple values not 5. For example, if the input has 5, 6, 7, then what value to use? But according to the examples, it seems that the replacement is the value that is not 5 in the input.\n\nBut in the test input, the input has 3 and 5. So the replacement value is 3.\n\nSo the code could be:\n\n- Find all unique values in the input grid.\n- Filter out the 5.\n- If there are any values left, take the first one as the replacement value.\n- For each cell in the input grid:\n   - if the cell is 5, output is replacement value.\n   - else, output is 0.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find all unique values in the input grid.\n2. Remove 5 from the list.\n3. If the list is not empty, take the first element as the replacement value.\n4. For each cell in the grid:\n   - if the cell is 5, output is replacement value.\n   - else, output is 0.\n\nBut what if the input grid has no values other than 5? For example, all cells are 5. Then the replacement value would be None, but according to the examples, this case is not present. So the code would need to handle that.\n\nBut according to the examples, the input grids have at least one value that is not 5.\n\nSo let's implement this logic.\n\nLet's test this logic with the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput grid has 4 and 5. Unique values are {4,5}. Remove 5, get [4]. Replacement value is 4. So for each cell, if it's 5, output is 4. Else 0. Which matches the example.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput has 5 and 6. Unique values are {5,6}. Remove 5, get [6]. Replacement is 6. So for cells with 5, output is 6. Else 0. Which matches the example.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput has 5 and 9. Unique values {5,9}. Remove 5, get [9]. Replacement is 9. So for cells with 5, output is 9. Else 0. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the test input.\n\nTest input is:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 3 5 3\nRow 1: 3 5 3 3 3\nRow 2: 3 5 5 3 5\nRow 3: 3 3 3 5 3\nRow 4: 5 5 5 3 3\n\nThe unique values in this input are 3,5. So after removing 5, the replacement value is 3.\n\nSo for each cell:\n\nIf the cell is 5, output is 3. Else, output is 0.\n\nSo the output grid would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 3 0\nRow 1: 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 3 3 0 3\nRow 3: 0 0 0 3 0\nRow 4: 3 3 3 0 0\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis based on the observed pattern.\n\nSo the code would need to implement this logic.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\n- Read the input grid as a list of lists.\n- Find all unique values in the grid.\n- Remove 5 from the list.\n- If the list is not empty, take the first element as replacement_value.\n- For each cell in the grid, if it is 5, replace with replacement_value, else 0.\n\nBut what if the input has no values other than 5? Like all cells are 5. Then, the replacement_value would be None, but according to the examples, this case is not present.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input grid is from the training examples, which have at least one value other than 5.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find all unique values in the grid\n    unique_values = set()\n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            unique_values.add(val)\n    # Remove 5 from the unique values\n    other_values = [v for v in unique_values if v != 5]\n    # Get the first value that is not 5\n    if other_values:\n        replacement = other_values[0]\n    else:\n        # If no other values, but according to examples, this is not possible\n        replacement = 0  # default, but not sure\n    # Create the output grid\n    output = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 5:\n                new_row.append(replacement)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(0)\n        output.append(new_row)\n    return output\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the replacement is 4, which is not 5. So this code would work.\n\nBut what about the test input? Let's see.\n\nTest input has 3 and 5. So other_values is [3], replacement is 3. So cells with 5 are replaced with 3, others with 0.\n\nSo the output would be as described.\n\nBut let's check example 2. The input has 5 and 6. other_values is [6], so replacement is 6. So cells with 5 are replaced with 6, others with 0. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nBut wait, what about example 3? The input has 5 and 9. other_values is [9], replacement is 9. So cells with 5 are replaced with 9, others with 0. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this code seems to handle all the examples correctly.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python. The function takes a 2D list (grid) and returns a new grid.\n\nBut what about the case where the input has multiple values not 5? For example, if the input has 5, 6, 7. According to the code, the replacement value is 6. So cells with 5 are replaced with 6, others with 0. But what if the input has multiple values not 5? The code would take the first one in the unique_values set. But the unique_values set is a set, so the order is not guaranteed. But in the examples, the unique_values are {5, x}, so the code would work.\n\nBut for the code, the order of the unique_values depends on how the set is processed. However, in Python, sets are unordered. So the code might not work correctly if the other_values are not in the order expected. For example, if the input has 5, 6, and 7, and the code picks 6 as the replacement, but according to the pattern, it should pick 6 or 7?\n\nBut according to the examples, the code works when there are exactly two values, 5 and x. So in that case, the code would work.\n\nBut for other cases, it's unclear. But according to the problem statement, the code should handle the training examples, and the test input.\n\nThus, the code seems to be correct based on the examples.\n\nSo the final code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    unique_values = set()\n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            unique_values.add(val)\n    other_values = [v for v in unique_values if v != 5]\n    if other_values:\n        replacement = other_values[0]\n    else:\n        replacement = 0  # default, but not sure\n    output = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 5:\n                new_row.append(replacement)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(0)\n        output.append(new_row)\n    return output\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the replacement is 4. But in the code, the other_values is [4], so replacement is 4. Correct.\n\nBut what if the input has multiple other values? For example, input has 5, 6, 7. The code would take the first one in the set. But according to the pattern, it's unclear. But according to the examples, it's acceptable.\n\nThus, this code should handle the training examples correctly.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, there are three examples given. Let me look at each one and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 3x3 grid. The output is also 3x3. The input has 4,5,4 in the first row, then 5s in the middle, and same as first row. The output has 0s on the corners and 4s in the middle. Wait, maybe it's replacing the 5s with 4s and the 4s with 0s? But that doesn't fit exactly. Wait, the input's middle row is all 5s, and the output's middle row is all 4s. The corners of the input are 4s, and the output's corners are 0s. So maybe the transformation is replacing 5s with 4s and 4s with 0s? But that would make the output's middle row all 4s, which matches. But then the corners of the input are 4s, which become 0s. So maybe the rule is that any cell that is 5 becomes 4, and any cell that is 4 becomes 0. But then what about other numbers? Well, in this example, the output is 0s and 4s. But maybe the pattern is that the output is 0s where the input is 4, and 4s where the input is 5. But that seems too simple. Let me check the other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input is a 5x5 grid. The output is a 5x5 grid. The input has a pattern where the numbers are 5,6, etc. The output seems to have 6s in some positions and 0s in others. For instance, the first row of the input is 5,5,6,6,6. The output's first row is 6,6,0,0,0. So maybe the 5s are being replaced by 6s, and the 6s are being replaced by 0s? But that doesn't fit. Wait, the input's first row starts with 5,5,6,6,6. The output's first row is 6,6,0,0,0. So the first two elements are 5s in the input, which become 6s in the output. Then the next three 6s become 0s. Hmm. That seems like maybe the 5s are being replaced by 6s, but the 6s are being replaced by 0s. But that's only for the first row. Let me check the second row of the input. The input's second row is 6,5,5,6,6. The output's second row is 0,6,6,0,0. So the first element is 6, which becomes 0. Then 5 becomes 6, then 5 becomes 6, then 6 becomes 0, then 6 becomes 0. So maybe the rule is that any cell that is 5 becomes 6, and any cell that is 6 becomes 0? But that would mean that in the first row of the input, the first two 5s become 6s, and the three 6s become 0s. Which matches the output. But then in the second row, the first 6 becomes 0, then the two 5s become 6s, and the two 6s become 0s. That seems to fit. But then what about the third row of the input? The input third row is 6,6,5,5,6. The output third row is 0,0,6,6,0. So the first two 6s become 0s, then the two 5s become 6s, then the 6 becomes 0. That fits. So maybe the pattern is that 5s become 6s and 6s become 0s. But wait, in example 3, let's check.\n\nExample 3's input is a 5x5 grid. The output is also 5x5. The input has 9s and 5s. The output has 0s and 9s. For instance, the first row of the input is 9,5,9,9,9. The output's first row is 0,9,0,0,0. So the 9s are replaced by 0s? Wait, no. The first element is 9 in input, which becomes 0. The second is 5, which becomes 9. Then the third is 9, which becomes 0. So maybe the 5s are being replaced by 9s, and 9s are being replaced by 0s? But that's not consistent with the first example. Wait, in example 1, the 4s become 0s and 5s become 4s. But in example 2, 5s become 6s and 6s become 0s. In example 3, 5s become 9s and 9s become 0s. That seems inconsistent. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on some kind of pattern in the grid. Like, for example, in example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid with a cross shape of 5s. The output is a 3x3 grid with 0s on the corners and 4s in the middle. Maybe the transformation is that the output is 0s where the input is 4, and 4s where the input is 5. But that's only for example 1. But example 2 and 3 have different numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For instance, in example 2, the input has a pattern where the numbers are 5,6, etc. The output seems to have 6s in some positions and 0s in others. Maybe the output is 6s where the input is 5, and 0s where the input is 6. But that would explain example 2. But then in example 3, the input has 9s and 5s. The output has 0s and 9s. So perhaps the rule is that for each cell, if the value is 5, it becomes 6, if it's 6, becomes 0, if it's 9, becomes 0, and if it's 5, becomes 9? That seems conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, in example 1, the input has a cross of 5s. The output has 0s in the corners and 4s in the middle. Maybe the transformation is replacing 5s with 4s, and 4s with 0s. But in example 2, the input has 5s and 6s. The output has 6s and 0s. So maybe the transformation is that 5s become 6s and 6s become 0s. But that's inconsistent with example 3. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking at example 3's input and output. The input's first row is 9,5,9,9,9. The output is 0,9,0,0,0. So the 9s in the input become 0s, and the 5 becomes 9. So maybe the rule is that 5s are replaced by 9s, and 9s are replaced by 0s. But that's conflicting with example 2. Because in example 2, the 5s become 6s, and 6s become 0s. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if the cell is part of a certain pattern, like a cross, then it's replaced by a certain value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with 0 if it's part of a certain shape, and some other value otherwise. For example, in example 1, the input has a cross of 5s. The output has 0s in the corners and 4s in the middle. So maybe the transformation is that the 5s are replaced with 4s, and the 4s are replaced with 0s. But that's only for example 1. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 5, it becomes 4, and if it's 4, it becomes 0. But then example 2 would have 5s replaced by 4s and 6s replaced by 0s. But that's not matching the example 2's output. Because in example 2, the input has 5s and 6s. The output has 6s and 0s. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the position. For example, in example 2, the output seems to have 6s in the first two positions of the first row, then 0s. Maybe the pattern is that for each cell, if it's part of a certain diagonal or line, it's replaced by 6, and others by 0. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2's input and output, the output seems to have a pattern where the 6s are replaced by 0s, and 5s are replaced by 6s. But that's only in certain positions. For example, the first row of the input is 5,5,6,6,6. The output is 6,6,0,0,0. So the first two 5s become 6s, and the three 6s become 0s. Then the second row of the input is 6,5,5,6,6. The output is 0,6,6,0,0. So the first 6 becomes 0, then the two 5s become 6s, then two 6s become 0s. So it's like the 5s become 6s, and 6s become 0s. But that's only for example 2. But example 3's input has 9s and 5s. The output has 0s and 9s. So for example, the first row of input is 9,5,9,9,9. Output is 0,9,0,0,0. So the 9s become 0s, and the 5 becomes 9. So that's the opposite of example 2. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the position in the grid. For example, in example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid. The output has 0s in the corners and 4s in the middle. So the 4s become 0s and 5s become 4s. But that's only for example 1. Maybe the pattern is that the output is 0 where the input is 4, and 4 where the input is 5. But that's not applicable to other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the number of adjacent cells with the same value. But that's getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output is a 3x3 grid with 0s on the corners and 4s in the middle. That looks like a cross shape. The input is a cross shape of 5s. So maybe the output is a cross of the same value as the input's value, but with 0s in the corners. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by replacing each cell with 0 if it's part of a certain shape, and the same value as the input otherwise. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2, the output seems to have a pattern where the 6s are replaced by 0s, and 5s are replaced by 6s. But that's only for certain parts. For example, the first row of the input is 5,5,6,6,6. The output is 6,6,0,0,0. So the first two 5s become 6s, then the three 6s become 0s. Then the next row of input is 6,5,5,6,6. The output is 0,6,6,0,0. So the first 6 becomes 0, then the two 5s become 6s, then the two 6s become 0s. So the pattern seems to be that 5s become 6s, and 6s become 0s. But then why in example 3, the input has 9s and 5s, and the output has 0s and 9s. For example, the first row of input is 9,5,9,9,9. The output is 0,9,0,0,0. So the 9s become 0s, and the 5 becomes 9. So that's the opposite of example 2. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's another pattern. Let me think again. Maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position relative to the center. For example, in example 1, the input is a cross of 5s. The output is a cross of 4s with 0s in the corners. So perhaps the transformation is that the center cell is replaced with the same value as the input's center, but the corners are replaced with 0s. But that's only for example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with 0 if it's part of a certain shape, and the same value as the input otherwise. But how to determine that shape.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the number of times it appears in the grid. For example, in example 2, the input has more 6s than 5s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 5, it becomes 6, and if it's 6, becomes 0. But then in example 3, the input has 9s and 5s. The output has 0s and 9s. So that would imply that 5 becomes 9 and 9 becomes 0. But that's inconsistent with example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, the output value is 0 if the input value is 5, and the input value is 6 if it's 5. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 where the input is 4 or 5, and the input value otherwise. But that's not matching example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 where the input is 4, and the input value is 4 if it's 5. But that's not matching example 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is 0 if the input is 4 or 5, and 6 if the input is 5. But that's not clear.\n\nThis is getting really confusing. Maybe I need to look for a different pattern. Let me think about the examples again.\n\nExample 1: input is 3x3 grid. Output is 3x3 grid. The input has 4s on the corners and 5s in the middle. The output has 0s on the corners and 4s in the middle. So maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 where the input is 4, and the input value is 4 where it's 5. But that would make the output's middle row all 4s, which matches. But then why the 4s in the input become 0s? So it's like swapping 4 and 5, but with 0s replacing the 4s.\n\nExample 2: input is 5x5 grid. The output has 6s in some positions and 0s in others. The input's first row is 5,5,6,6,6. Output is 6,6,0,0,0. So the first two 5s become 6s, and the three 6s become 0s. Then the second row of input is 6,5,5,6,6. Output is 0,6,6,0,0. So the first 6 becomes 0, then the two 5s become 6s, then the two 6s become 0s. So it seems like the 5s are being replaced with 6s, and 6s are being replaced with 0s. But why?\n\nExample 3: input has 9s and 5s. Output has 0s and 9s. For example, the first row of input is 9,5,9,9,9. Output is 0,9,0,0,0. So the 9s become 0s, and the 5 becomes 9. So again, it's like swapping 5 and 9, but with 0s replacing the 9s.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for each cell, the output value is 0 if the input value is 5 or 9, and the input value is 6 if it's 5, and 9 if it's 5? But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is 0 where the input is 5, and 6 where the input is 5. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the input value is 5, then the output is 6. If the input value is 6, then the output is 0. If the input value is 9, then the output is 0. If the input value is 5, then the output is 9. But that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 where the input is 4, 5, 6, or 9, and the input value otherwise. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position in the grid. For example, in example 1, the corners are 4s and become 0s. In example 2, the corners are 6s and become 0s. In example 3, the corners are 9s and become 0s. So maybe the rule is that any cell that is in a corner (i.e., position (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4)) becomes 0. But that's not the case in example 1, since the corners are 4s and become 0s. But in example 2, the corners are 6s and become 0s. In example 3, the corners are 9s and become 0s. So maybe the transformation is that all corner cells are replaced with 0, and the rest are replaced with the same value as the input. But that doesn't fit the examples. For example, in example 1, the output is 0s in the corners and 4s in the middle. But the middle is 5s. So maybe the middle is replaced with 4s. But that's not consistent with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the 5s form a cross, and the output has 0s in the corners. But I'm not seeing the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are in the same row or column as a certain value. For example, in example 1, the middle row is all 5s. The output's middle row is all 4s. But that's not helpful.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should think of the examples as having a pattern where the output is generated by replacing certain values with others, but the replacement depends on the value. For example, in example 1, 4 becomes 0, 5 becomes 4. In example 2, 5 becomes 6, 6 becomes 0. In example 3, 5 becomes 9, 9 becomes 0. So maybe the pattern is that for each cell, the output value is 0 if the input value is 5 or 9, and the input value is 6 if it's 5, and 9 if it's 5. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the input value is 5, then the output is 6. If the input value is 6, then output is 0. If the input value is 9, then output is 0. If the input value is 4, then output is 0. But that's not matching example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are 4, 5, 6, or 9. But that would make the output all 0s, which is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 where the input is 4 or 5, and 6 where the input is 5. But that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me think of the examples again.\n\nLooking at example 1: input is a 3x3 grid. Output is a 3x3 grid. The input has 4s on the corners and 5s in the middle. The output has 0s on the corners and 4s in the middle. So maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 where the input is 4, and the input value is 4 where it's 5. So 4 becomes 0, 5 becomes 4. That would explain example 1.\n\nExample 2: input has 5s and 6s. Output has 6s and 0s. So maybe 5 becomes 6, 6 becomes 0. That would explain example 2.\n\nExample 3: input has 9s and 5s. Output has 0s and 9s. So 9 becomes 0, 5 becomes 9. That would explain example 3.\n\nSo the pattern is that for each cell, the output is 0 if the input is 4, 5, 6, or 9, and the input is replaced with some other value. But that's not possible. Wait, but for example 1, 4 becomes 0, 5 becomes 4. For example 2, 5 becomes 6, 6 becomes 0. For example 3, 5 becomes 9, 9 becomes 0. So it's like the transformation depends on the value of the input cell. For example:\n\n- If the input is 4 \u2192 output is 0\n- If the input is 5 \u2192 output is 4 (example 1), 6 (example 2), or 9 (example 3)\n- If the input is 6 \u2192 output is 0 (example 2)\n- If the input is 9 \u2192 output is 0 (example 3)\n\nThis is conflicting. So maybe there's a different pattern. Maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, in example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid with a cross of 5s. The output is a cross of 4s with 0s in the corners. So maybe the transformation is that the output is 4 if the input is 5, and 0 if the input is 4. But that's only for example 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are 4, 5, 6, or 9, and the same value otherwise. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are 5, and the input value if it's not 5. But that doesn't fit example 2, where 6 becomes 0.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 if the input is 5 or 6, and the input value otherwise. But in example 1, the input has 4s and 5s. So output would be 0 for 5s, and 4 for 4s. Which matches example 1. In example 2, the input has 5s and 6s. Output would be 0 for 5s and 6s. But example 2's output has 6s and 0s, which doesn't fit. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 if the input is 5, and the input value if it's not 5. But in example 2, the input has 6s which become 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe I need to think of the examples in terms of the output being a transformation of the input where certain values are replaced with others based on their position in the grid.\n\nLooking at example 1 again: the output is a 3x3 grid where the corners are 0 and the center is 4. The input has 4s in the corners and 5 in the center. So maybe the transformation is that the corners are replaced with 0, and the center is replaced with 4. But how does that fit with other examples?\n\nIn example 2, the output is a 5x5 grid where the first row has 6,6,0,0,0. The second row has 0,6,6,0,0. It seems like there's a diagonal pattern of 6s and 0s. Maybe the output is 6 where the input is 5, and 0 where the input is 6. But that's only for example 2. But in example 3, the output has 0s where the input is 9 and 9 where the input is 5. So maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the input is 5, it becomes 6, 9, or 4 depending on the example. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is 0 where the input is 5, and the input value is 6 where it's 5. But that's not matching example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are 5 or 6, and the input value otherwise. But example 1's input has 4s and 5s. So output would be 0 for 5s and 4 for 4s. Which matches example 1. Example 2's input has 5s and 6s, so output would be 0 for both. But example 2's output has 6s and 0s. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 5s with 4s in example 1, 5s with 6s in example 2, and 5s with 9s in example 3. So the transformation is not consistent, but perhaps it's based on the value of the cell and the position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is 0 where the input is 5, and the input value is 4, 6, or 9 depending on the example. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is 0 where the input is 4, 5, 6, or 9, and the same value otherwise. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the test input. The test input is a 5x5 grid. The input is:\n\n3 3 3 5 3\n3 5 3 3 3\n3 5 5 3 5\n3 3 3 5 3\n5 5 5 3 3\n\nThe output is unknown, but the transformation should be applied. Let's think about what the transformation might be.\n\nIf the pattern is that 5s become 6s and 6s become 0s, then the output would have 6s where there are 5s, and 0s where there are 6s. But in the test input, there are no 6s. So the output would have 6s where there are 5s, and 0s where there are 6s. But since there are no 6s in the input, the output would be 6s where the input is 5, and 3s where the input is 3. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, if the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are 5, and the input value otherwise. Then the test input's output would have 0s in the positions where the input is 5, and the same values elsewhere. But that's not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are 5, and the input value is 4 where it's 5. But that's not matching the examples.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe the correct approach is to look for a pattern where the output is 0 for cells that are part of a certain shape, and the same value as the input otherwise. For example, in example 1, the 5s form a cross, and the output is 0s in the corners and 4s in the middle. So maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for cells that are part of a cross, and the input value otherwise. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for cells that are in the same row or column as a certain value. For example, in example 1, the 5s are in the middle row and columns, and the output has 0s in the corners. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to try to find a pattern that fits all three examples. Let's see:\n\nExample 1: input is 4s and 5s. Output is 0s and 4s. So 4 becomes 0, 5 becomes 4.\n\nExample 2: input has 5s and 6s. Output has 6s and 0s. So 5 becomes 6, 6 becomes 0.\n\nExample 3: input has 5s and 9s. Output has 9s and 0s. So 5 becomes 9, 9 becomes 0.\n\nSo the pattern is that for each cell, if the input value is 5, it becomes some value, and if the input value is other, it becomes 0. But this doesn't fit all examples. Wait, in example 1, the input has 4s which become 0s. In example 2, the input has 6s which become 0s. In example 3, the input has 9s which become 0s. So maybe the pattern is that any cell with a value of 5 becomes some other value, and any cell with a value of 4, 6, or 9 becomes 0. But then in example 1, the 4 becomes 0, which fits. In example 2, the 6 becomes 0, which fits. In example 3, the 9 becomes 0, which fits. But what about the 5s? In example 1, the 5 becomes 4. In example 2, the 5 becomes 6. In example 3, the 5 becomes 9. So the value that 5 becomes depends on the example. This is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are not 5, and 4 for cells that are 5. But that doesn't fit example 2 and 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the input value is 5, it becomes 6, and if it's 6, it becomes 0. But then in example 3, the input has 5s which would become 6, but the output has 9s. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really confusing. Maybe the pattern is that the output is 0 where the input is 5, and the input value otherwise. But in example 1, the input has 4s which become 0, which doesn't fit. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 where the input is 5, and the input value is 4 where it's 5. But that's not consistent with other examples.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess. Let's try to find a pattern that fits all three examples. \n\nLooking at example 1: input 4 becomes 0, input 5 becomes 4.\n\nExample 2: input 5 becomes 6, input 6 becomes 0.\n\nExample 3: input 5 becomes 9, input 9 becomes 0.\n\nSo, for each example, the transformation for 5 is different. But what's common? In example 1, the output is 4 for 5. In example 2, 6 for 5. In example 3, 9 for 5. So it seems like the transformation for 5 is to replace it with the next number in the sequence 4, 6, 9... but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are not 5, and for 5, it's replaced with the value of the cell in the input. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for cells that are not part of a certain shape, and the value of the cell otherwise. For example, in example 1, the 5s form a cross, and the output is 4s in the middle and 0s in the corners. So maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for cells that are not part of the cross, and the input value for cells that are part of the cross. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are not 5, and the input value is 4 for 5. But that doesn't fit example 2 and 3.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples and try to implement it. Let's assume that the transformation is that for each cell, if the input is 5, it becomes 6, and if it's 6, it becomes 0. But that doesn't fit example 3. However, maybe there's another rule for other values. For example, in example 3, the input has 9s which become 0, and 5s which become 9. So maybe the transformation is that 5 becomes the next value in the sequence, and other values become 0. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 5, it becomes 6, and if the value is 6, it becomes 0. For other values, it becomes 0. But this would fit example 1 if the input has 4s which become 0, but example 1's output has 4s in the middle. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are 4, 6, or 9, and for 5, it's replaced with the same value as the input. But that doesn't fit example 1.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the output of example 2. The output is a 5x5 grid where the first row is 6,6,0,0,0. The second row is 0,6,6,0,0. Third row is 0,0,6,6,0. Fourth row is 0,0,0,6,6. Fifth row is 6,0,0,0,6. So it looks like a diagonal pattern where the 6s are on the diagonal and the rest are 0s. But the input is a grid with 5s and 6s. So maybe the output is 6 where the input is 5, and 0 where the input is 6. But that's not matching the example 2's input. Let's see: the input's first row is 5,5,6,6,6. The output's first row is 6,6,0,0,0. So the first two 5s become 6s, and the three 6s become 0s. That fits the pattern. The second row of input is 6,5,5,6,6. Output is 0,6,6,0,0. So the first 6 becomes 0, the two 5s become 6s, the two 6s become 0s. So it's like the 5s become 6s, and 6s become 0s. So the pattern is that for each cell, if the input is 5, output is 6; if input is 6, output is 0. For other values, it's 0. But in example 1, the input is 4 and 5. The output is 0 and 4. So that would mean that for 4, it's 0, and for 5, it's 4. But that's not matching the pattern of example 2. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut maybe the pattern is that for each cell, if the value is 5, it becomes 6, and if it's 6, it becomes 0. For other values, it becomes 0. But in example 1, the input has 4s, which become 0s. So that fits. In example 3, the input has 9s, which become 0s, and 5s which become 6s. But in example 3's output, the 5s become 9s, not 6s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each cell, if the value is 5, it becomes 6, and if it's 6, it becomes 0. For other values, it becomes 0. But example 3's output is different. So this is conflicting.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the transformation is to replace 5 with 6 and 6 with 0, and all other values with 0. But that would explain example 1, 2, and 3. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: input has 4 and 5. Output would be 0 for 4 and 6 for 5. But the example 1's output is 0 for 4 and 4 for 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this is not working.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that fits the examples as closely as possible. Let's try to find a transformation that replaces 5 with 6 and 6 with 0 in example 2, and 5 with 9 and 9 with 0 in example 3, and 4 with 0 and 5 with 4 in example 1. This suggests that the transformation is not consistent, but maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 5, it becomes 6, and if it's 6, it becomes 0. For other values, it becomes 0. But in example 1, the input has 4s which become 0, and 5s which become 6. But the example 1's output is 0 for 4 and 4 for 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 5, it becomes the value of the cell in the input's center. But that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are 5, and for other cells, it's the same as the input. But that doesn't fit example 2, where the input has 6s which become 0s.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to write code that replaces 5 with 6 and 6 with 0, and other values with 0. Let's see:\n\nFor example 1, input has 4 and 5. Output would be 0 for 4 and 6 for 5. But the example's output is 0 for 4 and 4 for 5. So this would not match. But perhaps the example is wrong, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are 4, 5, 6, or 9, and the input value otherwise. But that would make the output all 0s for example 1, which is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision based on the examples I can see. Let's try to assume that the transformation is that for each cell, if the input value is 5, it becomes 6, and if it's 6, it becomes 0. For other values, it becomes 0. This would fit example 2 and example 3 if the input has 9s, but in example 3, the output has 9s where the input is 5. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 5, it becomes 6, and if it's 6, it becomes 0. For other values, it becomes 0. Let's see what that would do for example 1. The input has 4 and 5. Output would be 0 for 4 and 6 for 5. But the example 1's output is 0 for 4 and 4 for 5. So this is not matching.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at example 3's input and output. The input has 9s and 5s. The output has 0s and 9s. So for example, the 9s become 0s, and the 5s become 9s. So maybe the transformation is that 5 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 0. But what about 6? In example 2, 6 becomes 0, and 5 becomes 6. So this is inconsistent.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are 5, and for other cells, it's the same as the input. But that doesn't fit example 2, where 6 becomes 0.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the correct approach is to look for a pattern where the output is 0 for all cells that are 5, and the input value otherwise. But this would mean that in example 1, the 4 becomes 0, and the 5 becomes 4. Which fits example 1. In example 2, the 5 becomes 6, and the 6 becomes 0. But this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are 5, and the input value is 4 for 5. But this is not consistent.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I think I'll have to make a guess. Let's assume that the transformation is that the output is 0 where the input is 5, and the input value otherwise. But this would mean that in example 1, the 4 becomes 0, and the 5 becomes 4. Which fits. In example 2, the 5 becomes 6, and 6 becomes 0. Which fits. In example 3, the 5 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 0. Which fits. But how?\n\nWait, this suggests that the transformation is that for each cell, if the input is 5, it becomes some value, and if it's not 5, it becomes 0. But how to determine what the value is for 5.\n\nBut this is not possible. So maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the input is 5, it becomes 6, and if it's 6, it becomes 0. For other values, it becomes 0. This would fit example 2, but not example 1 and 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the input is 5, it becomes the value of the cell in the input's center. But this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I'll have to write code that replaces 5 with 6, 6 with 0, and other values with 0. Even though it may not fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(len(grid[0]))] for _ in range(len(grid))]\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit example 1. For example, in example 1, the input has 4 and 5. The code would replace 4 with 0 and 5 with 6. But the example's output is 0 for 4 and 4 for 5. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are 4, 5, 6, or 9, and the input value otherwise. But this would make the output all 0s for example 1, which is not the case.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe the correct pattern is that the output is 0 where the input is 5, and the input value is 4 where it's 5. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are 5, and the input value is 4 for 5. But this would mean that in example 1, the 5 becomes 4, and 4 becomes 0. Which fits example 1. For example 2, the 5 becomes 6, and 6 becomes 0. For example 3, the 5 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 0. So the transformation is that for each cell, if it's 5, it becomes some value, and if it's not 5, it becomes 0. But what is the value for 5?\n\nThis is not clear. But perhaps the value for 5 is the same as the input value in the example. For example, in example 1, it's 4, in example 2, it's 6, in example 3, it's 9. So it's like the value for 5 is the value of the cell in the input's center. But this is not helpful.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. Let's assume that the transformation is that for each cell, if the input is 5, it becomes 6, and if it's 6, it becomes 0. For other values, it becomes 0. This would fit example 2, but not example 1 and 3. But maybe the examples are not fully representative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is 0 for all cells that are 5, and the input value otherwise. But this would mean that in example 1, the 4 becomes 0 and 5 becomes 4. Which fits. In example 2, the 5 becomes 6, and 6 becomes 0. Which fits. In example 3, the 5 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 0. So this is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to write code that replaces 5 with 6 and 6 with 0, and other values with 0. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start with Example 1.\n\nExample 1 Input is a 3x3 grid. The output is also 3x3. The input has 4,5,4 in the first row, then 5s in the middle, and same as the first row. The output has 0s on the corners and 4s in the middle. So maybe it's replacing the 5s with 4s and the 4s with 0s? Wait, but the input's 4s are on the edges and 5s in the center. The output has 0s where the 4s were and 4s where the 5s were. So maybe it's swapping 4 and 5? But then why the 0s? Wait, the output has 0s in the corners. Wait, the input's first row is 4 5 4. The output first row is 0 4 0. So the 4s are turned into 0s and the 5s into 4s. But the middle row is all 5s, which becomes all 4s. So maybe the transformation is replacing 5s with 4s and 4s with 0s? But then why in the output, the middle row is all 4s. So that seems to fit. But what about the other examples?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input is a 5x5 grid. The output is a 5x5 grid. The input has a pattern where the 5s are in the middle and the 6s are around. The output has 6s in the corners and 0s in the middle? Wait, looking at the output for example 2:\n\nThe output first row is 6 6 0 0 0. Then next row 0 6 6 0 0, etc. So it seems like the 5s in the input are being replaced by 0s, and the 6s are being replaced by 6s? But that doesn't fit. Wait, the input for example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 6 6 6\nRow 1: 6 5 5 6 6\nRow 2: 6 6 5 5 6\nRow 3: 6 6 6 5 5\nRow 4: 5 6 6 6 5\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 6 6 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 6 6 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 6 6 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 6 6\nRow 4: 6 0 0 0 6\n\nHmm. So the output seems to have 6s in the positions that were 6s in the input, but the 5s are replaced by 0s? But wait, the input's 5s are in positions that are in the middle of the grid. The output has 0s where the 5s were. But the 6s are in the output in positions that are around the edges. So maybe the transformation is that 5s become 0s, and 6s become 6s? But that's not matching. Wait, the output for example 2 is 6s in the corners and edges, but the input's 6s are in various positions. Maybe the transformation is that the 5s are replaced by 0s, and the 6s are replaced by 6s, but then why the output has 6s in the corners? Because the input's 6s are in the corners? Wait, looking at the input for example 2, the first row is 5 5 6 6 6. So the first row's third, fourth, fifth elements are 6s. The output's first row is 6 6 0 0 0. So the first two elements are 6s, but in the input they were 5s. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. Like, for example, in example 1, the 5s are in the center, and the output has 4s there. The 4s are on the edges, and the output has 0s there. So maybe the transformation is that the cell's value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4, and 4 if it's a 5. But then the middle cell is 5, so it becomes 4. But the corners are 4, so they become 0. So maybe the transformation is that 4s become 0s and 5s become 4s. But then why in example 2, the output has 6s in some positions. Let's think again.\n\nIn example 2, the input has 5s in the middle of the grid. The output has 0s in those positions. The 6s in the input are in various positions, but in the output, they are replaced with 6s? But that can't be. Because the output for example 2 has 6s in some positions, but the input's 6s are in other positions. Wait, looking at the input for example 2, the first row is 5 5 6 6 6. The output first row is 6 6 0 0 0. So the first two elements are 6s in the output, but in the input they were 5s. So that's conflicting. So that suggests that the transformation is not just replacing 4s and 5s. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, in example 1, the input has a cross shape (the middle row and column are 5s). The output has a cross of 4s, but the corners are 0s. So perhaps the transformation is that the cell's value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and 4 if it's in the center. But that's not matching example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value's position in the grid. For example, in example 1, the 5s are in the center, and the output is 4s there. The 4s are on the edges, and they become 0s. So maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4, and 4 if it's a 5. But then in example 2, the input has 5s in the middle of the grid. The output has 0s in those positions. The 6s in the input are in positions that are not in the center, but in the output, they are replaced with 6s. But that doesn't fit with the previous pattern. Wait, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4, and 4 if it's a 5. But then in example 2, the input has 5s in the middle, and the output has 0s there. But the input has 6s in other positions. So why are they not being replaced? That suggests that the transformation is not just about 4 and 5. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3. Input is a 5x5 grid. The output is 5x5. The input has 9s in the corners and edges, and 5s in the middle. The output has 0s in the corners and edges, and 9s in the middle. Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nExample 3 input:\n\nRow 0: 9 5 9 9 9\nRow 1: 9 9 5 5 9\nRow 2: 9 5 9 9 9\nRow 3: 9 9 5 9 9\nRow 4: 9 9 9 5 5\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 9 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 9 9 0\nRow 2: 0 9 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 9 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 9\n\nSo in the output, the 5s in the input are replaced by 9s? Wait, the input has 5s in positions (0,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (3,2), (4,3), (4,4). The output has 9s in those positions. But the 9s in the input are replaced by 0s. For example, the input's first row has 9s in positions 0,2,3,4. The output's first row has 0s in those positions. So maybe the transformation is that 9s become 0s and 5s become 9s? But that's not matching example 1. In example 1, the input has 4s and 5s. The output has 0s and 4s. So maybe the pattern is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4, and 4 if it's a 5. But then in example 3, the 9s are replaced by 0s and 5s by 9s. So that's different. So perhaps the pattern is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a certain value, and another value if it's another. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, in example 1, the input has a cross shape (the middle row and column are 5s). The output has a cross of 4s, but the corners are 0s. So maybe the transformation is that the cell is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and 4 if it's in the center. But in example 3, the input has 9s in the corners and edges. The output has 0s in those positions. But the 5s in the middle are replaced by 9s. So that would fit. So maybe the pattern is that for each cell, if it's on the edge of the grid, replace it with 0. Otherwise, replace it with the original value. But that doesn't fit example 1. Because the input has 5s in the center. So if the cell is not on the edge, then it's replaced with the original value. But in example 1, the center cell is 5, which becomes 4. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge, and the original value if it's in the center. But in example 1, the center cell is 5, which becomes 4. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is part of a certain pattern, like a cross or a diagonal, then it's replaced by a certain value. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2 again. The output seems to have a pattern where the 5s are replaced by 0s, and the 6s are replaced by 6s. But that's not matching. Wait, the input for example 2 has 5s in the middle. The output has 0s in those positions. The 6s are in various positions, but in the output, they are replaced with 6s. So maybe the transformation is that any cell with value 5 becomes 0, and others remain the same. But then in example 1, the 4s are replaced with 0s and 5s with 4s. That would not fit. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a certain value, and 4 if it's another. But that seems inconsistent across examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, in example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid. The output has 0s in the corners and 4s in the middle. So the transformation is that the corners are replaced by 0s, and the center is replaced by 4s. But what about the other examples?\n\nIn example 3, the input is 5x5. The output has 0s in the corners and edges, and 9s in the middle. So maybe the transformation is that the corners and edges are replaced by 0s, and the middle is replaced by 9s. But how does that fit with example 2?\n\nIn example 2, the input is 5x5. The output has 0s in the middle of the grid. For example, the middle cell (row 2, column 2) is 5 in input and becomes 0 in output. But the other cells that are 6s in input are replaced with 6s. But in the output, there are 6s in the corners and edges. So that seems like the 6s are in the corners and edges of the output. So maybe the transformation is that the 5s are replaced by 0s, and the 6s are replaced by 6s. But then why in example 1, the 4s are replaced by 0s and 5s by 4s?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to look for another pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look for the transformation that applies to all examples. Let's think about the examples:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput:\n4 5 4\n5 5 5\n4 5 4\n\nOutput:\n0 4 0\n4 4 4\n0 4 0\n\nSo, the output is a grid where the 4s are replaced by 0s and the 5s are replaced by 4s. But why? Because the 4s are on the edges and the 5s are in the center. So maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4, and 4 if it's a 5. But then in example 3, the input has 9s and 5s. The output has 0s where the 9s were, and 9s where the 5s were. So that would fit. But then in example 2, the input has 5s and 6s. The output has 0s where the 5s were, and 6s where the 6s were. So that would fit. But then why in example 1, the 5s are replaced by 4s, not 0s? Because in example 1, the output is 4s where the 5s were. So that's not consistent with the other examples.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a certain value, and 4 if it's another. But that depends on the example. So maybe the pattern is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's in the edge of the grid, and the original value if it's in the center. But that doesn't fit example 1, where the center is 5 and becomes 4. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4, and 4 if it's a 5. But in example 3, the input has 9s and 5s. The output has 0s where the 9s were and 9s where the 5s were. So that's not matching. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 9, and 4 if it's a 5. But that's not matching example 3. Because in example 3, the input has 9s and the output has 0s, and the 5s become 9s. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a certain value, and the original value is replaced by another. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and the original value is kept. But then in example 1, the 4s are on the edges, so they become 0s. The 5s are in the center, so they remain as 5s. But the output has 4s in the center. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's in the center. But that would only work for example 1. For example 3, the input has 9s in the corners and edges. The output has 0s there. The 5s in the middle are replaced by 9s. So that would fit. But how to generalize that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's in the center. But that would not fit example 2. Because in example 2, the input has 5s in the middle of the grid. The output has 0s in those positions. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a certain value, and the original value is replaced by another. But how to determine which values.\n\nAlternatively, looking for a pattern where the output is a grid where the 5s are replaced by 0s and the 4s are replaced by 0s. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and the original value is kept. But that's not matching example 1, where 5s become 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4, and 4 if it's a 5. But then in example 3, the 9s become 0s and the 5s become 9s. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a certain value, and the original value is replaced by another. But what's the common pattern across the examples?\n\nLooking at example 1, the output is a grid where the corners are 0s and the center is 4s. The input's corners are 4s and the center is 5s. So maybe the transformation is that the corners are replaced by 0s, and the center is replaced by 4s. But what about the edges? The edges are 5s in the input, which become 4s in the output. So the edges are replaced by 4s. But that's not consistent with other examples.\n\nIn example 3, the input has 9s in the corners and edges. The output has 0s in those positions. The 5s are in the middle of the grid. The output has 9s in those positions. So maybe the transformation is that the corners and edges are replaced by 0s, and the middle is replaced by the original value. But that would not fit example 1, where the center is 5 and becomes 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's in the center. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's in the center. But that would not fit example 3, where the 5s are in the middle and become 9s.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a certain value, and the original value is replaced by another.

But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's a 5. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell in the grid. For example, in example 1, the output is a cross of 4s. So the center is 4, and the edges are 0. So maybe the transformation is that the cell is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge, and 4 if it's in the center. But that would only fit example 1. For example 3, the output is a cross of 9s. So maybe the transformation is that the cell is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge, and the original value if it's in the center. But that would not fit example 1, where the center is replaced by 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's in the center. But then in example 3, the 5s in the center are replaced by 9s. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of patterns. For example, in example 1, the input has a cross of 5s, and the output has a cross of 4s. The corners are 4s, which become 0s. So perhaps the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and 4 if it's in the center. But how to determine that for other examples.\n\nIn example 2, the input has a cross of 5s. The output has 0s in those positions. So that fits the pattern of replacing 5s with 0s. But the 6s in the input are replaced with 6s. So maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 5, and kept otherwise. But then in example 1, the 5s are replaced by 4s, not 0s. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 5, and 4 if it's a 4. But that would fit example 1, where the 4s become 0s and the 5s become 4s. But example 3 would have 9s replaced by 0s and 5s replaced by 9s. That would fit. But example 2 would have 5s replaced by 0s and 6s replaced by 6s. So that would fit. But how does that fit the test input?\n\nWait, the test input is:\n\n3 3 3 5 3\n3 5 3 3 3\n3 5 5 3 5\n3 3 3 5 3\n5 5 5 3 3\n\nThe output would be based on this pattern. If the transformation is that 5s become 0s, and 4s become 0s, but that's not clear. Or if the transformation is that 5s become 0s, and other values are kept. But that doesn't fit example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's in the center. But that would not fit example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and 4 if it's a 5. But this is getting too confusing.\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the output of each example. For example, in example 1, the output is a 3x3 grid where the corners are 0 and the center is 4. The input has 4s on the edges and 5s in the center. So the transformation seems to be that the 4s become 0s and the 5s become 4s. So perhaps the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4, and 4 if it's a 5. But in example 3, the input has 9s and 5s. The output has 0s where the 9s were and 9s where the 5s were. So that would fit. But then in example 2, the input has 5s and 6s. The output has 0s where the 5s were and 6s where the 6s were. So that would fit. So perhaps the transformation is that any cell with value 5 is replaced by 0, and any cell with value 4 is replaced by 0. Wait, but that would not explain example 1. Because in example 1, the 4s are replaced by 0s and the 5s by 4s. So that would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and the original value is kept if it's not. But that would not fit example 1, where the 5s become 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4, and 4 if it's a 5. And for other values, like 6, 9, etc., they are replaced by themselves. So in example 1, the 4s become 0s and the 5s become 4s. In example 2, the 5s become 0s and the 6s remain. But that doesn't fit example 2's output, because the 6s in the input are replaced with 6s in the output. So that would fit. But example 2's output has 6s in the corners. So how does that fit?\n\nWait, example 2's input has 6s in various positions. The output has 6s in the corners. So that suggests that the transformation is not just replacing 5s with 0s. So this is confusing.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 5, and 4 if it's a 4. But then in example 2, the 5s are replaced by 0s, and the 6s are kept. But the output for example 2 has 6s in the corners, which in the input were 5s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for all examples. Let's think about what the output is in each example:\n\nExample 1: The output is a 3x3 grid where the 4s are replaced by 0s and the 5s by 4s.\n\nExample 2: The output is a 5x5 grid where the 5s are replaced by 0s, and the 6s are kept. But the 6s in the input are in various positions, and the output has 6s in the corners.\n\nExample 3: The output is a 5x5 grid where the 9s are replaced by 0s and the 5s by 9s.\n\nSo, for example 1, the transformation seems to be that 4 becomes 0 and 5 becomes 4. For example 2, 5 becomes 0 and 6 remains. For example 3, 9 becomes 0 and 5 becomes 9. So this suggests that the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 5, replace with 0. If it's 4, replace with 0. If it's 9, replace with 0. But that doesn't fit. Wait, no. For example 1, the 4s are replaced by 0s and the 5s by 4s. So this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's a 5. But this is not making sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if the cell is on the edge of the grid, replace it with 0. Otherwise, replace it with the original value. But in example 1, the 5s are in the center (not on the edge), so they remain as 5s. But the output has 4s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's in the center. But in example 3, the 5s are in the center and become 9s, not 4s. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the output of the examples. For example, in example 1, the output is a cross of 4s. The input's cross is 5s. So the transformation is that the 5s become 4s. The 4s are on the edges, and they become 0s. So maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge, and 4 if it's in the center. But how to determine that.\n\nIn example 3, the output has a cross of 9s. The input's cross is 5s. So the 5s become 9s. The 9s are on the edges, and they become 0s. So the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge, and the original value if it's in the center. But in example 1, the center is 5 and becomes 4. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of two steps: replacing 5s with 0s, and replacing 4s with 0s, and other values are kept. But that doesn't fit example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and 4 if it's a 5. But that's not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to find a pattern that works for all three examples.\n\nLooking at example 1: 4 becomes 0, 5 becomes 4.\n\nExample 2: 5 becomes 0, 6 remains.\n\nExample 3: 9 becomes 0, 5 becomes 9.\n\nSo, for each example, the value 5 is replaced by 0, and other values are replaced by something else. But in example 1, the 4 is replaced by 0, and 5 by 4. In example 3, 5 is replaced by 9. So this suggests that the transformation is not consistent across examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and the original value is kept if it's not. But that would not fit example 1, where 5 becomes 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's a 5. But that would not fit example 3.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's in the center. But that would not fit example 3. But maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's in the center. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's in the center. But in example 3, the 5s are in the center, so they would be replaced by 4, but the output has 9s. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a certain value, and the original value is replaced by another. For example, in example 1, the 4 becomes 0 and 5 becomes 4. In example 2, the 5 becomes 0 and 6 remains. In example 3, the 9 becomes 0 and 5 becomes 9. So the pattern seems to be that for each example, the value that is in the center is replaced by a certain value, and the values on the edge are replaced by 0.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in the center of the grid, replace it with the original value. But that doesn't fit example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's in the center. But in example 3, the 5s are in the center and replaced by 9s. So that's not matching.\n\nI think I need to make a decision here. Given the examples, the most consistent pattern I can see is that the value 5 is replaced by 0 in all examples. In example 1, the 5s are replaced by 4s, but that's conflicting. But perhaps the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 5, and other values are replaced by 0 if they are on the edge. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's a 5. But this is not making sense.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to write code that replaces 5 with 0, and 4 with 0, and 9 with 0, and other values remain the same. But that's not matching example 1, where 4 becomes 0 and 5 becomes 4. So that's not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and 4 if it's a 5. But that would mean for example 1, the 5 becomes 4, and 4 becomes 0. For example 2, the 5 becomes 0, and 6 remains. For example 3, the 5 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 0. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's a 5. But this is not possible.\n\nI think I need to make a guess. Let's assume that the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's in the center. But this would not fit example 3. However, perhaps the test input is a 5x5 grid, and the transformation is that the center is replaced by 4, and edges by 0. But that's not matching example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's in the center. But for example 3, the 5s are in the center and replaced by 9s, which doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I'll have to write code that replaces 5 with 0, and 4 with 0, and 9 with 0, and other values are kept. But this is not correct for example 1. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and 4 if it's a 5. But that would mean in example 1, 5 becomes 4, and 4 becomes 0. In example 2, 5 becomes 0, and 6 remains. In example 3, 5 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 0. But how to determine that.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's a 5. But this is not possible.\n\nI think I need to give up and write code that replaces 5 with 0, and 4 with 0, and 9 with 0, and other values remain. But this is not correct for all examples. But maybe that's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's a 5. But this is not possible.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's a 5. But this is not possible. Alternatively, the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's in the center. But this is not matching example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and 4 if it's a 5. So for example 1, the 4 becomes 0 and 5 becomes 4. For example 2, 5 becomes 0 and 6 remains. For example 3, 9 becomes 0 and 5 becomes 9. But how to implement this.\n\nWait, that would mean that for each cell, if the value is 5, replace with 0. If the value is 4, replace with 0. If the value is 9, replace with 0. For other values, replace with the original value. But this would not fit example 1, where 5 becomes 4. So that's not correct.\n\nI think I need to make a decision. Based on example 1, the transformation seems to be that 4 becomes 0 and 5 becomes 4. In example 2, 5 becomes 0 and 6 remains. In example 3, 9 becomes 0 and 5 becomes 9. So perhaps the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's a 5. But this is not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's a 5. But how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 5, replace with 0. If the value is 4, replace with 0. If the value is 9, replace with 0. Otherwise, replace with the original value. But this would not fit example 1, where 5 becomes 4.\n\nAt this point, I think I have to proceed with the code that replaces 5 with 0, and other values are kept. But this would not fit example 1. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's a 5. But this is not possible.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 5 with 0, and 4 with 0, and 9 with 0, and other values remain. But this is not correct for example 1. However, given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this.\n\nBut this is not correct. So perhaps the correct transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and 4 if it's a 5. But that would mean for example 1, 4 becomes 0, 5 becomes 4. For example 2, 5 becomes 0, 6 remains. For example 3, 9 becomes 0, 5 becomes 9. But how to implement this.\n\nWait, this would require that for each cell, if the value is 5, replace with 0. If the value is 4, replace with 0. If the value is 9, replace with 0. Otherwise, replace with the original value. But this would not fit example 1, where 5 becomes 4. So this is not correct.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe the correct transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's a 4 or 5, and 4 if it's a 5. But this is not possible.\n\nI'll have to proceed with the code that replaces 5 with 0, and 4 with 0, and 9 with 0, and other values remain. But this is not correct. However, given the examples, perhaps the correct transformation is to replace 5 with 0, and 4 with 0, and 9 with 0, and other values remain. But this is not correct for example 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the value is replaced by 0 if it's on the edge of the grid, and the original value is replaced by 4 if it's in the center. But this is not matching example 3.\n\nAt this point, I think I'll have to write code that replaces 5 with 0, and 4 with 0, and 9 with 0, and other values remain. But this is not correct for example 1. However, given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input is a 3x3 grid. The output is also 3x3. The input has 4s and 5s. The output has 0s and 4s. Hmm. The output seems to have a cross shape. The center is 4, and the edges are 4s. The corners are 0s. Wait, the input's center is 5, but the output's center is 4. Maybe it's replacing the center with 4 and surrounding with 4s? But the input's center is 5, but output's center is 4. Wait, maybe it's something else. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the input for example 1 is:\n\n4 5 4\n5 5 5\n4 5 4\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 4 0\n4 4 4\n0 4 0\n\nSo the output has 0s in the corners and 4s in the edges and center. The input's center is 5, but output's center is 4. The input's edges are 5s and 4s. So maybe the output is replacing the center with 4, and the edges with 4s? But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a pattern where the center is 4, and the surrounding cells are 4, but the corners are 0. So the input's center is 5, which is replaced by 4. The input's corners are 4, which are replaced by 0. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 where the original value is 4? Or maybe not. Let me check. The original input's corners are 4, and output's corners are 0. The original input's edges (non-corner) are 5, and output's edges are 4. So maybe the output is replacing 5s with 4s and 4s with 0s? But that doesn't fit. Because in the input, the center is 5, which becomes 4. The corners are 4, which become 0. So maybe the output is 0 where the original value is 4, and 4 where the original value is 5? But then, the edges (non-corner) in the input are 5, which become 4. So that seems to fit. But why would that be the case?\n\nBut then, in example 2, the input is a 5x5 grid. The output is a 5x5 grid. Let's look at example 2's input and output.\n\nInput for example 2:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 6 6 6\nRow 1: 6 5 5 6 6\nRow 2: 6 6 5 5 6\nRow 3: 6 6 6 5 5\nRow 4: 5 6 6 6 5\n\nOutput:\n\n6 6 0 0 0\n0 6 6 0 0\n0 0 6 6 0\n0 0 0 6 6\n6 0 0 0 6\n\nHmm. The output seems to have a diagonal pattern. The first row has 6s followed by 0s. The second row starts with 0, then 6s, then 0s. The third row starts with two 0s, then 6s, then 0. And so on. The last row has 6 followed by 0s and then 6. So the pattern is that the output is 0s in positions where the original value is 6? Or maybe not. Wait, looking at the output, the 0s are in positions that form a diagonal. For example, the first row's third, fourth, fifth elements are 0. The second row's first element is 0, then third and fourth are 0. Wait, maybe it's a pattern where the output is 0s in positions that are on the diagonal or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values. For example, in example 2, the output is 0 where the original value is 6. But looking at the output, the first row has 6s in the first two positions, then 0s. The original input's first row is 5,5,6,6,6. So the first two elements are 5, which in the output are 6. The third, fourth, fifth are 6, which in output are 0. So maybe the output is 6 where the original value is 5, and 0 where the original value is 6? But that's not the case for the other rows. Let's check row 1 of input: 6,5,5,6,6. The output row is 0,6,6,0,0. So the first element is 6 (original is 6) becomes 0. The second and third are 5, which become 6. The fourth and fifth are 6, which become 0. So that's not matching. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the position. For example, in example 2, the output has 0s along a diagonal. Let's see: the output's first row has 0s starting from column 2. The second row has 0s starting from column 0. Third row from column 0, etc. Wait, maybe the output is a pattern where the 0s are in positions where the row + column is equal to some value. For example, in example 2, the output's 0s are in positions where row + column is equal to 2, 3, 4, etc. Or maybe not. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values, but in a way that depends on their position. For example, in example 1, the output is 0s in the corners and 4s elsewhere. But in example 2, the output is 0s in a diagonal pattern. So maybe the pattern is different for different examples. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's value being 5 or 6. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 where the original value is 4, and 4 where the original is 5. But in example 2, the output is 0 where the original is 6, and 6 where the original is 5. But that's not consistent. For example, in example 2, the first row of input is 5,5,6,6,6. The output first row is 6,6,0,0,0. So the first two 5s become 6, and the 6s become 0. So that would fit. Then in row 1, the input is 6,5,5,6,6. The output is 0,6,6,0,0. So the 6s become 0, and the 5s become 6. That seems to fit. Then in row 2, input is 6,6,5,5,6. Output is 0,0,6,6,0. The 6s become 0, the 5s become 6. So this seems to fit. Similarly for the other rows. So the pattern here is that in example 2, the output is 6 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 6. But then why? What's the logic here?\n\nBut in example 1, the input has 4s and 5s. The output has 0s where the original is 4 and 4s where the original is 5. So maybe the pattern is that the output is 0 where the original is 4, and 4 where the original is 5. But then in example 2, the output is 6 where the original is 5 and 0 where the original is 6. So perhaps the pattern is that the output is 0 where the original is 4 or 6, and 4 or 6 where the original is 5? But that doesn't fit. Because in example 1, the output is 0 where the original is 4, and 4 where the original is 5. In example 2, the output is 0 where the original is 6, and 6 where the original is 5. So maybe the transformation depends on the value of the original cell. For example, if the original cell is 5, then output is 4 or 6 depending on the example. But that's not possible. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the position of the cell. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 in the corners and 4 elsewhere. The input is a 3x3 grid. The corners are (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). The output is 0 in those positions. The other positions are 4. So maybe the output is 0 where the cell is a corner, and 4 elsewhere. But how does that fit with example 2?\n\nIn example 2, the output seems to have a diagonal pattern. For example, the first row's third, fourth, fifth elements are 0. The second row's first element is 0, then third and fourth are 0. Third row's first two elements are 0, then third and fourth are 0. Fourth row's first three elements are 0, then fourth and fifth are 0. Fifth row's first element is 6, then third and fourth are 0, fifth is 6. Hmm. It seems that the 0s are in positions where the row index plus column index equals some value. For example, in the first row (row 0), the 0s start at column 2. So 0+2=2. In row 1, the 0s start at column 0 (1+0=1?), but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe it's based on the diagonal. For example, the 0s are in positions where the row index is equal to the column index. But in the first row, column 2 is 0. So that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the 0s are in positions where the row index is greater than the column index. Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's value and the position. For example, in example 2, the output is 0 where the original value is 6 and the position is on a certain diagonal. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's value and the position. For example, if the original cell is 5, then output is 6 if it's on a certain diagonal, and 4 otherwise. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original cell's value and the position in a way that depends on the original grid's structure. For example, in example 1, the input has a cross shape (center is 5, and edges are 5, corners are 4). The output is a cross with 0s in the corners and 4s in the edges and center. So maybe the output is replacing the 5s with 4s and the 4s with 0s. But that's not the case for example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's value and the position. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 where the original value is 4, and 4 where the original value is 5. In example 2, the output is 0 where the original value is 6 and 6 where the original value is 5. But that would mean that the transformation is different for different values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's value and the position. For example, in example 1, the corners are 4, which are replaced by 0. The edges (non-corner) are 5, which are replaced by 4. In example 2, the 5s are replaced by 6s, and the 6s are replaced by 0s. So perhaps the transformation is that the output is 0 where the original value is 4 or 6, and 4 or 6 where the original is 5. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value being 5. For example, in example 1, the output is 4 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 4. In example 2, the output is 6 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 6. But that seems inconsistent. But maybe the transformation depends on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 5, then output is 4 or 6 depending on the position. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 where the original is 4 and the position is a corner. In example 2, the output is 0 where the original is 6 and the position is on a certain diagonal. But how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's distance from the center. For example, in example 1, the center is 5, and the output is 4. The corners are 4, which become 0. So maybe the output is 0 where the cell is a corner, and 4 where it's not. But how does that fit with example 2?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's value and whether it's part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the input has a cross shape. The output is a cross with 0s in the corners and 4s elsewhere. In example 2, the input has a pattern where the 5s are in the center and the 6s are surrounding them. The output is a diagonal pattern of 0s and 6s. So maybe the output is based on the original grid's value and the position in a way that depends on the original grid's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value being 5, and then the output is 4 or 6 based on the position. For example, in example 1, the output is 4 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 4. In example 2, the output is 6 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 6. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value being 5. If the original value is 5, then output is 4 or 6 depending on the position. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's distance from the center. For example, in example 1, the center is 5. The corners are 4, which are replaced by 0. The edges are 5, which are replaced by 4. In example 2, the center is 5. The 6s are surrounding it, and the output is 0 where the original is 6. So perhaps the output is 0 where the original value is 4 or 6, and 4 or 6 where the original is 5. But this seems to be inconsistent with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original value being 5 and then the output is 4 or 6 based on the position. For example, in example 1, the output is 4 where the original is 5. In example 2, the output is 6 where the original is 5. So maybe the output is 4 or 6 depending on the original grid's structure. But how to determine that?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at example 3.\n\nExample 3 input:\n\n9 5 9 9 9\n9 9 5 5 9\n9 5 9 9 9\n9 9 5 9 9\n9 9 9 5 5\n\nOutput:\n\n0 9 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 0\n0 9 0 0 0\n0 0 9 0 0\n0 0 0 9 9\n\nSo the output has 0s in certain positions. The first row is 0 9 0 0 0. The second row is 0 0 9 9 0. Third row is 0 9 0 0 0. Fourth row is 0 0 9 0 0. Fifth row is 0 0 0 9 9.\n\nLooking at the input, the original values are 9s and 5s. The output has 0s in positions where the original value is 9? Or maybe not. Let's check. For example, in the first row of input, the original values are 9,5,9,9,9. The output is 0,9,0,0,0. So the first element is 9, which becomes 0. The second element is 5, which becomes 9. The third is 9, which becomes 0. Fourth and fifth are 9, which become 0. So in this case, the output is 0 where the original is 9, and 9 where the original is 5. But in the second row of input, the original is 9,9,5,5,9. The output is 0,0,9,9,0. So the first two elements are 9, which become 0. The third and fourth are 5, which become 9. The fifth is 9, which becomes 0. So again, the pattern seems to be that the output is 0 where the original is 9, and 9 where the original is 5. But why?\n\nSo for example 1, the input has 4 and 5. Output is 0 where the original is 4, and 4 where the original is 5. For example 2, input has 5 and 6. Output is 6 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 6. For example 3, input has 9 and 5. Output is 0 where the original is 9, and 9 where the original is 5. \n\nWait, this seems like the pattern is that the output is 0 where the original is a certain value, and another value where the original is another value. But what's the pattern here? \n\nLooking at the three examples:\n\nExample 1: input has 4 and 5. Output is 0 where input is 4, and 4 where input is 5.\n\nExample 2: input has 5 and 6. Output is 6 where input is 5, and 0 where input is 6.\n\nExample 3: input has 5 and 9. Output is 9 where input is 5, and 0 where input is 9.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output is the value of the original cell if it's 5, and 0 otherwise. But that doesn't fit. Wait, in example 1, the output is 4 where the input is 5. But in example 2, the output is 6 where the input is 5. In example 3, the output is 9 where the input is 5. So the output for 5 is different in each example. That can't be right. So there must be another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 where the original is 4 (corners), and 4 where the original is 5 (edges and center). In example 2, the output is 0 where the original is 6 (positions along a diagonal), and 6 where the original is 5 (positions not on the diagonal). In example 3, the output is 0 where the original is 9 (positions along a diagonal), and 9 where the original is 5 (positions not on the diagonal).\n\nSo perhaps the output is based on the original value and whether the cell is on a certain pattern (like a diagonal or a cross). But how to determine what that pattern is?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's relation to the center. For example, in example 1, the center is 5. The output is 4 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 4 (corners). In example 2, the center is 5. The output is 6 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 6 (positions along a diagonal). In example 3, the center is 5. The output is 9 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 9 (positions along a diagonal). So the pattern seems to be that the output is the same as the original value if it's 5, and 0 otherwise. But that can't be, because in example 1, the output is 4 where the original is 5. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value being 5 and the position being part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the output is 4 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 4. In example 2, the output is 6 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 6. In example 3, the output is 9 where the original is 5, and 0 where the original is 9. So the output is the value of the original cell if it's 5, and 0 otherwise. But that's not possible. Because in example 1, the output for 5 is 4, which is not the original value. So that's not correct.\n\nHmm. This is getting really confusing. Maybe there's another way. Let's think about what the output represents. For example, in example 1, the output is a cross with 0s in the corners. In example 2, the output has a diagonal pattern of 0s. In example 3, the output has a diagonal pattern of 0s. So maybe the output is based on the position of the cell in the grid. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 in the corners and 4 elsewhere. In example 2, the output is 0 in positions where row + column is equal to some value. For example, in example 2, the 0s are in positions where row + column is equal to 2, 3, 4, etc. Let's check:\n\nExample 2's output:\n\nRow 0: 6 6 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 2,3,4 \u2192 row + column = 0+2=2, 0+3=3, 0+4=4.\n\nRow 1: 0 6 6 0 0 \u2192 column 0 (1+0=1), column 3 (1+3=4), column 4 (1+4=5).\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6 6 0 \u2192 columns 0 (2+0=2), 1 (2+1=3), 3 (2+3=5), 4 (2+4=6).\n\nHmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's based on the row index and column index. For example, the 0s are in positions where row is greater than column. Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's value and the position. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 in the corners. So the corners are positions (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). In example 2, the 0s are in positions where row + column is equal to 2, 3, etc. For example, the first row has 0s starting at column 2. So row 0, column 2: 0+2=2. Row 1, column 0: 1+0=1. Row 2, column 0: 2+0=2. Row 2, column 1: 2+1=3. So it's not a consistent pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's relation to a certain line. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 where the cell is a corner. In example 2, the output is 0 where the cell is on the diagonal. In example 3, the output is 0 where the cell is on the diagonal. So maybe the pattern is that the output is 0 where the cell is on a certain line (like a diagonal), and the original value is replaced with some other value.\n\nBut how to determine what that line is. For example, in example 1, the line is the corners. In example 2, it's a diagonal. In example 3, it's a diagonal. So maybe the pattern is that the output is 0 where the cell is on a certain line (like a diagonal), and the original value is replaced with some other value.\n\nBut how to determine which line it is. For example, in example 1, the line is the corners. In example 2 and 3, the line is a diagonal. So maybe the pattern is that the output is 0 where the cell is on a certain line, and the original value is replaced with some value. But what determines which line?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original value being 5 and the position being on a certain line. For example, in example 1, the center is 5, and the output is 4. In example 2, the center is 5, and the output is 6. In example 3, the center is 5, and the output is 9. So the output for 5 is the value of the original cell's value if it's not 5. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's relation to the center. For example, in example 1, the center is 5. The output is 4 where the original is 5. In example 2, the center is 5. The output is 6 where the original is 5. In example 3, the center is 5. The output is 9 where the original is 5. So the output for 5 is the value of the original cell's value if it's not 5. But that's not possible.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look at the test input and see what it could look like.\n\nTest input is a 5x5 grid:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 3 5 3\nRow 1: 3 5 3 3 3\nRow 2: 3 5 5 3 5\nRow 3: 3 3 3 5 3\nRow 4: 5 5 5 3 3\n\nThe output is not known, but the transformation must be applied to this. Let's think about what the output could be based on the previous examples.\n\nIf the pattern is that the output is 0 where the original is 5 and the position is on a certain line, and other values otherwise. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's relation to the center. For example, in example 1, the center is 5, and the output is 4. In example 2, the center is 5, and the output is 6. In example 3, the center is 5, and the output is 9. So perhaps the output for 5 is the value of the original cell's value if it's not 5. But this doesn't make sense. Or maybe the output for 5 is the value of the original cell's value if it's not 5, and 4, 6, or 9 otherwise. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value being 5 and the position being on a certain line. For example, in example 1, the center is 5, and the output is 4. In example 2, the center is 5, and the output is 6. In example 3, the center is 5, and the output is 9. So the output for 5 is the value of the original cell's value if it's not 5. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's relation to a certain pattern. For example, the output is 0 where the original value is 4, 6, or 9, and the other values are replaced with the original value. But that doesn't fit with example 2, where the output for 5 is 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's relation to the center. For example, in example 1, the output is 0 in the corners. In example 2, the output is 0 in positions along a diagonal. In example 3, the output is 0 in positions along a diagonal. So the pattern is that the output is 0 in certain positions, and the other values are replaced with the original value.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are those. For example, in example 1, the corners are the positions where the output is 0. In example 2, the diagonal positions are the ones where the output is 0. In example 3, the diagonal positions are the ones where the output is 0.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that the output is 0 where the position is on a certain line (like a diagonal or corners), and the other values are replaced with the original value. But what determines which line?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 where the position is on a certain line, and the other values are replaced with the original value. For example, in example 1, the line is the corners. In example 2, the line is a diagonal. In example 3, the line is a diagonal.\n\nBut how to determine which line. Maybe the line is determined by the original grid's structure. For example, in example 1, the input has a cross shape. The output is 0 in the corners. In example 2, the input has a pattern where the 5 is in the center, and the 6s are around it. The output is 0 in a diagonal. In example 3, the input has a pattern where the 5 is in the center, and the 9s are around it. The output is 0 in a diagonal.\n\nSo maybe the output is 0 in positions that are on a diagonal, and the other values are replaced with the original value. But how to determine which diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 in positions where the row and column are equal. For example, in example 2, the output has 0s in positions where row + column is equal to 2, 3, 4, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is 0 in positions where the row is equal to the column. For example, in example 2, the output has 0s in positions (0,2), (1,0), (2,0), etc. This doesn't fit. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 in positions where the row is greater than the column. For example, in example 2, the first row has 0s from column 2 onwards. So row 0, column 2: 0 >= 2? No. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits all three examples.\n\nLooking at example 1: the output is 0 in the corners. The corners are positions (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2). So for a 3x3 grid, these are the positions where row == column or row + column == 2.\n\nIn example 2, the output has 0s in positions that form a diagonal. For example, in the first row, the 0s start at column 2. In row 1, the 0 is at column 0. In row 2, the 0s are at columns 0 and 1. This seems like the positions where row + column is equal to 2, 3, 4, etc. For example, row 0, column 2: 0+2=2. Row 1, column 0: 1+0=1. Row 2, column 0: 2+0=2. Row 2, column 1: 2+1=3. So it's not a consistent pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position's relation to the center. For example, in example 1, the center is (2,2) (assuming 0-based indexing). The output is 0 in the corners. In example 2, the center is (2,2). The output is 0 in positions along a diagonal. In example 3, the center is (2,2). The output is 0 in positions along a diagonal.\n\nSo maybe the output is 0 in positions that are on a certain diagonal, and the other values are replaced with the original value. But how to determine which diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 in positions where the row and column are equal. For example, in example 1, the center is (1,1). The output is 0 in the corners, which are not on the diagonal. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 in positions where the row is equal to the column. In example 1, the center is (1,1), which is on the diagonal. But the output for the center is 4, not 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really difficult. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the output for example 1. The output is 0 in the corners, and 4 elsewhere. The input has 4 and 5. So the output is 0 where the input is 4, and 4 where the input is 5. But why? Because the input's corners are 4, and the output's corners are 0. The input's edges are 5, and the output's edges are 4.\n\nIn example 2, the output is 0 where the input is 6, and 6 where the input is 5. In example 3, the output is 0 where the input is 9, and 9 where the input is 5.\n\nSo for each example, the output is 0 where the input is a certain value, and the other value is replaced with the original value. But what determines which value?\n\nIn example 1, the value is 4 and 5. The output is 0 for 4, and 4 for 5.\n\nIn example 2, the value is 5 and 6. Output is 6 for 5, and 0 for 6.\n\nIn example 3, the value is 5 and 9. Output is 9 for 5, and 0 for 9.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output is 0 where the input is a certain value, and the other value is replaced with the original value. But what determines which value is replaced with what?\n\nMaybe the value that is replaced is the one that is not 5. For example, in example 1, the input has 4 and 5. The output is 0 for 4, and 4 for 5. So 5 is replaced with 4, which is the other value.\n\nIn example 2, the input has 5 and 6. The output is 6 for 5, and 0 for 6. So 5 is replaced with 6.\n\nIn example 3, the input has 5 and 9. The output is 9 for 5, and 0 for 9. So 5 is replaced with 9.\n\nThis suggests that the replacement value depends on the input's values. But how?\n\nMaybe the replacement value is the value that is not 5. For example, in example 1, the value not 5 is 4. So 5 is replaced with 4. In example 2, the value not 5 is 6, so 5 is replaced with 6. In example 3, the value not 5 is 9, so 5 is replaced with 9.\n\nSo the pattern is: for any cell in the input, if the value is 5, then the output is the value that is not 5 in the input. If the value is not 5, then the output is 0.\n\nBut this would mean that in example 1, the output is 0 where the input is 4, and 4 where the input is 5. In example 2, the output is 0 where the input is 6, and 6 where the input is 5. In example 3, the output is 0 where the input is 9, and 9 where the input is 5. This fits all three examples.\n\nBut how to determine what the value that is not 5 is. For example, in example 1, the input has 4 and 5. The value not 5 is 4. In example 2, the input has 5 and 6. The value not 5 is 6. In example 3, the input has 5 and 9. The value not 5 is 9. So for each example, the value that is not 5 is the one that is replaced with the other value.\n\nBut how to determine this in the general case. For example, if the input has multiple values, like 5, 6, 7, etc., what would be the replacement?\n\nBut according to the examples, the replacement is the value that is not 5. So if the input cell is 5, the output is the value that is not 5. If the input cell is not 5, the output is 0.\n\nBut how to determine what the value that is not 5 is. For example, in example 1, the input has 4 and 5. So the value not 5 is 4. In example 2, the input has 5 and 6. The value not 5 is 6. In example 3, the input has 5 and 9. The value not 5 is 9. So the replacement value is the other value in the input. But what if the input has more than two values?\n\nBut according to the examples, it seems that the replacement value is the value that is not 5. So for any cell in the input, if the cell is 5, the output is the value that is not 5. If the cell is not 5, the output is 0.\n\nBut how to determine what the value that is not 5 is. For example, if the input has multiple values, like 5, 6, 7, then what is the replacement value? But according to the examples, it seems that the replacement is the value that is not 5, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement value is the value that is not 5 in the input. So for example, if the input has 5 and 6, then 5 is replaced with 6. If the input has 5 and 9, then 5 is replaced with 9. So the replacement value is the other value in the input. But how to determine that.\n\nBut in the test input, what would be the replacement? The test input has values 3, 5, 3, 5, 3, etc. So the input has 3 and 5. According to this pattern, the output would be 0 where the input is not 5, and 3 where the input is 5. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nBut let's check if this hypothesis fits the examples.\n\nExample 1: input has 4 and 5. So for cells with 4, output is 0. For cells with 5, output is 4. Which matches the example.\n\nExample 2: input has 5 and 6. So for cells with 5, output is 6. For cells with 6, output is 0. Which matches the example.\n\nExample 3: input has 5 and 9. For cells with 5, output is 9. For cells with 9, output is 0. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. So the transformation is: for each cell, if the value is 5, then output is the value that is not 5 in the input. If the value is not 5, output is 0.\n\nBut how to determine what the value that is not 5 is. For example, in the test input, the input has 3 and 5. So the value that is not 5 is 3. So for cells with 5, output is 3. For cells with 3, output is 0.\n\nBut what if the input has multiple values, like 5, 6, 7? How to determine which value to replace 5 with? According to the examples, it seems that the replacement is the value that is not 5 in the input. But if the input has multiple values, how to choose?\n\nBut according to the examples, it's possible that the replacement is the value that is not 5 in the input. So for each cell, if the value is 5, the output is the value that is not 5 in the input. If the value is not 5, the output is 0.\n\nBut how to determine what the value that is not 5 is. For example, in the test input, the input has 3 and 5. So the value that is not 5 is 3. So the output would be 0 for 3, and 3 for 5.\n\nBut this is a hypothesis. Let's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the input has 4 and 5. The value that is not 5 is 4. So output is 4 for 5. Which matches the example.\n\nIn example 2, input has 5 and 6. The value that is not 5 is 6. So output is 6 for 5. Which matches the example.\n\nIn example 3, input has 5 and 9. The value that is not 5 is 9. So output is 9 for 5. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. So the transformation is: for each cell, if the value is 5, then the output is the value that is not 5 in the input. If the value is not 5, then output is 0.\n\nBut how to determine what the value that is not 5 is in the input. For example, if the input has multiple values, like 5, 6, 7, then what is the value to replace 5 with? According to the examples, it seems that the value is the one that is not 5 in the input. But how to determine that.\n\nBut in the examples, the input has only two values: 5 and another value. So for each example, the other value is the one that is replaced.\n\nSo the code would need to find the value that is not 5 in the input grid. But how? For example, if the input has multiple values, how to determine which one to use.\n\nBut according to the examples, it's possible that the replacement value is the value that is not 5 in the input. So for the input grid, we need to find the value that is not 5. If there are multiple values, but only one is not 5, then that's the one.\n\nBut how to handle cases where the input has multiple values, like 5, 6, 7. In that case, what value to use? But according to the examples, it seems that the replacement is the value that is not 5 in the input. So perhaps the code would need to find the value that is not 5 in the input, and use that as the replacement.\n\nBut how to find that value. For example, in the test input, the input has 3 and 5. So the value that is not 5 is 3. So for cells with 5, output is 3. For cells with 3, output is 0.\n\nSo the code would need to find the value that is not 5 in the input. But how?\n\nWait, but in the examples, the input has exactly two values: 5 and another value. So for the input grid, the code would check for the value that is not 5, and use that as the replacement.\n\nSo the code could do the following:\n\n- For each cell in the input grid:\n   - If the cell's value is 5, then the output is the value that is not 5 in the input grid.\n   - Else, the output is 0.\n\nBut how to find the value that is not 5 in the input grid.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the input grid has 4 and 5. So the value that is not 5 is 4.\n\nIn example 2, the input grid has 5 and 6. So the value that is not 5 is 6.\n\nIn example 3, the input grid has 5 and 9. So the value that is not 5 is 9.\n\nSo the code would need to find the value that is not 5 in the input grid.\n\nBut how to do that. For example, if the input grid has multiple values, but only one of them is not 5, then that's the value to use.\n\nSo the code would need to find all the unique values in the input grid, filter out the 5, and take the first one.\n\nBut how to handle cases where there are multiple values not 5. For example, if the input has 5, 6, 7, then what value to use? But according to the examples, it seems that the replacement is the value that is not 5 in the input.\n\nBut in the test input, the input has 3 and 5. So the replacement value is 3.\n\nSo the code could be:\n\n- Find all unique values in the input grid.\n- Filter out the 5.\n- If there are any values left, take the first one as the replacement value.\n- For each cell in the input grid:\n   - if the cell is 5, output is replacement value.\n   - else, output is 0.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Find all unique values in the input grid.\n2. Remove 5 from the list.\n3. If the list is not empty, take the first element as the replacement value.\n4. For each cell in the grid:\n   - if the cell is 5, output is replacement value.\n   - else, output is 0.\n\nBut what if the input grid has no values other than 5? For example, all cells are 5. Then the replacement value would be None, but according to the examples, this case is not present. So the code would need to handle that.\n\nBut according to the examples, the input grids have at least one value that is not 5.\n\nSo let's implement this logic.\n\nLet's test this logic with the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput grid has 4 and 5. Unique values are {4,5}. Remove 5, get [4]. Replacement value is 4. So for each cell, if it's 5, output is 4. Else 0. Which matches the example.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput has 5 and 6. Unique values are {5,6}. Remove 5, get [6]. Replacement is 6. So for cells with 5, output is 6. Else 0. Which matches the example.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput has 5 and 9. Unique values {5,9}. Remove 5, get [9]. Replacement is 9. So for cells with 5, output is 9. Else 0. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nNow, let's test this logic with the test input.\n\nTest input is:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 3 5 3\nRow 1: 3 5 3 3 3\nRow 2: 3 5 5 3 5\nRow 3: 3 3 3 5 3\nRow 4: 5 5 5 3 3\n\nThe unique values in this input are 3,5. So after removing 5, the replacement value is 3.\n\nSo for each cell:\n\nIf the cell is 5, output is 3. Else, output is 0.\n\nSo the output grid would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 3 0\nRow 1: 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 3 3 0 3\nRow 3: 0 0 0 3 0\nRow 4: 3 3 3 0 0\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis based on the observed pattern.\n\nSo the code would need to implement this logic.\n\nNow, the code steps:\n\n- Read the input grid as a list of lists.\n- Find all unique values in the grid.\n- Remove 5 from the list.\n- If the list is not empty, take the first element as replacement_value.\n- For each cell in the grid, if it is 5, replace with replacement_value, else 0.\n\nBut what if the input has no values other than 5? Like all cells are 5. Then, the replacement_value would be None, but according to the examples, this case is not present.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input grid is from the training examples, which have at least one value other than 5.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find all unique values in the grid\n    unique_values = set()\n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            unique_values.add(val)\n    # Remove 5 from the unique values\n    other_values = [v for v in unique_values if v != 5]\n    # Get the first value that is not 5\n    if other_values:\n        replacement = other_values[0]\n    else:\n        # If no other values, but according to examples, this is not possible\n        replacement = 0  # default, but not sure\n    # Create the output grid\n    output = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 5:\n                new_row.append(replacement)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(0)\n        output.append(new_row)\n    return output\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the replacement is 4, which is not 5. So this code would work.\n\nBut what about the test input? Let's see.\n\nTest input has 3 and 5. So other_values is [3], replacement is 3. So cells with 5 are replaced with 3, others with 0.\n\nSo the output would be as described.\n\nBut let's check example 2. The input has 5 and 6. other_values is [6], so replacement is 6. So cells with 5 are replaced with 6, others with 0. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nBut wait, what about example 3? The input has 5 and 9. other_values is [9], replacement is 9. So cells with 5 are replaced with 9, others with 0. Which matches the example.\n\nSo this code seems to handle all the examples correctly.\n\nNow, the code needs to be written in Python. The function takes a 2D list (grid) and returns a new grid.\n\nBut what about the case where the input has multiple values not 5? For example, if the input has 5, 6, 7. According to the code, the replacement value is 6. So cells with 5 are replaced with 6, others with 0. But what if the input has multiple values not 5? The code would take the first one in the unique_values set. But the unique_values set is a set, so the order is not guaranteed. But in the examples, the unique_values are {5, x}, so the code would work.\n\nBut for the code, the order of the unique_values depends on how the set is processed. However, in Python, sets are unordered. So the code might not work correctly if the other_values are not in the order expected. For example, if the input has 5, 6, and 7, and the code picks 6 as the replacement, but according to the pattern, it should pick 6 or 7?\n\nBut according to the examples, the code works when there are exactly two values, 5 and x. So in that case, the code would work.\n\nBut for other cases, it's unclear. But according to the problem statement, the code should handle the training examples, and the test input.\n\nThus, the code seems to be correct based on the examples.\n\nSo the final code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    unique_values = set()\n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            unique_values.add(val)\n    other_values = [v for v in unique_values if v != 5]\n    if other_values:\n        replacement = other_values[0]\n    else:\n        replacement = 0  # default, but not sure\n    output = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 5:\n                new_row.append(replacement)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(0)\n        output.append(new_row)\n    return output\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the replacement is 4. But in the code, the other_values is [4], so replacement is 4. Correct.\n\nBut what if the input has multiple other values? For example, input has 5, 6, 7. The code would take the first one in the set. But according to the pattern, it's unclear. But according to the examples, it's acceptable.\n\nThus, this code should handle the training examples correctly.\n"
