          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input grids are transformed into the output grids. Let me start by analyzing each example one by one.\n\nFirst, Example 1. The input is a 3x3 grid of all 3s. The output is a 15x15 grid. Looking at the output, there's a pattern where the 3s are placed in certain positions. Let me look at the output rows. The first three rows have 0s and 3s in a specific pattern. For example, the first row of the output is 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So, the 3s are spaced every three positions, but with zeros in between. Then there's a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern as the first three rows, then another row of all 3s, and so on. So maybe the input is being expanded into a larger grid with some 3s placed in certain positions, and the rest filled with 0s. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nWait, the input is 3x3. The output is 15x15. Let me think about the structure. The output seems to have alternating blocks of 0s and 3s. For example, the first three rows have 3s in positions 3, 7, 11 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but maybe the 3s are placed in every third column. Let me check the first row of the output. The 3s are at positions 3, 7, 11. So, in a 15-column grid, that's every third column. So maybe the input's value is placed in certain positions, and the rest are 0s. But how does the input's size relate to the output's structure?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input is a 2x2 grid of 8s. The output is a 15x15 grid. The output starts with rows of 0s and 8s in every third column, then a row of all 8s, then again the same pattern, then all 8s, etc. So similar to Example 1, but with 8s. So the pattern seems to be that for each input value, the output has a certain pattern where the input's value is placed in certain positions, and the rest are 0s. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by expanding the input's value into a grid where the original input's cells are placed in certain positions, and the rest are 0s. For example, in Example 1, the input is 3x3 of 3s. The output has 3s in certain positions. Let me think about the structure of the output. The output seems to have a pattern where the 3s are in positions that are every third column, but in rows that alternate between 0s and all 3s. Wait, looking at the output for Example 1, the first three rows have 3s in columns 3, 7, 11. Then there's a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern, then all 3s again. So maybe the output is divided into blocks. For example, the first three rows have 3s in certain positions, then a row of all 3s, then again the same pattern, then all 3s. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's value and placing it in a grid where the original input's cells are expanded into larger blocks. For example, if the input is a 3x3 grid, the output is a 15x15 grid. The 15 is 3*5, but that's not directly obvious. Wait, 15 is 3*5, but maybe the output is structured in a way that the input is placed in a certain pattern. Let me think about the positions.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for each example, the 3s, 8s, and 2s are placed in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 3s in the first three rows, every third column. Then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern, then all 3s again. So maybe the output is divided into regions where the input's value is placed in certain positions. For example, the input's value is placed in positions that are in the middle of the output grid, and the rest are 0s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions, and the rest are 0s. For example, if the input is a single cell with value X, then the output has X in certain positions, and 0s elsewhere. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input is a 4x4 grid of 2s. The output is 15x15. The output seems to have 2s in certain positions. The first four rows have 2s in positions 4, 8, 12 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but looking at the output for Example 3, the first four rows are 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2. So, the 2s are in columns 4, 8, 12. Then there's a row of all 2s. Then again the same pattern, then all 2s again. So, similar to the other examples.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output is a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions, and the rest are 0s. The positions where the input's value is placed are determined by the input's dimensions. For example, if the input is a grid of size N x N, then the output is a 15x15 grid. But how?\n\nWait, the input for Example 1 is 3x3. The output is 15x15. The 3x3 input is transformed into a grid where the 3s are placed in certain positions. Let's think about the positions. The output has 3s in columns 3, 7, 11 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but maybe the positions are every third column. For example, in the first three rows, the 3s are placed in columns 3, 7, 11. Then there's a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern, then all 3s again. So maybe the output is divided into vertical strips. For example, the 3s are in columns 3, 7, 11, which are every third column. But how does that relate to the input's size?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's value is placed in the middle of the output grid. For example, if the input is 3x3, then the output is 15x15. The 3x3 grid is placed in the middle of the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's value and placing it in certain positions. For example, for each cell in the input grid, the value is placed in certain positions in the output. But how?\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the first three rows have 3s in columns 3, 7, 11. Then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern, then all 3s. So the output is divided into vertical strips. For example, the first three rows have 3s in columns 3, 7, 11. Then there's a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern. So maybe the output is structured in a way that the input's value is placed in every third column, and the rest are 0s. But how does the input's size affect this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by creating a grid where the input's value is placed in positions that are determined by the input's size. For example, if the input is a grid of size N x N, then the output is a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the input is 3x3. The output is 15x15. The 3x3 input is placed in the middle of the output grid. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the input's value into a grid where the original input's cells are placed in certain positions. For example, if the input is a single cell with value X, then the output has X in certain positions. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for each example, the 3s, 8s, and 2s are placed in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 3s in the middle columns. The 3s are placed in columns 3, 7, 11. Then there's a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern, then all 3s again. So maybe the output is divided into vertical strips. For example, the first three rows have 3s in every third column, then a row of all 3s. Then the same pattern again. So, the 3s are in the middle of the output grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions. For example, the input's value is placed in the middle of the output grid, and the rest are 0s. But how to determine the positions?\n\nAnother observation: the output for each example has a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output has 3s in the middle columns, and then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern, then all 3s again. So the pattern seems to be that the output is divided into vertical strips. The 3s are in certain columns, and then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern. So, perhaps the output is structured in a way that for each row in the input, the corresponding output rows have the input's value in certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions. For example, the input's value is placed in the middle of the output grid, and the rest are 0s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's value and placing it in positions that are determined by the input's size. For example, the input is a grid of size N x N, and the output is a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions. For instance, if N is 3, the output has 3s in certain columns. Let's think about the positions. The output is 15x15. So for N=3, the output is divided into vertical strips. The 3s are placed in columns 3, 7, 11. These are every third column, starting from column 3. Then there's a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern.\n\nSo, perhaps the pattern is that the output is divided into vertical strips. The input's value is placed in the middle of these strips. For example, for N=3, the vertical strips are every third column. Then, the input's value is placed in the middle of these strips. Then, the output has rows that alternate between the middle of the strips and all the same value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's value and placing it in positions that are determined by the input's dimensions. For example, if the input is N x N, then the output has the input's value placed in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, N is 3. The output has 3s in columns 3, 7, 11. So, the columns are spaced every 4 positions. Wait, 3, 7, 11 are 4 apart. But 15 columns. So 3, 7, 11 are positions 3, 7, 11. Then, the next row is all 3s. Then again the same pattern. So maybe the output is structured in a way that for each row in the input, the output has certain rows that have the input's value in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions. For example, for each cell in the input, the value is placed in the output grid at positions that are determined by the input's size. For example, if the input is 3x3, then the output is 15x15. The input's value is placed in positions that are every third column. But how?\n\nAnother observation: looking at the output for Example 2. The input is 2x2 of 8s. The output has rows where 8s are placed in columns 2, 6, 10. Then a row of all 8s. Then again the same pattern, then all 8s again. Wait, but the output is 15x15. So for 2x2 input, the 8s are in columns 2, 6, 10. Wait, but 2, 6, 10 are spaced by 4. So for N=2, the columns are 2, 6, 10. Which is every 4 columns. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of columns where the input's value is placed is determined by the input's size. For example, for N=3, the columns are 3, 7, 11. For N=2, columns are 2, 6, 10. For N=4, columns are 4, 8, 12. Which is every 4 columns. So the spacing between the columns is (N * 2) - 1? Or maybe it's based on the input's size. For example, for N=3, the columns are every 4 columns. Wait, 3* (something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns where the input's value is placed are determined by the input's size. For example, for input size N, the columns are every (N + 1)th column. For example, N=3: columns 3, 7, 11. Which is 3 + 4*0, 3 +4*1, 3+4*2. But why 4? Because 15 columns. 15 is 3*5. So maybe the output is divided into vertical strips of size 5. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where the input's value is placed in the middle of the output grid. For example, the input is placed in the middle of the output grid. For example, if the input is 3x3, then the output is 15x15. The 3x3 input is placed in the middle of the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the first three rows have 3s in columns 3, 7, 11. Then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern. So the 3s are placed in the middle of the output grid. Then, the output has rows that alternate between the middle rows and all 3s. So maybe the pattern is that the output has a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions, and the rest are 0s. The positions are determined by the input's size.\n\nAnother approach: looking for a pattern in the output for each example. For example, in Example 1, the output is a grid that has 3s in certain positions and 0s elsewhere. The 3s are placed in columns that are every third column, and then there are rows of all 3s. For example, in the first three rows, the 3s are in columns 3, 7, 11. Then there's a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern. So the output is divided into vertical strips of 3 columns, with 3s in the middle column of each strip. Then, between these strips, there are 0s. Wait, but in the first three rows, the 3s are in columns 3, 7, 11. So each of these is a middle column of a 3-column strip. For example, the first strip is columns 0-2, then 3-5, then 6-8, etc. Wait, no. Because the 3s are in columns 3, 7, 11. Which are the middle of 3-column strips. For example, columns 0-2: middle is 1. But the 3s are in column 3. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is divided into vertical strips of 4 columns. For example, columns 0-3, 4-7, 8-11, 12-15. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the 3s are placed in columns that are multiples of 4. For example, columns 3, 7, 11. Which is 3 mod 4, 7 mod 4 is 3, etc. So maybe the columns are every 4 columns starting from 3. But how does that relate to the input's size?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's value and placing it in certain positions. For example, for each row in the input, the corresponding output rows have the input's value in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the input is 3x3. The output has 3 rows with 3s in certain columns, then a row of all 3s, then again the same pattern, then all 3s. So the input's rows are mapped to the output's rows. For example, the first three input rows are mapped to the first three output rows. Then the fourth row is all 3s. Then the fifth row is the same as the first three, and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps the output is structured in a way that the input's value is placed in certain positions, and the rest are 0s. The positions are determined by the input's size. For example, if the input is N x N, then the output has certain rows and columns where the input's value is placed.\n\nBut how to translate this into code?\n\nLet me think about the output for Example 1. The output is 15x15. The input is 3x3. The output has 3s in certain positions. The first three rows have 3s in columns 3, 7, 11. Then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern. So the output is divided into 5 rows of 3 rows each. Wait, 15 rows total. So 3 rows of 3s, then 1 row of all 3s, then 3 rows of 3s, then 1 row of all 3s, and so on. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, the output has 15 rows. For example, for the first three rows, the 3s are placed in certain columns. Then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern. So the output is divided into 5 vertical strips of 3 rows each. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is divided into vertical strips. For example, for N=3, the columns are every 4 columns. So columns 0-3, 4-7, 8-11, 12-15. Then, in each of these strips, the middle column (column 3, 7, 11) is filled with the input's value. So the 3s are placed in those columns. Then, the rows are divided into groups of 3 rows. For example, the first three rows have the 3s in the middle columns. Then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input's size?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by creating a grid where the input's value is placed in the middle of the output grid. For example, the input is placed in the middle of the output grid. For N=3, the input is placed in the middle of the output grid. But how to determine the positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding the input's value into a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions. For example, for each cell in the input, the value is placed in the output grid at positions that are determined by the input's size.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find a general rule that applies to all three examples.\n\nLooking at the output for each example:\n\nExample 1: input is 3x3, output has 3s in certain positions. The output has 3s in columns 3,7,11. Then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern.\n\nExample 2: input is 2x2, output has 8s in columns 2,6,10. Then a row of all 8s.\n\nExample 3: input is 4x4, output has 2s in columns 4,8,12. Then a row of all 2s.\n\nSo, for each input size N, the columns where the input's value is placed are every (N+1)th column. Wait:\n\nFor N=3, columns 3,7,11. Which is 3, 3+4, 3+8. So 4 is (N+1) = 4. Because 3+1=4. So for N=3, the columns are every 4 steps. Similarly for N=2, columns are 2,6,10. Which is 2, 2+4, 2+8. Again, 4 is N+1=3? No. Wait N=2, N+1 is 3. But the step is 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the step is 2*N. For N=3, 2*3=6. But the step is 4. No. Alternatively, the step is 2*(N) - 1. For N=3, 2*3-1=5. But the step is 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the columns for each example:\n\nFor N=3: columns are 3,7,11. These are 3 + 4*i, where i=0,1,2. 4 is 15/3.5? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of columns where the input's value is placed is (15 / N) - 1. For N=3, 15/3 =5. 5-1=4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the columns are spaced every 4 columns. For example, in Example 1, the columns are 3,7,11. Which is every 4 columns. For N=2, columns are 2,6,10. Which is every 4 columns. For N=4, columns are 4,8,12. Also every 4 columns. So the step between columns is 4. But why?\n\nWait, the output is 15x15. So the columns are 0-14. For N=3, the columns where the value is placed are 3,7,11. Which are 3, 3+4, 3+8. So the step is 4. For N=2, columns are 2, 6, 10. Step is 4. For N=4, columns are 4,8,12. Step is 4. So the step is 4. So regardless of the input size, the columns are spaced every 4 columns. But why?\n\nBut how does the input size relate to the columns? For example, for N=3, the columns are 3,7,11. Which is 3 = N, 7 = N + 4, 11 = N + 8. So for N=3, the first column is N, then N + 4, etc. So the first column is N, then every 4 steps. But why N?\n\nIn Example 2, N=2. The first column is 2, then 6, 10. Which is N, N+4, N+8. So same pattern.\n\nIn Example 3, N=4. The first column is 4, then 8, 12. Again, same pattern.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each input size N, the columns where the input's value is placed are N, N+4, N+8, etc., up to 14 (since the output is 15 columns). But why 4?\n\nBecause the output is 15 columns. So for N=3, the first column is 3. Then adding 4 steps. 3, 7, 11. Next would be 15, but that's beyond 14. So for N=3, there are three columns. Similarly, for N=2, 2,6,10. For N=4, 4,8,12. So the columns are every 4 steps, starting from N.\n\nSo the columns where the input's value is placed are N, N+4, N+8, etc. So the columns are determined by N and the step of 4.\n\nThen, for each of these columns, the input's value is placed in the output grid. But how about the rows?\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1: the first three rows have 3s in columns 3,7,11. Then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern. So the rows are divided into groups of 3 rows, then a row of all 3s, then again 3 rows, then all 3s, etc.\n\nWait, the output is 15 rows. Let's see:\n\nExample 1's output has:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: same as row 0.\n\nRow 3: all 3s.\n\nRow 4: same as row 0.\n\nRow 5: same as row 0.\n\nRow 6: same as row 0.\n\nRow 7: all 3s.\n\nRow 8: same as row 0.\n\nRow 9: same as row 0.\n\nRow 10: same as row 0.\n\nRow 11: all 3s.\n\nRow 12: same as row 0.\n\nRow 13: same as row 0.\n\nRow 14: same as row 0.\n\nSo the pattern is that the first three rows (0-2) have the 3s in the columns. Then row 3 is all 3s. Then rows 4-6 are same as rows 0-2. Then row 7 is all 3s. Then rows 8-10 are same as rows 0-2. Then row 11 is all 3s. Then rows 12-14 are same as rows 0-2.\n\nSo the rows are divided into groups of 3 rows, followed by a row of all 3s. So the total rows are 3*5 = 15. Wait, 3 rows (group), 1 row (all 3s), repeated 3 times? No, 3 rows, 1 row, 3 rows, 1 row, 3 rows, 1 row. That's 3*3 + 1*3 = 12 rows. But the output is 15 rows. So maybe it's 3 groups of 3 rows, then 3 rows of all 3s? Or perhaps the pattern is that the output has 5 groups of 3 rows and 1 row of all 3s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each input row, the output has certain rows. For example, the input is 3x3. The output has 3 rows (rows 0-2) with the 3s in columns, then a row of all 3s, then rows 4-6 (same as 0-2), then row 7 (all 3s), then rows 8-10 (same as 0-2), then row 11 (all 3s), then rows 12-14 (same as 0-2). So for each group of 3 rows, followed by a row of all 3s, and this repeats. So the output has 5 groups of 3 rows and 3 rows of all 3s. But 3*5 + 3 = 18, which is more than 15. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the output has 5 rows of all 3s, but that doesn't fit the example.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the output has rows that alternate between the 3s in the columns and all 3s. For example, the first three rows are the same, then a row of all 3s, then the same three rows again, then all 3s, etc. So for 15 rows, that would be 3 rows, 1 row, 3 rows, 1 row, 3 rows, 1 row. That's 3*3 + 1*3 = 12 rows. But the output has 15 rows. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output is divided into 5 vertical strips. For example, the first 3 rows are the same, then a row of all 3s, then the same 3 rows again, then all 3s, then the same 3 rows again, then all 3s. But that would be 3+1+3+1+3+1 = 12 rows. Still not 15.\n\nAlternatively, the output is divided into 5 rows of all 3s. But that doesn't fit the example.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the rows are divided into 5 groups of 3 rows each, and between them, there's a row of all 3s. But that would be 5*3 + 4 = 19 rows, which is not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the pattern is that the input's value is placed in certain positions in the output grid. For example, the input's value is placed in the columns that are every 4 steps starting from N, and the rows are divided into groups of 3 rows followed by a row of all 3s.\n\nBut how to translate this into code.\n\nSo, the steps to generate the output grid would be:\n\nFor each row in the output grid:\n\n- If the row is in a group of 3 rows (like 0-2, 4-6, 8-10, 12-14), then in those rows, the value is placed in the columns that are N, N+4, N+8, etc.\n\n- If the row is in the group of 1 row (like 3, 7, 11), then all the columns are filled with the input's value.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are in which group.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are divided into 5 groups. For example, the first 3 rows (0-2), then row 3, then rows 4-6, then row 7, then rows 8-10, then row 11, then rows 12-14. This would give 3+1+3+1+3+1= 12 rows. But the output has 15 rows. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the rows are divided into 5 groups of 3 rows, and between them, there are 3 rows of all 3s. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for the output grid, the rows are divided into 5 vertical strips of 3 rows each, and each strip has the 3s in the middle columns. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each row in the output grid, if the row number is even (0, 2, 4, etc.), then it has the 3s in the columns, else it has all 3s. But that doesn't fit the example.\n\nAlternatively, the rows are divided into 5 groups of 3 rows each, with the first group being rows 0-2, then row 3, then rows 4-6, then row 7, then rows 8-10, then row 11, then rows 12-14. This would give 3+1+3+1+3+1+3 = 15 rows. So that's 3 rows, 1 row, 3 rows, 1 row, 3 rows, 1 row, 3 rows. That totals 3*4 + 1*3 = 12 +3=15 rows.\n\nSo for the output grid, the rows are grouped as follows:\n\nGroup 0: rows 0-2 (3 rows) \u2192 these rows have the input's value in the columns.\n\nGroup 1: row 3 \u2192 all input's value.\n\nGroup 2: rows 4-6 (3 rows) \u2192 input's value in columns.\n\nGroup 3: row 7 \u2192 all input's value.\n\nGroup 4: rows 8-10 (3 rows) \u2192 input's value in columns.\n\nGroup 5: row 11 \u2192 all input's value.\n\nGroup 6: rows 12-14 (3 rows) \u2192 input's value in columns.\n\nSo, for each row in the output grid, if it is in a group that is even-numbered (group 0, 2, 4, 6), then the row has the input's value in the columns. If it's in a group that is odd-numbered (group 1, 3, 5), then the row is all input's value.\n\nSo the pattern is that the output rows are divided into groups of 3 rows, followed by a single row of all input's value. This repeats until all 15 rows are filled.\n\nSo the code would need to:\n\nFor each row in the output grid:\n\n- Determine which group it belongs to.\n\n- If it's in a group with 3 rows (even group), then the row has the input's value in the columns.\n\n- If it's in a group with 1 row (odd group), then the row is all input's value.\n\nSo how to determine the group.\n\nThe groups are:\n\nGroup 0: rows 0-2\n\nGroup 1: row 3\n\nGroup 2: rows 4-6\n\nGroup 3: row 7\n\nGroup 4: rows 8-10\n\nGroup 5: row 11\n\nGroup 6: rows 12-14\n\nSo for each row in 0-14:\n\nIf row % 4 == 0 \u2192 group 0, 2, 4, 6 \u2192 which are even groups.\n\nWait, row 0 \u2192 group 0.\n\nrow 3 \u2192 group 1.\n\nrow 4 \u2192 group 2.\n\nrow 7 \u2192 group 3.\n\nrow 8 \u2192 group 4.\n\nrow 11 \u2192 group 5.\n\nrow 12 \u2192 group 6.\n\nSo the group number is row // 4. Because:\n\nrow 0 \u2192 0//4 = 0 \u2192 group 0.\n\nrow 3 \u2192 3//4 = 0 \u2192 group 0? No, that's not right. Because row 3 is group 1. Hmm, perhaps the group number is (row // 4) + 1? Or maybe it's (row // 4) % 2?\n\nAlternatively, the group number can be determined by whether the row is in a group of 3 rows or 1 row.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to check if the row is in the first three rows, then the next row is all, then next three, then all, etc.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, if (row // 4) is even, then it's in a group of 3 rows. If (row // 4) is odd, then it's in a group of 1 row.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe the code can be written as follows:\n\nFor each row in the output grid:\n\n- If the row is in positions 0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,14 \u2192 it's in a group of 3 rows.\n\n- Else, it's in a group of 1 row.\n\nSo for each row, if (row % 4) is 0, 1, or 2 \u2192 group of 3 rows. If (row %4) is 3 \u2192 group of 1 row.\n\nSo for row 0 \u2192 0%4=0 \u2192 group of 3 rows.\n\nrow 3 \u2192 3%4=3 \u2192 group of 1 row.\n\nrow 4 \u2192 4%4=0 \u2192 group of 3 rows.\n\nrow 7 \u2192 7%4=3 \u2192 group of 1 row.\n\nrow 8 \u2192 8%4=0 \u2192 group of 3 rows.\n\nrow 11 \u2192 11%4=3 \u2192 group of 1 row.\n\nrow 12 \u2192 12%4=0 \u2192 group of 3 rows.\n\nSo this seems to fit.\n\nSo for each row in the output grid, if the row %4 is 0,1,2 \u2192 it's in a group of 3 rows. Else, it's in a group of 1 row.\n\nSo, for each row in the output grid:\n\nif row %4 != 3 \u2192 then the row has the input's value in certain columns.\n\nelse \u2192 the row is all input's value.\n\nNow, for the columns, as discussed earlier, the columns where the input's value is placed are N, N+4, N+8, etc., up to 14.\n\nSo for example, if the input is 3x3, N=3. The columns are 3,7,11.\n\nFor N=2, columns are 2,6,10.\n\nFor N=4, columns are 4,8,12.\n\nSo the code needs to generate these columns.\n\nSo the steps for the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the output grid (15 rows):\n\n- Determine if it's in a group of 3 rows or 1 row.\n\n- For each column in the output grid (15 columns):\n\n   - if the row is in a group of 1 row \u2192 set the value to the input's value.\n\n   - else:\n\n      - check if the column is in the list of columns [N, N+4, N+8, ...] up to 14.\n\n      - if yes \u2192 set the value to the input's value.\n\n      - else \u2192 set to 0.\n\nBut wait, what is the input's value? The input is a grid of values. For example, in Example 1, the input is 3x3 of 3s. So the output grid's value is 3 in the specified positions. But what if the input has multiple values? For example, in Example 2, the input is 2x2 of 8s. So the output grid's value is 8 in the specified positions.\n\nBut how to get the input's value? The input grid is given as a 2D list. The output grid is generated based on the input grid's values. For example, if the input is a 3x3 grid, then the output grid's value is the value of the input's cell (i,j) in the corresponding position. Wait, no. Because in the examples, the input is a grid of the same value. For example, in Example 1, the input is all 3s. So the output grid is filled with 3s in the specified positions.\n\nBut what if the input has different values? For example, if the input is a 2x2 grid with values 8 and 2. How would that affect the output?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input grid is a 2D list where each cell has a value. The output grid is generated based on the input's value. So for each cell in the input grid, the corresponding value in the output grid is determined by the pattern.\n\nWait, but the examples show that the input is a grid of the same value. So perhaps the output grid is filled with the value of the input's cell (i,j) in certain positions. But how to determine which positions.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, looking at the examples, the input grid's value is the same for all cells. So the output grid is filled with that value in the specified positions.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\nFor each cell in the output grid:\n\n- If the row is in a group of 1 row \u2192 set to the input's value (which is the same for all cells in the input).\n\n- Else, if the column is in the list of columns [N, N+4, N+8, ...] \u2192 set to the input's value.\n\n- Else \u2192 0.\n\nBut what is the input's value?

So perhaps the code should take the value of the input grid's cell (i,j) and use that for the output grid. But how to determine which cell's value to use.\n\nWait, the input is a grid of size M x N. The output is 15x15. How does the input's value relate to the output's value?\n\nIn the examples, the input is a grid of the same value. So the output is filled with that value in the specified positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Perhaps the code should take the value of the input grid's cell (i,j) and use that for the output grid.

Since the input is a grid, perhaps the input's value is the value of the input's cell (i,j) where i and j are the row and column of the input grid. But how to determine which cell (i,j) to use.\n\nBut in the examples, the input is a grid of the same value. So the code can take the value of the input's cell (0,0) as the input's value. For example, in Example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid of 3s, so the value is 3.\n\nSo the code can take the value of the input's cell (0,0) as the input's value.\n\nBut this is not correct if the input has different values. But given the examples, this is the best approach.\n\nSo the code would:\n\n- Get the input's value as the value of the input's cell (0,0).\n\n- For each row in the output grid:\n\n   - if the row is in a group of 1 row \u2192 set all cells to the input's value.\n\n   - else:\n\n      - for each column in the output grid:\n\n         - if the column is in the list of columns [N, N+4, N+8, ...], set to input's value.\n\n         - else, 0.\n\nBut how to determine N, which is the size of the input grid.\n\nThe input grid is given as a 2D list. So the code can determine the input's size as M x N, where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns.\n\nBut in the examples, the input is a square grid. For example, Example 1: 3x3, Example 2: 2x2, Example 3: 4x4.\n\nSo the code can take N as the number of columns in the input grid.\n\nBut in the examples, the input's value is the same for all cells. So the code can take the value of the input's cell (0,0) as the input's value.\n\nBut this is not correct if the input has different values, but given the examples, it's the best approach.\n\nSo the code would:\n\n- Determine the input's value as grid[0][0].\n\n- Determine the input's size as M x N, where M is len(grid), N is len(grid[0]).\n\n- For each row in the output grid (15 rows):\n\n   - if row %4 == 3 \u2192 set all cells to input_value.\n\n   - else:\n\n      - for each column in 0-14:\n\n         - if column is in the list [N, N+4, N+8, ...] up to 14 \u2192 set to input_value.\n\n         - else \u2192 0.\n\nBut wait, what if the input is not square? For example, if the input is 2x3. Then N is 3, and the columns would be 3, 7, 11. But 3+4=7, 7+4=11, 11+4=15, which is beyond 14. So the columns would be 3,7,11.\n\nSo the code can generate the columns as follows:\n\ncolumns = [N + 4*i for i in range(0, 4) if N + 4*i < 15]\n\nBut this is not correct. For example, if N=3, 3+4*0=3, 3+4*1=7, 3+4*2=11, 3+4*3=15 which is beyond 14. So the columns are 3,7,11.\n\nSo the code can generate the columns as [N + 4*i for i in range(0, 4) if N + 4*i < 15].\n\nBut how to determine N. N is the number of columns in the input grid.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- input_value = grid[0][0]\n\n- input_rows = len(grid)\n\n- input_cols = len(grid[0])\n\n- N = input_cols\n\n- columns = [N + 4*i for i in range(0, 4) if N + 4*i < 15]\n\nBut this would generate columns for the input's columns.\n\nSo, for each row in the output grid:\n\n   if row %4 == 3:\n\n      set all cells to input_value\n\n   else:\n\n      for each column in 0-14:\n\n         if column in columns:\n\n            set to input_value\n\n         else:\n\n            0\n\nSo this would generate the output grid as per the examples.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nInput is 3x3 grid. N=3.\n\ncolumns = [3,7,11].\n\nFor rows 0-2,4-6,8-10,12-14, the code checks if column is in columns.\n\nFor example, row 0:\n\ncolumns 3,7,11 are set to input_value (3), others are 0.\n\nSo the first row of the output is 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 \u2192 which matches Example 1.\n\nRow 3 is all 3s.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nFor Example 2, input is 2x2 grid. N=2.\n\ncolumns = [2,6,10].\n\nSo for rows 0-2,4-6,8-10,12-14:\n\ncolumns 2,6,10 are set to input_value (8), others 0.\n\nWhich matches Example 2.\n\nFor Example 3, input is 4x4 grid. N=4.\n\ncolumns = [4,8,12].\n\nWhich matches Example 3.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern.\n\nSo the code would implement this logic.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle the input grid, which can be of any size (not necessarily square). So the code will:\n\n- Determine the input's value as grid[0][0].\n\n- Determine the input's columns as input_cols = len(grid[0]).\n\n- Generate the columns as [N + 4*i for i in range(0, 4) if N + 4*i < 15].\n\n- For each row in the output grid (15 rows):\n\n   - if row %4 == 3 \u2192 set all cells to input_value.\n\n   - else:\n\n      - for each column in 0-14:\n\n         - if column is in columns \u2192 input_value.\n\n         - else \u2192 0.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nThe function transform(grid) should return a 15x15 grid.\n\nSo:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    input_value = grid[0][0]\n    input_rows = len(grid)\n    input_cols = len(grid[0]) if input_rows > 0 else 0\n    N = input_cols\n    columns = []\n    for i in range(4):\n        col = N + 4 * i\n        if col < 15:\n            columns.append(col)\n    # Now generate the output grid\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]\n    for row in range(15):\n        if row % 4 == 3:\n            for col in range(15):\n                output[row][col] = input_value\n        else:\n            for col in range(15):\n                if col in columns:\n                    output[row][col] = input_value\n                else:\n                    output[row][col] = 0\n    return output\n\nBut wait, in the examples, the output has rows that are not all input_value. For example, in Example 1, the first three rows are not all input_value. So the code checks if row %4 ==3, which is true for row 3, 7, 11, etc. So for rows 0-2, 4-6, 8-10, 12-14, the code checks if the column is in columns. So this should work.\n\nTesting this code with the examples:\n\nExample 1:\n\ninput_value = 3.\n\ncolumns = [3,7,11].\n\nFor rows 0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,14:\n\neach row is processed. For each column, if it is in columns, set to 3.\n\nSo the first row is 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 \u2192 correct.\n\nRow 3 is all 3s.\n\nYes.\n\nExample 2:\n\ninput_value = 8.\n\ncolumns = [2,6,10].\n\nRows 0-2,4-6,8-10,12-14: columns 2,6,10 are 8, others 0.\n\nRow 3 is all 8s.\n\nYes.\n\nExample 3:\n\ninput_value = 2.\n\ncolumns = [4,8,12].\n\nRows 0-2,4-6,8-10,12-14: columns 4,8,12 are 2, others 0.\n\nRow 3 is all 2s.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut what about when the input is not square? For example, input is 2x3.\n\ninput_cols = 3.\n\ncolumns = [3,7,11].\n\nSo for rows not in group of 1, the code sets columns 3,7,11 to input_value.\n\nThis should work.\n\nSo this code should handle the examples correctly.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples, I need to see how the input grids are transformed into the output grids. Let me start by analyzing each example one by one.\n\nFirst, Example 1. The input is a 3x3 grid of all 3s. The output is a 15x15 grid. Looking at the output, there's a pattern where the 3s are placed in certain positions. Let me look at the output rows. The first three rows have 0s and 3s in a specific pattern. For example, the first row of the output is 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So, the 3s are spaced every three positions, but with zeros in between. Then there's a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern as the first three rows, then another row of all 3s, and so on. So maybe the input is being expanded into a larger grid with some 3s placed in certain positions, and the rest filled with 0s. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nWait, the input is 3x3. The output is 15x15. Let me think about the structure. The output seems to have alternating blocks of 0s and 3s. For example, the first three rows have 3s in positions 3, 7, 11 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but maybe the 3s are placed in every third column. Let me check the first row of the output. The 3s are at positions 3, 7, 11. So, in a 15-column grid, that's every third column. So maybe the input's value is placed in certain positions, and the rest are 0s. But how does the input's size relate to the output's structure?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input is a 2x2 grid of 8s. The output is a 15x15 grid. The output starts with rows of 0s and 8s in every third column, then a row of all 8s, then again the same pattern, then all 8s, etc. So similar to Example 1, but with 8s. So the pattern seems to be that for each input value, the output has a certain pattern where the input's value is placed in certain positions, and the rest are 0s. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by expanding the input's value into a grid where the original input's cells are placed in certain positions, and the rest are 0s. For example, in Example 1, the input is 3x3 of 3s. The output has 3s in certain positions. Let me think about the structure of the output. The output seems to have a pattern where the 3s are in positions that are every third column, but in rows that alternate between 0s and all 3s. Wait, looking at the output for Example 1, the first three rows have 3s in columns 3, 7, 11. Then there's a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern, then all 3s again. So maybe the output is divided into blocks. For example, the first three rows have 3s in certain positions, then a row of all 3s, then again the same pattern, then all 3s. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's value and placing it in a grid where the original input's cells are expanded into larger blocks. For example, if the input is a 3x3 grid, the output is a 15x15 grid. The 15 is 3*5, but that's not directly obvious. Wait, 15 is 3*5, but maybe the output is structured in a way that the input is placed in a certain pattern. Let me think about the positions.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for each example, the 3s, 8s, and 2s are placed in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 3s in the first three rows, every third column. Then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern, then all 3s again. So maybe the output is divided into regions where the input's value is placed in certain positions. For example, the input's value is placed in positions that are in the middle of the output grid, and the rest are 0s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions, and the rest are 0s. For example, if the input is a single cell with value X, then the output has X in certain positions, and 0s elsewhere. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input is a 4x4 grid of 2s. The output is 15x15. The output seems to have 2s in certain positions. The first four rows have 2s in positions 4, 8, 12 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but looking at the output for Example 3, the first four rows are 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2. So, the 2s are in columns 4, 8, 12. Then there's a row of all 2s. Then again the same pattern, then all 2s again. So, similar to the other examples.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output is a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions, and the rest are 0s. The positions where the input's value is placed are determined by the input's dimensions. For example, if the input is a grid of size N x N, then the output is a 15x15 grid. But how?\n\nWait, the input for Example 1 is 3x3. The output is 15x15. The 3x3 input is transformed into a grid where the 3s are placed in certain positions. Let's think about the positions. The output has 3s in columns 3, 7, 11 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but maybe the positions are every third column. For example, in the first three rows, the 3s are placed in columns 3, 7, 11. Then there's a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern, then all 3s again. So maybe the output is divided into vertical strips. For example, the 3s are in columns 3, 7, 11, which are every third column. But how does that relate to the input's size?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's value is placed in the middle of the output grid. For example, if the input is 3x3, then the output is 15x15. The 3x3 grid is placed in the middle of the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's value and placing it in certain positions. For example, for each cell in the input grid, the value is placed in certain positions in the output. But how?\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the first three rows have 3s in columns 3, 7, 11. Then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern, then all 3s. So the output is divided into vertical strips. For example, the first three rows have 3s in columns 3, 7, 11. Then there's a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern. So maybe the output is structured in a way that the input's value is placed in every third column, and the rest are 0s. But how does the input's size affect this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by creating a grid where the input's value is placed in positions that are determined by the input's size. For example, if the input is a grid of size N x N, then the output is a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the input is 3x3. The output is 15x15. The 3x3 input is placed in the middle of the output grid. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the input's value into a grid where the original input's cells are placed in certain positions. For example, if the input is a single cell with value X, then the output has X in certain positions. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for each example, the 3s, 8s, and 2s are placed in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 3s in the middle columns. The 3s are placed in columns 3, 7, 11. Then there's a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern, then all 3s again. So maybe the output is divided into vertical strips. For example, the first three rows have 3s in every third column, then a row of all 3s. Then the same pattern again. So, the 3s are in the middle of the output grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions. For example, the input's value is placed in the middle of the output grid, and the rest are 0s. But how to determine the positions?\n\nAnother observation: the output for each example has a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output has 3s in the middle columns, and then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern, then all 3s again. So the pattern seems to be that the output is divided into vertical strips. The 3s are in certain columns, and then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern. So, perhaps the output is structured in a way that for each row in the input, the corresponding output rows have the input's value in certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions. For example, the input's value is placed in the middle of the output grid, and the rest are 0s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's value and placing it in positions that are determined by the input's size. For example, the input is a grid of size N x N, and the output is a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions. For instance, if N is 3, the output has 3s in certain columns. Let's think about the positions. The output is 15x15. So for N=3, the output is divided into vertical strips. The 3s are placed in columns 3, 7, 11. These are every third column, starting from column 3. Then there's a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern.\n\nSo, perhaps the pattern is that the output is divided into vertical strips. The input's value is placed in the middle of these strips. For example, for N=3, the vertical strips are every third column. Then, the input's value is placed in the middle of these strips. Then, the output has rows that alternate between the middle of the strips and all the same value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's value and placing it in positions that are determined by the input's dimensions. For example, if the input is N x N, then the output has the input's value placed in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, N is 3. The output has 3s in columns 3, 7, 11. So, the columns are spaced every 4 positions. Wait, 3, 7, 11 are 4 apart. But 15 columns. So 3, 7, 11 are positions 3, 7, 11. Then, the next row is all 3s. Then again the same pattern. So maybe the output is structured in a way that for each row in the input, the output has certain rows that have the input's value in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions. For example, for each cell in the input, the value is placed in the output grid at positions that are determined by the input's size. For example, if the input is 3x3, then the output is 15x15. The input's value is placed in positions that are every third column. But how?\n\nAnother observation: looking at the output for Example 2. The input is 2x2 of 8s. The output has rows where 8s are placed in columns 2, 6, 10. Then a row of all 8s. Then again the same pattern, then all 8s again. Wait, but the output is 15x15. So for 2x2 input, the 8s are in columns 2, 6, 10. Wait, but 2, 6, 10 are spaced by 4. So for N=2, the columns are 2, 6, 10. Which is every 4 columns. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of columns where the input's value is placed is determined by the input's size. For example, for N=3, the columns are 3, 7, 11. For N=2, columns are 2, 6, 10. For N=4, columns are 4, 8, 12. Which is every 4 columns. So the spacing between the columns is (N * 2) - 1? Or maybe it's based on the input's size. For example, for N=3, the columns are every 4 columns. Wait, 3* (something). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns where the input's value is placed are determined by the input's size. For example, for input size N, the columns are every (N + 1)th column. For example, N=3: columns 3, 7, 11. Which is 3 + 4*0, 3 +4*1, 3+4*2. But why 4? Because 15 columns. 15 is 3*5. So maybe the output is divided into vertical strips of size 5. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a grid where the input's value is placed in the middle of the output grid. For example, the input is placed in the middle of the output grid. For example, if the input is 3x3, then the output is 15x15. The 3x3 input is placed in the middle of the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the first three rows have 3s in columns 3, 7, 11. Then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern. So the 3s are placed in the middle of the output grid. Then, the output has rows that alternate between the middle rows and all 3s. So maybe the pattern is that the output has a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions, and the rest are 0s. The positions are determined by the input's size.\n\nAnother approach: looking for a pattern in the output for each example. For example, in Example 1, the output is a grid that has 3s in certain positions and 0s elsewhere. The 3s are placed in columns that are every third column, and then there are rows of all 3s. For example, in the first three rows, the 3s are in columns 3, 7, 11. Then there's a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern. So the output is divided into vertical strips of 3 columns, with 3s in the middle column of each strip. Then, between these strips, there are 0s. Wait, but in the first three rows, the 3s are in columns 3, 7, 11. So each of these is a middle column of a 3-column strip. For example, the first strip is columns 0-2, then 3-5, then 6-8, etc. Wait, no. Because the 3s are in columns 3, 7, 11. Which are the middle of 3-column strips. For example, columns 0-2: middle is 1. But the 3s are in column 3. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is divided into vertical strips of 4 columns. For example, columns 0-3, 4-7, 8-11, 12-15. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the 3s are placed in columns that are multiples of 4. For example, columns 3, 7, 11. Which is 3 mod 4, 7 mod 4 is 3, etc. So maybe the columns are every 4 columns starting from 3. But how does that relate to the input's size?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's value and placing it in certain positions. For example, for each row in the input, the corresponding output rows have the input's value in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the input is 3x3. The output has 3 rows with 3s in certain columns, then a row of all 3s, then again the same pattern, then all 3s. So the input's rows are mapped to the output's rows. For example, the first three input rows are mapped to the first three output rows. Then the fourth row is all 3s. Then the fifth row is the same as the first three, and so on.\n\nSo, perhaps the output is structured in a way that the input's value is placed in certain positions, and the rest are 0s. The positions are determined by the input's size. For example, if the input is N x N, then the output has certain rows and columns where the input's value is placed.\n\nBut how to translate this into code?\n\nLet me think about the output for Example 1. The output is 15x15. The input is 3x3. The output has 3s in certain positions. The first three rows have 3s in columns 3, 7, 11. Then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern. So the output is divided into 5 rows of 3 rows each. Wait, 15 rows total. So 3 rows of 3s, then 1 row of all 3s, then 3 rows of 3s, then 1 row of all 3s, and so on. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, the output has 15 rows. For example, for the first three rows, the 3s are placed in certain columns. Then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern. So the output is divided into 5 vertical strips of 3 rows each. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is divided into vertical strips. For example, for N=3, the columns are every 4 columns. So columns 0-3, 4-7, 8-11, 12-15. Then, in each of these strips, the middle column (column 3, 7, 11) is filled with the input's value. So the 3s are placed in those columns. Then, the rows are divided into groups of 3 rows. For example, the first three rows have the 3s in the middle columns. Then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input's size?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by creating a grid where the input's value is placed in the middle of the output grid. For example, the input is placed in the middle of the output grid. For N=3, the input is placed in the middle of the output grid. But how to determine the positions.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding the input's value into a grid where the input's value is placed in certain positions. For example, for each cell in the input, the value is placed in the output grid at positions that are determined by the input's size.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find a general rule that applies to all three examples.\n\nLooking at the output for each example:\n\nExample 1: input is 3x3, output has 3s in certain positions. The output has 3s in columns 3,7,11. Then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern.\n\nExample 2: input is 2x2, output has 8s in columns 2,6,10. Then a row of all 8s.\n\nExample 3: input is 4x4, output has 2s in columns 4,8,12. Then a row of all 2s.\n\nSo, for each input size N, the columns where the input's value is placed are every (N+1)th column. Wait:\n\nFor N=3, columns 3,7,11. Which is 3, 3+4, 3+8. So 4 is (N+1) = 4. Because 3+1=4. So for N=3, the columns are every 4 steps. Similarly for N=2, columns are 2,6,10. Which is 2, 2+4, 2+8. Again, 4 is N+1=3? No. Wait N=2, N+1 is 3. But the step is 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the step is 2*N. For N=3, 2*3=6. But the step is 4. No. Alternatively, the step is 2*(N) - 1. For N=3, 2*3-1=5. But the step is 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the columns for each example:\n\nFor N=3: columns are 3,7,11. These are 3 + 4*i, where i=0,1,2. 4 is 15/3.5? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the number of columns where the input's value is placed is (15 / N) - 1. For N=3, 15/3 =5. 5-1=4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the columns are spaced every 4 columns. For example, in Example 1, the columns are 3,7,11. Which is every 4 columns. For N=2, columns are 2,6,10. Which is every 4 columns. For N=4, columns are 4,8,12. Also every 4 columns. So the step between columns is 4. But why?\n\nWait, the output is 15x15. So the columns are 0-14. For N=3, the columns where the value is placed are 3,7,11. Which are 3, 3+4, 3+8. So the step is 4. For N=2, columns are 2, 6, 10. Step is 4. For N=4, columns are 4,8,12. Step is 4. So the step is 4. So regardless of the input size, the columns are spaced every 4 columns. But why?\n\nBut how does the input size relate to the columns? For example, for N=3, the columns are 3,7,11. Which is 3 = N, 7 = N + 4, 11 = N + 8. So for N=3, the first column is N, then N + 4, etc. So the first column is N, then every 4 steps. But why N?\n\nIn Example 2, N=2. The first column is 2, then 6, 10. Which is N, N+4, N+8. So same pattern.\n\nIn Example 3, N=4. The first column is 4, then 8, 12. Again, same pattern.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for each input size N, the columns where the input's value is placed are N, N+4, N+8, etc., up to 14 (since the output is 15 columns). But why 4?\n\nBecause the output is 15 columns. So for N=3, the first column is 3. Then adding 4 steps. 3, 7, 11. Next would be 15, but that's beyond 14. So for N=3, there are three columns. Similarly, for N=2, 2,6,10. For N=4, 4,8,12. So the columns are every 4 steps, starting from N.\n\nSo the columns where the input's value is placed are N, N+4, N+8, etc. So the columns are determined by N and the step of 4.\n\nThen, for each of these columns, the input's value is placed in the output grid. But how about the rows?\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1: the first three rows have 3s in columns 3,7,11. Then a row of all 3s. Then again the same pattern. So the rows are divided into groups of 3 rows, then a row of all 3s, then again 3 rows, then all 3s, etc.\n\nWait, the output is 15 rows. Let's see:\n\nExample 1's output has:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: same as row 0.\n\nRow 3: all 3s.\n\nRow 4: same as row 0.\n\nRow 5: same as row 0.\n\nRow 6: same as row 0.\n\nRow 7: all 3s.\n\nRow 8: same as row 0.\n\nRow 9: same as row 0.\n\nRow 10: same as row 0.\n\nRow 11: all 3s.\n\nRow 12: same as row 0.\n\nRow 13: same as row 0.\n\nRow 14: same as row 0.\n\nSo the pattern is that the first three rows (0-2) have the 3s in the columns. Then row 3 is all 3s. Then rows 4-6 are same as rows 0-2. Then row 7 is all 3s. Then rows 8-10 are same as rows 0-2. Then row 11 is all 3s. Then rows 12-14 are same as rows 0-2.\n\nSo the rows are divided into groups of 3 rows, followed by a row of all 3s. So the total rows are 3*5 = 15. Wait, 3 rows (group), 1 row (all 3s), repeated 3 times? No, 3 rows, 1 row, 3 rows, 1 row, 3 rows, 1 row. That's 3*3 + 1*3 = 12 rows. But the output is 15 rows. So maybe it's 3 groups of 3 rows, then 3 rows of all 3s? Or perhaps the pattern is that the output has 5 groups of 3 rows and 1 row of all 3s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that for each input row, the output has certain rows. For example, the input is 3x3. The output has 3 rows (rows 0-2) with the 3s in columns, then a row of all 3s, then rows 4-6 (same as 0-2), then row 7 (all 3s), then rows 8-10 (same as 0-2), then row 11 (all 3s), then rows 12-14 (same as 0-2). So for each group of 3 rows, followed by a row of all 3s, and this repeats. So the output has 5 groups of 3 rows and 3 rows of all 3s. But 3*5 + 3 = 18, which is more than 15. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the output has 5 rows of all 3s, but that doesn't fit the example.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the output has rows that alternate between the 3s in the columns and all 3s. For example, the first three rows are the same, then a row of all 3s, then the same three rows again, then all 3s, etc. So for 15 rows, that would be 3 rows, 1 row, 3 rows, 1 row, 3 rows, 1 row. That's 3*3 + 1*3 = 12 rows. But the output has 15 rows. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output is divided into 5 vertical strips. For example, the first 3 rows are the same, then a row of all 3s, then the same 3 rows again, then all 3s, then the same 3 rows again, then all 3s. But that would be 3+1+3+1+3+1 = 12 rows. Still not 15.\n\nAlternatively, the output is divided into 5 rows of all 3s. But that doesn't fit the example.\n\nAlternatively, the pattern is that the rows are divided into 5 groups of 3 rows each, and between them, there's a row of all 3s. But that would be 5*3 + 4 = 19 rows, which is not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the pattern is that the input's value is placed in certain positions in the output grid. For example, the input's value is placed in the columns that are every 4 steps starting from N, and the rows are divided into groups of 3 rows followed by a row of all 3s.\n\nBut how to translate this into code.\n\nSo, the steps to generate the output grid would be:\n\nFor each row in the output grid:\n\n- If the row is in a group of 3 rows (like 0-2, 4-6, 8-10, 12-14), then in those rows, the value is placed in the columns that are N, N+4, N+8, etc.\n\n- If the row is in the group of 1 row (like 3, 7, 11), then all the columns are filled with the input's value.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are in which group.\n\nAlternatively, the output rows are divided into 5 groups. For example, the first 3 rows (0-2), then row 3, then rows 4-6, then row 7, then rows 8-10, then row 11, then rows 12-14. This would give 3+1+3+1+3+1= 12 rows. But the output has 15 rows. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the rows are divided into 5 groups of 3 rows, and between them, there are 3 rows of all 3s. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for the output grid, the rows are divided into 5 vertical strips of 3 rows each, and each strip has the 3s in the middle columns. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for each row in the output grid, if the row number is even (0, 2, 4, etc.), then it has the 3s in the columns, else it has all 3s. But that doesn't fit the example.\n\nAlternatively, the rows are divided into 5 groups of 3 rows each, with the first group being rows 0-2, then row 3, then rows 4-6, then row 7, then rows 8-10, then row 11, then rows 12-14. This would give 3+1+3+1+3+1+3 = 15 rows. So that's 3 rows, 1 row, 3 rows, 1 row, 3 rows, 1 row, 3 rows. That totals 3*4 + 1*3 = 12 +3=15 rows.\n\nSo for the output grid, the rows are grouped as follows:\n\nGroup 0: rows 0-2 (3 rows) \u2192 these rows have the input's value in the columns.\n\nGroup 1: row 3 \u2192 all input's value.\n\nGroup 2: rows 4-6 (3 rows) \u2192 input's value in columns.\n\nGroup 3: row 7 \u2192 all input's value.\n\nGroup 4: rows 8-10 (3 rows) \u2192 input's value in columns.\n\nGroup 5: row 11 \u2192 all input's value.\n\nGroup 6: rows 12-14 (3 rows) \u2192 input's value in columns.\n\nSo, for each row in the output grid, if it is in a group that is even-numbered (group 0, 2, 4, 6), then the row has the input's value in the columns. If it's in a group that is odd-numbered (group 1, 3, 5), then the row is all input's value.\n\nSo the pattern is that the output rows are divided into groups of 3 rows, followed by a single row of all input's value. This repeats until all 15 rows are filled.\n\nSo the code would need to:\n\nFor each row in the output grid:\n\n- Determine which group it belongs to.\n\n- If it's in a group with 3 rows (even group), then the row has the input's value in the columns.\n\n- If it's in a group with 1 row (odd group), then the row is all input's value.\n\nSo how to determine the group.\n\nThe groups are:\n\nGroup 0: rows 0-2\n\nGroup 1: row 3\n\nGroup 2: rows 4-6\n\nGroup 3: row 7\n\nGroup 4: rows 8-10\n\nGroup 5: row 11\n\nGroup 6: rows 12-14\n\nSo for each row in 0-14:\n\nIf row % 4 == 0 \u2192 group 0, 2, 4, 6 \u2192 which are even groups.\n\nWait, row 0 \u2192 group 0.\n\nrow 3 \u2192 group 1.\n\nrow 4 \u2192 group 2.\n\nrow 7 \u2192 group 3.\n\nrow 8 \u2192 group 4.\n\nrow 11 \u2192 group 5.\n\nrow 12 \u2192 group 6.\n\nSo the group number is row // 4. Because:\n\nrow 0 \u2192 0//4 = 0 \u2192 group 0.\n\nrow 3 \u2192 3//4 = 0 \u2192 group 0? No, that's not right. Because row 3 is group 1. Hmm, perhaps the group number is (row // 4) + 1? Or maybe it's (row // 4) % 2?\n\nAlternatively, the group number can be determined by whether the row is in a group of 3 rows or 1 row.\n\nBut perhaps a better way is to check if the row is in the first three rows, then the next row is all, then next three, then all, etc.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, if (row // 4) is even, then it's in a group of 3 rows. If (row // 4) is odd, then it's in a group of 1 row.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe the code can be written as follows:\n\nFor each row in the output grid:\n\n- If the row is in positions 0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,14 \u2192 it's in a group of 3 rows.\n\n- Else, it's in a group of 1 row.\n\nSo for each row, if (row % 4) is 0, 1, or 2 \u2192 group of 3 rows. If (row %4) is 3 \u2192 group of 1 row.\n\nSo for row 0 \u2192 0%4=0 \u2192 group of 3 rows.\n\nrow 3 \u2192 3%4=3 \u2192 group of 1 row.\n\nrow 4 \u2192 4%4=0 \u2192 group of 3 rows.\n\nrow 7 \u2192 7%4=3 \u2192 group of 1 row.\n\nrow 8 \u2192 8%4=0 \u2192 group of 3 rows.\n\nrow 11 \u2192 11%4=3 \u2192 group of 1 row.\n\nrow 12 \u2192 12%4=0 \u2192 group of 3 rows.\n\nSo this seems to fit.\n\nSo for each row in the output grid, if the row %4 is 0,1,2 \u2192 it's in a group of 3 rows. Else, it's in a group of 1 row.\n\nSo, for each row in the output grid:\n\nif row %4 != 3 \u2192 then the row has the input's value in certain columns.\n\nelse \u2192 the row is all input's value.\n\nNow, for the columns, as discussed earlier, the columns where the input's value is placed are N, N+4, N+8, etc., up to 14.\n\nSo for example, if the input is 3x3, N=3. The columns are 3,7,11.\n\nFor N=2, columns are 2,6,10.\n\nFor N=4, columns are 4,8,12.\n\nSo the code needs to generate these columns.\n\nSo the steps for the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the output grid (15 rows):\n\n- Determine if it's in a group of 3 rows or 1 row.\n\n- For each column in the output grid (15 columns):\n\n   - if the row is in a group of 1 row \u2192 set the value to the input's value.\n\n   - else:\n\n      - check if the column is in the list of columns [N, N+4, N+8, ...] up to 14.\n\n      - if yes \u2192 set the value to the input's value.\n\n      - else \u2192 set to 0.\n\nBut wait, what is the input's value? The input is a grid of values. For example, in Example 1, the input is 3x3 of 3s. So the output grid's value is 3 in the specified positions. But what if the input has multiple values? For example, in Example 2, the input is 2x2 of 8s. So the output grid's value is 8 in the specified positions.\n\nBut how to get the input's value? The input grid is given as a 2D list. The output grid is generated based on the input grid's values. For example, if the input is a 3x3 grid, then the output grid's value is the value of the input's cell (i,j) in the corresponding position. Wait, no. Because in the examples, the input is a grid of the same value. For example, in Example 1, the input is all 3s. So the output grid is filled with 3s in the specified positions.\n\nBut what if the input has different values? For example, if the input is a 2x2 grid with values 8 and 2. How would that affect the output?\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the input grid is a 2D list where each cell has a value. The output grid is generated based on the input's value. So for each cell in the input grid, the corresponding value in the output grid is determined by the pattern.\n\nWait, but the examples show that the input is a grid of the same value. So perhaps the output grid is filled with the value of the input's cell (i,j) in certain positions. But how to determine which positions.\n\nBut this is unclear. However, looking at the examples, the input grid's value is the same for all cells. So the output grid is filled with that value in the specified positions.\n\nSo the code needs to:\n\nFor each cell in the output grid:\n\n- If the row is in a group of 1 row \u2192 set to the input's value (which is the same for all cells in the input).\n\n- Else, if the column is in the list of columns [N, N+4, N+8, ...] \u2192 set to the input's value.\n\n- Else \u2192 0.\n\nBut what is the input's value?

So perhaps the code should take the value of the input grid's cell (i,j) and use that for the output grid. But how to determine which cell's value to use.\n\nWait, the input is a grid of size M x N. The output is 15x15. How does the input's value relate to the output's value?\n\nIn the examples, the input is a grid of the same value. So the output is filled with that value in the specified positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Perhaps the code should take the value of the input grid's cell (i,j) and use that for the output grid.

For example, the input's value is the value of the input grid's cell (i,j), and the output grid's cell (i,j) is set to that value if it's in the specified positions.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nThe code will generate the output grid as follows:\n\nFor each row in the output grid (15 rows):\n\n- If the row is in a group of 1 row (row %4 == 3), then all cells in that row are set to the input's value.\n\n- Else, for each column in the output grid (15 columns):\n\n   - if the column is in the list of columns [N, N+4, N+8, ...], then set to the input's value.\n\n   - else, set to 0.\n\nBut what is the input's value? Since the input is a grid, perhaps the input's value is the value of the input's cell (i,j) where i and j are the row and column of the input grid. But how to determine which cell (i,j) to use.\n\nBut in the examples, the input is a grid of the same value. So the code can take the value of the input's cell (0,0) as the input's value. For example, in Example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid of 3s, so the value is 3.\n\nSo the code can take the value of the input's cell (0,0) as the input's value.\n\nBut this is not correct if the input has different values. But given the examples, this is the best approach.\n\nSo the code would:\n\n- Get the input's value as the value of the input's cell (0,0).\n\n- For each row in the output grid:\n\n   - if the row is in a group of 1 row \u2192 set all cells to the input's value.\n\n   - else:\n\n      - for each column in the output grid:\n\n         - if the column is in the list of columns [N, N+4, N+8, ...], set to input's value.\n\n         - else, 0.\n\nBut how to determine N, which is the size of the input grid.\n\nThe input grid is given as a 2D list. So the code can determine the input's size as M x N, where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns.\n\nBut in the examples, the input is a square grid. For example, Example 1: 3x3, Example 2: 2x2, Example 3: 4x4.\n\nSo the code can take N as the number of columns in the input grid.\n\nBut in the examples, the input's value is the same for all cells. So the code can take the value of the input's cell (0,0) as the input's value.\n\nBut this is not correct if the input has different values, but given the examples, it's the best approach.\n\nSo the code would:\n\n- Determine the input's value as grid[0][0].\n\n- Determine the input's size as M x N, where M is len(grid), N is len(grid[0]).\n\n- For each row in the output grid (15 rows):\n\n   - if row %4 == 3 \u2192 set all cells to input_value.\n\n   - else:\n\n      - for each column in 0-14:\n\n         - if column is in the list [N, N+4, N+8, ...] up to 14 \u2192 set to input_value.\n\n         - else \u2192 0.\n\nBut wait, what if the input is not square? For example, if the input is 2x3. Then N is 3, and the columns would be 3, 7, 11. But 3+4=7, 7+4=11, 11+4=15, which is beyond 14. So the columns would be 3,7,11.\n\nSo the code can generate the columns as follows:\n\ncolumns = [N + 4*i for i in range(0, 4) if N + 4*i < 15]\n\nBut this is not correct. For example, if N=3, 3+4*0=3, 3+4*1=7, 3+4*2=11, 3+4*3=15 which is beyond 14. So the columns are 3,7,11.\n\nSo the code can generate the columns as [N + 4*i for i in range(0, 4) if N + 4*i < 15].\n\nBut how to determine N. N is the number of columns in the input grid.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- input_value = grid[0][0]\n\n- input_rows = len(grid)\n\n- input_cols = len(grid[0])\n\n- N = input_cols\n\n- columns = [N + 4*i for i in range(0, 4) if N + 4*i < 15]\n\nBut this would generate columns for the input's columns.\n\nSo, for each row in the output grid:\n\n   if row %4 == 3:\n\n      set all cells to input_value\n\n   else:\n\n      for each column in 0-14:\n\n         if column in columns:\n\n            set to input_value\n\n         else:\n\n            0\n\nSo this would generate the output grid as per the examples.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nInput is 3x3 grid. N=3.\n\ncolumns = [3,7,11].\n\nFor rows 0-2,4-6,8-10,12-14, the code checks if column is in columns.\n\nFor example, row 0:\n\ncolumns 3,7,11 are set to input_value (3), others are 0.\n\nSo the first row of the output is 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 \u2192 which matches Example 1.\n\nRow 3 is all 3s.\n\nSo this seems to work.\n\nFor Example 2, input is 2x2 grid. N=2.\n\ncolumns = [2,6,10].\n\nSo for rows 0-2,4-6,8-10,12-14:\n\ncolumns 2,6,10 are set to input_value (8), others 0.\n\nWhich matches Example 2.\n\nFor Example 3, input is 4x4 grid. N=4.\n\ncolumns = [4,8,12].\n\nWhich matches Example 3.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern.\n\nSo the code would implement this logic.\n\nNow, the code needs to handle the input grid, which can be of any size (not necessarily square). So the code will:\n\n- Determine the input's value as grid[0][0].\n\n- Determine the input's columns as input_cols = len(grid[0]).\n\n- Generate the columns as [N + 4*i for i in range(0, 4) if N + 4*i < 15].\n\n- For each row in the output grid (15 rows):\n\n   - if row %4 == 3 \u2192 set all cells to input_value.\n\n   - else:\n\n      - for each column in 0-14:\n\n         - if column is in columns \u2192 input_value.\n\n         - else \u2192 0.\n\nSo the code can be written as follows.\n\nNow, let's write the code.\n\nThe function transform(grid) should return a 15x15 grid.\n\nSo:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    input_value = grid[0][0]\n    input_rows = len(grid)\n    input_cols = len(grid[0]) if input_rows > 0 else 0\n    N = input_cols\n    columns = []\n    for i in range(4):\n        col = N + 4 * i\n        if col < 15:\n            columns.append(col)\n    # Now generate the output grid\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]\n    for row in range(15):\n        if row % 4 == 3:\n            for col in range(15):\n                output[row][col] = input_value\n        else:\n            for col in range(15):\n                if col in columns:\n                    output[row][col] = input_value\n                else:\n                    output[row][col] = 0\n    return output\n\nBut wait, in the examples, the output has rows that are not all input_value. For example, in Example 1, the first three rows are not all input_value. So the code checks if row %4 ==3, which is true for row 3, 7, 11, etc. So for rows 0-2, 4-6, 8-10, 12-14, the code checks if the column is in columns. So this should work.\n\nTesting this code with the examples:\n\nExample 1:\n\ninput_value = 3.\n\ncolumns = [3,7,11].\n\nFor rows 0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,14:\n\neach row is processed. For each column, if it is in columns, set to 3.\n\nSo the first row is 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 \u2192 correct.\n\nRow 3 is all 3s.\n\nYes.\n\nExample 2:\n\ninput_value = 8.\n\ncolumns = [2,6,10].\n\nRows 0-2,4-6,8-10,12-14: columns 2,6,10 are 8, others 0.\n\nRow 3 is all 8s.\n\nYes.\n\nExample 3:\n\ninput_value = 2.\n\ncolumns = [4,8,12].\n\nRows 0-2,4-6,8-10,12-14: columns 4,8,12 are 2, others 0.\n\nRow 3 is all 2s.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this code should work.\n\nBut what about when the input is not square? For example, input is 2x3.\n\ninput_cols = 3.\n\ncolumns = [3,7,11].\n\nSo for rows not in group of 1, the code sets columns 3,7,11 to input_value.\n\nThis should work.\n\nSo this code should handle the examples correctly.\n"
