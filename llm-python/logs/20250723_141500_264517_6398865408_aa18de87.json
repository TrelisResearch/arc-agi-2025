If it is not zero, we replace the cell and its adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) with `2`.\n\nHere is the Python function that implements this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the directions for adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Replace the current cell and its adjacent cells with 2\n                for di, dj in directions:\n                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                    if 0 <= ni < len(grid) and 0 <= nj < len(grid[0]):\n                        transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis function will transform the input grid by replacing each non-zero cell and its adjacent cells with `2`. Note that this transformation does not handle the case where the input grid has zeros in a way that would create a larger pattern of `2`s. However, based on the given examples, this is the best pattern that can be observed and implemented.",
