Here's a Python function to achieve this:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    transformed_grid = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                if i + 1 < rows and j + 1 < cols:\n                    transformed_grid[i + 1][j + 1] = 8\n                elif i + 1 < rows:\n                    transformed_grid[i + 1][j] = 8\n                elif j + 1 < cols:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j + 1] = 8\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8  # No valid position to shift, keep it as is\n\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    transformed_grid = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]\n\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                if i + 1 < rows and j + 1 < cols:\n                    transformed_grid[i + 1][j + 1] = 8\n                elif i + 1 < rows:\n                    transformed_grid[i + 1][j] = 8\n                elif j + 1 < cols:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j + 1] = 8\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8  # No valid position to shift, keep it as is\n\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
