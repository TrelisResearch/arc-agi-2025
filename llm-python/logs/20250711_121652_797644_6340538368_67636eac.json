We scan the grid to find all connected components of non-zero cells (4-connectivity).\n2. For each component, we record its color, list of points, mean column (for left-to-right sorting), and its bounding box.\n3. We sort the shapes by mean column (so leftmost shape first).\n4. We allocate a 3\u00d79 zero grid, then for the first three shapes we extract a 3\u00d73 block from their bounding region (padding or cropping if needed) and place each block side by side.\n5. The final grid is always 3 rows by 9 columns."

We scan the grid to find all connected components of non-zero cells (4-connectivity).\n2. For each component, we record its color, list of points, mean column (for left-to-right sorting), and its bounding box.\n3. We sort the shapes by mean column (so leftmost shape first).\n4. We allocate a 3\u00d79 zero grid, then for the first three shapes we extract a 3\u00d73 block from their bounding region (padding or cropping if needed) and place each block side by side.\n5. The final grid is always 3 rows by 9 columns."
