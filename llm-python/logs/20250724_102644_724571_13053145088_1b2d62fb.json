    "reasoning": "**Mapping the Inputs**\n\nI've started by examining the training examples for `transform(grid)`. It's clear a transformation is needed to reshape the grid. I need to figure out the specific mapping logic from input to output, focusing on the size change and element re-arrangement. My immediate next step is to look for any common elements or patterns across the examples.\n\n\n**Decoding the Pattern**\n\nI've identified a key separation in the input grid, with a central column of '1's dividing it into left and right sections. The transformation seems to selectively use elements from the input to build the 5x3 output. I'm beginning to see a correlation between the right side of the input grid and the placement of '8's in specific output rows, while the left side of the input seems less influential. My focus shifts to the mapping logic of these sides.\n\n\n**Unraveling Row-Level Logic**\n\nI've started focusing on each row individually, analyzing how it contributes to the output. The count of '9's in both the left and right sections of the input grid seem relevant. I suspect these counts might be used in determining the placement of '8's in the corresponding output rows, although the mapping isn't immediately apparent. I am currently working on formulating hypotheses around this observation.\n\n\n**Investigating Value Transformation**\n\nI'm now focused on the specific values and their transformation, specifically focusing on the 9s in the input, and how they might be translated into 8s. The `L_count` and `R_count` don't show a simple, straightforward mapping. I'm considering if there is a conditional replacement of 9s based on their positions, or on other row-based conditions derived from the other numbers. My current focus is on discerning how the output '8's are generated, and where the source input '9's came from.\n\n\n**Formulating a Key Hypothesis**\n\nI've identified that the `transform` function appears to map a 5x7 input grid to a 5x3 output, based on the individual rows. Specifically, when the input row contains `0 0 0 | 1 | 9 0 0`, the output becomes `0 8 8`. I'm trying to codify this rule. Now I am attempting to expand the conditions where '8' appears.\n\n\n**Testing Conditional Replacements**\n\nI'm now concentrating on the idea of conditional replacements. It seems there might be a rule where certain input values become '8's in the output. My experiments are focusing on specific positions and row conditions to pin down the exact logic. Right now, I'm verifying how those '8's appear based on the left and right side values in the input row.\n\n\n**Defining Output Conditions**\n\nI'm refining the rules for generating the output. After examining various examples, a key condition for an '8' appears to be a '9' in the input, specifically in the right-hand section. I'm testing if the presence of this '9' is enough to trigger the '8'. I am also looking into the conditions for the output columns, independently.\n\n\n**Finalizing Output Rules**\n\nI'm now in the process of formalizing the rules, and identifying all conditions that lead to an output of 8. I've determined that when `0 0 0 | 1 | 9 0 0` exists, the output must be `0 8 8`, but the '8's can also be derived when a '9' is found in the right half of an input row, independent of the values in the left side. The next step is to construct the logic for when to output a '0'.\n\n\n**Refining the Conditions**\n\nI'm now focused on the condition when the output should be '8'. The presence of '9' on the right side seems crucial. The output is always `0 8 8` for the input pattern `0 0 0 | 1 | 9 0 0`. Now, the plan is to identify all the conditions to make an output '8'.\n\n\n**Formulating the Core Logic**\n\nI've solidified a key part of the transformation: an input row of `0 0 0 | 1 | 9 0 0` always yields an output of `0 8 8`. The '8's result from a '9' in the right half. My current task is to define the conditions for the '8' outputs.\n\n\n**Forming Output Conditions**\n\nI've solidified the critical conditions, a '9' in the right section and a '1' in the center column. If the input has the specific structure `0 0 0 | 1 | 9 0 0`, the output must be `0 8 8`. Now I'm working out the general rules for other inputs.\n\n\n**Confirming the Rule**\n\nI'm now certain the output value hinges on conditions within the input row. The presence of a '9' in the right section is not a sufficient condition to generate an '8'. I need the exact condition. I'm now working on codifying this specific relationship.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Logic**\n\nI've now formulated a rule where if the corresponding input left and right sides both have a 0, then the output becomes an 8. Otherwise, it's a zero. This simple hypothesis explains the observed outputs. I'm proceeding with coding based on these rules.\n\n\n**Verifying the Core Logic**\n\nThe output of each row is directly influenced by elements within that row. My current focus is verifying the established core principle: if both the left and right parts (columns 0-2, and 4-6 respectively) of an input row at a certain index contain a 0, the output grid will contain an 8 at that index. The other outputs will then be 0.\n\n\n**Refining the Rule**\n\nI'm now refining the core logic to a more concise definition. After testing against all examples, the transformation to '8' occurs when corresponding values in the input's left and right halves are *both* zero. Otherwise, the output is zero. The core principle is now verified.\n\n\n**Confirming Output Conditions**\n\nI'm now confirming that the output's '8's only result when both the left and right sides of the input have a 0 at the same index position. I will use these findings to generate the corresponding output.\n\n\n",

Specifically, when the input row contains `0 0 0 | 1 | 9 0 0`, the output becomes `0 8 8`. I'm trying to codify this rule. Now I am attempting to expand the conditions where '8' appears.\n\n\n**Testing Conditional Replacements**\n\nI'm now concentrating on the idea of conditional replacements. It seems there might be a rule where certain input values become '8's in the output. My experiments are focusing on specific positions and row conditions to pin down the exact logic. Right now, I'm verifying how those '8's appear based on the left and right side values in the input row.\n\n\n**Defining Output Conditions**\n\nI'm refining the rules for generating the output. After examining various examples, a key condition for an '8' appears to be a '9' in the input, specifically in the right-hand section. I'm testing if the presence of this '9' is enough to trigger the '8'. I am also looking into the conditions for the output columns, independently.\n\n\n**Finalizing Output Rules**\n\nI'm now in the process of formalizing the rules, and identifying all conditions that lead to an output of 8. I've determined that when `0 0 0 | 1 | 9 0 0` exists, the output must be `0 8 8`, but the '8's can also be derived when a '9' is found in the right half of an input row, independent of the values in the left side. The next step is to construct the logic for when to output a '0'.\n\n\n**Refining the Conditions**\n\nI'm now focused on the condition when the output should be '8'. The presence of '9' on the right side seems crucial. The output is always `0 8 8` for the input pattern `0 0 0 | 1 | 9 0 0`. Now, the plan is to identify all the conditions to make an output '8'.\n\n\n**Formulating the Core Logic**\n\nI've solidified a key part of the transformation: an input row of `0 0 0 | 1 | 9 0 0` always yields an output of `0 8 8`. The '8's result from a '9' in the right half. My current task is to define the conditions for the '8' outputs.\n\n\n**Forming Output Conditions**\n\nI've solidified the critical conditions, a '9' in the right section and a '1' in the center column. If the input has the specific structure `0 0 0 | 1 | 9 0 0`, the output must be `0 8 8`. Now I'm working out the general rules for other inputs.\n\n\n**Confirming the Rule**\n\nI'm now certain the output value hinges on conditions within the input row. The presence of a '9' in the right section is not a sufficient condition to generate an '8'. I need the exact condition. I'm now working on codifying this specific relationship.\n\n\n**Defining the Core Logic**\n\nI've now formulated a rule where if the corresponding input left and right sides both have a 0, then the output becomes an 8. Otherwise, it's a zero. This simple hypothesis explains the observed outputs. I'm proceeding with coding based on these rules.\n\n\n**Verifying the Core Logic**\n\nThe output of each row is directly influenced by elements within that row. My current focus is verifying the established core principle: if both the left and right parts (columns 0-2, and 4-6 respectively) of an input row at a certain index contain a 0, the output grid will contain an 8 at that index. The other outputs will then be 0.\n\n\n**Refining the Rule**\n\nI'm now refining the core logic to a more concise definition. After testing against all examples, the transformation to '8' occurs when corresponding values in the input's left and right halves are *both* zero. Otherwise, the output is zero. The core principle is now verified.\n\n\n**Confirming Output Conditions**\n\nI'm now confirming that the output's '8's only result when both the left and right sides of the input have a 0 at the same index position. I will use these findings to generate the corresponding output.\n\n\n",
