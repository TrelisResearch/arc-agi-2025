          "From analyzing the training examples and their outputs, there is a clear and strong pattern:\n\n- In each training example, the output is a **3x3 grid filled with a single color**.\n- This single color corresponds to the **color of the largest contiguous colored shape in the input grid that is *not* color 0** (color 0 usually corresponds to black/background).\n- The largest connected region (by number of cells) of a non-zero color determines the output color.\n- The output is a 3x3 grid filled uniformly with that color.\n\nSteps to implement:\n\n1. Identify all connected components of each color in the input, ignoring color 0.\n2. Find the largest component across all colors.\n3. Extract the color of that largest component.\n4. Construct a 3x3 grid filled with that color.\n\nThis matches the training examples exactly:\n\n- Example 1\u2019s largest nonzero region is color 4 \u2192 output all 4\u2019s.\n- Example 2\u2019s largest nonzero region is color 3 \u2192 output all 3\u2019s.\n- Example 3\u2019s largest nonzero region is color 8 \u2192 output all 8\u2019s.\n\nThe size or shape of the region doesn\u2019t matter beyond it being the largest connected one.\n\nNow, I will implement this in Python.
