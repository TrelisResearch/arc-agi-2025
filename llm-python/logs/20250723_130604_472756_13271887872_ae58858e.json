              "content": "Let's analyze the patterns in the training examples:\n\n1. **Example 1**:\n   - The input grid has a 2x2 pattern of `2` surrounded by `0`.\n   - The output grid replaces the `2` with `6` and keeps the `0` unchanged.\n\n2. **Example 2**:\n   - The input grid has a 2x2 pattern of `2` surrounded by `0` and some additional `2` values.\n   - The output grid replaces the `2` with `6` and keeps the `0` unchanged, but the additional `2` values are replaced by `6` if they are part of the pattern.\n\n3. **Example 3**:\n   - The input grid has a 2x2 pattern of `2` surrounded by `0`.\n   - The output grid replaces the `2` with `6` and keeps the `0` unchanged.\n\n4. **Example 4**:\n   - The input grid has a 2x2 pattern of `2` surrounded by `0` and some additional `2` values.\n   - The output grid replaces the `2` with `6` and keeps the `0` unchanged, but the additional `2` values are replaced by `6` if they are part of the pattern.\n\nFrom these examples, we can observe that the transformation involves replacing `2` with `6` in the input grid, while keeping the `0` unchanged. The pattern seems to be that any `2` that is part of the 2x2 pattern surrounded by `0` should be replaced by `6`.\n\nLet's implement this pattern in a Python function:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]  # Create a copy of the input grid\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(grid) - 1):\n        for j in range(1, len(grid[0]) - 1):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2 and grid[i-1][j] == 0 and grid[i+1][j] == 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 0 and grid[i][j+1] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis function iterates through each cell in the grid (excluding the borders) and checks if it is part of a 2x2 pattern of `2`s surrounded by `0`s. If it is, it replaces the `2` with `6`. Otherwise, it keeps the value unchanged.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]  # Create a copy of the input grid\n    \n    for i in range(1, len(grid) - 1):\n        for j in range(1, len(grid[0]) - 1):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2 and grid[i-1][j] == 0 and grid[i+1][j] == 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 0 and grid[i][j+1] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The patterns are likely related to the arrangement of `2`s in the input grid.\n\n### Implementation:\nGiven the observations, a simple transformation could be to replace all occurrences of `2` with `6` in the input grid. However, this might not capture all nuances of the patterns observed in the training examples. For a more accurate transformation, we would need to identify and preserve the shapes formed by `2`s.\n\nSince we don't have enough information to implement a more complex transformation, let's start with the simplest one:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]  # Create a deep copy of the input grid\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[i])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis function simply replaces all `2`s with `6`s in the input grid and returns the transformed grid.\n\n### Final Answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]  # Create a deep copy of the input grid\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[i])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis solution attempts to capture the most basic pattern observed in the training examples, where `2`s are replaced by `6`s.",
