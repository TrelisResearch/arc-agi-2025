The key observations:\n- The input includes a \"3rd line\" with some numbers, possibly indicating parameters.\n- The output seems to rearrange or rotate some parts, but the details are not clear from just this fragment.\n\n**Example 2:**\nInput:\n```\n3 3 8\n3 7 0\n5 0 0\n```\nOutput:\n```\n0 0 5\n0 7 3\n8 3 3\n```\n\nAgain, there\u2019s a pattern:\n- The third number in the input line appears to be 8, and in the output, the numbers seem to be rearranged in a pattern.\n- It looks like the input grid might be flipped or rotated to generate the output.\n\n**Common pattern:**\n- Observing the transformations, the second example seems to match the rotation or flipping pattern:\n  - The input:\n    ```\n    3 7 0\n    5 0 0\n    ```\n  - The output:\n    ```\n    0 0 5\n    0 7 3\n    8 3 3\n    ```\n- The first two rows are just reversed or rotated in some way.\n- The last line in the input (like \"3 3 8\") might be parameters for the transformation.\n\n**Assumption:**\n- The first two numbers are the dimensions of the grid (rows and columns).\n- The third number is some mode or parameter, possibly indicating the type of transformation (e.g., rotate, flip, etc.).\n\n**Testing with the test input:**\n```\n6 3 5\n6 8 0\n4 0 0\n```\nThe input grid:\n```\n6 8 0\n4 0 0\n```\n\nPossible transformations:\n- Rotate 90\u00b0, then flip.\n- Or, transpose and then reverse rows or columns.\n\nNote:\n- The first example resembles a transpose + reverse pattern.\n- The second resembles rotating 180\u00b0.\n\nGiven these clues, a common approach in abstract reasoning exercises like ARC is to rotate the grid anti-clockwise or clockwise based on a parameter.\n\nSince the third parameter varies and no explicit rule is clear, but both examples result in some form of rearrangement, let's hypothesize that:\n\n- The third number indicates a rotation mode:\n  - For example, 0: rotate 90\u00b0, 1: rotate 180\u00b0, 2: rotate 270\u00b0, etc.\n- Alternatively, the number could represent other transformations.\n\nBut given the data, the most likely pattern is the rotation by 180\u00b0, considering the second example's output.\n\n**Testing the hypothesis:**\n- The second example seems like a 180\u00b0 rotation:\n  Original:\n  ```\n  3 7 0\n  5 0 0\n  ```\n  Rotated 180\u00b0:\n  ```\n  0 0 5\n  0 7 3\n  ```\n  but matching exactly, seems similar to the output.\n\nTherefore, the simplest implementation consistent with the provided examples is:\n\n- Read the grid\n- Apply a rotation based on the third parameter.\n\n**Implementation plan:**\n- Parse the input\n- Based on the third parameter:\n  - For 0: rotate 180\u00b0\n  - For other parameters, apply other transformations if necessary\n- Return the transformed grid\n\n### Code implementation:\nWe will assume the third parameter indicates the number of 90\u00b0 rotations clockwise (i.e., 1: 90\u00b0, 2: 180\u00b0, 3: 270\u00b0, etc.).  \nIn the provided examples, the transformations align with 180\u00b0 rotations.\n\nLet's implement a general rotation function.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Extract dimensions - in this context, dimensions are an implicit part of the grid shape\n    # because the input format might be different, but for this problem, assume grid is already parsed.\n    # Since the input includes dimensions and the grid after, we can ignore dims here.\n    # But since we are only given the grid, we assume grid is a list of lists.\n    \n    # For demonstration, let's define the rotation logic.\n    # Based on earlier analysis and examples, we will perform a 180-degree rotation.\n    \n    # Rotate 180 degrees\n    transformed_grid = [row[::-1] for row in grid[::-1]]\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
