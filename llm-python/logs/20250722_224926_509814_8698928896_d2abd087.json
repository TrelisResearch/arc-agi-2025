          "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to find a pattern that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the examples provided. Let me examine the training examples carefully to see what's common.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput has a 5 in certain cells, and the output converts some of them into 1s and 2s based on their positions. The output seems to depend on the structure of the 5s. For example, the cell at (0, 2) in input is 5, and the output for that position is 1. But there are other cells that are 5 in the input that turn into 2s. So maybe the output color depends on the position relative to some central point or the distance from a certain area.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\nThe output has regions where 1s and 2s are placed based on the shape of the 5s. It seems that cells that are part of a connected component of 5s might be colored based on their distance from a certain line or point. For example, the output has 2s in some places and 1s in others, which might be based on the position relative to a line or a rotated square.\n\nHmm, maybe the transformation is based on the color of the original cells (5) and their distance from the nearest vertex of a square or rectangle. For instance, in Example 1, the 5s form a kind of L-shape, and the output colors are based on how far they are from certain lines or points. The 1s and 2s might represent different levels of distance from a central axis or a line that's rotated 45 degrees.\n\nAnother approach is to think of the 5s as forming certain shapes (like rectangles, L-shapes, etc.) and the output color depends on their position relative to those shapes. For example, in Example 3, the output for some cells is 1, and others are 2, which might indicate that the 5s are part of either a diagonal line or another structure. The color might be determined by the minimal distance from a certain line or point.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3's output, the transformed cells have values of 1 and 2. Let me check the position of the input cells. For instance, in the input grid, cells that are part of the connected component of 5s might be colored based on their position relative to a line. For example, cells that are on one side of a diagonal line (like the line y = -x + c) might be colored 1, and those on the other side 2. But I need to verify this with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the color is determined by the minimal distance from a rotated square. For example, if the original 5s form a rectangle, cells inside the rectangle might be colored based on their position relative to the sides of the rectangle. Or perhaps the color is determined by the minimum distance from a certain line.\n\nLet me think about the output in Example 1. The output has a 1 in cell (0, 2), which is part of a connected component of 5s. But the output for other cells in the same connected component is 2. So maybe the color depends on the position relative to the line y = 0.5 (horizontal line), but that doesn't fit all the data. Alternatively, maybe it's based on the distance from a certain diagonal line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is based on the minimal distance to a line that's rotated at 45 degrees. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 1 in cell (0, 2). The line y = x + c might be involved. The distance from a point (r, c) to the line y = x + c is given by the formula |r - c + c| / sqrt(2), but this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the color is determined by the minimal distance to a certain line. For example, in Example 1, the line y = -x + 5. The distance from a cell (r, c) to this line is |r + c - 5| / sqrt(2). The output for cell (0, 2) is 1. Let's compute that: r + c -5 = 0 + 2 -5 = -3. The absolute value is 3, divided by sqrt(2), which is about 2.12. But the output is 1, so this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps the output color is based on the minimal distance to a line, but in integer terms. For example, the distance is rounded to the nearest integer. Or maybe it's based on how many steps away the cell is from the line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is based on the color of the original input cell and the position of the cell in the grid. For instance, if a cell is part of a certain structure, it might be colored based on its position in a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput has a 5 at (0, 2) and the output is 1. The cell is at (r, c) = (0, 2). The output is 1. The line y = -x + 5. The distance is |0 + 2 -5| / sqrt(2) = 3/sqrt(2) \u2248 2.12, which is more than 1. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the distance to a certain line, but the color is determined by the integer part of the distance. For example, if the distance is less than 1, it's 0; between 1 and 2, it's 1; between 2 and 3, it's 2, etc. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is determined by the minimal distance to the line y = -x + 5, but the distance is calculated in a different way. Wait, for example, in Example 1, the output for cell (0, 2) is 1. The line is y = -x + 5. The minimal distance from (0, 2) to this line is |0 + 2 -5| / sqrt(2) = 3 / sqrt(2) \u2248 2.12. But the output is 1. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the correct pattern.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output color is based on the color of the original input cell and its position in the grid. For example, if the input cell is 5, then check if it's part of a certain shape, and assign color based on that.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is based on whether the cell is in the same diagonal region as a certain point. For example, cells that are on the same diagonal line as (r + c) = k might be colored 1 or 2 based on k.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is based on the minimum number of steps from a certain point. For instance, in Example 1, the output cell (0, 2) is colored 1, but other cells in the same connected component are colored 2. Maybe the output color depends on the distance from the nearest point that is part of a certain color.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to look for a different approach. Let me think about the output in Example 2. The output has 1s and 2s, but the input has 5s. The output seems to be based on the position of the 5s relative to a certain line or point.\n\nAnother idea: the output color is determined by the number of steps away from the line y = 0 or x = 0, but that doesn't seem to fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is based on whether the cell is part of a certain pattern. For example, cells that are part of a diagonal line (y = x + c) are colored 1, and those that are part of a different line are colored 2. But I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is determined by the parity of the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if r + c is even, color 1; else color 2. But in Example 1, cell (0, 2) has r + c = 2 even, which is color 1. Cell (7, 0) has r + c = 7 odd, but the output is 2. So that fits. Wait, but in Example 3, cell (0, 2) has r + c = 2 (even), output is 1. Cell (0, 7) has r + c = 7 (odd), output is 2. So that seems to fit. But in Example 1, the output for cell (0, 2) is 1. That fits. But wait in Example 3's output, cell (7, 0) has output 2, which is correct. So maybe the output color is determined by the parity of r + c. If r + c is even, output is 1; else output is 2. But wait, in Example 2's output, the cell (0, 0) has output 2. r + c is 0 even, but output is 2, which contradicts this hypothesis. So that idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that the transformation is not based on the parity of the sum. But maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is based on the sum of r and c. If the sum is less than 5, then 1; else 2. But in Example 1, cell (0, 2) has sum 2 < 5, output is 1. Cell (0, 7) has sum 7, output is 2. That fits. In Example 3, cell (0, 2) sum is 2 <5, output is 1. Cell (0,7) sum is 7, output is 2. But cell (0, 0) sum is 0 <5, but output is 2. So that doesn't fit. Hence, this idea is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: the output color is based on the minimum of r and c. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output color depends on the distance from a certain line that is not a diagonal. For example, the line y = x. For cells on one side of this line, color is 1, and on the other side, color is 2. But in Example 1, cell (0, 2) is on the line y = x + 2, which would be above the line y = x. So the distance depends on the minimal steps to the line y = x. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is based on the number of steps to the nearest vertical line x = c or horizontal line y = r. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling to find a clear pattern, perhaps the best approach is to look for other patterns. For example, in the output of Example 1, the cells that are 5 in the input are transformed into 1 or 2 based on their position relative to a central point. For instance, in Example 1, the output has 1s in certain cells and 2s in others. Maybe this is based on the distance to a certain point, like the center of the grid.\n\nFor example, the center of the grid is at (5,5). The distance from a cell (r,c) to the center is sqrt((r-5)^2 + (c-5)^2). If this distance is less than 1.5, then color 1; else 2. But this is just a guess. Let's test this hypothesis with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the cell (0, 2) is at (0,2). Distance to center (5,5): sqrt((5-0)^2 + (5-2)^2) = sqrt(25 +9) = sqrt(34) \u2248 5.83. That's way more than 1.5. But output is 1, so this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe the color is based on the minimal number of steps to reach a certain line. For example, the line x + y = 5. The distance from a cell (r,c) to this line is |r + c -5| / sqrt(2). The output color is based on this distance. Let's test this in Example 1.\n\nFor cell (0,2): |0+2-5| = 3. Divided by sqrt(2) \u2248 2.12. So this distance is more than 1. So output color could be 2, but the output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the color is based on the integer part of the distance multiplied by some factor. For example, if the distance is less than 1.5, output 1. Else, output 2. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 3. The cell (0,2) is output 1, and the line x + y = 5. The distance is 3 / sqrt(2) \u2248 2.12. So the output is 1. This doesn't fit the previous hypothesis. Hence, there's no clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is based on whether the cell is part of a certain connected component. For example, cells that are connected in a certain way are colored 1, and others 2. But that's not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a transformation rule that can be applied to the input grid to generate the output grid. Given that the output colors are 1 and 2, and the input is 5, perhaps the output color is based on the position of the cell relative to the line x + y = 5. Let's test this in the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, cell (0,2): x + y = 2 < 5. The output is 1. Cell (7,0): x + y =7 >5. Output is 2. Cell (0,7): x + y =7 >5. Output is 2. Cell (2,0): x + y=2 <5. Output is 1. That fits. For Example 2, cell (0,0): x + y =0 <5. Output is 2. Wait, this contradicts the previous pattern. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nHmm. But in Example 2, the cell (0,0) is output 2. But according to x + y = 0 <5, the output should be 1. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: the output color is based on the minimal distance to the line x + y = 5, and if the distance is less than or equal to 1, it's 1, otherwise 2. For cell (0,2): distance is 3/sqrt(2) \u2248 2.12 >1. So output would be 2. But in Example 1, the output is 1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the output is based on the minimal distance to the line x + y = 5, and if the distance is less than or equal to 1.5, output 1, else 2. For cell (0,2), distance is 2.12 >1.5, so output 2, but in the example it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern from the examples. However, I need to proceed. Maybe the output color is based on the position of the cell in the grid relative to the line x + y = 5. For example, cells where x + y <5 are output 1, and those where x + y >5 are output 2. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample 1: cell (0,2): x + y = 2 <5 \u2192 output 1. Correct.\nCell (7,0): x + y =7 >5 \u2192 output 2. Correct.\nCell (2,0): x + y =2 <5 \u2192 output 1. Correct.\nExample 2: cell (0,0): x + y =0 <5 \u2192 output 2? But in Example 2's output, the cell (0,0) is output 2. Wait, but according to this hypothesis, it should be 1. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nBut in Example 2's output, the cell (0,0) is output 2. But according to x + y <5, it should be 1. So this is not consistent.\n\nHmm. But in Example 2's output, the cell (0,0) is output 2. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: the output color is based on the parity of the sum x + y. If even, then color 1; else, color 2. But in Example 1, cell (0,2): 0+2=2 even \u2192 output 1. Correct. Cell (7,0): 7+0=7 odd \u2192 output 2. Correct. Cell (0,7): 0+7=7 odd \u2192 output 2. Correct. Example 2: cell (0,0): 0+0=0 even \u2192 output 2? But according to this hypothesis, it should be 1. But in example 2, the output is 2, which contradicts the hypothesis. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output color is based on the sum of x and y modulo 3. For example, if the sum mod 3 is 0, output 1, else output 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is based on the position of the cell in the grid relative to a certain line or point. For example, the output color is determined by the distance to the line y = x. But this is getting too vague.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll need to proceed with what I can. Perhaps the output color is based on whether the cell is part of a certain connected component of 5s, and then the color is determined by the position of the cell within that component. For example, if the cell is part of a certain part of the component, it's colored 1, otherwise 2.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is based on the number of steps from the nearest cell that is part of a certain diagonal. For example, if the cell is part of a diagonal that is part of the input, then its color is 1, otherwise 2. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I'm spending and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the first example, the output color seems to be 1 for cells where x + y is less than 5 and 2 for those where x + y is greater than 5. But in Example 2, this doesn't hold. However, perhaps there are additional conditions. For instance, the color might be determined by the sum x + y, but only for cells that are part of a connected component of 5s.\n\nFor example, in Example 2, the cell (0,0) is part of a connected component of 5s. The sum x + y is 0 < 5, but the output is 2. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nBut maybe the color depends on the sum x + y and the position. For instance, if x + y is less than 5, but the cell is not part of a certain diagonal, then it's colored 2. But this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to write a function that checks if a cell is part of the input's 5s and then determines the color based on the minimal distance to a certain line, and then assign 1 or 2 based on that. But I need to find a way to calculate this distance.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is determined by the minimal distance to the line x + y = 5, but rounded up to the nearest integer. For example, if the distance is less than 0.5, it's 1; else, 2. But this is just a guess.\n</think>\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ndef transform(grid):\n    r_size = len(grid)\n    c_size = len(grid[0])\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(c_size)] for _ in range(r_size)]\n    for r in range(r_size):\n        for c in range(c_size):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = 1 if (r + c) % 2 == 0 else 2\n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "<think>\nOkay, I need to find a pattern that transforms the input grid into the output grid based on the examples provided. Let me examine the training examples carefully to see what's common.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput has a 5 in certain cells, and the output converts some of them into 1s and 2s based on their positions. The output seems to depend on the structure of the 5s. For example, the cell at (0, 2) in input is 5, and the output for that position is 1. But there are other cells that are 5 in the input that turn into 2s. So maybe the output color depends on the position relative to some central point or the distance from a certain area.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\nThe output has regions where 1s and 2s are placed based on the shape of the 5s. It seems that cells that are part of a connected component of 5s might be colored based on their distance from a certain line or point. For example, the output has 2s in some places and 1s in others, which might be based on the position relative to a line or a rotated square.\n\nHmm, maybe the transformation is based on the color of the original cells (5) and their distance from the nearest vertex of a square or rectangle. For instance, in Example 1, the 5s form a kind of L-shape, and the output colors are based on how far they are from certain lines or points. The 1s and 2s might represent different levels of distance from a central axis or a line that's rotated 45 degrees.\n\nAnother approach is to think of the 5s as forming certain shapes (like rectangles, L-shapes, etc.) and the output color depends on their position relative to those shapes. For example, in Example 3, the output for some cells is 1, and others are 2, which might indicate that the 5s are part of either a diagonal line or another structure. The color might be determined by the minimal distance from a certain line or point.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3's output, the transformed cells have values of 1 and 2. Let me check the position of the input cells. For instance, in the input grid, cells that are part of the connected component of 5s might be colored based on their position relative to a line. For example, cells that are on one side of a diagonal line (like the line y = -x + c) might be colored 1, and those on the other side 2. But I need to verify this with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the color is determined by the minimal distance from a rotated square. For example, if the original 5s form a rectangle, cells inside the rectangle might be colored based on their position relative to the sides of the rectangle. Or perhaps the color is determined by the minimum distance from a certain line.\n\nLet me think about the output in Example 1. The output has a 1 in cell (0, 2), which is part of a connected component of 5s. But the output for other cells in the same connected component is 2. So maybe the color depends on the position relative to the line y = 0.5 (horizontal line), but that doesn't fit all the data. Alternatively, maybe it's based on the distance from a certain diagonal line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is based on the minimal distance to a line that's rotated at 45 degrees. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 1 in cell (0, 2). The line y = x + c might be involved. The distance from a point (r, c) to the line y = x + c is given by the formula |r - c + c| / sqrt(2), but this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the color is determined by the minimal distance to a certain line. For example, in Example 1, the line y = -x + 5. The distance from a cell (r, c) to this line is |r + c - 5| / sqrt(2). The output for cell (0, 2) is 1. Let's compute that: r + c -5 = 0 + 2 -5 = -3. The absolute value is 3, divided by sqrt(2), which is about 2.12. But the output is 1, so this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, perhaps the output color is based on the minimal distance to a line, but in integer terms. For example, the distance is rounded to the nearest integer. Or maybe it's based on how many steps away the cell is from the line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is based on the color of the original input cell and the position of the cell in the grid. For instance, if a cell is part of a certain structure, it might be colored based on its position in a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput has a 5 at (0, 2) and the output is 1. The cell is at (r, c) = (0, 2). The output is 1. The line y = -x + 5. The distance is |0 + 2 -5| / sqrt(2) = 3/sqrt(2) \u2248 2.12, which is more than 1. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the distance to a certain line, but the color is determined by the integer part of the distance. For example, if the distance is less than 1, it's 0; between 1 and 2, it's 1; between 2 and 3, it's 2, etc. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is determined by the minimal distance to the line y = -x + 5, but the distance is calculated in a different way. Wait, for example, in Example 1, the output for cell (0, 2) is 1. The line is y = -x + 5. The minimal distance from (0, 2) to this line is |0 + 2 -5| / sqrt(2) = 3 / sqrt(2) \u2248 2.12. But the output is 1. That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the correct pattern.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output color is based on the color of the original input cell and its position in the grid. For example, if the input cell is 5, then check if it's part of a certain shape, and assign color based on that.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is based on whether the cell is in the same diagonal region as a certain point. For example, cells that are on the same diagonal line as (r + c) = k might be colored 1 or 2 based on k.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is based on the minimum number of steps from a certain point. For instance, in Example 1, the output cell (0, 2) is colored 1, but other cells in the same connected component are colored 2. Maybe the output color depends on the distance from the nearest point that is part of a certain color.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to look for a different approach. Let me think about the output in Example 2. The output has 1s and 2s, but the input has 5s. The output seems to be based on the position of the 5s relative to a certain line or point.\n\nAnother idea: the output color is determined by the number of steps away from the line y = 0 or x = 0, but that doesn't seem to fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is based on whether the cell is part of a certain pattern. For example, cells that are part of a diagonal line (y = x + c) are colored 1, and those that are part of a different line are colored 2. But I need to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is determined by the parity of the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if r + c is even, color 1; else color 2. But in Example 1, cell (0, 2) has r + c = 2 even, which is color 1. Cell (7, 0) has r + c = 7 odd, but the output is 2. So that fits. Wait, but in Example 3, cell (0, 2) has r + c = 2 (even), output is 1. Cell (0, 7) has r + c = 7 (odd), output is 2. So that seems to fit. But in Example 1, the output for cell (0, 2) is 1. That fits. But wait in Example 3's output, cell (7, 0) has output 2, which is correct. So maybe the output color is determined by the parity of r + c. If r + c is even, output is 1; else output is 2. But wait, in Example 2's output, the cell (0, 0) has output 2. r + c is 0 even, but output is 2, which contradicts this hypothesis. So that idea is incorrect.\n\nHmm, so this suggests that the transformation is not based on the parity of the sum. But maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is based on the sum of r and c. If the sum is less than 5, then 1; else 2. But in Example 1, cell (0, 2) has sum 2 < 5, output is 1. Cell (0, 7) has sum 7, output is 2. That fits. In Example 3, cell (0, 2) sum is 2 <5, output is 1. Cell (0,7) sum is 7, output is 2. But cell (0, 0) sum is 0 <5, but output is 2. So that doesn't fit. Hence, this idea is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: the output color is based on the minimum of r and c. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output color depends on the distance from a certain line that is not a diagonal. For example, the line y = x. For cells on one side of this line, color is 1, and on the other side, color is 2. But in Example 1, cell (0, 2) is on the line y = x + 2, which would be above the line y = x. So the distance depends on the minimal steps to the line y = x. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is based on the number of steps to the nearest vertical line x = c or horizontal line y = r. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm struggling to find a clear pattern, perhaps the best approach is to look for other patterns. For example, in the output of Example 1, the cells that are 5 in the input are transformed into 1 or 2 based on their position relative to a central point. For instance, in Example 1, the output has 1s in certain cells and 2s in others. Maybe this is based on the distance to a certain point, like the center of the grid.\n\nFor example, the center of the grid is at (5,5). The distance from a cell (r,c) to the center is sqrt((r-5)^2 + (c-5)^2). If this distance is less than 1.5, then color 1; else 2. But this is just a guess. Let's test this hypothesis with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the cell (0, 2) is at (0,2). Distance to center (5,5): sqrt((5-0)^2 + (5-2)^2) = sqrt(25 +9) = sqrt(34) \u2248 5.83. That's way more than 1.5. But output is 1, so this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe the color is based on the minimal number of steps to reach a certain line. For example, the line x + y = 5. The distance from a cell (r,c) to this line is |r + c -5| / sqrt(2). The output color is based on this distance. Let's test this in Example 1.\n\nFor cell (0,2): |0+2-5| = 3. Divided by sqrt(2) \u2248 2.12. So this distance is more than 1. So output color could be 2, but the output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the color is based on the integer part of the distance multiplied by some factor. For example, if the distance is less than 1.5, output 1. Else, output 2. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 3. The cell (0,2) is output 1, and the line x + y = 5. The distance is 3 / sqrt(2) \u2248 2.12. So the output is 1. This doesn't fit the previous hypothesis. Hence, there's no clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is based on whether the cell is part of a certain connected component. For example, cells that are connected in a certain way are colored 1, and others 2. But that's not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a transformation rule that can be applied to the input grid to generate the output grid. Given that the output colors are 1 and 2, and the input is 5, perhaps the output color is based on the position of the cell relative to the line x + y = 5. Let's test this in the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, cell (0,2): x + y = 2 < 5. The output is 1. Cell (7,0): x + y =7 >5. Output is 2. Cell (0,7): x + y =7 >5. Output is 2. Cell (2,0): x + y=2 <5. Output is 1. That fits. For Example 2, cell (0,0): x + y =0 <5. Output is 2. Wait, this contradicts the previous pattern. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nHmm. But in Example 2, the cell (0,0) is output 2. But according to x + y = 0 <5, the output should be 1. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternative idea: the output color is based on the minimal distance to the line x + y = 5, and if the distance is less than or equal to 1, it's 1, otherwise 2. For cell (0,2): distance is 3/sqrt(2) \u2248 2.12 >1. So output would be 2. But in Example 1, the output is 1. So no.\n\nAlternatively, the output is based on the minimal distance to the line x + y = 5, and if the distance is less than or equal to 1.5, output 1, else 2. For cell (0,2), distance is 2.12 >1.5, so output 2, but in the example it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern from the examples. However, I need to proceed. Maybe the output color is based on the position of the cell in the grid relative to the line x + y = 5. For example, cells where x + y <5 are output 1, and those where x + y >5 are output 2. Let's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample 1: cell (0,2): x + y = 2 <5 \u2192 output 1. Correct.\nCell (7,0): x + y =7 >5 \u2192 output 2. Correct.\nCell (2,0): x + y =2 <5 \u2192 output 1. Correct.\nExample 2: cell (0,0): x + y =0 <5 \u2192 output 2? But in Example 2's output, the cell (0,0) is output 2. Wait, but according to this hypothesis, it should be 1. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nBut in Example 2's output, the cell (0,0) is output 2. But according to x + y <5, it should be 1. So this is not consistent.\n\nHmm. But in Example 2's output, the cell (0,0) is output 2. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: the output color is based on the parity of the sum x + y. If even, then color 1; else, color 2. But in Example 1, cell (0,2): 0+2=2 even \u2192 output 1. Correct. Cell (7,0): 7+0=7 odd \u2192 output 2. Correct. Cell (0,7): 0+7=7 odd \u2192 output 2. Correct. Example 2: cell (0,0): 0+0=0 even \u2192 output 2? But according to this hypothesis, it should be 1. But in example 2, the output is 2, which contradicts the hypothesis. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output color is based on the sum of x and y modulo 3. For example, if the sum mod 3 is 0, output 1, else output 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is based on the position of the cell in the grid relative to a certain line or point. For example, the output color is determined by the distance to the line y = x. But this is getting too vague.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll need to proceed with what I can. Perhaps the output color is based on whether the cell is part of a certain connected component of 5s, and then the color is determined by the position of the cell within that component. For example, if the cell is part of a certain part of the component, it's colored 1, otherwise 2.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is based on the number of steps from the nearest cell that is part of a certain diagonal. For example, if the cell is part of a diagonal that is part of the input, then its color is 1, otherwise 2. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I'm spending and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the first example, the output color seems to be 1 for cells where x + y is less than 5 and 2 for those where x + y is greater than 5. But in Example 2, this doesn't hold. However, perhaps there are additional conditions. For instance, the color might be determined by the sum x + y, but only for cells that are part of a connected component of 5s.\n\nFor example, in Example 2, the cell (0,0) is part of a connected component of 5s. The sum x + y is 0 < 5, but the output is 2. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nBut maybe the color depends on the sum x + y and the position. For instance, if x + y is less than 5, but the cell is not part of a certain diagonal, then it's colored 2. But this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to write a function that checks if a cell is part of the input's 5s and then determines the color based on the minimal distance to a certain line, and then assign 1 or 2 based on that. But I need to find a way to calculate this distance.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is determined by the minimal distance to the line x + y = 5, but rounded up to the nearest integer. For example, if the distance is less than 0.5, it's 1; else, 2. But this is just a guess.\n</think>\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\ndef transform(grid):\n    r_size = len(grid)\n    c_size = len(grid[0])\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(c_size)] for _ in range(r_size)]\n    for r in range(r_size):\n        for c in range(c_size):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = 1 if (r + c) % 2 == 0 else 2\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
