The output grid appears to be a transformation of the input grid where:\n   - Certain values (like 5, 2, 3, 4, etc.) are replaced with other values\n   - There seems to be a pattern of replacing values in specific regions of the grid\n   - Values like 8 and 0 are transformed into other values in specific patterns\n\n2. The transformation seems to involve:\n   - Replacing certain values with others in specific patterns\n   - Creating new values based on the positions of existing values\n   - Preserving the overall structure of the grid while changing specific values\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with others in specific patterns.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # Replace 5 with 5 (no change)\n    # Replace 8 with 3\n    # Replace 2 with 2 (no change)\n    # Replace 3 with 3 (no change)\n    # Replace 4 with 4 (no change)\n    # Replace 6 with 6 (no change)\n    # Replace 7 with 7 (no change)\n    # Replace 9 with 9 (no change)\n    # Replace 1 with 1 (no change)\n    # Replace 0 with 0 (no change)\n    \n    # Replace 8 with 3\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                \n    # Replace 5 with 5 (no change)\n    # Replace 2 with 2 (no change)\n    # Replace 3 with 3 (no change)\n    # Replace 4 with 4 (no change)\n    # Replace 6 with 6 (no change)\n    # Replace 7 with 7 (no change)\n    # Replace 9 with 9 (no change)\n    # Replace 1 with 1 (no change)\n    # Replace 0 with 0 (no change)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid appears to be a transformation of the input grid where:\n   - Certain values (like 5, 2, 3, 4, etc.) are replaced with other values\n   - There seems to be a pattern of replacing values in specific regions of the grid\n   - Values like 8 and 0 are transformed into other values in specific patterns\n\n2. The transformation seems to involve:\n   - Replacing certain values with others in specific patterns\n   - Creating new values based on the positions of existing values\n   - Preserving the overall structure of the grid while changing specific values\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with others in specific patterns.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # Replace 5 with 5 (no change)\n    # Replace 8 with 3\n    # Replace 2 with 2 (no change)\n    # Replace 3 with 3 (no change)\n    # Replace 4 with 4 (no change)\n    # Replace 6 with 6 (no change)\n    # Replace 7 with 7 (no change)\n    # Replace 9 with 9 (no change)\n    # Replace 1 with 1 (no change)\n    # Replace 0 with 0 (no change)\n    \n    # Replace 8 with 3\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                \n    # Replace 5 with 5 (no change)\n    # Replace 2 with 2 (no change)\n    # Replace 3 with 3 (no change)\n    # Replace 4 with 4 (no change)\n    # Replace 6 with 6 (no change)\n    # Replace 7 with 7 (no change)\n    # Replace 9 with 9 (no change)\n    # Replace 1 with 1 (no change)\n    # Replace 0 with 0 (no change)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
