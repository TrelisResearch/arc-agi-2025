          "Analyzing the training examples:\n\n- The input grids have a black (0) background.\n- There are vertical colored bars on the left side, composed of different colors stacked vertically.\n- There is a shape composed of gray cells (color 5 in some cases) in the middle-right of the grid.\n- In the output:\n  - The left vertical bars keep their rows but their color is replaced by the dominant color of the shape on the right (the \"gray shape\").\n  - The \"gray shape\" is recolored by replacing all of the shape's color cells with the color of the *left* color bar that matches their row.\n\nFrom the first example:\n\n- Left vertical bars: 8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2 (in rows 2-8)\n- The gray shape consists of cells with color 5 in the input, replaced in output by either 8 or 2 depending on row:\n\n  - Rows with 8 on left bar are recolored to 8.\n  - Rows with 2 on left bar are recolored to 2.\n\nFrom the second example:\n\n- Left vertical bars: 9,9,6,6,6,4,4,4 (rows 1-8)\n- Gray shape with color 5 in input is replaced row-wise by the left bar color in output.\n\nHypothesis / Final pattern:\n\n- For each non-zero colored cell in the \"shape\" (cells likely equal to color 5 in input), map it to the color of the left vertical bar cell on the same row.\n- Copy all other cells as is.\n- The left color bars remain unmodified.\n- The output grid remains the same size 10x10.\n\nAdditional note:\n\n- Only the cells that were color 5 in input (the shape) are recolored in the output.\n- The left vertical bar colors determine the shape color per row.\n\nThis matches both training examples and fits the visual transformation.\n\n---\n\n**Approach to implement in code:**\n\n- For each row and column:\n  - If the cell is 5 (shape color) in input:\n    - Replace it with the left bar color at that row (the cell in column 0).\n  - Else:\n    - Keep the cell unchanged.\n\n- Return the new grid.\n\n---\n\n**Code implementation follows.**\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The leftmost column contains vertical bars with colors (non-zero)\n    # The shape cells have value 5 in input.\n    # Replace each cell == 5 with the color in the leftmost cell of the same row.\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for r, row in enumerate(grid):\n        new_row = []\n        left_color = row[0]\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 5:\n                new_row.append(left_color)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```"

              "Analyzing the training examples:\n\n- The input grids have a black (0) background.\n- There are vertical colored bars on the left side, composed of different colors stacked vertically.\n- There is a shape composed of gray cells (color 5 in some cases) in the middle-right of the grid.\n- In the output:\n  - The left vertical bars keep their rows but their color is replaced by the dominant color of the shape on the right (the \"gray shape\").\n  - The \"gray shape\" is recolored by replacing all of the shape's color cells with the color of the *left* color bar that matches their row.\n\nFrom the first example:\n\n- Left vertical bars: 8,8,8,2,2,2,2,2 (in rows 2-8)\n- The gray shape consists of cells with color 5 in the input, replaced in output by either 8 or 2 depending on row:\n\n  - Rows with 8 on left bar are recolored to 8.\n  - Rows with 2 on left bar are recolored to 2.\n\nFrom the second example:\n\n- Left vertical bars: 9,9,6,6,6,4,4,4 (rows 1-8)\n- Gray shape with color 5 in input is replaced row-wise by the left bar color in output.\n\nHypothesis / Final pattern:\n\n- For each non-zero colored cell in the \"shape\" (cells likely equal to color 5 in input), map it to the color of the left vertical bar cell on the same row.\n- Copy all other cells as is.\n- The left color bars remain unmodified.\n- The output grid remains the same size 10x10.\n\nAdditional note:\n\n- Only the cells that were color 5 in input (the shape) are recolored in the output.\n- The left vertical bar colors determine the shape color per row.\n\nThis matches both training examples and fits the visual transformation.\n\n---\n\n**Approach to implement in code:**\n\n- For each row and column:\n  - If the cell is 5 (shape color) in input:\n    - Replace it with the left bar color at that row (the cell in column 0).\n  - Else:\n    - Keep the cell unchanged.\n\n- Return the new grid.\n\n---\n\n**Code implementation follows.**\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The leftmost column contains vertical bars with colors (non-zero)\n    # The shape cells have value 5 in input.\n    # Replace each cell == 5 with the color in the leftmost cell of the same row.\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for r, row in enumerate(grid):\n        new_row = []\n        left_color = row[0]\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 5:\n                new_row.append(left_color)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
