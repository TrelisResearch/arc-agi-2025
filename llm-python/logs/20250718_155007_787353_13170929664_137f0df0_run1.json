The output grid seems to replace certain values with new values based on their position and value.\n2. There's a pattern where 0s are replaced with 1s or 2s in certain positions.\n3. The value 5 seems to be replaced with 2 in some cases.\n4. There's a pattern where certain rows or columns are transformed differently.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces 0s with 1s or 2s in certain positions and replaces 5s with 2s in other positions.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace 5s with 2s in certain positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Replace 5s with 2s in certain positions\n                if (i + j) % 3 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Replace 0s with 1s or 2s in certain positions\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Replace 0s with 1s or 2s in certain positions\n                if (i + j) % 3 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The transformation appears to be based on the position of the value in the grid. For example:\n   - In Example 1, the middle rows (rows 2 and 7) have all 0s replaced with 2s in the first 8 columns, and 1s in the last 2 columns\n   - In Example 2, the middle rows (rows 2 and 7) have a pattern of 1s, 2s, and 1s\n   - In Example 3, the middle rows (rows 2-5) have a pattern of 1s and 2s\n\n3. It seems like the transformation is based on the position of the value in the grid, with some patterns that repeat every few rows and columns.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces 0s with 1s or 2s based on their position in the grid, and replaces 5s with 2s in certain positions.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for i, val in enumerate(row):\n            if val == 0:\n                # Replace 0s with 1s or 2s based on position\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    new_row.append(1)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(2)\n            elif val == 5:\n                # Replace 5s with 2s in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    new_row.append(2)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(5)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
