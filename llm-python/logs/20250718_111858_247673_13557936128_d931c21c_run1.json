          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe that the transformation seems to involve some form of **local enhancement** or **pattern expansion** based on the values in the input grid. Specifically:\n\n1. **Value 0** in the input often maps to **0** or **2** in the output, depending on context.\n2. **Value 1** in the input often maps to **1** or **2** in the output.\n3. **Value 2** in the input often maps to **2** or **3** in the output.\n4. **Value 3** in the input often maps to **3** or **1** in the output.\n5. **Value 4** in the input often maps to **1** or **2** in the output.\n6. **Value 5** in the input often maps to **1** or **2** in the output.\n7. **Value 6** in the input often maps to **1** or **2** in the output.\n8. **Value 7** in the input often maps to **1** or **2** in the output.\n9. **Value 8** in the input often maps to **1** or **2** in the output.\n10. **Value 9** in the input often maps to **1** or **2** in the output.\n\nFrom the examples, it appears that the transformation involves **local enhancement** where certain values are increased or decreased based on their neighbors. For instance, a value of 1 might be increased to 2 if it is surrounded by 1s, or decreased to 1 if it is surrounded by 0s.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that increases values based on their neighbors, with some adjustments for specific values.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(8):\n        for j in range(8):\n            # Check the value at the current cell\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            \n            # Check the value of the cell to the right\n            right_value = grid[i][j+1] if j+1 < 8 else 0\n            \n            # Check the value of the cell below\n            below_value = grid[i+1][j] if i+1 < 8 else 0\n            \n            # Check the value of the cell to the left\n            left_value = grid[i][j-1] if j-1 >= 0 else 0\n            \n            # Check the value of the cell above\n            above_value = grid[i-1][j] if i-1 >= 0 else 0\n            \n            # Calculate the average of the surrounding values\n            surrounding_values = [right_value, below_value, left_value, above_value]\n            surrounding_avg = sum(surrounding_values) / len(surrounding_values)\n            \n            # Apply some transformation based on the current value and surrounding values\n            if value == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 3\n            elif value == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 1\n            elif value == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(8):\n        for j in range(8):\n            # Check the value at the current cell\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            \n            # Check the value of the cell to the right\n            right_value = grid[i][j+1] if j+1 < 8 else 0\n            \n            # Check the value of the cell below\n            below_value = grid[i+1][j] if i+1 < 8 else 0\n            \n            # Check the value of the cell to the left\n            left_value = grid[i][j-1] if j-1 >= 0 else 0\n            \n            # Check the value of the cell above\n            above_value = grid[i-1][j] if i-1 >= 0 else 0\n            \n            # Calculate the average of the surrounding values\n            surrounding_values = [right_value, below_value, left_value, above_value]\n            surrounding_avg = sum(surrounding_values) / len(surrounding_values)\n            \n            # Apply some transformation based on the current value and surrounding values\n            if value == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 3\n            elif value == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 1\n            elif value == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

For instance, a value of 1 might be increased to 2 if it is surrounded by 1s, or decreased to 1 if it is surrounded by 0s.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that increases values based on their neighbors, with some adjustments for specific values.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(8):\n        for j in range(8):\n            # Check the value at the current cell\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            \n            # Check the value of the cell to the right\n            right_value = grid[i][j+1] if j+1 < 8 else 0\n            \n            # Check the value of the cell below\n            below_value = grid[i+1][j] if i+1 < 8 else 0\n            \n            # Check the value of the cell to the left\n            left_value = grid[i][j-1] if j-1 >= 0 else 0\n            \n            # Check the value of the cell above\n            above_value = grid[i-1][j] if i-1 >= 0 else 0\n            \n            # Calculate the average of the surrounding values\n            surrounding_values = [right_value, below_value, left_value, above_value]\n            surrounding_avg = sum(surrounding_values) / len(surrounding_values)\n            \n            # Apply some transformation based on the current value and surrounding values\n            if value == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 3\n            elif value == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 1\n            elif value == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(8):\n        for j in range(8):\n            # Check the value at the current cell\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            \n            # Check the value of the cell to the right\n            right_value = grid[i][j+1] if j+1 < 8 else 0\n            \n            # Check the value of the cell below\n            below_value = grid[i+1][j] if i+1 < 8 else 0\n            \n            # Check the value of the cell to the left\n            left_value = grid[i][j-1] if j-1 >= 0 else 0\n            \n            # Check the value of the cell above\n            above_value = grid[i-1][j] if i-1 >= 0 else 0\n            \n            # Calculate the average of the surrounding values\n            surrounding_values = [right_value, below_value, left_value, above_value]\n            surrounding_avg = sum(surrounding_values) / len(surrounding_values)\n            \n            # Apply some transformation based on the current value and surrounding values\n            if value == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 3\n            elif value == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 1\n            elif value == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n            elif value == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1 if surrounding_avg == 0 else 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
