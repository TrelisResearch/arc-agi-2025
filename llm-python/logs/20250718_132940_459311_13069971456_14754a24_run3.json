          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 18x19. The input and output have some numbers, and the output seems to have some changes. Let me compare the first few rows.\n\nLooking at the first row of input and output for Example 1: the input is 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0. The output is the same as the input. Wait, that's interesting. So maybe that row is unchanged. But looking at the second row of input and output: input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0, and the output is the same. Hmm, but in the third row of input and output, the input is 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0, and the output is the same. Wait, but in Example 1, the output is the same as the input? But that can't be right because the output in Example 1 is different from the input. Wait, no, looking again. Wait the output for Example 1 is different. Let me check again.\n\nWait in Example 1, the input and output are different. For example, in the sixth row of input (row index 5?), the input is 0 0 5 0 4 5 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5 5. The output is 0 0 5 0 4 2 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5 5. So the sixth row of input has a 5 in position 5 (assuming 0-based?), and the output has a 2 there. So that's a change. Similarly, in the seventh row of input, the input is 5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 4 4 5 0. The output is 5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 2 4 4 5 0. So here, the 15th element (position 15) in the input is 5, and in the output it's 2. So that's a change. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be that certain positions are being modified. But how? Let me check more examples. For example, in Example 2, the input and output are different. For instance, in the second row of input, the input is 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0. The output is 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 2 5 0 0. So the 13th element (index 12?) is changed from 5 to 2. Similarly, in the third row of input, the input is 0 0 4 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 4 5 5 5 0. The output is 0 0 4 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 4 2 2 5 0. So the 12th element (index 11?) is 5 in input, but in output it's 2. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being replaced with 2s. But where? Let me look for a pattern in the positions where changes occur. \n\nLooking at Example 1, the sixth row (row index 5?), the 5th element (position 5) is changed from 5 to 2. Wait, in the input row 5: 0 0 5 0 4 5 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5 5. The output row 5 is 0 0 5 0 4 2 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5 5. So the 5th element (index 5) is 4 in input and 2 in output. Wait, no, wait the input row is 0 0 5 0 4 5 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5 5. So the elements are:\n\nIndices 0-17 (since it's 18 elements per row). Let me check the sixth row (assuming rows are 0-based). Let's say the input row is row 5. Let's index the elements as 0 to 18. So the sixth row in input is:\n\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5]\n\nIn the output, the same row is:\n\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 2, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5]\n\nSo the 5th element (index 5) is 5 in input, and 2 in output. So that's a change. Similarly, in the seventh row of input (row 6?), the input is:\n\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 5, 0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 5, 0]\n\nSo the 14th element (index 14) is 5 in input, 2 in output. \n\nLooking at these positions, perhaps the 5th element (index 5) and 14th element (index 14) in the row. Wait, but how do these positions relate to the grid? Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified. \n\nLooking at the first example, in the sixth row, the fifth element (index 5) is changed to 2. In the seventh row, the 14th element (index 14) is changed to 2. \n\nIn the second example, in the second row of input (row 1?), the 12th element (index 12) is changed to 2. In the third row of input (row 2?), the 11th element (index 11) is changed to 2. \n\nWait, maybe the positions where 2 is inserted are in certain columns. Let me look for a pattern. \n\nIn Example 1, the sixth row (row 5) has a 2 at index 5. The seventh row (row 6) has a 2 at index 14. \n\nIn Example 2, the second row (row 1) has a 2 at index 12. Third row (row 2) has a 2 at index 11. \n\nHmm, perhaps the 2s are placed in certain positions based on some rule. Maybe the positions where the value is 4 in the input are being replaced with 2? Let me check. \n\nIn Example 1, the sixth row input has a 4 at index 4 (the fifth element). The output changes that to 2. But in the input, that position was 4, but in the output it's 2. \n\nIn the seventh row of input, the 14th element is 5. But in the output, it's 2. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5. But in the sixth row of input, the 5th element was 5, but in the output it's 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in certain positions based on some other rule. For example, maybe the positions where the value is 5 and in certain rows or columns. \n\nLooking at the first example, the output in the sixth row has a 2 at index 5. Let's see the original input. The sixth row input is 0 0 5 0 4 5 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5 5. So the fifth element (index 5) is 5. The output changes that to 2. \n\nIn the seventh row, the 14th element (index 14) is 5 in input, and output is 2. \n\nSo perhaps the rule is that in certain positions (like index 5 and 14 in rows 5 and 6), the value is changed to 2. \n\nBut how to find a general rule? Let's check other examples. \n\nLooking at Example 2, the second row of input is 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0. The output is 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 2 5 0 0. So the 12th element (index 12) is 5 in input and 2 in output. \n\nThird row of input is 0 0 4 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 4 5 5 5 0. The output is 0 0 4 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 4 2 2 5 0. So the 11th element (index 11) is 4 in input, but in output it's 2. \n\nWait, but that's conflicting with the previous idea. So maybe the 2 is being placed where the original value is 5 or 4? Or maybe there's a different pattern. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in certain positions that form a pattern. For example, in the first example, the 2s are in positions (5,5) and (6,14). In the second example, (1,12) and (2,11). \n\nLooking for a pattern in the positions. Let's consider the rows and columns. For example, in Example 1, the first 2 is in row 5 (assuming rows are 0-based?), column 5. The second 2 is in row 6, column 14. \n\nIn Example 2, the first 2 is in row 1, column 12. The second 2 is in row 2, column 11. \n\nHmm. Maybe the positions are related to the row number. For example, in row i, column (some function of i). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the positions where 2 is inserted are in certain diagonals or other geometric patterns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being inserted in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain row or column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being inserted in positions where the value is 5 and the position is in a certain region. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being inserted in positions where the value is 5 and the row and column indices satisfy a certain condition. \n\nBut this is getting a bit complicated. Let's look at the third example. \n\nIn Example 3, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5\nRow 1: 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 4 5 0 0 5 0 5 5\nRow 2: 5 0 5 0 0 0 4 4 5 0 5 5 5 0 5\nRow 3: 5 0 0 5 0 5 5 4 0 0 0 5 5 0 5\nRow 4: 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 5 0\nRow 5: 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0\nRow 6: 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 5 5 4 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 5\nRow 8: 5 4 5 4 0 5 5 0 4 5 4 5 0 5 0\nRow 9: 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 4 0 5 0 5 5\nRow 10: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5\nRow 11: 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5\n\nThe output for Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5\nRow 1: 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 4 5 0 0 5 0 5 5\nRow 2: 5 0 5 0 0 0 4 4 2 0 5 5 5 0 5\nRow 3: 5 0 0 5 0 5 5 4 0 0 0 5 5 0 5\nRow 4: 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 5 0\nRow 5: 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0\nRow 6: 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 5 5 4 0 5 0 5 0 0 2 0 5 0 5 5\nRow 8: 5 4 2 4 0 5 5 0 4 2 4 5 0 5 0\nRow 9: 5 5 2 0 0 5 5 0 0 4 0 5 0 5 5\nRow 10: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5\nRow 11: 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5\n\nLooking at the output, in row 2, the 8th element (index 8) is 2. In row 7, the 9th element (index 9) is 2. In row 8, the 8th element (index 8) is 2, and the 9th element (index 9) is 2. In row 9, the 8th element (index 8) is 2. \n\nSo in these rows, the 2s are in certain columns. For example, in row 2, index 8. In row 7, index 9. In row 8, index 8 and 9. In row 9, index 8. \n\nThis seems like a pattern where in certain rows, the 2 is placed in the 8th or 9th column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain row or column. \n\nBut how to find a general rule. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row and column indices satisfy a certain condition. For example, in row i, column j, if i is even or odd, or if j is even or odd. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row and column indices are in a certain range. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row and column indices are in certain positions. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me think of another approach. \n\nLooking at the test input and output. The test input is given, but I don't have the output. However, the task is to write a function that transforms the input to output. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain values with 2s based on their position. For example, in certain positions (like (row, column) where row is even and column is 5 or something), replace the value with 2. \n\nBut without seeing the output of the test input, it's hard to know. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain diagonal. \n\nAnother approach: maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the value is 5 and the position is in a certain row or column. For example, in the first example, in row 5 (the sixth row), the fifth element is 5 and is changed to 2. \n\nBut why that particular position? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in the middle of the grid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in certain rows and columns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row and column indices are in certain ranges. For example, in rows 5-7, columns 5-14. \n\nBut this is too vague. \n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the positions where 2s are placed. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row (row 5) has a 2 at column 5. The seventh row (row 6) has a 2 at column 14. \n\nIn Example 2, the second row (row 1) has a 2 at column 12. The third row (row 2) has a 2 at column 11. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2 has a 2 at column 8, row 7 at column 9, row 8 at columns 8 and 9, row 9 at column 8. \n\nLooking at these positions, perhaps the columns are related to the row number. For example, in row i, the column is 14 - i or something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the column is 5, 14, 11, 12, etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is (row + 5) modulo 19. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is 5, 14, 11, 12, etc., but this seems arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the column is in a certain range. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row is even. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in certain rows and columns. For example, in the first example, row 5 (sixth row) and column 5. In the second example, row 1 and column 12. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain diagonal. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row and column indices are in the same row or column. \n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. \n\nLooking at the examples, the transformation seems to replace certain values with 2s. The key is to find out which positions are being replaced. \n\nIn Example 1, the sixth row has a 2 at column 5. The seventh row has a 2 at column 14. \n\nIn Example 2, the second row has a 2 at column 12. The third row has a 2 at column 11. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2 has a 2 at column 8. Row 7 has a 2 at column 9. Row 8 has 2s at columns 8 and 9. Row 9 has a 2 at column 8. \n\nLooking for a pattern in these positions. For example, in row 2 of Example 3, column 8. In row 7, column 9. Row 8, columns 8 and 9. Row 9, column 8. \n\nMaybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the column is 8 or 9 in certain rows. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the column is 5, 14, 11, 12, 8, 9, etc. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the column is 5, 14, 8, 9, etc., and the row is in a certain range. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in the middle of the grid. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the 2s are placed in the output and see if they form a pattern. \n\nIn Example 1, the 2s are at (5,5) and (6,14). \n\nIn Example 2, the 2s are at (1,12) and (2,11). \n\nIn Example 3, the 2s are at (2,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). \n\nLooking at these positions, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even or odd, and the column is in certain ranges. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column indices satisfy row + column = some value. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, row 5, column 5: 5+5=10. Row 6, column 14: 6+14=20. \n\nIn Example 2, row 1, column 12: 13. Row 2, column 11: 13. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 8: 10. Row 7, column 9: 16. Row 8, column 8: 16. Row 9, column 8: 17. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column indices are in certain ranges. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, row 5 (which is the sixth row) and column 5. \n\nIn Example 2, row 1 and column 12. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2 and column 8. \n\nIt's possible that these positions are part of a pattern where the 2s are placed in certain rows and columns based on some rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row is even or odd. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAnother idea: looking at the examples, the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in the same row or column as another 2. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain area of the grid. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the sixth row has a 2 at column 5. In the seventh row, column 14. \n\nIn Example 2, row 1, column 12. Row 2, column 11. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 8. Row 7, column 9. \n\nMaybe these positions are in certain regions of the grid. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in the middle of the grid. \n\nBut this is too vague. \n\nMaybe I should think of the 2s as being placed in certain positions based on the row and column indices. For example, in row i, column j, if i is even and j is 5, or if i is odd and j is 14. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column indices are such that (row + column) is even or odd. \n\nIn Example 1, row 5, column 5: 10 (even). Row 6, column 14: 20 (even). \n\nIn Example 2, row 1, column 12: 13 (odd). Row 2, column 11: 13 (odd). \n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 8: 10 (even). Row 7, column 9: 16 (even). Row 8, column 8: 16 (even). Row 9, column 8: 17 (odd). \n\nSo this doesn't seem to form a consistent pattern. \n\nAnother approach: maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain pattern, like a diagonal or a line. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain region. For example, in the middle of the grid. \n\nBut how to determine that? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row is less than 10 or greater than 10. \n\nBut again, this is just guessing. \n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for the positions where 2s are placed in the output and see if there's a pattern. \n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that in certain rows, the 2s are placed in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row (row 5) has a 2 at column 5. In Example 2, the second row (row 1) has a 2 at column 12. In Example 3, row 2 has a 2 at column 8. \n\nMaybe the columns are 5, 12, 8, 9, etc. These numbers are not obvious. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is 5, 12, 8, 9, etc., and the row is in certain ranges. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the column is 5, 12, 8, 9, etc., and the row is in the middle of the grid. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain diagonal. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row (row 5) and column 5. This is a diagonal where row equals column. \n\nIn Example 2, the second row (row 1) and column 12. This is not on the diagonal. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 8. This is not on the diagonal. \n\nSo this idea is not consistent. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing certain values with 2s based on some rule. For example, in certain rows, replace the value at certain columns with 2 if it's 5. \n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns? \n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even or odd and the column is in a certain range. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row is even, and the column is 5 or 14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the column is 5 or 14. \n\nIn Example 1, row 5, column 5. In Example 2, row 1, column 12. \n\nThis doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the column is 5, 14, 11, 12, etc. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be implemented in code. For example, in the examples, the 2s are placed in certain positions, and perhaps the code can check for those positions. \n\nBut how to determine which positions? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even and the column is 5, or the row is odd and the column is 14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column indices are such that (row + column) is 10, 13, 16, etc. \n\nBut again, this is just guessing. \n\nAnother approach: look at the output of the examples and see if there's a pattern in the positions of the 2s. \n\nIn Example 1, the 2s are at (5,5) and (6,14). \n\nIn Example 2, the 2s are at (1,12) and (2,11). \n\nIn Example 3, the 2s are at (2,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). \n\nLooking at these positions, it seems that in row 2 of Example 3, column 8. In row 7, column 9. In row 8, columns 8 and 9. In row 9, column 8. \n\nThis suggests that in rows 2, 7, 8, 9, the 2s are placed in columns 8 and 9. \n\nMaybe the 2s are placed in columns 8 and 9 for rows 2, 7, 8, 9. \n\nBut how to generalize this? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns 8 and 9 for rows 2, 7, 8, 9, and in other rows, in other columns. \n\nBut this is too specific. \n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to assume that the 2s are placed in certain positions based on the row and column indices, and implement a rule that checks for those positions. \n\nFor example, in the examples, the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even or odd, and the column is in a certain range. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain region of the grid. For example, the middle of the grid. \n\nBut how to determine that? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row is in the first half of the grid. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. \n\nLooking at the examples, the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in certain rows and columns. For example, in row 5, column 5; in row 6, column 14; in row 1, column 12; in row 2, column 11; in row 2, column 8; in row 7, column 9; in row 8, columns 8 and 9; in row 9, column 8. \n\nMaybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even and the column is 5, or the row is odd and the column is 14. \n\nBut this is not consistent with all examples. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even and the column is 5, or the row is odd and the column is 14, or the row is 2 and column is 8, or row is 7 and column is 9, etc. \n\nBut this is too specific. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is in the range 0-10 and the column is 5 or 14, or in other ranges. \n\nBut again, this is not helpful. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of a possible transformation that could explain the examples. \n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace all instances of 5 in certain positions with 2. For example, in certain rows and columns. \n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns? \n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is 5, 6, 1, 2, 2, 7, 8, 9, etc. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is in the range 0-10 and the column is 5, 14, 8, 9, etc. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: in the examples, the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is at (5,5), which is the fifth row and fifth column. In Example 2, the 2 is at (1,12), which is row 1, column 12. In Example 3, the 2 is at (2,8), (7,9), etc. \n\nMaybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row is i and the column is (19 - i) or something. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, row 5 (i=5), column 5 (19 - 5 = 14, but that's not matching). \n\nAlternatively, column is 5 for row 5. \n\nThis is not helpful. \n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to write a function that replaces certain positions with 2s based on some rule. For example, replace the value at position (row, column) with 2 if the original value is 5 and the row and column satisfy some condition. \n\nBut without knowing the condition, it's hard to proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in the middle of the grid. \n\nBut how to determine that? \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll have to make an educated guess. \n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace the value at position (row, column) with 2 if the original value is 5 and the position is in the middle of the grid. For example, in the middle rows and columns. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row is in the range 5-7 and the column is 5 or 14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the examples, I'll try to write a function that replaces certain positions with 2. For example, in the first example, replace (5,5) and (6,14) with 2. In the second example, replace (1,12) and (2,11) with 2. In the third example, replace (2,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8) with 2. \n\nBut how to generalize this? \n\nMaybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even and the column is 5, or the row is odd and the column is 14. \n\nBut this is not consistent with all examples. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is in the range 0-10 and the column is 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even and the column is 5, or the row is odd and the column is 14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain positions with 2 based on the examples. \n\nFor example, in the first example, the 2s are at (5,5) and (6,14). In the second example, (1,12) and (2,11). In the third example, (2,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). \n\nLooking at these positions, it seems that the 2s are placed in certain rows and columns, but I'm not sure of the pattern. \n\nPerhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is in the range 0-10 and the column is 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even and the column is 5, or the row is odd and the column is 14. \n\nBut I'll have to implement this as a possible pattern. \n\nSo, the code could check for each position (row, col) if it meets certain conditions and replace the value with 2. \n\nFor example, if row is even and column is 5, or row is odd and column is 14, or other conditions. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is 5, 6, 1, 2, 2, 7, 8, 9, etc. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nAt this point, I'll have to proceed with a possible transformation. \n\nMaybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in certain rows and columns. For example, in rows 5, 6, 1, 2, 2, 7, 8, 9, etc., and columns 5, 14, 12, 11, 8, 9, etc. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nPerhaps the code can check for certain positions and replace them with 2. \n\nBut since the examples are limited, I'll have to make a guess. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace all occurrences of 5 in certain positions with 2. For example, in the first example, replace (5,5) and (6,14) with 2. In the second example, replace (1,12) and (2,11) with 2. In the third example, replace (2,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8) with 2. \n\nBut how to generalize this? \n\nPerhaps the code can check if the row is in a certain range and the column is in a certain range. For example, rows 0-10 and columns 5-14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the code can replace the value at (row, column) with 2 if the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain pattern. \n\nBut without knowing the pattern, it's hard to implement. \n\nAt this point, I'll proceed with a possible transformation that replaces certain positions with 2, based on the examples. \n\nFor example, in the first example, the 2 is at (5,5) and (6,14). In the second example, (1,12) and (2,11). In the third example, (2,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). \n\nSo, the code could replace these specific positions with 2. \n\nBut how to determine which positions to replace? \n\nPerhaps the code can check if the row is in the range 0-10 and the column is in the range 5-14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the code can replace the value at (row, column) with 2 if the original value is 5 and (row + column) is even. \n\nBut this is also a guess. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain positions with 2 based on the examples. \n\nFor example, in the first example, the 2 is at (5,5) and (6,14). In the second example, (1,12) and (2,11). In the third example, (2,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). \n\nSo, the code could check if the position is in these specific positions and replace the value with 2. \n\nBut this would not generalize to other examples, but it's the best I can do given the time. \n\nSo, the code would create a new grid, and for each position (row, col), if it's one of the positions mentioned above, replace the value with 2. \n\nBut how to determine these positions? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code replaces the value at (row, col) with 2 if the original value is 5 and the row is even or odd, and the column is in a certain range. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is just guessing. \n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following approach: \n\nThe transformation replaces certain positions with 2 based on the examples. For example, in the first example, replace (5,5) and (6,14) with 2. In the second example, (1,12) and (2,11) with 2. In the third example, (2,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8) with 2. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nThe code would need to have a list of positions to replace. \n\nBut since the examples are different, it's not possible to hardcode these positions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code replaces the value at (row, column) with 2 if the original value is 5 and the row is in a certain range and the column is in a certain range. \n\nFor example, rows 0-10 and columns 5-14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nIn the first example, row 5 is in 0-10, column 5 is in 5-14. So replace with 2. \n\nIn the second example, row 1 is in 0-10, column 12 is in 5-14. So replace with 2. \n\nIn the third example, row 2 is in 0-10, column 8 is in 5-14. So replace with 2. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nSo the code could replace any position (row, col) where the original value is 5 and row is in 0-10 and column is in 5-14. \n\nBut let's check this with the examples. \n\nIn Example 1, the sixth row (row 5) has a 5 at column 5. So it would be replaced with 2. \n\nIn the seventh row (row 6), column 14 is in 5-14. So it would be replaced with 2. \n\nIn Example 2, row 1, column 12 is in 5-14. So replaced with 2. \n\nIn row 2, column 11 is in 5-14. So replaced with 2. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 8 is in 5-14. So replaced with 2. \n\nRow 7, column 9 is in 5-14. So replaced with 2. \n\nRow 8, columns 8 and 9 are in 5-14. So replaced with 2. \n\nRow 9, column 8 is in 5-14. So replaced with 2. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nSo the code would replace any position (row, col) where the original value is 5 and row is between 0 and 10 (inclusive), and column is between 5 and 14 (inclusive). \n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the seventh row is row 6, which is in 0-10. Column 14 is in 5-14. So this would be replaced. \n\nBut in the third example, row 9 is in 0-10. Column 8 is in 5-14. So replaced. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nSo the code would check for each cell in the grid: if the value is 5, and the row is between 0 and 10, and the column is between 5 and 14, then replace it with 2. \n\nBut let's check this with the examples. \n\nIn Example 1, the sixth row (row 5) has a 5 at column 5. So replaced with 2. \n\nIn the seventh row (row 6), column 14 is 5, replaced with 2. \n\nIn Example 2, row 1, column 12 is 5, replaced with 2. \n\nRow 2, column 11 is 5, replaced with 2. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 8 is 5, replaced with 2. \n\nRow 7, column 9 is 5, replaced with 2. \n\nRow 8, columns 8 and 9 are 5, replaced with 2. \n\nRow 9, column 8 is 5, replaced with 2. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nBut what about other positions? For example, in Example 1, the sixth row has a 5 at column 5 (replaced), but other 5s in rows 0-10 and columns 5-14 would also be replaced. \n\nBut according to the examples, this seems to work. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if the value is 5, and the row is in 0-10 and column is in 5-14, replace with 2. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the sixth row (row 5) has a 5 at column 5 (replaced), and in the seventh row (row 6), column 14 is replaced. \n\nIn Example 2, row 1, column 12 is replaced, and row 2, column 11 is replaced. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 8 is replaced, etc. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nSo the code would look like:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row in range(18):\n        for col in range(19):\n            if grid[row][col] == 5 and 0 <= row <= 10 and 5 <= col <= 14:\n                transformed[row][col] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the sixth row (row 5) has a 5 at column 5, which is replaced with 2. \n\nBut in the first example's input, the sixth row is:\n\n0 0 5 0 4 5 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5 5\n\nSo the 5 at column 5 (index 5) is replaced with 2. \n\nYes. \n\nBut in the input, the seventh row (row 6) is:\n\n5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 4 4 5 0\n\nSo column 14 is 5 (index 14), which is replaced with 2. \n\nYes. \n\nIn Example 2, the second row (row 1) has a 5 at column 12 (index 12), which is replaced with 2. \n\nYes. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 8 is replaced with 2. \n\nYes. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nBut what about other positions? For example, in Example 3, row 7, column 9 is 5, which is replaced with 2. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to be a possible pattern. \n\nBut why would this pattern be correct? Because the examples show that the 2s are placed in positions where the row is in 0-10 and column in 5-14. \n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the correct pattern, but given the examples, it seems to fit. \n\nSo the code would replace any 5 in the grid that is in rows 0-10 and columns 5-14 with 2. \n\nThis is the best I can do based on the examples.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 18x19. The input and output have some numbers, and the output seems to have some changes. Let me compare the first few rows.\n\nLooking at the first row of input and output for Example 1: the input is 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0. The output is the same as the input. Wait, that's interesting. So maybe that row is unchanged. But looking at the second row of input and output: input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0, and the output is the same. Hmm, but in the third row of input and output, the input is 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0, and the output is the same. Wait, but in Example 1, the output is the same as the input? But that can't be right because the output in Example 1 is different from the input. Wait, no, looking again. Wait the output for Example 1 is different. Let me check again.\n\nWait in Example 1, the input and output are different. For example, in the sixth row of input (row index 5?), the input is 0 0 5 0 4 5 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5 5. The output is 0 0 5 0 4 2 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5 5. So the sixth row of input has a 5 in position 5 (assuming 0-based?), and the output has a 2 there. So that's a change. Similarly, in the seventh row of input, the input is 5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 4 4 5 0. The output is 5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 2 4 4 5 0. So here, the 15th element (position 15) in the input is 5, and in the output it's 2. So that's a change. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be that certain positions are being modified. But how? Let me check more examples. For example, in Example 2, the input and output are different. For instance, in the second row of input, the input is 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0. The output is 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 2 5 0 0. So the 13th element (index 12?) is changed from 5 to 2. Similarly, in the third row of input, the input is 0 0 4 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 4 5 5 5 0. The output is 0 0 4 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 4 2 2 5 0. So the 12th element (index 11?) is 5 in input, but in output it's 2. \n\nSo maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being replaced with 2s. But where? Let me look for a pattern in the positions where changes occur. \n\nLooking at Example 1, the sixth row (row index 5?), the 5th element (position 5) is changed from 5 to 2. Wait, in the input row 5: 0 0 5 0 4 5 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5 5. The output row 5 is 0 0 5 0 4 2 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5 5. So the 5th element (index 5) is 4 in input and 2 in output. Wait, no, wait the input row is 0 0 5 0 4 5 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5 5. So the elements are:\n\nIndices 0-17 (since it's 18 elements per row). Let me check the sixth row (assuming rows are 0-based). Let's say the input row is row 5. Let's index the elements as 0 to 18. So the sixth row in input is:\n\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 5, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5]\n\nIn the output, the same row is:\n\n[0, 0, 5, 0, 4, 2, 4, 5, 5, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5]\n\nSo the 5th element (index 5) is 5 in input, and 2 in output. So that's a change. Similarly, in the seventh row of input (row 6?), the input is:\n\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 4, 4, 5, 0]\n\nThe output is:\n\n[5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 4, 4, 5, 0]\n\nSo the 14th element (index 14) is 5 in input, 2 in output. \n\nLooking at these positions, perhaps the 5th element (index 5) and 14th element (index 14) in the row. Wait, but how do these positions relate to the grid? Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified. \n\nLooking at the first example, in the sixth row, the fifth element (index 5) is changed to 2. In the seventh row, the 14th element (index 14) is changed to 2. \n\nIn the second example, in the second row of input (row 1?), the 12th element (index 12) is changed to 2. In the third row of input (row 2?), the 11th element (index 11) is changed to 2. \n\nWait, maybe the positions where 2 is inserted are in certain columns. Let me look for a pattern. \n\nIn Example 1, the sixth row (row 5) has a 2 at index 5. The seventh row (row 6) has a 2 at index 14. \n\nIn Example 2, the second row (row 1) has a 2 at index 12. Third row (row 2) has a 2 at index 11. \n\nHmm, perhaps the 2s are placed in certain positions based on some rule. Maybe the positions where the value is 4 in the input are being replaced with 2? Let me check. \n\nIn Example 1, the sixth row input has a 4 at index 4 (the fifth element). The output changes that to 2. But in the input, that position was 4, but in the output it's 2. \n\nIn the seventh row of input, the 14th element is 5. But in the output, it's 2. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5. But in the sixth row of input, the 5th element was 5, but in the output it's 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in certain positions based on some other rule. For example, maybe the positions where the value is 5 and in certain rows or columns. \n\nLooking at the first example, the output in the sixth row has a 2 at index 5. Let's see the original input. The sixth row input is 0 0 5 0 4 5 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5 5. So the fifth element (index 5) is 5. The output changes that to 2. \n\nIn the seventh row, the 14th element (index 14) is 5 in input, and output is 2. \n\nSo perhaps the rule is that in certain positions (like index 5 and 14 in rows 5 and 6), the value is changed to 2. \n\nBut how to find a general rule? Let's check other examples. \n\nLooking at Example 2, the second row of input is 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0. The output is 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 2 5 0 0. So the 12th element (index 12) is 5 in input and 2 in output. \n\nThird row of input is 0 0 4 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 4 5 5 5 0. The output is 0 0 4 5 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 4 2 2 5 0. So the 11th element (index 11) is 4 in input, but in output it's 2. \n\nWait, but that's conflicting with the previous idea. So maybe the 2 is being placed where the original value is 5 or 4? Or maybe there's a different pattern. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in certain positions that form a pattern. For example, in the first example, the 2s are in positions (5,5) and (6,14). In the second example, (1,12) and (2,11). \n\nLooking for a pattern in the positions. Let's consider the rows and columns. For example, in Example 1, the first 2 is in row 5 (assuming rows are 0-based?), column 5. The second 2 is in row 6, column 14. \n\nIn Example 2, the first 2 is in row 1, column 12. The second 2 is in row 2, column 11. \n\nHmm. Maybe the positions are related to the row number. For example, in row i, column (some function of i). \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the positions where 2 is inserted are in certain diagonals or other geometric patterns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being inserted in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain row or column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being inserted in positions where the value is 5 and the position is in a certain region. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being inserted in positions where the value is 5 and the row and column indices satisfy a certain condition. \n\nBut this is getting a bit complicated. Let's look at the third example. \n\nIn Example 3, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5\nRow 1: 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 4 5 0 0 5 0 5 5\nRow 2: 5 0 5 0 0 0 4 4 5 0 5 5 5 0 5\nRow 3: 5 0 0 5 0 5 5 4 0 0 0 5 5 0 5\nRow 4: 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 5 0\nRow 5: 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0\nRow 6: 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 5 5 4 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0 5 5\nRow 8: 5 4 5 4 0 5 5 0 4 5 4 5 0 5 0\nRow 9: 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 4 0 5 0 5 5\nRow 10: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5\nRow 11: 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5\n\nThe output for Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5\nRow 1: 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 4 5 0 0 5 0 5 5\nRow 2: 5 0 5 0 0 0 4 4 2 0 5 5 5 0 5\nRow 3: 5 0 0 5 0 5 5 4 0 0 0 5 5 0 5\nRow 4: 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 5 0\nRow 5: 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0\nRow 6: 5 5 0 5 5 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 5 5 4 0 5 0 5 0 0 2 0 5 0 5 5\nRow 8: 5 4 2 4 0 5 5 0 4 2 4 5 0 5 0\nRow 9: 5 5 2 0 0 5 5 0 0 4 0 5 0 5 5\nRow 10: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5\nRow 11: 0 5 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5\n\nLooking at the output, in row 2, the 8th element (index 8) is 2. In row 7, the 9th element (index 9) is 2. In row 8, the 8th element (index 8) is 2, and the 9th element (index 9) is 2. In row 9, the 8th element (index 8) is 2. \n\nSo in these rows, the 2s are in certain columns. For example, in row 2, index 8. In row 7, index 9. In row 8, index 8 and 9. In row 9, index 8. \n\nThis seems like a pattern where in certain rows, the 2 is placed in the 8th or 9th column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain row or column. \n\nBut how to find a general rule. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row and column indices satisfy a certain condition. For example, in row i, column j, if i is even or odd, or if j is even or odd. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row and column indices are in a certain range. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row and column indices are in certain positions. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me think of another approach. \n\nLooking at the test input and output. The test input is given, but I don't have the output. However, the task is to write a function that transforms the input to output. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain values with 2s based on their position. For example, in certain positions (like (row, column) where row is even and column is 5 or something), replace the value with 2. \n\nBut without seeing the output of the test input, it's hard to know. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain diagonal. \n\nAnother approach: maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the value is 5 and the position is in a certain row or column. For example, in the first example, in row 5 (the sixth row), the fifth element is 5 and is changed to 2. \n\nBut why that particular position? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in the middle of the grid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in certain rows and columns. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row and column indices are in certain ranges. For example, in rows 5-7, columns 5-14. \n\nBut this is too vague. \n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the positions where 2s are placed. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row (row 5) has a 2 at column 5. The seventh row (row 6) has a 2 at column 14. \n\nIn Example 2, the second row (row 1) has a 2 at column 12. The third row (row 2) has a 2 at column 11. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2 has a 2 at column 8, row 7 at column 9, row 8 at columns 8 and 9, row 9 at column 8. \n\nLooking at these positions, perhaps the columns are related to the row number. For example, in row i, the column is 14 - i or something. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the column is 5, 14, 11, 12, etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is (row + 5) modulo 19. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is 5, 14, 11, 12, etc., but this seems arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the column is in a certain range. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row is even. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in certain rows and columns. For example, in the first example, row 5 (sixth row) and column 5. In the second example, row 1 and column 12. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain diagonal. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row and column indices are in the same row or column. \n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. \n\nLooking at the examples, the transformation seems to replace certain values with 2s. The key is to find out which positions are being replaced. \n\nIn Example 1, the sixth row has a 2 at column 5. The seventh row has a 2 at column 14. \n\nIn Example 2, the second row has a 2 at column 12. The third row has a 2 at column 11. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2 has a 2 at column 8. Row 7 has a 2 at column 9. Row 8 has 2s at columns 8 and 9. Row 9 has a 2 at column 8. \n\nLooking for a pattern in these positions. For example, in row 2 of Example 3, column 8. In row 7, column 9. Row 8, columns 8 and 9. Row 9, column 8. \n\nMaybe the 2s are being placed in positions where the column is 8 or 9 in certain rows. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the column is 5, 14, 11, 12, 8, 9, etc. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the column is 5, 14, 8, 9, etc., and the row is in a certain range. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in the middle of the grid. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the 2s are placed in the output and see if they form a pattern. \n\nIn Example 1, the 2s are at (5,5) and (6,14). \n\nIn Example 2, the 2s are at (1,12) and (2,11). \n\nIn Example 3, the 2s are at (2,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). \n\nLooking at these positions, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even or odd, and the column is in certain ranges. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column indices satisfy row + column = some value. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, row 5, column 5: 5+5=10. Row 6, column 14: 6+14=20. \n\nIn Example 2, row 1, column 12: 13. Row 2, column 11: 13. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 8: 10. Row 7, column 9: 16. Row 8, column 8: 16. Row 9, column 8: 17. \n\nHmm, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column indices are in certain ranges. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, row 5 (which is the sixth row) and column 5. \n\nIn Example 2, row 1 and column 12. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2 and column 8. \n\nIt's possible that these positions are part of a pattern where the 2s are placed in certain rows and columns based on some rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row is even or odd. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAnother idea: looking at the examples, the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in the same row or column as another 2. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain area of the grid. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the sixth row has a 2 at column 5. In the seventh row, column 14. \n\nIn Example 2, row 1, column 12. Row 2, column 11. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 8. Row 7, column 9. \n\nMaybe these positions are in certain regions of the grid. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are being placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in the middle of the grid. \n\nBut this is too vague. \n\nMaybe I should think of the 2s as being placed in certain positions based on the row and column indices. For example, in row i, column j, if i is even and j is 5, or if i is odd and j is 14. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column indices are such that (row + column) is even or odd. \n\nIn Example 1, row 5, column 5: 10 (even). Row 6, column 14: 20 (even). \n\nIn Example 2, row 1, column 12: 13 (odd). Row 2, column 11: 13 (odd). \n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 8: 10 (even). Row 7, column 9: 16 (even). Row 8, column 8: 16 (even). Row 9, column 8: 17 (odd). \n\nSo this doesn't seem to form a consistent pattern. \n\nAnother approach: maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain pattern, like a diagonal or a line. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain region. For example, in the middle of the grid. \n\nBut how to determine that? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row is less than 10 or greater than 10. \n\nBut again, this is just guessing. \n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for the positions where 2s are placed in the output and see if there's a pattern. \n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that in certain rows, the 2s are placed in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row (row 5) has a 2 at column 5. In Example 2, the second row (row 1) has a 2 at column 12. In Example 3, row 2 has a 2 at column 8. \n\nMaybe the columns are 5, 12, 8, 9, etc. These numbers are not obvious. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column is 5, 12, 8, 9, etc., and the row is in certain ranges. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the column is 5, 12, 8, 9, etc., and the row is in the middle of the grid. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain diagonal. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row (row 5) and column 5. This is a diagonal where row equals column. \n\nIn Example 2, the second row (row 1) and column 12. This is not on the diagonal. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 8. This is not on the diagonal. \n\nSo this idea is not consistent. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing certain values with 2s based on some rule. For example, in certain rows, replace the value at certain columns with 2 if it's 5. \n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns? \n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even or odd and the column is in a certain range. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row is even, and the column is 5 or 14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the column is 5 or 14. \n\nIn Example 1, row 5, column 5. In Example 2, row 1, column 12. \n\nThis doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the column is 5, 14, 11, 12, etc. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be implemented in code. For example, in the examples, the 2s are placed in certain positions, and perhaps the code can check for those positions. \n\nBut how to determine which positions? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even and the column is 5, or the row is odd and the column is 14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row and column indices are such that (row + column) is 10, 13, 16, etc. \n\nBut again, this is just guessing. \n\nAnother approach: look at the output of the examples and see if there's a pattern in the positions of the 2s. \n\nIn Example 1, the 2s are at (5,5) and (6,14). \n\nIn Example 2, the 2s are at (1,12) and (2,11). \n\nIn Example 3, the 2s are at (2,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). \n\nLooking at these positions, it seems that in row 2 of Example 3, column 8. In row 7, column 9. In row 8, columns 8 and 9. In row 9, column 8. \n\nThis suggests that in rows 2, 7, 8, 9, the 2s are placed in columns 8 and 9. \n\nMaybe the 2s are placed in columns 8 and 9 for rows 2, 7, 8, 9. \n\nBut how to generalize this? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns 8 and 9 for rows 2, 7, 8, 9, and in other rows, in other columns. \n\nBut this is too specific. \n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to assume that the 2s are placed in certain positions based on the row and column indices, and implement a rule that checks for those positions. \n\nFor example, in the examples, the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even or odd, and the column is in a certain range. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain region of the grid. For example, the middle of the grid. \n\nBut how to determine that? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row is in the first half of the grid. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. \n\nLooking at the examples, the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in certain rows and columns. For example, in row 5, column 5; in row 6, column 14; in row 1, column 12; in row 2, column 11; in row 2, column 8; in row 7, column 9; in row 8, columns 8 and 9; in row 9, column 8. \n\nMaybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even and the column is 5, or the row is odd and the column is 14. \n\nBut this is not consistent with all examples. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even and the column is 5, or the row is odd and the column is 14, or the row is 2 and column is 8, or row is 7 and column is 9, etc. \n\nBut this is too specific. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is in the range 0-10 and the column is 5 or 14, or in other ranges. \n\nBut again, this is not helpful. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of a possible transformation that could explain the examples. \n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace all instances of 5 in certain positions with 2. For example, in certain rows and columns. \n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns? \n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is 5, 6, 1, 2, 2, 7, 8, 9, etc. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is in the range 0-10 and the column is 5, 14, 8, 9, etc. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: in the examples, the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is at (5,5), which is the fifth row and fifth column. In Example 2, the 2 is at (1,12), which is row 1, column 12. In Example 3, the 2 is at (2,8), (7,9), etc. \n\nMaybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row is i and the column is (19 - i) or something. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, row 5 (i=5), column 5 (19 - 5 = 14, but that's not matching). \n\nAlternatively, column is 5 for row 5. \n\nThis is not helpful. \n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to write a function that replaces certain positions with 2s based on some rule. For example, replace the value at position (row, column) with 2 if the original value is 5 and the row and column satisfy some condition. \n\nBut without knowing the condition, it's hard to proceed. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in the middle of the grid. \n\nBut how to determine that? \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll have to make an educated guess. \n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace the value at position (row, column) with 2 if the original value is 5 and the position is in the middle of the grid. For example, in the middle rows and columns. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the row is in the range 5-7 and the column is 5 or 14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the examples, I'll try to write a function that replaces certain positions with 2. For example, in the first example, replace (5,5) and (6,14) with 2. In the second example, replace (1,12) and (2,11) with 2. In the third example, replace (2,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8) with 2. \n\nBut how to generalize this? \n\nMaybe the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even and the column is 5, or the row is odd and the column is 14. \n\nBut this is not consistent with all examples. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is in the range 0-10 and the column is 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even and the column is 5, or the row is odd and the column is 14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain positions with 2 based on the examples. \n\nFor example, in the first example, the 2s are at (5,5) and (6,14). In the second example, (1,12) and (2,11). In the third example, (2,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). \n\nLooking at these positions, it seems that the 2s are placed in certain rows and columns, but I'm not sure of the pattern. \n\nPerhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is in the range 0-10 and the column is 5, 8, 9, 11, 12, 14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is even and the column is 5, or the row is odd and the column is 14. \n\nBut I'll have to implement this as a possible pattern. \n\nSo, the code could check for each position (row, col) if it meets certain conditions and replace the value with 2. \n\nFor example, if row is even and column is 5, or row is odd and column is 14, or other conditions. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are placed in positions where the row is 5, 6, 1, 2, 2, 7, 8, 9, etc. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nAt this point, I'll have to proceed with a possible transformation. \n\nMaybe the 2s are placed in positions where the original value is 5 and the position is in certain rows and columns. For example, in rows 5, 6, 1, 2, 2, 7, 8, 9, etc., and columns 5, 14, 12, 11, 8, 9, etc. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nPerhaps the code can check for certain positions and replace them with 2. \n\nBut since the examples are limited, I'll have to make a guess. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace all occurrences of 5 in certain positions with 2. For example, in the first example, replace (5,5) and (6,14) with 2. In the second example, replace (1,12) and (2,11) with 2. In the third example, replace (2,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8) with 2. \n\nBut how to generalize this? \n\nPerhaps the code can check if the row is in a certain range and the column is in a certain range. For example, rows 0-10 and columns 5-14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the code can replace the value at (row, column) with 2 if the original value is 5 and the position is in a certain pattern. \n\nBut without knowing the pattern, it's hard to implement. \n\nAt this point, I'll proceed with a possible transformation that replaces certain positions with 2, based on the examples. \n\nFor example, in the first example, the 2 is at (5,5) and (6,14). In the second example, (1,12) and (2,11). In the third example, (2,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). \n\nSo, the code could replace these specific positions with 2. \n\nBut how to determine which positions to replace? \n\nPerhaps the code can check if the row is in the range 0-10 and the column is in the range 5-14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the code can replace the value at (row, column) with 2 if the original value is 5 and (row + column) is even. \n\nBut this is also a guess. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain positions with 2 based on the examples. \n\nFor example, in the first example, the 2 is at (5,5) and (6,14). In the second example, (1,12) and (2,11). In the third example, (2,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8). \n\nSo, the code could check if the position is in these specific positions and replace the value with 2. \n\nBut this would not generalize to other examples, but it's the best I can do given the time. \n\nSo, the code would create a new grid, and for each position (row, col), if it's one of the positions mentioned above, replace the value with 2. \n\nBut how to determine these positions? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code replaces the value at (row, col) with 2 if the original value is 5 and the row is even or odd, and the column is in a certain range. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is just guessing. \n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following approach: \n\nThe transformation replaces certain positions with 2 based on the examples. For example, in the first example, replace (5,5) and (6,14) with 2. In the second example, (1,12) and (2,11) with 2. In the third example, (2,8), (7,9), (8,8), (8,9), (9,8) with 2. \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nThe code would need to have a list of positions to replace. \n\nBut since the examples are different, it's not possible to hardcode these positions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code replaces the value at (row, column) with 2 if the original value is 5 and the row is in a certain range and the column is in a certain range. \n\nFor example, rows 0-10 and columns 5-14. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nIn the first example, row 5 is in 0-10, column 5 is in 5-14. So replace with 2. \n\nIn the second example, row 1 is in 0-10, column 12 is in 5-14. So replace with 2. \n\nIn the third example, row 2 is in 0-10, column 8 is in 5-14. So replace with 2. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nSo the code could replace any position (row, col) where the original value is 5 and row is in 0-10 and column is in 5-14. \n\nBut let's check this with the examples. \n\nIn Example 1, the sixth row (row 5) has a 5 at column 5. So it would be replaced with 2. \n\nIn the seventh row (row 6), column 14 is in 5-14. So it would be replaced with 2. \n\nIn Example 2, row 1, column 12 is in 5-14. So replaced with 2. \n\nIn row 2, column 11 is in 5-14. So replaced with 2. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 8 is in 5-14. So replaced with 2. \n\nRow 7, column 9 is in 5-14. So replaced with 2. \n\nRow 8, columns 8 and 9 are in 5-14. So replaced with 2. \n\nRow 9, column 8 is in 5-14. So replaced with 2. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nSo the code would replace any position (row, col) where the original value is 5 and row is between 0 and 10 (inclusive), and column is between 5 and 14 (inclusive). \n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the seventh row is row 6, which is in 0-10. Column 14 is in 5-14. So this would be replaced. \n\nBut in the third example, row 9 is in 0-10. Column 8 is in 5-14. So replaced. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nSo the code would check for each cell in the grid: if the value is 5, and the row is between 0 and 10, and the column is between 5 and 14, then replace it with 2. \n\nBut let's check this with the examples. \n\nIn Example 1, the sixth row (row 5) has a 5 at column 5. So replaced with 2. \n\nIn the seventh row (row 6), column 14 is 5, replaced with 2. \n\nIn Example 2, row 1, column 12 is 5, replaced with 2. \n\nRow 2, column 11 is 5, replaced with 2. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 8 is 5, replaced with 2. \n\nRow 7, column 9 is 5, replaced with 2. \n\nRow 8, columns 8 and 9 are 5, replaced with 2. \n\nRow 9, column 8 is 5, replaced with 2. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nBut what about other positions? For example, in Example 1, the sixth row has a 5 at column 5 (replaced), but other 5s in rows 0-10 and columns 5-14 would also be replaced. \n\nBut according to the examples, this seems to work. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if the value is 5, and the row is in 0-10 and column is in 5-14, replace with 2. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the sixth row (row 5) has a 5 at column 5 (replaced), and in the seventh row (row 6), column 14 is replaced. \n\nIn Example 2, row 1, column 12 is replaced, and row 2, column 11 is replaced. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 8 is replaced, etc. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nSo the code would look like:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row in range(18):\n        for col in range(19):\n            if grid[row][col] == 5 and 0 <= row <= 10 and 5 <= col <= 14:\n                transformed[row][col] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the sixth row (row 5) has a 5 at column 5, which is replaced with 2. \n\nBut in the first example's input, the sixth row is:\n\n0 0 5 0 4 5 4 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 5 5 5\n\nSo the 5 at column 5 (index 5) is replaced with 2. \n\nYes. \n\nBut in the input, the seventh row (row 6) is:\n\n5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 4 4 5 0\n\nSo column 14 is 5 (index 14), which is replaced with 2. \n\nYes. \n\nIn Example 2, the second row (row 1) has a 5 at column 12 (index 12), which is replaced with 2. \n\nYes. \n\nIn Example 3, row 2, column 8 is replaced with 2. \n\nYes. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nBut what about other positions? For example, in Example 3, row 7, column 9 is 5, which is replaced with 2. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to be a possible pattern. \n\nBut why would this pattern be correct? Because the examples show that the 2s are placed in positions where the row is in 0-10 and column in 5-14. \n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the correct pattern, but given the examples, it seems to fit. \n\nSo the code would replace any 5 in the grid that is in rows 0-10 and columns 5-14 with 2. \n\nThis is the best I can do based on the examples.\n"
