The output grid seems to be a transformation of the input grid where certain values are preserved, and others are modified based on their position and value.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain values (like 4) are preserved in specific positions.\n3. Values like 3 and 2 seem to be transformed into other values based on their position and surrounding values.\n4. There's a pattern where certain values (like 1) are preserved in specific positions.\n5. The output grid seems to be a transformation that preserves certain values and modifies others based on their position and value.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Preserves values that are 0, 1, 4, and 8\n- Transforms values that are 2 into 0\n- Transforms values that are 3 into 1\n- Transforms values that are 6 into 0\n- Transforms values that are 7 into 0\n- Transforms values that are 9 into 0\n\nThis is a hypothesis based on the patterns observed in the training examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    transformation = {\n        0: 0,\n        1: 1,\n        4: 4,\n        8: 8,\n        2: 0,\n        3: 1,\n        6: 0,\n        7: 0,\n        9: 0\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the transformation to each cell\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[i])):\n            value = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = transformation.get(value, value)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid seems to be a transformation of the input grid where certain values are preserved, and others are modified based on their position and value.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain values (like 4) are preserved in specific positions.\n3. Values like 3 and 2 seem to be transformed into other values based on their position and surrounding values.\n4. There's a pattern where certain values (like 1) are preserved in specific positions.\n5. The output grid seems to be a transformation that preserves certain values and modifies others based on their position and value.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Preserves values that are 0, 1, 4, and 8\n- Transforms values that are 2 into 0\n- Transforms values that are 3 into 1\n- Transforms values that are 6 into 0\n- Transforms values that are 7 into 0\n- Transforms values that are 9 into 0\n\nThis is a hypothesis based on the patterns observed in the training examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    transformation = {\n        0: 0,\n        1: 1,\n        4: 4,\n        8: 8,\n        2: 0,\n        3: 1,\n        6: 0,\n        7: 0,\n        9: 0\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the transformation to each cell\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[i])):\n            value = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = transformation.get(value, value)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
