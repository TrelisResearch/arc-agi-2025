The input grid is always 3 rows high and 3 columns wide. This suggests that the output is a transformation of the input that repeats or extends the input in some way.\n\nLooking at the examples more closely:\n\n- In Example 1, the input is:\n  ```\n  1 1 0\n  1 1 1\n  0 0 0\n  ```\n  The output is:\n  ```\n  1 1 0\n  1 1 1\n  0 0 0\n  0 0 0\n  1 1 1\n  1 1 0\n  ```\n  This looks like the input is repeated twice, with the third row being repeated at the bottom.\n\n- In Example 2, the input is:\n  ```\n  0 0 0\n  1 0 1\n  1 1 0\n  ```\n  The output is:\n  ```\n  0 0 0\n  1 0 1\n  1 1 0\n  1 1 0\n  1 0 1\n  0 0 0\n  ```\n  This looks like the input is mirrored vertically, with the first row repeated at the bottom and the third row repeated in the middle.\n\n- In Example 3, the input is:\n  ```\n  0 0 0\n  0 0 1\n  0 0 1\n  ```\n  The output is:\n  ```\n  0 0 0\n  0 0 1\n  0 0 1\n  0 0 1\n  0 0 1\n  0 0 0\n  ```\n  This looks like the input is repeated twice, with the third row being repeated at the bottom.\n\nFrom these examples, I observe that the output grid is created by repeating the input grid in a certain pattern. It seems like the output is formed by repeating the input grid in a way that creates a symmetrical pattern.\n\nBased on this pattern, I'll implement a transformation that repeats the input grid in a symmetrical pattern to form a 6x3 output grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 6x3 output grid\n    transformed_grid = []\n    \n    # Repeat the input grid in a symmetrical pattern\n    for i in range(3):\n        # Add the original row\n        transformed_grid.append(grid[i])\n        # Add the reversed row\n        transformed_grid.append(grid[2 - i])\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
