The key observation is that the output is a single integer, which suggests that the transformation might be summarizing the input grid in some way.\n\nLet's break down the patterns:\n\n1. **Input Grid Characteristics**:\n   - The input grids are large (e.g., 20x20) and contain integers from 0 to 9.\n   - The grids have a high degree of symmetry and repetition.\n\n2. **Output Grid Characteristics**:\n   - The output is always a single integer.\n\nGiven these observations, one possible transformation could be to count the occurrences of each integer in the input grid and then determine the output based on these counts.
