Output introduces dark blue (`1`).\n- The change in output: in each block of adjacent `8`s (visually, a \"polyomino\"), **one of the empty (value `0`) cells that is horizontally or vertically adjacent to two `8`s is turned into a `1`**.\n  - In the first example (L-shape in top left and reverse L bottom right), a `1` is added where the missing cell would make a 2x2 square of `8`s.\n  - In the second example, the same idea\u2014where a `1` closes the \"hole\" in each `L`-shape/polyomino formed by `8`s.\n\nPattern hypothesis:\n- For each `8`, check each of its orthogonal (up/down/left/right) neighbors.\n    - If a cell is `0` and is *adjacent to exactly two `8`s* (and those two are not on the same axis, i.e. must be one above and one to the side -- making a corner), then turn the cell into `1`.\n\nImplementation logic:\n- For each cell, if it is `0`, check its four neighbors.\n- If two of those neighbors are `8`, and they are not on the same axis (must be one vertical, one horizontal), set that cell to `1`.\n- Otherwise, leave unchanged.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    out = grid.copy()\n    h, w = grid.shape\n    for r in range(h):\n        for c in range(w):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0:\n                continue\n            # Check the four neighbors\n            neighbors = []\n            coords = []\n            # Up\n            if r > 0 and grid[r-1, c] == 8:\n                neighbors.append('U')\n            # Down\n            if r < h-1 and grid[r+1, c] == 8:\n                neighbors.append('D')\n            # Left\n            if c > 0 and grid[r, c-1] == 8:\n                neighbors.append('L')\n            # Right\n            if c < w-1 and grid[r, c+1] == 8:\n                neighbors.append('R')\n            if len(neighbors) == 2:\n                # If neighbors are one row and one col (corner), place a 1\n                if ('U' in neighbors or 'D' in neighbors) and ('L' in neighbors or 'R' in neighbors):\n                    out[r, c] = 1\n    return out.tolist()\n```\n"

              "Let\u2019s analyze the patterns:\n\n- All grids are 7x7.\n- The main colors are black (`0`) and blue (`8`). Output introduces dark blue (`1`).\n- The change in output: in each block of adjacent `8`s (visually, a \"polyomino\"), **one of the empty (value `0`) cells that is horizontally or vertically adjacent to two `8`s is turned into a `1`**.\n  - In the first example (L-shape in top left and reverse L bottom right), a `1` is added where the missing cell would make a 2x2 square of `8`s.\n  - In the second example, the same idea\u2014where a `1` closes the \"hole\" in each `L`-shape/polyomino formed by `8`s.\n\nPattern hypothesis:\n- For each `8`, check each of its orthogonal (up/down/left/right) neighbors.\n    - If a cell is `0` and is *adjacent to exactly two `8`s* (and those two are not on the same axis, i.e. must be one above and one to the side -- making a corner), then turn the cell into `1`.\n\nImplementation logic:\n- For each cell, if it is `0`, check its four neighbors.\n- If two of those neighbors are `8`, and they are not on the same axis (must be one vertical, one horizontal), set that cell to `1`.\n- Otherwise, leave unchanged.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    out = grid.copy()\n    h, w = grid.shape\n    for r in range(h):\n        for c in range(w):\n            if grid[r, c] != 0:\n                continue\n            # Check the four neighbors\n            neighbors = []\n            coords = []\n            # Up\n            if r > 0 and grid[r-1, c] == 8:\n                neighbors.append('U')\n            # Down\n            if r < h-1 and grid[r+1, c] == 8:\n                neighbors.append('D')\n            # Left\n            if c > 0 and grid[r, c-1] == 8:\n                neighbors.append('L')\n            # Right\n            if c < w-1 and grid[r, c+1] == 8:\n                neighbors.append('R')\n            if len(neighbors) == 2:\n                # If neighbors are one row and one col (corner), place a 1\n                if ('U' in neighbors or 'D' in neighbors) and ('L' in neighbors or 'R' in neighbors):\n                    out[r, c] = 1\n    return out.tolist()\n```\n"
