          "Let's analyze the examples:\n\nInput size is always 3\u00d73, output size always 3\u00d76.\n\n**Observations:**\n\n- The output grid doubles the width from 3 to 6.\n- The original 3 columns are expanded somehow into 6 columns, possibly by reflecting or concatenating.\n  \nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 7 0  \n0 0 7  \n0 7 7\n\nOutput:\n0 7 0 0 7 0  \n0 0 7 7 0 0  \n0 7 7 7 7 0\n\nLooking closely:\n- The first 3 columns in output match the input rows.\n- The last 3 columns appear to be a kind of horizontal reflection or rearrangement of input columns.\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0  \n0 7 7  \n0 0 0  \n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0  \n0 7 7 7 7 0  \n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHere, the middle row in the output is the middle row of input extended to double width:\ninput middle row: 0 7 7  \noutput middle row: 0 7 7 7 7 0\n\nIt looks like the pattern \"7 7\" in input middle row is extended to four 7s in output middle row, with zeros tacked at edges.\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 0 0  \n7 0 0  \n0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0  \n7 0 0 0 0 7  \n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nIn the row 1 (middle), the single `7` at (1,0) appears to be extended to both ends in output (7 at first column and last column).\n\n**Summary pattern hypothesis:**\n\n- The output grid has 3 rows, 6 columns.\n- The output is an expanded version of the input row-wise.\n- For each input row:\n  - The original 3 columns are \"embedded\" in first half or mirrored somehow.\n  - The 7s in input are expanded horizontally and sometimes reflected to the other half.\n- Specifically, the output's left half is the original input row.\n- The output's right half is a horizontal mirroring or rearrangement of some input pattern.\n\nChecking:\n\nIn example 1:\n- row 0 input: 0 7 0  \n- row 0 output left half: 0 7 0  \n- row 0 output right half: 0 7 0 (same as left half)\n\nSimilarly for row 1 and 2, right half is rearranged (not always exact mirror but looks derived from input).\n\nIn example 2: The middle row output right half is 7 7 0, which corresponds roughly to the 7 7 from input middle row appended then last zero.\n\nIn example 3: row 1 output right half is 0 0 0 7, which places the single 7 from the left of input to right end in output.\n\n**Overall transformation:**\n\n- Output dimensions: 3\u00d76\n- Left half columns (0-2) copy input row as is.\n- Right half columns (3-5) derived by mirroring input row left to right and/or extending 7s.\n- Note how 7s in input are expanded or duplicated to the right half.\n\n---\n\n**Implementing a hypothesis:**\n\n1. For each row in input:\n2. Left half of output = input row (3 elements)\n3. Right half: take input row reversed.\n4. In right half, replace all non-zero cells with the max of input row (likely 7 here) to replicate expansion.\n5. But in example 3, single '7' at left side in input results in '7' at both ends in output. Possibly right half is reversed input row but keep only 7s, else zero.\n6. The pattern likely mirrors input row as right half with 7s preserved, zeros otherwise.\n\nTry coding this logic.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # grid is 3x3 input\n    rows = 3\n    cols_in = 3\n    cols_out = 6\n    \n    transformed_grid = []\n    \n    for row in grid:\n        left = row[:]  # copy input row as left half\n        \n        # Create right half by reversing input row\n        right = row[::-1]\n        # Replace zeros with 0, keep 7s or non-zero values as is to expand pattern\n        # In examples zeros stay zeros, 7s stay 7s\n        right_expanded = []\n        for val in right:\n            if val == 0:\n                right_expanded.append(0)\n            else:\n                right_expanded.append(val)\n        \n        transformed_row = left + right_expanded\n        transformed_grid.append(transformed_row)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\nThis will at least match the pattern of doubling width and mirroring horizontally with preservation of non-zero values, notably 7s. It perfectly matches example 1 row 0, example 2 row 0 and 2. For example 3, the single 7 at left will result in one 7 at right end as well.\n\nThis implementation is a best guess approximating the observed pattern."
