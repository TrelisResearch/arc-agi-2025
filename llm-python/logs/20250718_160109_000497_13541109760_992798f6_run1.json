          "content": "Looking at the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve spreading or expanding a single value (like 2 or 1) into a pattern of 3s in a diagonal or expanding manner.\n2. In Example 1, the value 2 is expanded into a diagonal pattern of 3s starting from the position where the 2 is.\n3. In Example 2, the value 2 is expanded into a vertical pattern of 3s.\n4. In Example 3, the value 1 is expanded into a horizontal pattern of 3s.\n5. In Example 4, the value 2 is expanded into a diagonal pattern of 3s.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading a value (like 2 or 1) into a pattern of 3s in a diagonal or expanding manner, starting from the position of the value.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Find all positions with value 2 or 1\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid_np[i][j] in [1, 2]:\n                # Spread the value to a diagonal pattern of 3s\n                for k in range(1, 10):  # Spread up to 9 steps\n                    ni, nj = i - k, j - k\n                    if 0 <= ni < 13 and 0 <= nj < 12:\n                        transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 3\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid_np[i][j] in [1, 2]:\n                for k in range(1, 10):\n                    ni, nj = i - k, j - k\n                    if 0 <= ni < 13 and 0 <= nj < 12:\n                        transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",

In Example 1, the value 2 is expanded into a diagonal pattern of 3s starting from the position where the 2 is.\n3. In Example 2, the value 2 is expanded into a vertical pattern of 3s.\n4. In Example 3, the value 1 is expanded into a horizontal pattern of 3s.\n5. In Example 4, the value 2 is expanded into a diagonal pattern of 3s.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading a value (like 2 or 1) into a pattern of 3s in a diagonal or expanding manner, starting from the position of the value.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Find all positions with value 2 or 1\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid_np[i][j] in [1, 2]:\n                # Spread the value to a diagonal pattern of 3s\n                for k in range(1, 10):  # Spread up to 9 steps\n                    ni, nj = i - k, j - k\n                    if 0 <= ni < 13 and 0 <= nj < 12:\n                        transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 3\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid_np[i][j] in [1, 2]:\n                for k in range(1, 10):\n                    ni, nj = i - k, j - k\n                    if 0 <= ni < 13 and 0 <= nj < 12:\n                        transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
