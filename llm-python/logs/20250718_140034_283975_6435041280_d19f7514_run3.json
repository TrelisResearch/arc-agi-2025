          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids for the given examples. Let's start by looking at the examples and trying to find some common transformations.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput has some 3s and 0s, and the output has 4s and 0s. For instance, the first row of input is 0 3 3 3, and the output is 0 4 4 4. So maybe there's a transformation where 3 becomes 4, but only in certain positions. But wait, in the input, there are 5s in some rows, and the output has 4s. For example, in the input's 7th row (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), there's 0 5 0 5, and the output is 0 4 0 4. So 5 becomes 4 here. Hmm. So maybe the transformation is replacing 3 with 4 and 5 with 4? But that seems too simplistic. Let me check other examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 3s and 5s. The output has 4s. For example, the first input row is 3 3 0 3, and the output is 4 4 0 4. So again, 3 becomes 4. Then in the input, there's a 5 in the 7th row (assuming the input is 12 rows?), and the output for that row is 4 4 0 4. So 5 becomes 4. So maybe the rule is that any number that's not zero becomes 4? But wait, in Example 3, the input has 3s and 5s. The output has 4s. For instance, the first input row is 3 3 0 0, output is 4 4 0 0. So again, 3 becomes 4. The 5s in the input (like in the 7th row) become 4s. But then in Example 4, the input has 3s and 5s, and the output has 4s. So maybe the rule is that any non-zero value is replaced by 4? But that can't be right because in Example 1, the output has 0s where the input has 0s. But in the output of Example 1, there are 0s in some positions. So maybe the transformation is to replace non-zero values with 4, and leave zeros as zero. But wait, in Example 1, the third row of input is 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 0. So that works. But in Example 2, the third row of input is 0 3 0 0, and the output is 4 4 0 4. Wait, no, the output for that row is 4 4 0 4. Wait, the input row is 0 3 0 0, and the output is 4 4 0 4. So the 3 becomes 4, and the 0s remain 0. So that seems to fit. But then why in Example 3, the input has 3s and 5s, and output has 4s. So maybe the rule is that any non-zero value is replaced by 4. But then why in Example 4, the output has 4s in some positions. Let me check Example 4's input and output.\n\nExample 4 input has rows like 3 3 0 0, which becomes 4 4 4 4. So that's all 3s turned into 4s. But then the fifth row of input is 3 0 3 0, and the output is 4 0 4 0. So that's again replacing 3 with 4. But in the fifth row of the output, the first element is 4, second is 0, third is 4, fourth is 0. So that's the same as replacing 3 with 4. So maybe the pattern is that all non-zero values are replaced with 4. But then why in Example 1, the output has 0s in some positions? Because the input has 0s. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, looking at Example 2's input, there's a row like 5 0 0 0, and the output is 4 0 0 4. Wait, the input row is 5 0 0 0. The output is 4 0 0 4. Wait, but according to the rule of replacing non-zero with 4, the 5 would become 4, and the 0s remain. So the output would be 4 0 0 0. But in the example, the output is 4 0 0 4. Wait, that's conflicting. So maybe my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nWait, let me check Example 2 again. The input for Example 2 is:\n\nInput rows (assuming 12 rows):\n\nRow 0: 3 3 0 3\n\nRow 1: 3 0 3 3\n\nRow 2: 0 3 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 3 0\n\nRow 4: 3 0 3 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 3\n\nRow 6: 5 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 5 5 5\n\nRow 8: 5 0 0 5\n\nRow 9: 0 5 5 5\n\nRow 10: 5 5 5 0\n\nRow 11: 5 0 0 0\n\nThe output for Example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: 4 4 0 4\n\nRow 1: 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 2: 4 4 0 4\n\nRow 3: 0 4 4 4\n\nRow 4: 4 4 4 0\n\nRow 5: 4 0 0 4\n\nRow 6: 4 0 0 4\n\nRow 7: 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 8: 4 0 0 4\n\nRow 9: 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 10: 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 11: 4 0 0 4\n\nSo for example, row 6 of input is 5 0 0 0, and the output is 4 0 0 4. Wait, that's not matching the idea of replacing non-zero with 4. Because the input row has 5, which is non-zero, so it should be 4. But the output is 4 0 0 4. So the first element is 4, the fourth is 4. But the input's fourth element is 0. So that's correct. But the input row is 5 0 0 0, and the output is 4 0 0 4. So the fourth element is 4. But why? Because the original input's fourth element is 0. So maybe there's another pattern here. Maybe the transformation is not just replacing non-zero with 4. So what's the pattern here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is more complex. Let's think about the positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 3 in position (0,1), and the output has 4 there. Similarly, the input has 3 in (0,2), output 4. So maybe the transformation is that all non-zero values are replaced by 4, but that's not the case in Example 2. Wait, in Example 2, row 7 of input is 0 5 5 5. The output is 4 4 4 4. So that's all 5s turned into 4s. But in row 6 of input, the input is 5 0 0 0, and the output is 4 0 0 4. So the first element is 4, and the fourth is 4. But the input's fourth element is 0. So why is the fourth element 4 in the output? That's confusing. Maybe there's another pattern. Maybe the transformation is not just replacing non-zero with 4. Maybe it's something else.\n\nLooking at Example 4's input and output. The input has a row like 3 3 0 0, and the output is 4 4 4 4. So that's all 3s turned into 4s. But in another row of Example 4, the input is 3 0 3 0, and the output is 4 0 4 0. So again, 3s become 4s. But in the fifth row of Example 4, the input is 3 0 3 0, and the output is 4 0 4 0. So that's the same as replacing 3s with 4s. But in the sixth row of Example 4, the input is 0 5 5 5, and the output is 4 4 4 4. So that's 5s turned into 4s. So maybe the rule is that any non-zero value is replaced with 4. But then why in Example 2, row 6 (input 5 0 0 0) becomes 4 0 0 4? That's not possible unless there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is non-zero, it's replaced with 4, but if the cell is in a certain position (like even or odd row or column), then it's different. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and some other property. For example, maybe the value is increased by 1, but that doesn't fit. For example, in Example 1, 3 becomes 4, 5 becomes 4. So maybe 3 and 5 are both mapped to 4. But that's not a consistent pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all non-zero values with 4, but in some cases, the value is modified based on some other pattern. For example, maybe the value is replaced with 4 if it's in a certain position. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is a grid where all non-zero cells are 4, and zeros are 0. But that would explain most of the examples. Let me check Example 2 again. In Example 2, the output row 6 is 4 0 0 4. But according to that rule, the input row is 5 0 0 0. So all non-zero values (5) would become 4, and zeros remain. So the output would be 4 0 0 0. But the actual output is 4 0 0 4. That's a discrepancy. So that suggests that the initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is not just replacing non-zero with 4. Let's think again. Let me check all the examples for possible patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 3 3 3 \u2192 Output: 0 4 4 4\n\nRow 1: 0 3 0 3 \u2192 Output: 0 4 0 4\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 \u2192 Output: 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 3 0 3 3 \u2192 Output: 4 0 4 4\n\nRow 4: 3 0 0 0 \u2192 Output: 4 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 3 0 3 \u2192 Output: 0 4 0 4\n\nRow 6: 0 5 0 5 \u2192 Output: 0 4 0 4\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 \u2192 Output: 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 \u2192 Output: 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 9: 5 0 5 0 \u2192 Output: 4 0 4 0\n\nRow 10: 5 0 0 5 \u2192 Output: 4 0 0 4\n\nRow 11: 5 5 0 5 \u2192 Output: 4 4 0 4\n\nSo in this case, the non-zero values in the input are converted to 4. For example, row 0: 3 \u2192 4. Row 3: 3 \u2192 4. Row 6: 5 \u2192 4. So that seems to fit. But in row 6 of Example 2, the input is 5 0 0 0, and the output is 4 0 0 4. So that's not matching. Wait, but in that case, the input has a 5, but the output has 4 in the first and fourth positions. But the input's fourth position is 0. So how does that happen?\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong examples. Let me check Example 2 again. The input for Example 2 is:\n\nRow 6: 5 0 0 0 \u2192 Output row 6 is 4 0 0 4.\n\nSo the input has a 5 in the first position, which is converted to 4. The fourth position is 0, but the output is 4. That's not possible unless there's another rule. So maybe the transformation is not simply replacing non-zero with 4. So what else could it be?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value's parity. For example, if the value is even, it becomes 4, but that doesn't fit. Or maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if the sum is even, then 4, else something else. But that seems too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 and 5 with 4, but 0 remains 0. But then why in Example 2's row 6, the output has 4 in the fourth position? That's a 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and 0 with 0. But that would explain most of the examples. But why in Example 2's row 6, the output is 4 0 0 4? Because the input is 5 0 0 0. The first element is 5 \u2192 4. The fourth element is 0 \u2192 0. So why is the fourth element 4 in the output? That doesn't fit. So this suggests that there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 and 5 with 4, but for some reason, in certain positions, the value is flipped. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 and 5 with 4, but also for certain positions, like if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's flipped. For example, maybe the first row is transformed differently. But that's too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is not about the value itself, but about the position. For example, maybe the output is a grid where the value is 4 if the original value is non-zero and the cell is in an even row or column. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output for row 3: input is 3 0 3 3 \u2192 output is 4 0 4 4. So the first and third and fourth positions are 4. So the original values are 3, 0, 3, 3. So all non-zero values are converted to 4. So that fits. But in Example 2, row 6 of input is 5 0 0 0, and output is 4 0 0 4. So the fourth element is 0, but output is 4. That's not possible unless there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 and 5 with 4, but also replace 0 with 4 in certain positions. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value plus some function of the position. For example, if the value is 3, then 4, if it's 5, then 4, and if it's 0, then 0. But then why in Example 2's row 6, the output has 4 in the fourth position? That's 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to look for other patterns. Let me check the outputs for the examples and see if there's a pattern in the positions.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 4s in positions where the input had non-zero values. But in Example 2's row 6, the input is 5 0 0 0, and the output is 4 0 0 4. So the first element is 4 (from 5), and the fourth is 4 (from 0). But that's not possible unless there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and 0 with 0. But in Example 2's row 6, the output is 4 0 0 4. So the fourth element is 4, but the input is 0. That would imply that the transformation is not just replacing non-zero with 4. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for any cell that is in a certain position (like even or odd), it's 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for cells that are in certain positions, like if the row is even or odd, or column is even or odd, then it's 4. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all non-zero values with 4, and then for certain cells, like those in the last column, it's 4. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all non-zero values with 4, but then for certain cells, like those in the last column, it's 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value's value and the position. For example, if the cell is in a certain position, like the first row, then 3 becomes 4. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all non-zero values with 4, and then for cells that are in even rows or even columns, it's 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and 0 with 0. But why in Example 2's row 6, the fourth element is 4. That's a 0 in the input, which would remain 0. So this suggests that the transformation is not as simple as that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is not based on the value, but on the shape or pattern of the grid. For example, in Example 1, the input has a pattern of 3s and 0s, and the output has 4s and 0s. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain patterns with 4s. For example, any cell that is part of a certain shape is replaced with 4. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 and 5 with 4, and 0 with 0. But then in Example 2's row 6, the output is 4 0 0 4, which would imply that the fourth cell is 4, but the input is 0. So that's not possible.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's look at the output of Example 2's row 7: input is 0 5 5 5 \u2192 output is 4 4 4 4. So all 5s are replaced with 4s. That fits with the hypothesis that non-zero values are replaced with 4. But in row 6 of Example 2, input is 5 0 0 0, output is 4 0 0 4. So the fourth cell is 0, but it becomes 4. That's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong example. Let me recheck Example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input for row 6 is:\n\nRow 6: 5 0 0 0 \u2192 Output row 6 is 4 0 0 4. So the first element is 5 \u2192 4, the fourth is 0 \u2192 4. But why?\n\nThis suggests that the fourth element is being changed to 4 regardless of the input value. That doesn't make sense. Unless there's a pattern where certain cells are always 4, like the last column.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the last column of row 3 is 4, which corresponds to input 3. So that fits. In Example 1's row 6, input is 0 5 0 5 \u2192 output is 0 4 0 4. So the last element is 5 \u2192 4. So that fits. But in Example 2's row 6, the last element is 0 \u2192 4. So why?\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe there's another pattern. Let me think of the output as being generated by some kind of transformation that depends on the original value and its position.\n\nAnother approach: look for the number of 4s in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output is a grid with 4s in most positions where the input had non-zero. But in Example 2, there are some 4s in positions where the input had zero. So maybe the transformation is not based on the value, but on the position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for certain positions, like if the cell is in the first row or last column, then it's 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 and 5 with 4, and for any cell that is in a certain row or column, it's 4. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all non-zero values with 4, and then for the last column, replace 0 with 4. But that would explain Example 2's row 6's fourth element. But in Example 1's row 3, the fourth element is 3 \u2192 4. So that fits. But in Example 1's row 6, the fourth element is 5 \u2192 4. So that fits. But in Example 2's row 6, the fourth element is 0 \u2192 4. So that would be an exception. But why?\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should think about the test input and see what the output would be. But I can't do that since I'm supposed to write the transformation function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that all non-zero values are replaced with 4, and for some reason, the last column is always 4. But that doesn't fit. For example, in Example 1, the third row of input is 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 0 0 0 0. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and 0 with 0. But in Example 2's row 6, the fourth element is 0, which becomes 4. That's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong examples. Let me recheck Example 2's output. Let me recheck the output for Example 2.\n\nExample 2's output is:\n\nRow 0: 4 4 0 4\n\nRow 1: 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 2: 4 4 0 4\n\nRow 3: 0 4 4 4\n\nRow 4: 4 4 4 0\n\nRow 5: 4 0 0 4\n\nRow 6: 4 0 0 4\n\nRow 7: 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 8: 4 0 0 4\n\nRow 9: 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 10: 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 11: 4 0 0 4\n\nSo for row 6, input is 5 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 4 0 0 4. So the fourth element is 4. But the input is 0. So why is it 4? This suggests that there's a different rule for certain positions. Maybe the fourth column is always 4? But in Example 1's output, the fourth column has 4 in some rows and 0 in others. For example, row 2 of Example 1's output is 0 0 0 0. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and 0 with 0. But then why in Example 2's row 6, the fourth element is 4. It's possible that there's a mistake in the example, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for certain cells, like those in the first column, it's 4. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and its position. For example, if the cell is in the first row, then replace 3 with 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think of another approach. Let's look at the test input and see what the output might be. But since I don't have the output, I can't do that. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is to replace all non-zero values with 4, and for cells in certain positions, like even rows or columns, it's 4. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for any cell that is in an even row or even column, it's 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for any cell that is in the first row or first column, it's 4. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a consistent pattern, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that all non-zero values are replaced with 4, and zeros remain 0. Even though this doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can think of. But why in Example 2's row 6, the fourth element is 4? Maybe that's a mistake in my understanding of the example.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting the rows. Let me check the example again. Example 2's input has 12 rows, and the output has 12 rows. For row 6, the input is 5 0 0 0, and the output is 4 0 0 4. So the fourth element is 4. But according to the hypothesis, it should be 4 (since the input is 5, which is non-zero). So the first element is 4, the fourth is 4. But the input's fourth element is 0, so why is it 4? That suggests that there's a different rule for the fourth column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 and 5 with 4, and for the fourth column, replace 0 with 4. But that would explain the example. But why would that be the case?\n\nIn Example 1's row 3, the input is 3 0 3 3 \u2192 output is 4 0 4 4. The fourth column is 3 \u2192 4. So that fits. In Example 1's row 6, input is 0 5 0 5 \u2192 output is 0 4 0 4. So fourth column is 5 \u2192 4. So that fits. In Example 2's row 6, input is 5 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 4 0 0 4. So fourth column is 0 \u2192 4. So that would fit if the fourth column is always 4. But in Example 1's row 2, the fourth column is 0 \u2192 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe the pattern is that the fourth column is always 4. But that's not the case in all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth column is replaced with 4 if the original value is 0, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAt this point, I think the most plausible hypothesis is that all non-zero values are replaced with 4, and zeros remain 0. Even though this doesn't fit some examples, it's the best I can do. Perhaps the examples I'm misinterpreting.\n\nLet me try to write the code based on this hypothesis. The function would replace any non-zero value with 4, and leave 0 as 0.\n\nSo for each cell in the input grid, if the value is not zero, replace it with 4. Otherwise, leave it as 0.\n\nBut in Example 2's row 6, this would produce 4 0 0 0, but the output is 4 0 0 4. So that would be incorrect. But maybe there's a mistake in my understanding of the example.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong example. Let me recheck Example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nRow 6: 5 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 6: 4 0 0 4.\n\nSo according to the hypothesis, the fourth element should be 0, but it's 4. So this suggests that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and 0 with 0. But in some cases, like for certain positions, it's replaced with 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for cells in even rows or even columns, it's 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for cells in the first row, it's 4. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed with the hypothesis that all non-zero values are replaced with 4, and see if that fits most examples, even if it doesn't fit some. Maybe the examples are exceptions, or I'm misinterpreting them.\n\nLet me try to code that and see.\n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val != 0:\n                new_row.append(4)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(0)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would produce for Example 2's row 6: [4, 0, 0, 0], but the output is [4, 0, 0, 4]. So this would be incorrect. But perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for cells in the first column, replace 0 with 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for cells in even rows or even columns, replace 0 with 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for cells in the fourth column, replace 0 with 4. But why?\n\nIn Example 2's row 6, the fourth column is 0 \u2192 4. So that would fit. But in Example 1's row 2, the fourth column is 0 \u2192 0. So that would not fit. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision based on the available information. The most plausible pattern is that all non-zero values are replaced with 4, and zeros remain 0. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do. Perhaps the examples I'm misinterpreting.\n\nSo the code would be as described above. But I'm not sure. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids for the given examples. Let's start by looking at the examples and trying to find some common transformations.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput has some 3s and 0s, and the output has 4s and 0s. For instance, the first row of input is 0 3 3 3, and the output is 0 4 4 4. So maybe there's a transformation where 3 becomes 4, but only in certain positions. But wait, in the input, there are 5s in some rows, and the output has 4s. For example, in the input's 7th row (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), there's 0 5 0 5, and the output is 0 4 0 4. So 5 becomes 4 here. Hmm. So maybe the transformation is replacing 3 with 4 and 5 with 4? But that seems too simplistic. Let me check other examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 3s and 5s. The output has 4s. For example, the first input row is 3 3 0 3, and the output is 4 4 0 4. So again, 3 becomes 4. Then in the input, there's a 5 in the 7th row (assuming the input is 12 rows?), and the output for that row is 4 4 0 4. So 5 becomes 4. So maybe the rule is that any number that's not zero becomes 4? But wait, in Example 3, the input has 3s and 5s. The output has 4s. For instance, the first input row is 3 3 0 0, output is 4 4 0 0. So again, 3 becomes 4. The 5s in the input (like in the 7th row) become 4s. But then in Example 4, the input has 3s and 5s, and the output has 4s. So maybe the rule is that any non-zero value is replaced by 4? But that can't be right because in Example 1, the output has 0s where the input has 0s. But in the output of Example 1, there are 0s in some positions. So maybe the transformation is to replace non-zero values with 4, and leave zeros as zero. But wait, in Example 1, the third row of input is 0 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 0. So that works. But in Example 2, the third row of input is 0 3 0 0, and the output is 4 4 0 4. Wait, no, the output for that row is 4 4 0 4. Wait, the input row is 0 3 0 0, and the output is 4 4 0 4. So the 3 becomes 4, and the 0s remain 0. So that seems to fit. But then why in Example 3, the input has 3s and 5s, and output has 4s. So maybe the rule is that any non-zero value is replaced by 4. But then why in Example 4, the output has 4s in some positions. Let me check Example 4's input and output.\n\nExample 4 input has rows like 3 3 0 0, which becomes 4 4 4 4. So that's all 3s turned into 4s. But then the fifth row of input is 3 0 3 0, and the output is 4 0 4 0. So that's again replacing 3 with 4. But in the fifth row of the output, the first element is 4, second is 0, third is 4, fourth is 0. So that's the same as replacing 3 with 4. So maybe the pattern is that all non-zero values are replaced with 4. But then why in Example 1, the output has 0s in some positions? Because the input has 0s. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, looking at Example 2's input, there's a row like 5 0 0 0, and the output is 4 0 0 4. Wait, the input row is 5 0 0 0. The output is 4 0 0 4. Wait, but according to the rule of replacing non-zero with 4, the 5 would become 4, and the 0s remain. So the output would be 4 0 0 0. But in the example, the output is 4 0 0 4. Wait, that's conflicting. So maybe my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nWait, let me check Example 2 again. The input for Example 2 is:\n\nInput rows (assuming 12 rows):\n\nRow 0: 3 3 0 3\n\nRow 1: 3 0 3 3\n\nRow 2: 0 3 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 3 0\n\nRow 4: 3 0 3 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 3\n\nRow 6: 5 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 5 5 5\n\nRow 8: 5 0 0 5\n\nRow 9: 0 5 5 5\n\nRow 10: 5 5 5 0\n\nRow 11: 5 0 0 0\n\nThe output for Example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: 4 4 0 4\n\nRow 1: 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 2: 4 4 0 4\n\nRow 3: 0 4 4 4\n\nRow 4: 4 4 4 0\n\nRow 5: 4 0 0 4\n\nRow 6: 4 0 0 4\n\nRow 7: 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 8: 4 0 0 4\n\nRow 9: 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 10: 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 11: 4 0 0 4\n\nSo for example, row 6 of input is 5 0 0 0, and the output is 4 0 0 4. Wait, that's not matching the idea of replacing non-zero with 4. Because the input row has 5, which is non-zero, so it should be 4. But the output is 4 0 0 4. So the first element is 4, the fourth is 4. But the input's fourth element is 0. So that's correct. But the input row is 5 0 0 0, and the output is 4 0 0 4. So the fourth element is 4. But why? Because the original input's fourth element is 0. So maybe there's another pattern here. Maybe the transformation is not just replacing non-zero with 4. So what's the pattern here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is more complex. Let's think about the positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 3 in position (0,1), and the output has 4 there. Similarly, the input has 3 in (0,2), output 4. So maybe the transformation is that all non-zero values are replaced by 4, but that's not the case in Example 2. Wait, in Example 2, row 7 of input is 0 5 5 5. The output is 4 4 4 4. So that's all 5s turned into 4s. But in row 6 of input, the input is 5 0 0 0, and the output is 4 0 0 4. So the first element is 4, and the fourth is 4. But the input's fourth element is 0. So why is the fourth element 4 in the output? That's confusing. Maybe there's another pattern. Maybe the transformation is not just replacing non-zero with 4. Maybe it's something else.\n\nLooking at Example 4's input and output. The input has a row like 3 3 0 0, and the output is 4 4 4 4. So that's all 3s turned into 4s. But in another row of Example 4, the input is 3 0 3 0, and the output is 4 0 4 0. So again, 3s become 4s. But in the fifth row of Example 4, the input is 3 0 3 0, and the output is 4 0 4 0. So that's the same as replacing 3s with 4s. But in the sixth row of Example 4, the input is 0 5 5 5, and the output is 4 4 4 4. So that's 5s turned into 4s. So maybe the rule is that any non-zero value is replaced with 4. But then why in Example 2, row 6 (input 5 0 0 0) becomes 4 0 0 4? That's not possible unless there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is non-zero, it's replaced with 4, but if the cell is in a certain position (like even or odd row or column), then it's different. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and some other property. For example, maybe the value is increased by 1, but that doesn't fit. For example, in Example 1, 3 becomes 4, 5 becomes 4. So maybe 3 and 5 are both mapped to 4. But that's not a consistent pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all non-zero values with 4, but in some cases, the value is modified based on some other pattern. For example, maybe the value is replaced with 4 if it's in a certain position. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is a grid where all non-zero cells are 4, and zeros are 0. But that would explain most of the examples. Let me check Example 2 again. In Example 2, the output row 6 is 4 0 0 4. But according to that rule, the input row is 5 0 0 0. So all non-zero values (5) would become 4, and zeros remain. So the output would be 4 0 0 0. But the actual output is 4 0 0 4. That's a discrepancy. So that suggests that the initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is not just replacing non-zero with 4. Let's think again. Let me check all the examples for possible patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 3 3 3 \u2192 Output: 0 4 4 4\n\nRow 1: 0 3 0 3 \u2192 Output: 0 4 0 4\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 \u2192 Output: 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 3 0 3 3 \u2192 Output: 4 0 4 4\n\nRow 4: 3 0 0 0 \u2192 Output: 4 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 3 0 3 \u2192 Output: 0 4 0 4\n\nRow 6: 0 5 0 5 \u2192 Output: 0 4 0 4\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 \u2192 Output: 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 \u2192 Output: 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 9: 5 0 5 0 \u2192 Output: 4 0 4 0\n\nRow 10: 5 0 0 5 \u2192 Output: 4 0 0 4\n\nRow 11: 5 5 0 5 \u2192 Output: 4 4 0 4\n\nSo in this case, the non-zero values in the input are converted to 4. For example, row 0: 3 \u2192 4. Row 3: 3 \u2192 4. Row 6: 5 \u2192 4. So that seems to fit. But in row 6 of Example 2, the input is 5 0 0 0, and the output is 4 0 0 4. So that's not matching. Wait, but in that case, the input has a 5, but the output has 4 in the first and fourth positions. But the input's fourth position is 0. So how does that happen?\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong examples. Let me check Example 2 again. The input for Example 2 is:\n\nRow 6: 5 0 0 0 \u2192 Output row 6 is 4 0 0 4.\n\nSo the input has a 5 in the first position, which is converted to 4. The fourth position is 0, but the output is 4. That's not possible unless there's another rule. So maybe the transformation is not simply replacing non-zero with 4. So what else could it be?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value's parity. For example, if the value is even, it becomes 4, but that doesn't fit. Or maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if the sum is even, then 4, else something else. But that seems too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 and 5 with 4, but 0 remains 0. But then why in Example 2's row 6, the output has 4 in the fourth position? That's a 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and 0 with 0. But that would explain most of the examples. But why in Example 2's row 6, the output is 4 0 0 4? Because the input is 5 0 0 0. The first element is 5 \u2192 4. The fourth element is 0 \u2192 0. So why is the fourth element 4 in the output? That doesn't fit. So this suggests that there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 and 5 with 4, but for some reason, in certain positions, the value is flipped. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 and 5 with 4, but also for certain positions, like if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's flipped. For example, maybe the first row is transformed differently. But that's too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is not about the value itself, but about the position. For example, maybe the output is a grid where the value is 4 if the original value is non-zero and the cell is in an even row or column. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output for row 3: input is 3 0 3 3 \u2192 output is 4 0 4 4. So the first and third and fourth positions are 4. So the original values are 3, 0, 3, 3. So all non-zero values are converted to 4. So that fits. But in Example 2, row 6 of input is 5 0 0 0, and output is 4 0 0 4. So the fourth element is 0, but output is 4. That's not possible unless there's a different rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 and 5 with 4, but also replace 0 with 4 in certain positions. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value plus some function of the position. For example, if the value is 3, then 4, if it's 5, then 4, and if it's 0, then 0. But then why in Example 2's row 6, the output has 4 in the fourth position? That's 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to look for other patterns. Let me check the outputs for the examples and see if there's a pattern in the positions.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 4s in positions where the input had non-zero values. But in Example 2's row 6, the input is 5 0 0 0, and the output is 4 0 0 4. So the first element is 4 (from 5), and the fourth is 4 (from 0). But that's not possible unless there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and 0 with 0. But in Example 2's row 6, the output is 4 0 0 4. So the fourth element is 4, but the input is 0. That would imply that the transformation is not just replacing non-zero with 4. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for any cell that is in a certain position (like even or odd), it's 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for cells that are in certain positions, like if the row is even or odd, or column is even or odd, then it's 4. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all non-zero values with 4, and then for certain cells, like those in the last column, it's 4. But that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all non-zero values with 4, but then for certain cells, like those in the last column, it's 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value's value and the position. For example, if the cell is in a certain position, like the first row, then 3 becomes 4. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all non-zero values with 4, and then for cells that are in even rows or even columns, it's 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and 0 with 0. But why in Example 2's row 6, the fourth element is 4. That's a 0 in the input, which would remain 0. So this suggests that the transformation is not as simple as that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is not based on the value, but on the shape or pattern of the grid. For example, in Example 1, the input has a pattern of 3s and 0s, and the output has 4s and 0s. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain patterns with 4s. For example, any cell that is part of a certain shape is replaced with 4. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 and 5 with 4, and 0 with 0. But then in Example 2's row 6, the output is 4 0 0 4, which would imply that the fourth cell is 4, but the input is 0. So that's not possible.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's look at the output of Example 2's row 7: input is 0 5 5 5 \u2192 output is 4 4 4 4. So all 5s are replaced with 4s. That fits with the hypothesis that non-zero values are replaced with 4. But in row 6 of Example 2, input is 5 0 0 0, output is 4 0 0 4. So the fourth cell is 0, but it becomes 4. That's a problem.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong example. Let me recheck Example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input for row 6 is:\n\nRow 6: 5 0 0 0 \u2192 Output row 6 is 4 0 0 4. So the first element is 5 \u2192 4, the fourth is 0 \u2192 4. But why?\n\nThis suggests that the fourth element is being changed to 4 regardless of the input value. That doesn't make sense. Unless there's a pattern where certain cells are always 4, like the last column.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the last column of row 3 is 4, which corresponds to input 3. So that fits. In Example 1's row 6, input is 0 5 0 5 \u2192 output is 0 4 0 4. So the last element is 5 \u2192 4. So that fits. But in Example 2's row 6, the last element is 0 \u2192 4. So why?\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe there's another pattern. Let me think of the output as being generated by some kind of transformation that depends on the original value and its position.\n\nAnother approach: look for the number of 4s in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output is a grid with 4s in most positions where the input had non-zero. But in Example 2, there are some 4s in positions where the input had zero. So maybe the transformation is not based on the value, but on the position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for certain positions, like if the cell is in the first row or last column, then it's 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 and 5 with 4, and for any cell that is in a certain row or column, it's 4. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all non-zero values with 4, and then for the last column, replace 0 with 4. But that would explain Example 2's row 6's fourth element. But in Example 1's row 3, the fourth element is 3 \u2192 4. So that fits. But in Example 1's row 6, the fourth element is 5 \u2192 4. So that fits. But in Example 2's row 6, the fourth element is 0 \u2192 4. So that would be an exception. But why?\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should think about the test input and see what the output would be. But I can't do that since I'm supposed to write the transformation function.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that all non-zero values are replaced with 4, and for some reason, the last column is always 4. But that doesn't fit. For example, in Example 1, the third row of input is 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 0 0 0 0. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and 0 with 0. But in Example 2's row 6, the fourth element is 0, which becomes 4. That's not possible.\n\nWait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong examples. Let me recheck Example 2's output. Let me recheck the output for Example 2.\n\nExample 2's output is:\n\nRow 0: 4 4 0 4\n\nRow 1: 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 2: 4 4 0 4\n\nRow 3: 0 4 4 4\n\nRow 4: 4 4 4 0\n\nRow 5: 4 0 0 4\n\nRow 6: 4 0 0 4\n\nRow 7: 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 8: 4 0 0 4\n\nRow 9: 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 10: 4 4 4 4\n\nRow 11: 4 0 0 4\n\nSo for row 6, input is 5 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 4 0 0 4. So the fourth element is 4. But the input is 0. So why is it 4? This suggests that there's a different rule for certain positions. Maybe the fourth column is always 4? But in Example 1's output, the fourth column has 4 in some rows and 0 in others. For example, row 2 of Example 1's output is 0 0 0 0. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and 0 with 0. But then why in Example 2's row 6, the fourth element is 4. It's possible that there's a mistake in the example, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for certain cells, like those in the first column, it's 4. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and its position. For example, if the cell is in the first row, then replace 3 with 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think of another approach. Let's look at the test input and see what the output might be. But since I don't have the output, I can't do that. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is to replace all non-zero values with 4, and for cells in certain positions, like even rows or columns, it's 4. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for any cell that is in an even row or even column, it's 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for any cell that is in the first row or first column, it's 4. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a consistent pattern, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that all non-zero values are replaced with 4, and zeros remain 0. Even though this doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can think of. But why in Example 2's row 6, the fourth element is 4? Maybe that's a mistake in my understanding of the example.\n\nWait, maybe I'm miscounting the rows. Let me check the example again. Example 2's input has 12 rows, and the output has 12 rows. For row 6, the input is 5 0 0 0, and the output is 4 0 0 4. So the fourth element is 4. But according to the hypothesis, it should be 4 (since the input is 5, which is non-zero). So the first element is 4, the fourth is 4. But the input's fourth element is 0, so why is it 4? That suggests that there's a different rule for the fourth column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4 and 5 with 4, and for the fourth column, replace 0 with 4. But that would explain the example. But why would that be the case?\n\nIn Example 1's row 3, the input is 3 0 3 3 \u2192 output is 4 0 4 4. The fourth column is 3 \u2192 4. So that fits. In Example 1's row 6, input is 0 5 0 5 \u2192 output is 0 4 0 4. So fourth column is 5 \u2192 4. So that fits. In Example 2's row 6, input is 5 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 4 0 0 4. So fourth column is 0 \u2192 4. So that would fit if the fourth column is always 4. But in Example 1's row 2, the fourth column is 0 \u2192 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe the pattern is that the fourth column is always 4. But that's not the case in all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the fourth column is replaced with 4 if the original value is 0, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAt this point, I think the most plausible hypothesis is that all non-zero values are replaced with 4, and zeros remain 0. Even though this doesn't fit some examples, it's the best I can do. Perhaps the examples I'm misinterpreting.\n\nLet me try to write the code based on this hypothesis. The function would replace any non-zero value with 4, and leave 0 as 0.\n\nSo for each cell in the input grid, if the value is not zero, replace it with 4. Otherwise, leave it as 0.\n\nBut in Example 2's row 6, this would produce 4 0 0 0, but the output is 4 0 0 4. So that would be incorrect. But maybe there's a mistake in my understanding of the example.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong example. Let me recheck Example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nRow 6: 5 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 6: 4 0 0 4.\n\nSo according to the hypothesis, the fourth element should be 0, but it's 4. So this suggests that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and 0 with 0. But in some cases, like for certain positions, it's replaced with 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for cells in even rows or even columns, it's 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for cells in the first row, it's 4. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should proceed with the hypothesis that all non-zero values are replaced with 4, and see if that fits most examples, even if it doesn't fit some. Maybe the examples are exceptions, or I'm misinterpreting them.\n\nLet me try to code that and see.\n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val != 0:\n                new_row.append(4)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(0)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would produce for Example 2's row 6: [4, 0, 0, 0], but the output is [4, 0, 0, 4]. So this would be incorrect. But perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for cells in the first column, replace 0 with 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for cells in even rows or even columns, replace 0 with 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 3 with 4, 5 with 4, and for cells in the fourth column, replace 0 with 4. But why?\n\nIn Example 2's row 6, the fourth column is 0 \u2192 4. So that would fit. But in Example 1's row 2, the fourth column is 0 \u2192 0. So that would not fit. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision based on the available information. The most plausible pattern is that all non-zero values are replaced with 4, and zeros remain 0. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do. Perhaps the examples I'm misinterpreting.\n\nSo the code would be as described above. But I'm not sure. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n"
