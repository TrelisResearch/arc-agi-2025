The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with 9s in specific patterns\n2. The 9s seem to appear in diagonal or horizontal patterns\n3. The transformation appears to be more complex than simple value replacement\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with 9s in a pattern that seems to follow the examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Check if the cell is part of a pattern that should be replaced with 9\n            # This is a hypothesis based on the examples\n            if (i + j) % 3 == 0 and grid[i][j] != 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
