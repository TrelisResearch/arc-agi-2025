          "content": "Let's analyze the training examples to identify patterns that map input grids to output grids. \n\n### Observations:\n1. **Zeros and Non-Zero Values**:\n   - Zeros in the input grid often remain unchanged in the output grid.\n   - Non-zero values (1-9) are transformed in some way.\n\n2. **Transformation of Non-Zero Values**:\n   - In many examples, non-zero values are replaced by a new value or pattern.\n   - The transformation appears to be based on the value itself and its position in the grid.\n\n3. **Specific Examples**:\n   - Example 1: The value `3` appears in positions that seem to be part of a larger pattern.\n   - Example 2: The value `1` appears in positions that seem to be part of a larger pattern.\n   - Example 3: The value `6` appears in positions that seem to be part of a larger pattern.\n   - Example 4: The value `0` appears in positions that seem to be part of a larger pattern.\n   - Example 5: The value `2` appears in positions that seem to be part of a larger pattern.\n   - Example 6: The value `4` appears in positions that seem to be part of a larger pattern.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe transformation appears to be based on the value itself and its position in the grid. Specifically, non-zero values are replaced by a new value or pattern that seems to be related to the value and its position.\n\n### Implementation:\nGiven the observed patterns, we can implement a transformation that replaces non-zero values based on their value and position. Here's a possible implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [[0] * 10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            if value == 0:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif value == 1:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 1\n            elif value == 2:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n            elif value == 3:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 3\n            elif value == 4:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 4\n            elif value == 5:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 5\n            elif value == 6:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 6\n            elif value == 7:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 7\n            elif value == 8:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n            elif value == 9:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 9\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The function initializes a new 10x10 grid filled with zeros.\n- It then iterates through each cell in the input grid.\n- If the value is zero, it remains zero in the output grid.\n- For non-zero values, it simply copies the value to the corresponding cell in the output grid.\n\nThis transformation is a basic implementation based on the observed patterns. It may not perfectly capture the more complex transformations seen in some examples, but it provides a starting point.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [[0] * 10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            if value == 0:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif value == 1:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 1\n            elif value == 2:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n            elif value == 3:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 3\n            elif value == 4:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 4\n            elif value == 5:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 5\n            elif value == 6:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 6\n            elif value == 7:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 7\n            elif value == 8:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n            elif value == 9:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 9\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

Here are the observations:\n\n1. **Pattern in Example 1**:\n   - The numbers 3, 6, 9, and 0 appear in a specific pattern.\n   - The numbers 3 and 6 are replaced with 0, and 9 and 0 remain unchanged.\n   - The numbers 3, 6, and 9 are positioned in a repeating pattern.\n\n2. **Pattern in Example 2**:\n   - The number 1 is replaced with 0.\n   - The number 1 is positioned in a repeating pattern.\n\n3. **Pattern in Example 3**:\n   - The number 1 is replaced with 0.\n   - The number 1 is positioned in a repeating pattern.\n\n4. **Pattern in Example 4**:\n   - The number 1 is replaced with 0.\n   - The number 1 is positioned in a repeating pattern.\n\n5. **Pattern in Example 5**:\n   - The number 1 is replaced with 0.\n   - The number 1 is positioned in a repeating pattern.\n\n6. **Pattern in Example 6**:\n   - The number 3 is replaced with 0.\n   - The number 3 is positioned in a repeating pattern.\n\nFrom these observations, we can deduce that the transformation involves replacing specific numbers (3, 6, 9, 1) with 0 and leaving other numbers unchanged. The numbers to be replaced appear in a repeating pattern.\n\nLet's implement this pattern in a Python function:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]  # Create a copy of the input grid\n    \n    # Define the numbers to be replaced\n    numbers_to_replace = {3, 6, 9, 1}\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] in numbers_to_replace:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis function creates a copy of the input grid and then iterates through each cell. If the cell contains a number that needs to be replaced (3, 6, 9, or 1), it replaces it with 0. Otherwise, it leaves the cell unchanged.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]  # Create a copy of the input grid\n    \n    # Define the numbers to be replaced\n    numbers_to_replace = {3, 6, 9, 1}\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] in numbers_to_replace:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
