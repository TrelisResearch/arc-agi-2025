    "content": "Looking at the training examples, I need to analyze the patterns between input and output grids.\n\nLet me examine each example carefully:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:     Output:\n3 3 8      0 0 5\n3 7 0  \u2192   0 7 3\n5 0 0      8 3 3\n\nExample 2:\nInput:     Output:\n5 5 2      0 0 0\n1 0 0  \u2192   0 0 1\n0 0 0      2 5 5\n\nLet me look for patterns:\n\n1. **Position mapping analysis:**\n   - In Example 1: \n     - Input[0][0]=3 \u2192 Output[2][0]=8 (positions (0,0) \u2192 (2,0))\n     - Input[0][2]=8 \u2192 Output[2][0]=8 (positions (0,2) \u2192 (2,0))\n     - Input[2][0]=5 \u2192 Output[0][2]=8 (positions (2,0) \u2192 (0,2))\n   \n   Wait, let me be more systematic.\n\n2. **Let me check if it's a rotation or reflection:**\n   - Looking at Example 1 more carefully:\n     - The 8 moves from top-right to bottom-left\n     - The 5 moves from bottom-left to top-right\n     - The 7 stays in the middle\n     - The 3's seem to shift\n\n3. **Let me try a different approach - trace specific values:**\n   Example 1:\n   - Value 8: (0,2) \u2192 (2,0)\n   - Value 5: (2,0) \u2192 (0,2)\n   - Value 7: (1,1) \u2192 (1,1)\n   - Value 3: Multiple instances at (0,0), (0,1) \u2192 (2,1), (1,2)\n\n   This looks like some kind of transformation where positions are being mapped.\n\n4. **Let me check if it's a matrix transpose with some modifications:**\n   - Transpose would swap (i,j) with (j,i)\n   - But that's not exactly what's happening.\n\n5. **Let me look at the corner and center patterns:**\n   - Center (1,1) seems to stay in place in example 1\n   - Corners seem to be involved in some mapping\n   - In example 2, the 2 moves from (0,2) to (2,0)\n\n6. **Let me try to see a pattern in position mappings:**\n   Looking at both examples, it seems like there might be a rotational or reflective pattern combined with some filtering.\n\nLet me try to identify a clearer pattern:\n- It seems like there's a mapping of positions, possibly involving rotation or reflection\n- Non-zero values might be preserved in some transformed positions\n- Zero values fill the rest\n\nLet me look at this as a possible anti-diagonal reflection or rotation:\n\nIf I consider the transformation as flipping along the anti-diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):\n- Position (0,0) \u2194 (2,2)\n- Position (0,1) \u2194 (1,2) \n- Position (0,2) \u2194 (0,2) - wait no\n- Position (1,0) \u2194 (2,1)\n\nActually, let me check if it's a 180-degree rotation:\n- (0,0) \u2192 (2,2)\n- (0,1) \u2192 (2,1)\n- (0,2) \u2192 (2,0)\n- (1,0) \u2192 (1,2)\n- (1,1) \u2192 (1,1)\n- (1,2) \u2192 (1,0)\n- (2,0) \u2192 (0,2)\n- (2,1) \u2192 (0,1)\n- (2,2) \u2192 (0,0)\n\nLet me verify with Example 1:\nInput: [[3,3,8],[3,7,0],[5,0,0]]\nAfter 180-degree rotation: [[0,0,5],[0,7,3],[8,3,3]]\nThis matches the output exactly!\n\nLet me verify with Example 2:\nInput: [[5,5,2],[1,0,0],[0,0,0]]\nAfter 180-degree rotation: [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[2,5,5]]\nThis also matches exactly!\n\nPerfect! The pattern is a 180-degree rotation of the input grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # 180-degree rotation: reverse rows and reverse columns\n    # This is equivalent to grid[::-1] (reverse rows) then [row[::-1] for row in ...] (reverse each row)\n    return [row[::-1] for row in grid[::-1]]\n```",

In Example 1: The element at (2,0) which is 5 moves to (0,2)\n   - The element at (1,1) which is 7 stays at (1,1)\n   - The element at (0,2) which is 8 moves to (2,0)\n   - This looks like a transpose or reflection pattern.\n\n2. **Let me check if it's a matrix transpose (rows become columns):**\n   - Example 1 Input transposed would be:\n     ```\n     3 3 5\n     3 7 0\n     8 0 0\n     ```\n   - This is not matching the output.\n\n3. **Let me check anti-diagonal reflection (flip along the anti-diagonal):**\n   - For a 3x3 matrix, this would map (i,j) to (2-j, 2-i)\n   - Example 1:\n     - (0,0)\u2192(2,2): 3 \u2192 3 \u2713\n     - (0,1)\u2192(1,2): 3 \u2192 3 \u2713\n     - (0,2)\u2192(0,2): 8 \u2192 8 \u2713\n     - (1,0)\u2192(2,1): 3 \u2192 0 \u2717\n   \n   This doesn't quite work.\n\n4. **Let me check main diagonal reflection (transpose) followed by vertical flip:**\n   - Transpose then flip vertically:\n   - Example 1 Input:\n     ```\n     3 3 8\n     3 7 0\n     5 0 0\n     ```\n   - Transposed:\n     ```\n     3 3 5\n     3 7 0\n     8 0 0\n     ```\n   - Vertically flipped:\n     ```\n     8 0 0\n     3 7 0\n     3 3 5\n     ```\n   - This is not matching.\n\n5. **Let me try anti-diagonal reflection more carefully:**\n   - Mapping (i,j) to (2-j, 2-i)\n   - Example 1:\n     - (0,0)\u2192(2,2): 3 \u2192 3\n     - (0,1)\u2192(1,2): 3 \u2192 0\n     - (0,2)\u2192(0,2): 8 \u2192 8\n     - (1,0)\u2192(2,1): 3 \u2192 0\n     - (1,1)\u2192(1,1): 7 \u2192 7\n     - (1,2)\u2192(0,1): 0 \u2192 0\n     - (2,0)\u2192(2,0): 5 \u2192 5\n     - (2,1)\u2192(1,0): 0 \u2192 3\n     - (2,2)\u2192(0,0): 0 \u2192 0\n     \n   Result:\n   ```\n   0 0 8\n   0 7 3\n   5 3 3\n   ```\n   \n   Close but not exact.\n\n6. **Let me check horizontal flip followed by transpose:**\n   - Example 1 Input horizontally flipped:\n     ```\n     8 3 3\n     0 7 3\n     0 0 5\n     ```\n   - Then transpose:\n     ```\n     8 0 0\n     3 7 0\n     3 3 5\n     ```\n   - Not matching.\n\n7. **Let me check vertical flip followed by transpose:**\n   - Example 1 Input vertically flipped:\n     ```\n     5 0 0\n     3 7 0\n     3 3 8\n     ```\n   -

Then horizontally flipped:\n     ```\n     5 3 3\n     0 7 3\n     0 0 8\n     ```\n   - This looks very close to the output:\n     ```\n     0 0 5\n     0 7 3\n     8 3 3\n     ```\n     \n   Let me double-check:\n   - My result: \n     ```\n     5 3 3\n     0 7 3\n     0 0 8\n     ```\n   - Expected:\n     ```\n     0 0 5\n     0 7 3\n     8 3 3\n     ```\n\n9. **Let me try transpose then anti-diagonal reflection:**\n   - For anti-diagonal reflection of a 3x3 matrix, (i,j) \u2192 (2-j, 2-i)\n   - Example 1 Input transposed:\n     ```\n     3 3 5\n     3 7 0\n     8 0 0\n     ```\n   - Anti-diagonal reflection:\n     - (0,0)\u2192(2,2): 3 \u2192 0\n     - (0,1)\u2192(1,2): 3 \u2192 0\n     - (0,2)\u2192(0,2): 5 \u2192 5\n     - (1,0)\u2192(2,1): 3 \u2192 0\n     - (1,1)\u2192(1,1): 7 \u2192 7\n     - (1,2)\u2192(0,1): 0 \u2192 3\n     -

rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise:**\n    - For 90\u00b0 CCW rotation: (i,j) \u2192 (2-j, i)\n    - Example 1 Input:\n      ```\n      3 3 8\n      3 7 0\n      5 0 0\n      ```\n    - After 90\u00b0 CCW:\n      -

(2,0)\u2192(2,2): 5 \u2192 0\n      - (2,1)\u2192(1,2): 0 \u2192 0\n      - (2,2)\u2192(0,2): 0 \u2192 8\n      \n    Result:\n    ```\n    3 3 0\n    3 7 0\n    0 5 8\n    ```\n    Not matching.\n\n11. **Let me try 90 degrees clockwise:**\n    - For 90\u00b0 CW rotation: (i,j) \u2192 (j, 2-i)\n    - Example 1 Input:\n      ```\n      3 3 8\n      3 7 0\n      5 0 0\n      ```\n    - After 90\u00b0 CW:\n      - (0,0)\u2192(0,2): 3 \u2192 8\n      -

The pattern is a 180-degree rotation of the input grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # 180-degree rotation: reverse rows and reverse columns\n    # This is equivalent to grid[::-1] (reverse rows) then [row[::-1] for row in ...] (reverse each row)\n    return [row[::-1] for row in grid[::-1]]\n```",
