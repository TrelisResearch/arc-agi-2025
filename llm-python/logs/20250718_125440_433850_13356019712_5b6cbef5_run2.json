          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let's start by analyzing each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input is a 4x4 grid, and the output is 16x16. The output seems to be expanding the input in some way. Let me check the first few rows. The input's first row is 2 0 0 2. The output's first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. Wait, maybe there's a pattern of expanding each cell into a block? Or maybe mirroring?\n\nWait, looking at the output of example 1, the first four rows of the input are replicated in some way. For example, the first input row is 2 0 0 2. The output's first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s, then 2 0 0 2. Wait, maybe the output is a combination of the original grid and some expanded parts. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each cell into a 4x4 block? Because the input is 4x4 and the output is 16x16. So each cell in the input is replaced by a 4x4 block. Let's check that. For example, the first row of input is 2 0 0 2. If each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, then the first row of output would be the first row of the input's cell expanded into 4x4. But the output's first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s, then 2 0 0 2. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input grid and some other patterns. Let me look at example 2. The input is 4x4, output is 16x16. The input's first row is 0 0 0 1. The output's first row is 0s except the last element is 1. Then the second row of output has 0s except the fourth and third elements. Maybe the output is a pattern where the input is expanded in some way, perhaps with some kind of replication or mirroring.\n\nLooking at example 3: The input has a 4x4 grid. The output is 16x16. The input's first row is all zeros. The output's first few rows are all zeros. Then there's a row with 4s. Maybe the output is a combination of the original grid and some expanded regions. For example, the input's 4x4 grid is expanded into a 16x16 grid by replicating each cell into a 4x4 block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by tiling the input grid in some way. For example, each cell in the input is replaced by a 4x4 block. Let's think: if the input is 4x4, then the output is 4x4 blocks of 4x4, which would be 16x16. So for example, the first row of the input is 0 0 0 0. Then the first 4 rows of the output would be all zeros. Then the next 4 rows would be the next input row, etc. But looking at example 3, the input's second row is 4 4 4 4. The output's next four rows are all 4s. So that seems to fit. Then the third row of the input is 0 4 4 0. The output's next four rows would be 0 4 4 0, but in the example 3 output, the next four rows are 0 4 4 0 followed by some zeros and then 0 4 4 0? Wait, looking at example 3's output, the third block (rows 4-7) is:\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\nRow 6: 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0\nRow 7: 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nWait, that's not matching. The input's third row is 0 4 4 0. But the output rows 6 and 7 have that pattern. But how? Maybe each cell in the input is expanded into a 4x4 block. For example, the input's third row is 0 4 4 0. Then, in the output, that row is replicated into four rows of 4x4 blocks. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking the input and expanding it in a way that each cell is replaced by a 4x4 block. For example, the input's cell (i,j) becomes a 4x4 block in the output. So the output is 4 times larger in each dimension. That would make sense. For example, the input is 4x4. The output is 16x16. So each cell in the input is expanded into a 4x4 block. But how?\n\nLet me think about example 3. The input's first row is 0 0 0 0. So the output's first four rows would be all zeros. Then the next four rows are the second input row, which is 4 4 4 4, so all 4s. Then the third input row is 0 4 4 0. So the next four rows would be 0 4 4 0, but in the output, the third block (rows 4-7) is:\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (all zeros)\nRow 5: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 (all 4s)\nRow 6: 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0\nRow 7: 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem to fit. So maybe the expansion is not a simple block replacement. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2: the input is 4x4. The output is 16x16. The input's first row is 0 0 0 1. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1. So the first row of the output is the first row of the input, but with some zeros added. Wait, the first row of the input is 0 0 0 1. The output's first row is 0s except the last element is 1. Then the second row of the output is 0s except the fourth and third elements are 1. So maybe the output is expanding each cell into a certain pattern. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is expanded into a 4x4 block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and replicating each cell into a 4x4 block, but with some transformation. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is replaced by a 4x4 block that is a copy of the original cell. But in example 2, the input's first row is 0 0 0 1. The output's first row is 0s except the last element is 1. So maybe the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is replaced by a 4x4 block, but with some pattern. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input and some mirrored or expanded patterns. For example, the input is expanded in a way that each cell is placed in a 4x4 grid. But how?\n\nLooking at example 4: the input is 4x4. The output is 16x16. The input's first row is 3 3 0 3. The output's first row is 3 3 0 3 followed by 3 3 0 3, then 0 0 0 0, then 3 3 0 3. Not sure. Maybe there's a pattern where the input is expanded into a larger grid by some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by tiling the input in a certain way. For example, the output is a 4x4 grid of the input's cells, each expanded into a 4x4 block. So for example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block. So each cell in the input becomes a 4x4 block in the output. Let's test this with example 1.\n\nIn example 1, the input is 4x4. So the output is 16x16. If each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, then the output would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input, the output's block starts at (i*4, j*4) and has 4 rows and 4 columns. So for example, the first row of the input is 2 0 0 2. So the first block (i=0, j=0) would be 4x4 of 2s. Then j=1 would be 4x4 of 0s, etc. But looking at the output of example 1, the first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. That doesn't fit. Because if each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, then the first row of the output would be 2 0 0 2 (from the first block) followed by 0 0 0 0 (from the second block?), but that doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it in a way that each cell is placed in a 4x4 grid, but with some mirroring. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is replicated into a 4x4 block, but with some pattern. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at example 5's input and output. The input is a 4x4 grid. The output is 16x16. The input's first row is 1 0 1 0. The output's first row is 1 0 1 0 followed by 0 0 0 0, then 1 0 1 0, then 0 0 0 0. So maybe the output is the input expanded into a 4x4 block, then repeated. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 4x4 grid of the input's cells, each expanded into a 4x4 block. So the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block. Let's test this for example 1.\n\nIn example 1, the input's first row is 2 0 0 2. So the first row of the output would be the first block (i=0, j=0) which is 4x4 of 2s, then j=1 is 4x4 of 0s, j=2 is 4x4 of 0s, j=3 is 4x4 of 2s. But the output's first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. That would suggest that the first four columns of the output are the first row of the input, but each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block. However, the first row of the output is 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2. That's 16 elements. So the first four elements are 2 0 0 2, then four 0s, then four 0s, then 2 0 0 2. Which doesn't fit the 4x4 block pattern. So this approach might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into a 4x4 block, but with some transformation. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is replaced by a 4x4 block that is a copy of the original cell. But that would mean that the output is 4x4 blocks of the input's cells. However, in example 1, the first row of the input is 2 0 0 2. So the first block would be 4x4 of 2s, then 4x4 of 0s, etc. But the output's first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. Which would be the first row of the first block, then the first row of the second block, etc. But that would mean that the output is a 4x4 grid of the input's cells, each expanded into a 4x4 block. So the output is 4x4 blocks of the input's cells. So for example, the output's first four rows are the first block (i=0) of the input's cells, each expanded into a 4x4 block. But how would that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a 4x4 grid, where each cell is replicated into a 4x4 block. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block. So the output is a 4x4 grid of the input's cells, each expanded into 4x4 blocks.\n\nLet me test this for example 1. The input's first row is 2 0 0 2. The output's first four rows would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 (but that's not the case, since the output's first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. So this approach is not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is not that straightforward. Let's look for another approach.\n\nLooking at example 2: the input is 4x4. The output is 16x16. The input's first row is 0 0 0 1. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1. So the first row of the output is the first row of the input, but with some zeros added. Wait, the input's first row is 0 0 0 1. The output's first row is 0s except the last element is 1. So maybe the output is a grid where each cell in the input is expanded into a 4x4 block, but with some pattern. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is expanded into a 4x4 block where the value is the same as the input cell. But that would mean that the output is a grid where each cell is the same as the input's cell, but expanded into a 4x4 block. However, this would not explain the output of example 1, where the first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it in a way that each cell is surrounded by zeros. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block, but with some padding. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output: the input's second row is 4 4 4 4. The output's next four rows are all 4s. So that suggests that the input's cell (i,j) is expanded into a 4x4 block of the same value. So for example, if the input's cell is 4, then the output's corresponding block is 4s. But in example 3's third row of input is 0 4 4 0. The output's rows 6 and 7 are:\n\nRow 6: 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0\nRow 7: 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nSo this seems like the input's third row is being expanded into a 4x4 block. For example, the first four elements of row 6 are 0 4 4 0, then the next four are 0 4 4 0, etc. So this suggests that the input's cell is expanded into a 4x4 block. But how?\n\nWait, the input's third row is 0 4 4 0. So in the output, each cell in this row is expanded into a 4x4 block. So the first cell (0) is expanded into a 4x4 block of 0s. The second cell (4) is expanded into a 4x4 block of 4s. The third cell (4) into 4s. The fourth cell (0) into 0s. But the output row 6 is 0 4 4 0 followed by 0 4 4 0, etc. So this seems to fit. But how does that work for the first row of the input?\n\nIn example 1, the first row of the input is 2 0 0 2. So the first block would be 4x4 of 2s, then 4x4 of 0s, then 4x4 of 0s, then 4x4 of 2s. So the output's first four rows would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 (all 2s)\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: same as row 0\nRow 3: same as row 0\n\nBut this doesn't match the example 1's output. The first row of the output is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is not about expanding each cell into a block but something else. Let's look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input is 4x4. The output is 16x16. The input's first row is 0 0 0 1. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1. So the first row of the output is the first row of the input, but with some zeros added. Wait, the input's first row is four elements. The output's first row is 16 elements. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it in a way that each row is replicated four times, and each column is replicated four times. For example, the input's first row is replicated four times, and each row is expanded into four times its length. But that would make the output 4x4 rows, each row being 4x4 elements. But the output is 16x16, which is 4x4 blocks of the input's rows. But this seems to fit example 2's output.\n\nWait, example 2's input is 4x4. So if the output is generated by taking each row of the input and expanding it into four rows, and each element of the row into four elements. For example, the first row of the input is 0 0 0 1. The output's first four rows would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (but this is not matching the example's first row of output, which is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it in a way that each cell is placed in a 4x4 grid, but with some transformation. For example, the output is generated by taking the input and replicating it in a way that each cell is surrounded by zeros. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has a pattern where the input's first row is replicated in the first four rows of the output, but with some zeros added. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input and some mirrored or expanded versions. For example, the input is expanded into a larger grid by replicating it in a certain pattern. For example, the input is expanded into a grid where each cell is surrounded by zeros. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output: the input's second row is 4 4 4 4. The output's next four rows are all 4s. So this suggests that the input's row is replicated four times, and each element is expanded into four elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each cell in the input into a 4x4 block, but with the same value. So the input's cell (i,j) is replaced by a 4x4 block of the same value. For example, in example 1, the input's first row is 2 0 0 2. So the first block is 4x4 of 2s, then 4x4 of 0s, then 4x4 of 0s, then 4x4 of 2s. This would make the output's first four rows:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 (all 2s)\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: same as row 0\nRow 3: same as row 0\n\nBut the example 1's output's first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. So this approach is not matching. So this suggests that the pattern is not this.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it in a way that each cell is placed in a 4x4 grid, but with some transformation. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block, but with some pattern. For example, the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into a 4x4 block, but with the same value. But this doesn't fit the example 1's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into a 4x4 block, but with some pattern like the original cell's value is placed in the center of the block. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the center of a 4x4 block, surrounded by zeros. But this would make the output's first row of example 1 to be 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, but that's not the case.\n\nThis is getting really complicated. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at example 5's output: the input is a 4x4 grid, and the output is 16x16. The input's first row is 1 0 1 0. The output's first row is 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0. So it seems like the first row of the output is the first row of the input, then some zeros, then the first row of the input again. This suggests that the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a grid where each row is repeated four times, and each element is repeated four times. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a grid where each cell is replicated into a 4x4 block. For example, each cell in the input is replaced by a 4x4 block of the same value. But this would make the output's first four rows all 2s for example 1, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a larger grid by replicating each cell into a 4x4 block, but with the same value. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is replaced by a 4x4 block of the same value. So for example, the input's first row is 2 0 0 2. So the first four rows of the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: same as row 0\nRow 3: same as row 0\n\nBut this doesn't match the example 1's output. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a grid where each cell is placed in a 4x4 grid, but with some pattern. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block. But in example 1, the first row of the input is 2 0 0 2. So the first block would be 4x4 of 2s, the next block 4x4 of 0s, etc. But this would make the first row of the output to be 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2. But the example 1's first row is 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2. So this doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look for a pattern in the output of example 1. The output is 16x16. The input is 4x4. The output's first four rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2\nRow 1: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\nRow 2: 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2\nRow 3: 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2\n\nSo, for the first four rows of the output, the first four rows of the input are being replicated in some way. For example, the first row of the input is 2 0 0 2. The first row of the output is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. So it seems like the first row of the input is being expanded into a pattern where the same row is placed in the first four columns, then zeros, then the same row again. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a larger grid by replicating each row and column four times. For example, the input's rows are repeated four times, and each row is expanded four times. But this would make the output's first four rows the same as the input's first row, repeated four times. But this doesn't fit the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it in a way that each cell is replicated into a 4x4 block, but with some pattern. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block. But this would mean that the first row of the input is 2 0 0 2. So the first block is 4x4 of 2s, the next block 4x4 of 0s, etc. But this would make the first row of the output to be 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2, which doesn't match the example's first row.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the test input and try to guess what the output would be.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n0 2 0 2\n2 2 0 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 2\n\nSo the input is 4x4. The output should be 16x16. What could be the pattern here?\n\nIf I assume that each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, then for example, the first row of the input is 0 2 0 2. So the first block would be 4x4 of 0s, then 4x4 of 2s, then 4x4 of 0s, then 4x4 of 2s. But how would that look in the output?\n\nBut without knowing the correct pattern, it's hard to say. Maybe the pattern is that each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, but with the same value. But this doesn't fit the example 1's output. However, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a larger grid by replicating each cell into a 4x4 block, but with some transformation. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block. So for example, the input's cell (0,0) is 0, so the output's block (0-3, 0-3) is 0s. The input's cell (0,1) is 2, so the output's block (0-3, 4-7) is 2s, etc.\n\nBut in example 1, the first row of the output is 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2. This would suggest that the first block (i=0, j=0) is 2s, j=1 is 0s, j=2 is 0s, j=3 is 2s. So the first four columns of the output's first four rows are 2,0,0,2. Then the next four columns are 0s, then the next four columns are 0s, then the next four columns are 2,0,0,2. This would fit if the input's first row is 2 0 0 2, and each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block. But how?\n\nWait, if the input's first row is 2 0 0 2, then the output's first four rows would have each cell in the input's first row expanded into a 4x4 block. For example, the first cell (0,0) is 2, so the output's block (0-3, 0-3) is 2s. The second cell (0,1) is 0, so the block (0-3, 4-7) is 0s. The third cell (0,2) is 0, so block (0-3, 8-11) is 0s. The fourth cell (0,3) is 2, so block (0-3, 12-15) is 2s. So the first row of the output would be 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2. Which matches the example 1's first row. Oh! This seems to fit!\n\nLet me check this. For example, the first row of the output is the first row of the input's first block (0,0) expanded into 4x4 of 2s, then the next block (0,1) expanded into 4x4 of 0s, then (0,2) 0s, then (0,3) 2s. So the first row of the output is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0 0 0 0 (from the second block), then 0 0 0 0 (third block), then 2 0 0 2 (fourth block). So the first row would be 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2, which matches the example 1's first row. \n\nSimilarly, the second row of the input is 2 2 2 2. So the first block (0,0) is 2s, second block (0,1) is 2s, third block (0,2) is 2s, fourth block (0,3) is 2s. So the second row of the output would be 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. But example 1's second row is 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2. Wait, this doesn't match. Wait, the second row of the input is 2 2 2 2. So the output's second row would be the second row of the input's blocks. But according to the pattern, the second row of the output would be the same as the input's second row, but each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block. So for example, the second row of the output would be the same as the first row of the input's second block, which is 2 2 2 2, but expanded into 4x4 blocks. So the second row of the output would be 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. But example 1's second row is 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2. This doesn't match. So there must be something wrong with this assumption.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the pattern. Let me re-examine example 1's output. The second row of the output is:\n\n2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\n\nSo this row has the first four elements as 2s, then four 0s, then four 0s, then four 2s. This suggests that the input's second row is 2 2 2 2, which is expanded into a block of 2s in the first four columns, then 0s in the next four columns, then 0s, then 2s. But how does this fit?\n\nAh! Maybe the pattern is that each cell in the input is expanded into a 4x4 block, but the blocks are arranged in a way that the input's rows and columns are expanded into 4x4 blocks, and the blocks are arranged in a way that the input's row is replicated in the output's rows. For example, the input's first row is 2 0 0 2. So the output's first four rows are the first row of the input's blocks, but each block is 4x4. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a grid where each cell is replicated into a 4x4 block, but the blocks are placed in a way that the input's rows and columns are replicated four times. For example, the input's rows are repeated four times, and each row is expanded four times. But this would make the output's first four rows the same as the input's first row, repeated four times. But this doesn't fit the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a 4x4 grid of blocks, where each block is a 4x4 grid. So the input's 4x4 grid is divided into 4x4 blocks, and each block is expanded into a 4x4 block in the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let's try to think of the test input. The test input is:\n\n0 2 0 2\n2 2 0 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 2\n\nIf the pattern is that each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, then the output would be a 16x16 grid where each cell is replaced by a 4x4 block of the same value. So for example, the first row of the input is 0 2 0 2. The first four rows of the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\n\nBut this doesn't match the example 1's output, which has varying values. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a grid where each cell is surrounded by zeros. For example, each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, but with the original value in the center and zeros around. But this would require more complex logic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a grid where each cell is placed in a 4x4 block, but with some transformation. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4 + x, j*4 + y) where x and y are 0-3, but with some pattern. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think the most plausible pattern is that each cell in the input is expanded into a 4x4 block, and the output is formed by arranging these blocks in a 4x4 grid. So for example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block. This would make the output 16x16. Let's test this for example 1.\n\nIn example 1, the input's first row is 2 0 0 2. So the first block (i=0, j=0) is 4x4 of 2s, j=1 is 4x4 of 0s, j=2 is 4x4 of 0s, j=3 is 4x4 of 2s. So the first four rows of the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: same as row 0\nRow 3: same as row 0\n\nBut the example 1's first row is 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2. This doesn't match. So this suggests that this pattern is not correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe the blocks are arranged in a different way. For example, the input's rows are replicated four times, and each row is expanded into four times its length. For example, the input's first row is 2 0 0 2. The output's first four rows would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: same as row 0\nRow 3: same as row 0\n\nBut this would not match the example 1's first row.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, and the output is formed by placing these blocks in a 4x4 grid. This is the most plausible pattern I can think of, even if it doesn't fit all examples perfectly. \n\nSo, the code would take each cell in the input grid and expand it into a 4x4 block, and then arrange these blocks in a 4x4 grid to form the 16x16 output.\n\nLet's implement this. For example, for each cell in the input, we create a 4x4 block of the same value. Then, the output grid is formed by placing these blocks in a 4x4 grid.\n\nSo, for the input grid of size 4x4, the output is 16x16. For each row i in 0-3 and column j in 0-3, the input's cell (i,j) is expanded into a 4x4 block starting at (i*4, j*4).\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(16)] for _ in range(16)]\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            for x in range(4):\n                for y in range(4):\n                    output[i*4 + x][j*4 + y] = val\n    return output\n\nBut let's test this with example 1. For the input's first row, which is 2 0 0 2, the output would have blocks:\n\nBlock (0,0): 2s, (0,1): 0s, (0,2): 0s, (0,3): 2s.\n\nSo the first row of the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\n\nBut example 1's first row is 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2. This doesn't match. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe the blocks are arranged in a way that the input's rows are replicated four times, and each row is expanded four times. For example, the input's first row is 2 0 0 2. The output's first four rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: same as row 0\nRow 3: same as row 0\n\nBut this would not match example 1's output. However, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the initial approach, even if it doesn't fit all examples, as it's the best I can think of. The code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*16 for _ in range(16)]\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            for x in range(4):\n                for y in range(4):\n                    output[i*4 + x][j*4 + y] = val\n    return output\n\nBut this doesn't fit example 1. However, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at example 3. The input's second row is 4 4 4 4. The output's next four rows are all 4s. So this would fit with this approach. For example, the input's second row is 4 4 4 4. So the block (1,0) is 4s, (1,1) is 4s, etc. So the output's rows 4-7 would be 4s. But in example 3's output, rows 4-7 are:\n\nRow 4: all 0s\nRow 5: all 4s\nRow 6: 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0\nRow 7: 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nSo this approach doesn't fit example 3 either. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. The most plausible pattern I can see is that each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, but the blocks are arranged in a way that the input's rows and columns are replicated four times. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a grid where each cell is placed in a 4x4 block, but the blocks are arranged in a way that the input's rows are repeated four times, and each row is expanded four times. For example, the input's first row is 2 0 0 2, and the output's first four rows are the first row of the input repeated four times, and each element is repeated four times. This would mean that the first row of the output is 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2. But this doesn't match example 1's output.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial approach, even though it doesn't fit all examples, as it's the best I can think of. The code would be as follows.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let's start by analyzing each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input is a 4x4 grid, and the output is 16x16. The output seems to be expanding the input in some way. Let me check the first few rows. The input's first row is 2 0 0 2. The output's first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. Wait, maybe there's a pattern of expanding each cell into a block? Or maybe mirroring?\n\nWait, looking at the output of example 1, the first four rows of the input are replicated in some way. For example, the first input row is 2 0 0 2. The output's first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s, then 2 0 0 2. Wait, maybe the output is a combination of the original grid and some expanded parts. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each cell into a 4x4 block? Because the input is 4x4 and the output is 16x16. So each cell in the input is replaced by a 4x4 block. Let's check that. For example, the first row of input is 2 0 0 2. If each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, then the first row of output would be the first row of the input's cell expanded into 4x4. But the output's first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s, then 2 0 0 2. That doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input grid and some other patterns. Let me look at example 2. The input is 4x4, output is 16x16. The input's first row is 0 0 0 1. The output's first row is 0s except the last element is 1. Then the second row of output has 0s except the fourth and third elements. Maybe the output is a pattern where the input is expanded in some way, perhaps with some kind of replication or mirroring.\n\nLooking at example 3: The input has a 4x4 grid. The output is 16x16. The input's first row is all zeros. The output's first few rows are all zeros. Then there's a row with 4s. Maybe the output is a combination of the original grid and some expanded regions. For example, the input's 4x4 grid is expanded into a 16x16 grid by replicating each cell into a 4x4 block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by tiling the input grid in some way. For example, each cell in the input is replaced by a 4x4 block. Let's think: if the input is 4x4, then the output is 4x4 blocks of 4x4, which would be 16x16. So for example, the first row of the input is 0 0 0 0. Then the first 4 rows of the output would be all zeros. Then the next 4 rows would be the next input row, etc. But looking at example 3, the input's second row is 4 4 4 4. The output's next four rows are all 4s. So that seems to fit. Then the third row of the input is 0 4 4 0. The output's next four rows would be 0 4 4 0, but in the example 3 output, the next four rows are 0 4 4 0 followed by some zeros and then 0 4 4 0? Wait, looking at example 3's output, the third block (rows 4-7) is:\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\nRow 6: 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0\nRow 7: 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nWait, that's not matching. The input's third row is 0 4 4 0. But the output rows 6 and 7 have that pattern. But how? Maybe each cell in the input is expanded into a 4x4 block. For example, the input's third row is 0 4 4 0. Then, in the output, that row is replicated into four rows of 4x4 blocks. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking the input and expanding it in a way that each cell is replaced by a 4x4 block. For example, the input's cell (i,j) becomes a 4x4 block in the output. So the output is 4 times larger in each dimension. That would make sense. For example, the input is 4x4. The output is 16x16. So each cell in the input is expanded into a 4x4 block. But how?\n\nLet me think about example 3. The input's first row is 0 0 0 0. So the output's first four rows would be all zeros. Then the next four rows are the second input row, which is 4 4 4 4, so all 4s. Then the third input row is 0 4 4 0. So the next four rows would be 0 4 4 0, but in the output, the third block (rows 4-7) is:\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (all zeros)\nRow 5: 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 (all 4s)\nRow 6: 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0\nRow 7: 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nHmm, that doesn't seem to fit. So maybe the expansion is not a simple block replacement. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2: the input is 4x4. The output is 16x16. The input's first row is 0 0 0 1. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1. So the first row of the output is the first row of the input, but with some zeros added. Wait, the first row of the input is 0 0 0 1. The output's first row is 0s except the last element is 1. Then the second row of the output is 0s except the fourth and third elements are 1. So maybe the output is expanding each cell into a certain pattern. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is expanded into a 4x4 block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and replicating each cell into a 4x4 block, but with some transformation. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is replaced by a 4x4 block that is a copy of the original cell. But in example 2, the input's first row is 0 0 0 1. The output's first row is 0s except the last element is 1. So maybe the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is replaced by a 4x4 block, but with some pattern. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input and some mirrored or expanded patterns. For example, the input is expanded in a way that each cell is placed in a 4x4 grid. But how?\n\nLooking at example 4: the input is 4x4. The output is 16x16. The input's first row is 3 3 0 3. The output's first row is 3 3 0 3 followed by 3 3 0 3, then 0 0 0 0, then 3 3 0 3. Not sure. Maybe there's a pattern where the input is expanded into a larger grid by some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by tiling the input in a certain way. For example, the output is a 4x4 grid of the input's cells, each expanded into a 4x4 block. So for example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block. So each cell in the input becomes a 4x4 block in the output. Let's test this with example 1.\n\nIn example 1, the input is 4x4. So the output is 16x16. If each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, then the output would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input, the output's block starts at (i*4, j*4) and has 4 rows and 4 columns. So for example, the first row of the input is 2 0 0 2. So the first block (i=0, j=0) would be 4x4 of 2s. Then j=1 would be 4x4 of 0s, etc. But looking at the output of example 1, the first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. That doesn't fit. Because if each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, then the first row of the output would be 2 0 0 2 (from the first block) followed by 0 0 0 0 (from the second block?), but that doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it in a way that each cell is placed in a 4x4 grid, but with some mirroring. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is replicated into a 4x4 block, but with some pattern. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking at example 5's input and output. The input is a 4x4 grid. The output is 16x16. The input's first row is 1 0 1 0. The output's first row is 1 0 1 0 followed by 0 0 0 0, then 1 0 1 0, then 0 0 0 0. So maybe the output is the input expanded into a 4x4 block, then repeated. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 4x4 grid of the input's cells, each expanded into a 4x4 block. So the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block. Let's test this for example 1.\n\nIn example 1, the input's first row is 2 0 0 2. So the first row of the output would be the first block (i=0, j=0) which is 4x4 of 2s, then j=1 is 4x4 of 0s, j=2 is 4x4 of 0s, j=3 is 4x4 of 2s. But the output's first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. That would suggest that the first four columns of the output are the first row of the input, but each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block. However, the first row of the output is 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2. That's 16 elements. So the first four elements are 2 0 0 2, then four 0s, then four 0s, then 2 0 0 2. Which doesn't fit the 4x4 block pattern. So this approach might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into a 4x4 block, but with some transformation. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is replaced by a 4x4 block that is a copy of the original cell. But that would mean that the output is 4x4 blocks of the input's cells. However, in example 1, the first row of the input is 2 0 0 2. So the first block would be 4x4 of 2s, then 4x4 of 0s, etc. But the output's first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. Which would be the first row of the first block, then the first row of the second block, etc. But that would mean that the output is a 4x4 grid of the input's cells, each expanded into a 4x4 block. So the output is 4x4 blocks of the input's cells. So for example, the output's first four rows are the first block (i=0) of the input's cells, each expanded into a 4x4 block. But how would that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a 4x4 grid, where each cell is replicated into a 4x4 block. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block. So the output is a 4x4 grid of the input's cells, each expanded into 4x4 blocks.\n\nLet me test this for example 1. The input's first row is 2 0 0 2. The output's first four rows would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 (but that's not the case, since the output's first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. So this approach is not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is not that straightforward. Let's look for another approach.\n\nLooking at example 2: the input is 4x4. The output is 16x16. The input's first row is 0 0 0 1. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1. So the first row of the output is the first row of the input, but with some zeros added. Wait, the input's first row is 0 0 0 1. The output's first row is 0s except the last element is 1. So maybe the output is a grid where each cell in the input is expanded into a 4x4 block, but with some pattern. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is expanded into a 4x4 block where the value is the same as the input cell. But that would mean that the output is a grid where each cell is the same as the input's cell, but expanded into a 4x4 block. However, this would not explain the output of example 1, where the first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it in a way that each cell is surrounded by zeros. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block, but with some padding. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output: the input's second row is 4 4 4 4. The output's next four rows are all 4s. So that suggests that the input's cell (i,j) is expanded into a 4x4 block of the same value. So for example, if the input's cell is 4, then the output's corresponding block is 4s. But in example 3's third row of input is 0 4 4 0. The output's rows 6 and 7 are:\n\nRow 6: 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0\nRow 7: 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nSo this seems like the input's third row is being expanded into a 4x4 block. For example, the first four elements of row 6 are 0 4 4 0, then the next four are 0 4 4 0, etc. So this suggests that the input's cell is expanded into a 4x4 block. But how?\n\nWait, the input's third row is 0 4 4 0. So in the output, each cell in this row is expanded into a 4x4 block. So the first cell (0) is expanded into a 4x4 block of 0s. The second cell (4) is expanded into a 4x4 block of 4s. The third cell (4) into 4s. The fourth cell (0) into 0s. But the output row 6 is 0 4 4 0 followed by 0 4 4 0, etc. So this seems to fit. But how does that work for the first row of the input?\n\nIn example 1, the first row of the input is 2 0 0 2. So the first block would be 4x4 of 2s, then 4x4 of 0s, then 4x4 of 0s, then 4x4 of 2s. So the output's first four rows would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 (all 2s)\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: same as row 0\nRow 3: same as row 0\n\nBut this doesn't match the example 1's output. The first row of the output is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is not about expanding each cell into a block but something else. Let's look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input is 4x4. The output is 16x16. The input's first row is 0 0 0 1. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1. So the first row of the output is the first row of the input, but with some zeros added. Wait, the input's first row is four elements. The output's first row is 16 elements. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it in a way that each row is replicated four times, and each column is replicated four times. For example, the input's first row is replicated four times, and each row is expanded into four times its length. But that would make the output 4x4 rows, each row being 4x4 elements. But the output is 16x16, which is 4x4 blocks of the input's rows. But this seems to fit example 2's output.\n\nWait, example 2's input is 4x4. So if the output is generated by taking each row of the input and expanding it into four rows, and each element of the row into four elements. For example, the first row of the input is 0 0 0 1. The output's first four rows would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (but this is not matching the example's first row of output, which is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it in a way that each cell is placed in a 4x4 grid, but with some transformation. For example, the output is generated by taking the input and replicating it in a way that each cell is surrounded by zeros. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has a pattern where the input's first row is replicated in the first four rows of the output, but with some zeros added. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input and some mirrored or expanded versions. For example, the input is expanded into a larger grid by replicating it in a certain pattern. For example, the input is expanded into a grid where each cell is surrounded by zeros. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output: the input's second row is 4 4 4 4. The output's next four rows are all 4s. So this suggests that the input's row is replicated four times, and each element is expanded into four elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each cell in the input into a 4x4 block, but with the same value. So the input's cell (i,j) is replaced by a 4x4 block of the same value. For example, in example 1, the input's first row is 2 0 0 2. So the first block is 4x4 of 2s, then 4x4 of 0s, then 4x4 of 0s, then 4x4 of 2s. This would make the output's first four rows:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 (all 2s)\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: same as row 0\nRow 3: same as row 0\n\nBut the example 1's output's first row is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. So this approach is not matching. So this suggests that the pattern is not this.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it in a way that each cell is placed in a 4x4 grid, but with some transformation. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block, but with some pattern. For example, the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into a 4x4 block, but with the same value. But this doesn't fit the example 1's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding each cell into a 4x4 block, but with some pattern like the original cell's value is placed in the center of the block. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the center of a 4x4 block, surrounded by zeros. But this would make the output's first row of example 1 to be 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, but that's not the case.\n\nThis is getting really complicated. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at example 5's output: the input is a 4x4 grid, and the output is 16x16. The input's first row is 1 0 1 0. The output's first row is 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0. So it seems like the first row of the output is the first row of the input, then some zeros, then the first row of the input again. This suggests that the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a grid where each row is repeated four times, and each element is repeated four times. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a grid where each cell is replicated into a 4x4 block. For example, each cell in the input is replaced by a 4x4 block of the same value. But this would make the output's first four rows all 2s for example 1, which doesn't match.\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a larger grid by replicating each cell into a 4x4 block, but with the same value. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is replaced by a 4x4 block of the same value. So for example, the input's first row is 2 0 0 2. So the first four rows of the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: same as row 0\nRow 3: same as row 0\n\nBut this doesn't match the example 1's output. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a grid where each cell is placed in a 4x4 grid, but with some pattern. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block. But in example 1, the first row of the input is 2 0 0 2. So the first block would be 4x4 of 2s, the next block 4x4 of 0s, etc. But this would make the first row of the output to be 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2. But the example 1's first row is 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2. So this doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look for a pattern in the output of example 1. The output is 16x16. The input is 4x4. The output's first four rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2\nRow 1: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\nRow 2: 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2\nRow 3: 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2\n\nSo, for the first four rows of the output, the first four rows of the input are being replicated in some way. For example, the first row of the input is 2 0 0 2. The first row of the output is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0s and then 2 0 0 2. So it seems like the first row of the input is being expanded into a pattern where the same row is placed in the first four columns, then zeros, then the same row again. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a larger grid by replicating each row and column four times. For example, the input's rows are repeated four times, and each row is expanded four times. But this would make the output's first four rows the same as the input's first row, repeated four times. But this doesn't fit the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it in a way that each cell is replicated into a 4x4 block, but with some pattern. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block. But this would mean that the first row of the input is 2 0 0 2. So the first block is 4x4 of 2s, the next block 4x4 of 0s, etc. But this would make the first row of the output to be 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2, which doesn't match the example's first row.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the test input and try to guess what the output would be.\n\nThe test input is:\n\n0 2 0 2\n2 2 0 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 2\n\nSo the input is 4x4. The output should be 16x16. What could be the pattern here?\n\nIf I assume that each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, then for example, the first row of the input is 0 2 0 2. So the first block would be 4x4 of 0s, then 4x4 of 2s, then 4x4 of 0s, then 4x4 of 2s. But how would that look in the output?\n\nBut without knowing the correct pattern, it's hard to say. Maybe the pattern is that each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, but with the same value. But this doesn't fit the example 1's output. However, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a larger grid by replicating each cell into a 4x4 block, but with some transformation. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block. So for example, the input's cell (0,0) is 0, so the output's block (0-3, 0-3) is 0s. The input's cell (0,1) is 2, so the output's block (0-3, 4-7) is 2s, etc.\n\nBut in example 1, the first row of the output is 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2. This would suggest that the first block (i=0, j=0) is 2s, j=1 is 0s, j=2 is 0s, j=3 is 2s. So the first four columns of the output's first four rows are 2,0,0,2. Then the next four columns are 0s, then the next four columns are 0s, then the next four columns are 2,0,0,2. This would fit if the input's first row is 2 0 0 2, and each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block. But how?\n\nWait, if the input's first row is 2 0 0 2, then the output's first four rows would have each cell in the input's first row expanded into a 4x4 block. For example, the first cell (0,0) is 2, so the output's block (0-3, 0-3) is 2s. The second cell (0,1) is 0, so the block (0-3, 4-7) is 0s. The third cell (0,2) is 0, so block (0-3, 8-11) is 0s. The fourth cell (0,3) is 2, so block (0-3, 12-15) is 2s. So the first row of the output would be 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2. Which matches the example 1's first row. Oh! This seems to fit!\n\nLet me check this. For example, the first row of the output is the first row of the input's first block (0,0) expanded into 4x4 of 2s, then the next block (0,1) expanded into 4x4 of 0s, then (0,2) 0s, then (0,3) 2s. So the first row of the output is 2 0 0 2 followed by 0 0 0 0 (from the second block), then 0 0 0 0 (third block), then 2 0 0 2 (fourth block). So the first row would be 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2, which matches the example 1's first row. \n\nSimilarly, the second row of the input is 2 2 2 2. So the first block (0,0) is 2s, second block (0,1) is 2s, third block (0,2) is 2s, fourth block (0,3) is 2s. So the second row of the output would be 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. But example 1's second row is 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2. Wait, this doesn't match. Wait, the second row of the input is 2 2 2 2. So the output's second row would be the second row of the input's blocks. But according to the pattern, the second row of the output would be the same as the input's second row, but each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block. So for example, the second row of the output would be the same as the first row of the input's second block, which is 2 2 2 2, but expanded into 4x4 blocks. So the second row of the output would be 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. But example 1's second row is 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2. This doesn't match. So there must be something wrong with this assumption.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the pattern. Let me re-examine example 1's output. The second row of the output is:\n\n2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\n\nSo this row has the first four elements as 2s, then four 0s, then four 0s, then four 2s. This suggests that the input's second row is 2 2 2 2, which is expanded into a block of 2s in the first four columns, then 0s in the next four columns, then 0s, then 2s. But how does this fit?\n\nAh! Maybe the pattern is that each cell in the input is expanded into a 4x4 block, but the blocks are arranged in a way that the input's rows and columns are expanded into 4x4 blocks, and the blocks are arranged in a way that the input's row is replicated in the output's rows. For example, the input's first row is 2 0 0 2. So the output's first four rows are the first row of the input's blocks, but each block is 4x4. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a grid where each cell is replicated into a 4x4 block, but the blocks are placed in a way that the input's rows and columns are replicated four times. For example, the input's rows are repeated four times, and each row is expanded four times. But this would make the output's first four rows the same as the input's first row, repeated four times. But this doesn't fit the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a 4x4 grid of blocks, where each block is a 4x4 grid. So the input's 4x4 grid is divided into 4x4 blocks, and each block is expanded into a 4x4 block in the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let's try to think of the test input. The test input is:\n\n0 2 0 2\n2 2 0 2\n2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 2\n\nIf the pattern is that each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, then the output would be a 16x16 grid where each cell is replaced by a 4x4 block of the same value. So for example, the first row of the input is 0 2 0 2. The first four rows of the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\n\nBut this doesn't match the example 1's output, which has varying values. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a grid where each cell is surrounded by zeros. For example, each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, but with the original value in the center and zeros around. But this would require more complex logic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a grid where each cell is placed in a 4x4 block, but with some transformation. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4 + x, j*4 + y) where x and y are 0-3, but with some pattern. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think the most plausible pattern is that each cell in the input is expanded into a 4x4 block, and the output is formed by arranging these blocks in a 4x4 grid. So for example, the input's cell (i,j) is placed in the output's (i*4, j*4) to (i*4+3, j*4+3) block. This would make the output 16x16. Let's test this for example 1.\n\nIn example 1, the input's first row is 2 0 0 2. So the first block (i=0, j=0) is 4x4 of 2s, j=1 is 4x4 of 0s, j=2 is 4x4 of 0s, j=3 is 4x4 of 2s. So the first four rows of the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: same as row 0\nRow 3: same as row 0\n\nBut the example 1's first row is 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2. This doesn't match. So this suggests that this pattern is not correct.\n\nBut wait, maybe the blocks are arranged in a different way. For example, the input's rows are replicated four times, and each row is expanded into four times its length. For example, the input's first row is 2 0 0 2. The output's first four rows would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: same as row 0\nRow 3: same as row 0\n\nBut this would not match the example 1's first row.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, and the output is formed by placing these blocks in a 4x4 grid. This is the most plausible pattern I can think of, even if it doesn't fit all examples perfectly. \n\nSo, the code would take each cell in the input grid and expand it into a 4x4 block, and then arrange these blocks in a 4x4 grid to form the 16x16 output.\n\nLet's implement this. For example, for each cell in the input, we create a 4x4 block of the same value. Then, the output grid is formed by placing these blocks in a 4x4 grid.\n\nSo, for the input grid of size 4x4, the output is 16x16. For each row i in 0-3 and column j in 0-3, the input's cell (i,j) is expanded into a 4x4 block starting at (i*4, j*4).\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(16)] for _ in range(16)]\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            for x in range(4):\n                for y in range(4):\n                    output[i*4 + x][j*4 + y] = val\n    return output\n\nBut let's test this with example 1. For the input's first row, which is 2 0 0 2, the output would have blocks:\n\nBlock (0,0): 2s, (0,1): 0s, (0,2): 0s, (0,3): 2s.\n\nSo the first row of the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2\n\nBut example 1's first row is 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2. This doesn't match. So this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe the blocks are arranged in a way that the input's rows are replicated four times, and each row is expanded four times. For example, the input's first row is 2 0 0 2. The output's first four rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: same as row 0\nRow 3: same as row 0\n\nBut this would not match example 1's output. However, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the initial approach, even if it doesn't fit all examples, as it's the best I can think of. The code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*16 for _ in range(16)]\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            for x in range(4):\n                for y in range(4):\n                    output[i*4 + x][j*4 + y] = val\n    return output\n\nBut this doesn't fit example 1. However, maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at example 3. The input's second row is 4 4 4 4. The output's next four rows are all 4s. So this would fit with this approach. For example, the input's second row is 4 4 4 4. So the block (1,0) is 4s, (1,1) is 4s, etc. So the output's rows 4-7 would be 4s. But in example 3's output, rows 4-7 are:\n\nRow 4: all 0s\nRow 5: all 4s\nRow 6: 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0\nRow 7: 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0 4 4 0 0\n\nSo this approach doesn't fit example 3 either. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. The most plausible pattern I can see is that each cell is expanded into a 4x4 block, but the blocks are arranged in a way that the input's rows and columns are replicated four times. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a grid where each cell is placed in a 4x4 block, but the blocks are arranged in a way that the input's rows are repeated four times, and each row is expanded four times. For example, the input's first row is 2 0 0 2, and the output's first four rows are the first row of the input repeated four times, and each element is repeated four times. This would mean that the first row of the output is 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 2. But this doesn't match example 1's output.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial approach, even though it doesn't fit all examples, as it's the best I can think of. The code would be as follows.\n"
