    "content": "Let me analyze the training examples to identify the pattern.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nExample 1:\n- Input has two separate 3x3 square frames made of 2s\n- Output has 3x3 blocks of 3s in the same positions but smaller (3x3 \u2192 1x1 or 3x3 \u2192 3x3 with specific pattern?)\n\nWait, let me look more carefully:\n- First shape: 3x3 frame at positions (1,1) to (3,3) \n- Second shape: 4x4 frame at positions (5,4) to (8,7)\n- Output: 3s at (2,2) and a 3x3 block at (6,5) to (8,7)\n\nExample 2:\n- One 3x4 frame at positions (1,4) to (3,6)\n- Output: 3s at (2,5) and (3,5) - a vertical line of 3s\n\nExample 3:\n- One 5x6 frame at positions (1,1) to (5,5) and a 2x2 block at (7,10) to (8,11)\n- Output: 3x3 block of 3s at (2,2) to (4,4)\n\nLet me reconsider the pattern:\nIt seems like the transformation involves:\n1. Finding enclosed shapes made of 2s\n2. For each shape, placing 3s in a specific pattern in the output\n\nLooking more carefully at the outputs:\n- Example 1: The 3x3 frame gets a single 3 at its center, the 4x4 frame gets a 3x3 block of 3s\n- Example 2: The frame gets a vertical line of 3s  \n- Example 3: The 5x5 frame gets a 3x3 block of 3s, the 2x2 block gets nothing (too small?)\n\nActually, let me think differently. It looks like:\n- Find shapes (connected components) of 2s\n- For each shape, find its bounding box\n- If the shape is large enough, create a pattern of 3s in the output\n\nLooking at the specific positions:\nExample 1: Shape at (1-3,1-3) \u2192 3 at (2,2); Shape at (5-8,4-7) \u2192 3s at (6-8,5-7)\nExample 2: Shape at (1-3,4-6) \u2192 3s at (2-3,5)\nExample 3: Shape at (1-5,1-5) \u2192 3s at (2-4,2-4)\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. Find connected components of 2s\n2. For each component, find its bounding box\n3. Create a smaller version or specific pattern in the output grid using 3s\n\nLet me try a hypothesis: \n- For each connected component of 2s, we create a pattern of 3s\n- The pattern might be related to the center or a reduced version\n\nActually, looking more carefully:\nExample 1: 3x3 frame (1,1)-(3,3) \u2192 single 3 at (2,2) [center]\nExample 1: 4x4 frame (5,4)-(8,7) \u2192 3x3 block of 3s at (6,5)-(8,7) [bottom-right part]\nExample 2: 3x4 frame (1,4)-(3,6) \u2192 2x1 vertical line of 3s at (2,5)-(3,5) [middle column, excluding top]\nExample 3: 5x5 frame (1,1)-(5,5) \u2192 3x3 block of 3s at (2,2)-(4,4) [inner part]\n\nIt looks like we're creating a \"core\" or \"reduced\" version:\n- Remove one layer from the bounding box?\n- Take the center region?\n\nLet me try: for each connected component, find its bounding box, then fill a smaller region with 3s.\n\nFor a bounding box of size h\u00d7w, maybe we fill a (h-1)\u00d7(w-1) region offset by (1,1), or we fill the center region.\n\nLet me code this approach:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    # Create output grid filled with 0s\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n    \n    # Pad grid to handle boundary cases\n    padded_grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols + 2)] for _ in range(rows + 2)]\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            padded_grid[i + 1][j + 1] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    visited = [[False for _ in range(cols + 2)] for _ in range(rows + 2)]\n    \n    # Find connected components of 2s\n    def bfs(start_i, start_j):\n        component = []\n        queue = deque([(start_i, start_j)])\n        visited[start_i][start_j] = True\n        component.append((start_i, start_j))\n        \n        # 4-directional connectivity\n        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n        \n        while queue:\n            i, j = queue.popleft()\n            for di, dj in directions:\n                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                if (0 <= ni < rows + 2 and 0 <= nj < cols + 2 and \n                    not visited[ni][nj] and padded_grid[ni][nj] == 2):\n                    visited[ni][nj] = True\n                    queue.append((ni, nj))\n                    component.append((ni, j))\n                    component.append((i, nj))\n                    component.append((ni, nj))\n        \n        # Remove duplicates and adjust back from padding\n        component = list(set(component))\n        adjusted_component = [(i -

Finding enclosed shapes made of 2s\n2. For each shape, placing 3s in a specific pattern in the output\n\nLooking more carefully at the outputs:\n- Example 1: The 3x3 frame gets a single 3 at its center, the 4x4 frame gets a 3x3 block of 3s\n- Example 2: The frame gets a vertical line of 3s  \n- Example 3: The 5x5 frame gets a 3x3 block of 3s, the 2x2 block gets nothing (too small?)\n\nActually, let me think differently. It looks like:\n- Find shapes (connected components) of 2s\n- For each shape, find its bounding box\n- If the shape is large enough, create a pattern of 3s in the output\n\nLooking at the specific positions:\nExample 1: Shape at (1-3,1-3) \u2192 3 at (2,2); Shape at (5-8,4-7) \u2192 3s at (6-8,5-7)\nExample 2: Shape at (1-3,4-6) \u2192 3s at (2-3,5)\nExample 3: Shape at (1-5,1-5) \u2192 3s at (2-4,2-4)\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. Find connected components of 2s\n2. For each component, find its bounding box\n3. Create a smaller version or specific pattern in the output grid using 3s\n\nLet me try a hypothesis: \n- For each connected component of 2s, we create a pattern of 3s\n- The pattern might be related to the center or a reduced version\n\nActually, looking more carefully:\nExample 1: 3x3 frame (1,1)-(3,3) \u2192 single 3 at (2,2) [center]\nExample 1: 4x4 frame (5,4)-(8,7) \u2192 3x3 block of 3s at (6,5)-(8,7) [bottom-right part]\nExample 2: 3x4 frame (1,4)-(3,6) \u2192 2x1 vertical line of 3s at (2,5)-(3,5) [middle column, excluding top]\nExample 3: 5x5 frame (1,1)-(5,5) \u2192 3x3 block of 3s at (2,2)-(4,4) [inner part]\n\nIt looks like we're creating a \"core\" or \"reduced\" version:\n- Remove one layer from the bounding box?\n- Take the center region?\n\nLet me try: for each connected component, find its bounding box, then fill a smaller region with 3s.\n\nFor a bounding box of size h\u00d7w, maybe we fill a (h-1)\u00d7(w-1) region offset by (1,1), or we fill the center region.\n\nLet me code this approach:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    # Create output grid filled with 0s\n    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n    \n    # Pad grid to handle boundary cases\n    padded_grid = [[0 for _ in range(cols + 2)] for _ in range(rows + 2)]\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            padded_grid[i + 1][j + 1] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    visited = [[False for _ in range(cols + 2)] for _ in range(rows + 2)]\n    \n    # Find connected components of 2s\n    def bfs(start_i, start_j):\n        component = []\n        queue = deque([(start_i, start_j)])\n        visited[start_i][start_j] = True\n        component.append((start_i, start_j))\n        \n        # 4-directional connectivity\n        directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n        \n        while queue:\n            i, j = queue.popleft()\n            for di, dj in directions:\n                ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                if (0 <= ni < rows + 2 and 0 <= nj < cols + 2 and \n                    not visited[ni][nj] and padded_grid[ni][nj] == 2):\n                    visited[ni][nj] = True\n                    queue.append((ni, nj))\n                    component.append((ni, j))\n                    component.append((i, nj))\n                    component.append((ni, nj))\n        \n        # Remove duplicates and adjust back from padding\n        component = list(set(component))\n        adjusted_component = [(i -
