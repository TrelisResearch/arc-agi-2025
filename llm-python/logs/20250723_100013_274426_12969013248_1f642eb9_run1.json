In Example 1, the value 9 in the input at position (0,4) becomes 9 in the output.\n2. The value 8 in the input at positions (3,4), (4,4), (5,4) becomes 9 in the output at (3,4), 8 at (4,4), 8 at (5,4).\n3. The value 6 in the input at (6,0) becomes 6 in the output.\n4. The value 4 in the input at (9,5) becomes 4 in the output.\n5. In Example 2, the value 7 in the input at (0,4) becomes 7 in the output.\n6. The value 8 in the input at positions (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3) becomes 6, 7, 8, 8, 3 in the output.\n7. The value 1 in the input at (9,5) becomes 1 in the output.\n8. In Example 3, the value 4 in the input at (0,3) becomes 4 in the output.\n9. The value 8 in the input at positions (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3) becomes 4, 3, 2, 7, 7 in the output.\n10. The value 6 in the input at (3,9) becomes 6 in the output.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Keeping certain values unchanged\n- Modifying values based on their position relative to other values\n- Possibly creating new values based on neighboring values\n\nBased on this, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Keeps values that are 0 or 9 unchanged\n- For values that are 8, replace them with 9 if they are in the first 3 rows, and with 8 otherwise\n- For values that are 6, replace them with 6\n- For values that are 4, replace them with 4\n- For values that are 3, replace them with 3\n- For values that are 2, replace them with 2\n- For values that are 7, replace them with 7\n- For values that are 1, replace them with 1\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Keep values that are 0 or 9 unchanged\n    # For values that are 8, replace them with 9 if they are in the first 3 rows, and with 8 otherwise\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                if i < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            # Keep other values unchanged\n            # Special cases for other values\n            # For example, keep 6, 4, 3, 2, 7, 1 unchanged\n            # These values are already handled by the above logic\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 1, the value 9 in the input at position (0,4) becomes 9 in the output.\n2. The value 8 in the input at positions (3,4), (4,4), (5,4) becomes 9 in the output at (3,4), 8 at (4,4), 8 at (5,4).\n3. The value 6 in the input at (6,0) becomes 6 in the output.\n4. The value 4 in the input at (9,5) becomes 4 in the output.\n5. In Example 2, the value 7 in the input at (0,4) becomes 7 in the output.\n6. The value 8 in the input at positions (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3) becomes 6, 7, 8, 8, 3 in the output.\n7. The value 1 in the input at (9,5) becomes 1 in the output.\n8. In Example 3, the value 4 in the input at (0,3) becomes 4 in the output.\n9. The value 8 in the input at positions (3,3), (4,3), (5,3), (6,3), (7,3) becomes 4, 3, 2, 7, 7 in the output.\n10. The value 6 in the input at (3,9) becomes 6 in the output.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Keeping certain values unchanged\n- Modifying values based on their position relative to other values\n- Possibly creating new values based on neighboring values\n\nBased on this, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Keeps values that are 0 or 9 unchanged\n- For values that are 8, replace them with 9 if they are in the first 3 rows, and with 8 otherwise\n- For values that are 6, replace them with 6\n- For values that are 4, replace them with 4\n- For values that are 3, replace them with 3\n- For values that are 2, replace them with 2\n- For values that are 7, replace them with 7\n- For values that are 1, replace them with 1\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Keep values that are 0 or 9 unchanged\n    # For values that are 8, replace them with 9 if they are in the first 3 rows, and with 8 otherwise\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                if i < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            # Keep other values unchanged\n            # Special cases for other values\n            # For example, keep 6, 4, 3, 2, 7, 1 unchanged\n            # These values are already handled by the above logic\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
