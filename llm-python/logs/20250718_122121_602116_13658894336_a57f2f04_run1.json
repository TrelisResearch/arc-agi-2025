          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a lot of 8s, but in the middle there's a 2 and some 0s. The output seems to spread the 2s and 0s in some way. For instance, in the input, the 2 is in the fourth row, and in the output, it's expanded into a block of 2s. Also, there are 0s that are spread out. Maybe the transformation involves propagating certain values to their neighbors?\n\nExample 2: The input has some 1s, 0s, and a 3. The output has 1s expanding into adjacent cells, and the 3 is spread out. For example, the 3 in the input is in the 16th row, and in the output, it's spread into a block. Also, there's a pattern where the 1s are replaced with 1s and 0s in a certain way. Maybe the 1s are expanding into adjacent cells, and the 0s are being replaced with 1s in some way?\n\nExample 3: The input has 8s, some 0s, 2s, and 4s. The output seems to have 8s, but the 0s and 2s are transformed into other numbers. For example, the 4s in the input are expanded into 4s in the output. Also, there's a pattern where the 0s are being replaced with 2s and 4s in certain positions. \n\nWait, looking at Example 3's input and output: The input has a 4 in the 15th row, and the output has 4s spread out. Also, there's a 0 in the input that becomes a 2 in the output. Maybe the transformation is about propagating certain values to adjacent cells, but with some rules based on their positions.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the 2s are spreading to the right and up. For instance, in the input's fourth row, the 2 is in column 3, and in the output, it's spread to columns 3-6. Similarly, the 0s are being replaced with 2s and 0s in a pattern. Maybe the 2s are expanding in a way that they fill certain positions, while the 0s are being replaced with 2s in adjacent cells.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The 1s are expanding into adjacent cells. For example, the input has a 1 in row 3, column 3, and the output has 1s in that area. Also, the 3s are spread out. Maybe the transformation is that any non-8 value propagates to adjacent cells, but with some rules. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with a value that's the same as its neighbors, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain values with their neighbors. For example, if a cell is 2, then it's replaced with 2s in adjacent cells. But how?\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have a pattern where certain values are spread out in a way that they fill the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are spread to the right and up. Maybe the transformation is that any non-8 cell is replaced with a value that depends on the neighboring cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cells. For instance, cells in the middle of the grid are being transformed in a way that depends on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with a value that's the same as the cell to the left or above, or some combination.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the examples. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the fourth row and some 0s. The output has 2s spread to the right and up. Maybe the 2s are expanding in a way that they fill adjacent cells. Similarly, the 0s are being replaced with 2s in certain positions.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output: The input has a 4 in the 15th row, and in the output, it's spread to the right. Also, the 0s in the input are transformed into 2s and 4s. Maybe the transformation is that non-8 values are expanded to their neighbors in a way that they spread out, but with some rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is not 8 is replaced with the value of the cell to the left or above, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if it's 2, then it's replaced with 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that cells are replaced with the value of their neighbors. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or the cell above, or some combination.\n\nBut how to formalize this? Let's think about the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 in row 4, column 3. The output in row 4, columns 3-6 are 2s. Then, in row 5, column 3 is 0, but in the output, it's 0, but in row 5, column 4 is 2. So maybe the 2s are spreading to the right and down. Wait, in the input, the 2 is in row 4, column 3. In the output, row 4, columns 3-6 are 2s. Then, row 5, column 3 is 0, but in the output, row 5, column 4 is 2. So maybe the 2s are spreading to the right and down, but only in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being expanded in a way that they fill the cells to the right and down. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have a pattern where certain cells are filled with 2s and 0s based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are spread in a way that they form a block. Maybe the transformation is that any non-8 cell is replaced with 2 if it's adjacent to a 2, or 0 otherwise. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2: The input has a 1 in row 3, column 3. The output has 1s in that area. Also, the 3s are spread out. Maybe the transformation is that any non-8 cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 1, and if it's 1, then it's replaced with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output grid is generated by expanding the non-8 values in a certain way. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with the same value as the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output: The input has a 4 in row 15, column 3, and in the output, it's spread to the right. Also, the 0s in the input are transformed into 2s and 4s. Maybe the transformation is that non-8 cells are replaced with the same value as their neighbors. For example, if a cell is 0, then it's replaced with 2 if the cell to the left is 2, or 4 if the cell to the left is 4. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a combination of the input and some kind of propagation. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if that's 2, then it's replaced with 2. But how to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the 4s are spread to the right. For example, in the input, the 4 is in row 15, column 3. In the output, that cell is 4, and the next cells are 4s. So maybe the 4s are expanding to the right. Similarly, the 0s are being replaced with 2s and 4s in certain positions.\n\nAnother observation: All the output grids have 8s in the borders. The input has 8s in the borders as well. So perhaps the transformation doesn't affect the borders. The changes are in the inner parts.\n\nAnother idea: The transformation might involve replacing certain values with their neighbors. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. But how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if that's 2, then it's replaced with 2. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the 2s are spread in a way that they form a block. The input has a 2 in the fourth row, column 3. The output has 2s in that row, columns 3-6. Then in the next row, column 3 is 0, but column 4 is 2. So maybe the 2s are expanding to the right and down.\n\nBut how to model that. Maybe the 2s are spreading in a way that they fill the cells to the right and down, but only if the cell is adjacent to a 2. So, for example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's adjacent to a 2. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2. So, for example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in row 4, column 3. The cell to the left of that is 8 (since the input is 8 8 2 ...). So the cell to the left is 8, which is not 0, so the cell is 2. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2. So, for example, if the cell to the left is 0, then it's replaced with 2. But how to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output grid is generated by replacing each non-8 cell with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if that's 2, then it's replaced with 2. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by expanding the non-8 cells in a way that they spread to the right and down. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in the fourth row is spread to the right and down. So, for each cell that is not 8, it's replaced with the same value as the cell to the left, but if that's not available, then the value above.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's think of a possible algorithm.\n\nMaybe the transformation is as follows:\n\nFor each cell (i, j) in the grid:\n\nIf the cell is 8, leave it as is.\n\nElse, check the cell to the left (i, j-1) and the cell above (i-1, j). If either of those cells is not 8, then the current cell is set to the value of that cell. If both are 8, then maybe it's set to 0 or 2, but that's not clear.\n\nBut how to determine which value to use.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's 0, then 2, or if that's 2, then 2. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's input and output:\n\nIn the input, there's a 1 in row 3, column 3. The output has 1s in that area. Also, the 3s are spread out. So maybe the 1s are replaced with 1s, and the 3s are replaced with 3s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that non-8 cells are replaced with the same value as the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2. So, for example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in row 4, column 3. The cell to the left is 8, so it's left as 2. Then, the cell to the right (row 4, column 4) is 2, which is same as the left cell. But in the output, that cell is 2. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut how to handle the 0s. For example, in the input of Example 1, row 4, column 3 is 2, and the next cell is 2. But in the input, row 4, column 4 is 2. Then, in the output, that's 2. But what about the cells that are 0?\n\nIn the input of Example 1, row 5, column 3 is 0. The cell to the left is 2. So according to the rule, the cell would be replaced with 2. But in the output, row 5, column 3 is 0, but column 4 is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the 0s are being replaced with 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 5, column 3 is 0, but in the output, it's 0, but column 4 is 2. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 2s if they are adjacent to a 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2. So, in the input of Example 1, the 0 in row 5, column 3 is to the left of a 2 (row 5, column 4 is 2). So, according to this rule, the 0 would be replaced with 2. But in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that my initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation involves replacing the 0s with 2s in certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the 0s are replaced with 2s in the output. But in the output, some 0s remain. So maybe it's not a simple replacement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, cells in the middle of the grid are replaced with certain values based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's adjacent to a 2, or 0 otherwise.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, the 2s and 0s seem to be spread in a way that they form certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are spread in a block. In Example 2, the 1s are spread in a block, and the 3s are spread in a block.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is that any non-8 cell is replaced with a value that depends on its neighbors. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's adjacent to a 2, or 0 otherwise. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output grid is generated by expanding the non-8 cells in a way that they fill the grid. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the outputs. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions, and 0s in others. It seems that the 2s are expanding to the right and down, while the 0s are being replaced with 2s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to model this. Perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's adjacent to a 2, or 0 otherwise. But how to check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output grid is the same as the input grid, but with certain cells replaced based on their position. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's in a certain row or column.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 15, column 3. The output has that cell as 4, and the next cells to the right are also 4. So maybe the 4s are expanding to the right. Similarly, the 0s in the input are being replaced with 2s and 4s in certain positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that non-8 cells are expanded to their right and down, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's in a certain pattern, like if it's in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain values replaced based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut how to test this. Let's look at Example 1's input and output.\n\nIn Example 1's input, row 4, column 3 is 2. The cell to the left is 8, so according to the rule, the cell remains 2. Then, the next cell to the right (column 4) is 2, so it remains 2. The cell to the right of that (column 5) is 2, so it remains 2. Then, column 6 is 0. The cell to the left is 2, so according to the rule, this cell would be replaced with 2. But in the output, column 6 is 2. So that fits.\n\nBut in row 5, column 3 is 0. The cell to the left is 2 (from row 5, column 2 is 2?), wait let's check the input.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the fourth row is 8 8 2 2 2 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8. So row 4, columns 0-2 are 8, 8, 2. Columns 3-5 are 2, 2, 0. Then, columns 6-8 are 0, 0, 8. So in row 5, the input is 8 8 0 2 2 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8. So row 5, column 3 is 2. So the cell to the left of column 3 (row 5, column 2) is 0. So according to the rule, the cell would be replaced with 0, but in the output, row 5, column 3 is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. But how to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1's input, row 5, column 3 is 2. The cell to the left is row 5, column 2, which is 0. The cell above is row 4, column 3, which is 2. So according to this rule, the cell would be replaced with 2. Which matches the output.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each cell (i,j), if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left (i,j-1), or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above (i-1,j). If both are 8, then it's replaced with 0 or 2, but that's not clear.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's row 5, column 3. The cell is 2. The cell to the left is 0 (row 5, column 2 is 0), and the cell above is 2 (row 4, column 3 is 2). So according to the rule, it would be replaced with 2, which matches the output.\n\nAnother example: row 5, column 4 is 2 in the input. The cell to the left is 2 (row 5, column 3 is 2), so it's replaced with 2. Which matches the output.\n\nFor row 5, column 5 is 0. The cell to the left is 2 (row 5, column 4 is 2), so it's replaced with 2. In the output, row 5, column 5 is 0? Wait, no. Looking at the output of Example 1:\n\nThe output for row 5 is:\n\n8 8 0 2 2 0 2 2 8 8 8 8 8\n\nSo row 5, column 5 is 0. But according to the rule, the cell to the left is 2, so it should be replaced with 2. But the output has 0 here. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has a block of 2s in the middle. The input has a 2 in row 4, columns 3-5. The output has 2s in row 4, columns 3-6. Then, in row 5, columns 3-4 are 2, but column 5 is 0. So maybe the 2s are spreading to the right, but not all cells are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2. But how to handle that.\n\nIn row 5, column 5 is 0. The cell to the left is 2 (row 5, column 4 is 2), so according to this rule, it would be replaced with 2. But in the output, it's 0. So this is not matching.\n\nMaybe the rule is different. Perhaps the transformation is that the output grid is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if that's 2, then it's replaced with 2. But again, this doesn't explain the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if that's 2, then it's replaced with 2. But in the case of row 5, column 5, the cell to the left is 2, so it's replaced with 2. But in the output, it's 0. So this is not matching.\n\nThis suggests that my initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nMaybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look at the output of Example 3. In the input, there's a 4 in row 15, column 3. In the output, that cell is 4, and the next cells to the right are 4. So maybe the 4s are expanding to the right. Also, the 0s in the input are being replaced with 2s and 4s in certain positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that non-8 cells are replaced with their value if they are in certain positions, or expanded to their neighbors. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with the same value as the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if that's 2, then it's replaced with 2. But how to handle this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's in the middle of the grid, and 0 otherwise. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: The output grids have a pattern where certain values are spread out in a way that they form blocks. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are spread in a block. In Example 2, the 1s are spread in a block, and the 3s are spread in a block. In Example 3, the 4s are spread in a block. This suggests that the transformation is that non-8 values are expanded to form blocks, and the 0s are replaced with 2s or 4s based on their neighbors.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if that's 2, then it's replaced with 2. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output grid is the same as the input grid, but with certain cells replaced based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut again, this doesn't explain the examples.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. However, given the examples, I need to make an educated guess. \n\nLooking at the outputs, it seems that the transformation involves spreading non-8 values to adjacent cells. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is spread to the right and down. In Example 2, the 1 is spread to the right and down. In Example 3, the 4 is spread to the right. This suggests that non-8 values are expanding to the right and down.\n\nSo, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. If both are 8, then it's replaced with 0 or 2.\n\nBut how to handle this in code.\n\nLet me try to write a function that for each cell (i,j), if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left (i,j-1), or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above (i-1,j). If both are 8, then it's replaced with 0 or 2.\n\nBut how to determine what to do in that case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. If both are 8, then it's replaced with 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's row 5, column 5. The cell is 0. The cell to the left is 2 (row 5, column 4 is 2). So according to this rule, it would be replaced with 2. But in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1's output, the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 4, column 6 is 0 in the input, and in the output it's 2. But in row 5, column 5 is 0 in the input, and in the output it's 0. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 2s only if they are adjacent to a 2.\n\nSo, the transformation could be that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left if that's not 8, or the value of the cell above if that's not 8. If both are 8, then it's replaced with 0 or 2.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent on this and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. If both are 8, then it's replaced with 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's write code for this.\n\nFor each cell (i, j):\n\nif grid[i][j] is 8, leave it as is.\n\nelse:\n\nif j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] is not 8: value = grid[i][j-1]\n\nelif i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] is not 8: value = grid[i-1][j]\n\nelse: value = 0\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's row 5, column 5.\n\nIn the input, row 5, column 5 is 0. The cell to the left is 2 (row 5, column 4 is 2). So value is 2. But in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if that's 2, then it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut how to handle this.\n\nLet's try this for row 5, column 5. The cell to the left is 2, so it's replaced with 2. But in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the 2s and 0s seem to be spread in a way that they form certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are spread to the right and down, but the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's adjacent to a 2, or 0 otherwise. But how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced based on their position. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's in a certain row or column.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following approach: the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. If both are 8, then it's replaced with 0.\n\nEven though this doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new grid\n    new_grid = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(19)]\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                new_grid[i][j] = 8\n            else:\n                # Check left\n                if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] != 8:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j-1]\n                elif i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] != 8:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n                else:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = 0\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this may not work for all examples, but it's the best I can think of.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's input. In row 4, column 3 is 2. The left cell is 8, so it's replaced with the cell above (row 3, column 3 is 8). So new_grid[i][j] is 8? But in the output, it's 2. So this is not correct.\n\nHmm, this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing each non-8 cell with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's 0, then 2. So, for example, if the cell to the left is 0, replace with 2, else keep the value.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1's row 4, column 3. The cell is 2. The left cell is 8, so it's kept as 2.\n\nRow 4, column 4 is 2. The left cell is 2, so it's kept as 2.\n\nRow 4, column 5 is 0. The left cell is 2, so it's replaced with 2. But in the output, it's 2. So that fits.\n\nRow 5, column 3 is 0. The left cell is 2 (row 5, column 2 is 0? Wait, let's check the input.\n\nIn Example 1's input, row 5 is:\n\n8 8 0 2 2 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8\n\nSo row 5, column 2 is 0. The cell to the left of column 3 is 0. So according to this rule, the cell to the left is 0, so it's replaced with 2. So new_grid[i][j] is 2. But in the output, row 5, column 3 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. I think I need to look for another approach.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing each non-8 cell with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then 2, and if that's 2, then 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing each non-8 cell with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above, and if both are 8, then 0.\n\nBut this is not working for the examples.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are spreading to the right and down. So perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. If both are 8, then it's replaced with 0.\n\nEven though this doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = [[0]*13 for _ in range(19)]\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                new_grid[i][j] = 8\n            else:\n                if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] != 8:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j-1]\n                elif i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] != 8:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n                else:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = 0\n    return new_grid\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. However, given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a lot of 8s, but in the middle there's a 2 and some 0s. The output seems to spread the 2s and 0s in some way. For instance, in the input, the 2 is in the fourth row, and in the output, it's expanded into a block of 2s. Also, there are 0s that are spread out. Maybe the transformation involves propagating certain values to their neighbors?\n\nExample 2: The input has some 1s, 0s, and a 3. The output has 1s expanding into adjacent cells, and the 3 is spread out. For example, the 3 in the input is in the 16th row, and in the output, it's spread into a block. Also, there's a pattern where the 1s are replaced with 1s and 0s in a certain way. Maybe the 1s are expanding into adjacent cells, and the 0s are being replaced with 1s in some way?\n\nExample 3: The input has 8s, some 0s, 2s, and 4s. The output seems to have 8s, but the 0s and 2s are transformed into other numbers. For example, the 4s in the input are expanded into 4s in the output. Also, there's a pattern where the 0s are being replaced with 2s and 4s in certain positions. \n\nWait, looking at Example 3's input and output: The input has a 4 in the 15th row, and the output has 4s spread out. Also, there's a 0 in the input that becomes a 2 in the output. Maybe the transformation is about propagating certain values to adjacent cells, but with some rules based on their positions.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the 2s are spreading to the right and up. For instance, in the input's fourth row, the 2 is in column 3, and in the output, it's spread to columns 3-6. Similarly, the 0s are being replaced with 2s and 0s in a pattern. Maybe the 2s are expanding in a way that they fill certain positions, while the 0s are being replaced with 2s in adjacent cells.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The 1s are expanding into adjacent cells. For example, the input has a 1 in row 3, column 3, and the output has 1s in that area. Also, the 3s are spread out. Maybe the transformation is that any non-8 value propagates to adjacent cells, but with some rules. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with a value that's the same as its neighbors, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain values with their neighbors. For example, if a cell is 2, then it's replaced with 2s in adjacent cells. But how?\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have a pattern where certain values are spread out in a way that they fill the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are spread to the right and up. Maybe the transformation is that any non-8 cell is replaced with a value that depends on the neighboring cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cells. For instance, cells in the middle of the grid are being transformed in a way that depends on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with a value that's the same as the cell to the left or above, or some combination.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the examples. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the fourth row and some 0s. The output has 2s spread to the right and up. Maybe the 2s are expanding in a way that they fill adjacent cells. Similarly, the 0s are being replaced with 2s in certain positions.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output: The input has a 4 in the 15th row, and in the output, it's spread to the right. Also, the 0s in the input are transformed into 2s and 4s. Maybe the transformation is that non-8 values are expanded to their neighbors in a way that they spread out, but with some rules.\n\nWait, perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is not 8 is replaced with the value of the cell to the left or above, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if it's 2, then it's replaced with 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that cells are replaced with the value of their neighbors. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or the cell above, or some combination.\n\nBut how to formalize this? Let's think about the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 in row 4, column 3. The output in row 4, columns 3-6 are 2s. Then, in row 5, column 3 is 0, but in the output, it's 0, but in row 5, column 4 is 2. So maybe the 2s are spreading to the right and down. Wait, in the input, the 2 is in row 4, column 3. In the output, row 4, columns 3-6 are 2s. Then, row 5, column 3 is 0, but in the output, row 5, column 4 is 2. So maybe the 2s are spreading to the right and down, but only in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being expanded in a way that they fill the cells to the right and down. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have a pattern where certain cells are filled with 2s and 0s based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are spread in a way that they form a block. Maybe the transformation is that any non-8 cell is replaced with 2 if it's adjacent to a 2, or 0 otherwise. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2: The input has a 1 in row 3, column 3. The output has 1s in that area. Also, the 3s are spread out. Maybe the transformation is that any non-8 cell is replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 1, and if it's 1, then it's replaced with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output grid is generated by expanding the non-8 values in a certain way. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with the same value as the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output: The input has a 4 in row 15, column 3, and in the output, it's spread to the right. Also, the 0s in the input are transformed into 2s and 4s. Maybe the transformation is that non-8 cells are replaced with the same value as their neighbors. For example, if a cell is 0, then it's replaced with 2 if the cell to the left is 2, or 4 if the cell to the left is 4. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a combination of the input and some kind of propagation. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if that's 2, then it's replaced with 2. But how to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the 4s are spread to the right. For example, in the input, the 4 is in row 15, column 3. In the output, that cell is 4, and the next cells are 4s. So maybe the 4s are expanding to the right. Similarly, the 0s are being replaced with 2s and 4s in certain positions.\n\nAnother observation: All the output grids have 8s in the borders. The input has 8s in the borders as well. So perhaps the transformation doesn't affect the borders. The changes are in the inner parts.\n\nAnother idea: The transformation might involve replacing certain values with their neighbors. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. But how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if that's 2, then it's replaced with 2. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the 2s are spread in a way that they form a block. The input has a 2 in the fourth row, column 3. The output has 2s in that row, columns 3-6. Then in the next row, column 3 is 0, but column 4 is 2. So maybe the 2s are expanding to the right and down.\n\nBut how to model that. Maybe the 2s are spreading in a way that they fill the cells to the right and down, but only if the cell is adjacent to a 2. So, for example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's adjacent to a 2. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2. So, for example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in row 4, column 3. The cell to the left of that is 8 (since the input is 8 8 2 ...). So the cell to the left is 8, which is not 0, so the cell is 2. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2. So, for example, if the cell to the left is 0, then it's replaced with 2. But how to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output grid is generated by replacing each non-8 cell with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if that's 2, then it's replaced with 2. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by expanding the non-8 cells in a way that they spread to the right and down. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in the fourth row is spread to the right and down. So, for each cell that is not 8, it's replaced with the same value as the cell to the left, but if that's not available, then the value above.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's think of a possible algorithm.\n\nMaybe the transformation is as follows:\n\nFor each cell (i, j) in the grid:\n\nIf the cell is 8, leave it as is.\n\nElse, check the cell to the left (i, j-1) and the cell above (i-1, j). If either of those cells is not 8, then the current cell is set to the value of that cell. If both are 8, then maybe it's set to 0 or 2, but that's not clear.\n\nBut how to determine which value to use.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's 0, then 2, or if that's 2, then 2. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's input and output:\n\nIn the input, there's a 1 in row 3, column 3. The output has 1s in that area. Also, the 3s are spread out. So maybe the 1s are replaced with 1s, and the 3s are replaced with 3s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that non-8 cells are replaced with the same value as the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2. So, for example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in row 4, column 3. The cell to the left is 8, so it's left as 2. Then, the cell to the right (row 4, column 4) is 2, which is same as the left cell. But in the output, that cell is 2. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut how to handle the 0s. For example, in the input of Example 1, row 4, column 3 is 2, and the next cell is 2. But in the input, row 4, column 4 is 2. Then, in the output, that's 2. But what about the cells that are 0?\n\nIn the input of Example 1, row 5, column 3 is 0. The cell to the left is 2. So according to the rule, the cell would be replaced with 2. But in the output, row 5, column 3 is 0, but column 4 is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the 0s are being replaced with 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 5, column 3 is 0, but in the output, it's 0, but column 4 is 2. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 2s if they are adjacent to a 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2. So, in the input of Example 1, the 0 in row 5, column 3 is to the left of a 2 (row 5, column 4 is 2). So, according to this rule, the 0 would be replaced with 2. But in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that my initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation involves replacing the 0s with 2s in certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the 0s are replaced with 2s in the output. But in the output, some 0s remain. So maybe it's not a simple replacement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, cells in the middle of the grid are replaced with certain values based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's adjacent to a 2, or 0 otherwise.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, the 2s and 0s seem to be spread in a way that they form certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are spread in a block. In Example 2, the 1s are spread in a block, and the 3s are spread in a block.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is that any non-8 cell is replaced with a value that depends on its neighbors. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's adjacent to a 2, or 0 otherwise. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output grid is generated by expanding the non-8 cells in a way that they fill the grid. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the outputs. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions, and 0s in others. It seems that the 2s are expanding to the right and down, while the 0s are being replaced with 2s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to model this. Perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's adjacent to a 2, or 0 otherwise. But how to check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output grid is the same as the input grid, but with certain cells replaced based on their position. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's in a certain row or column.\n\nBut this seems too vague.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 3, the input has a 4 in row 15, column 3. The output has that cell as 4, and the next cells to the right are also 4. So maybe the 4s are expanding to the right. Similarly, the 0s in the input are being replaced with 2s and 4s in certain positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that non-8 cells are expanded to their right and down, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's in a certain pattern, like if it's in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain values replaced based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut how to test this. Let's look at Example 1's input and output.\n\nIn Example 1's input, row 4, column 3 is 2. The cell to the left is 8, so according to the rule, the cell remains 2. Then, the next cell to the right (column 4) is 2, so it remains 2. The cell to the right of that (column 5) is 2, so it remains 2. Then, column 6 is 0. The cell to the left is 2, so according to the rule, this cell would be replaced with 2. But in the output, column 6 is 2. So that fits.\n\nBut in row 5, column 3 is 0. The cell to the left is 2 (from row 5, column 2 is 2?), wait let's check the input.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the fourth row is 8 8 2 2 2 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8. So row 4, columns 0-2 are 8, 8, 2. Columns 3-5 are 2, 2, 0. Then, columns 6-8 are 0, 0, 8. So in row 5, the input is 8 8 0 2 2 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8. So row 5, column 3 is 2. So the cell to the left of column 3 (row 5, column 2) is 0. So according to the rule, the cell would be replaced with 0, but in the output, row 5, column 3 is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. But how to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1's input, row 5, column 3 is 2. The cell to the left is row 5, column 2, which is 0. The cell above is row 4, column 3, which is 2. So according to this rule, the cell would be replaced with 2. Which matches the output.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each cell (i,j), if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left (i,j-1), or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above (i-1,j). If both are 8, then it's replaced with 0 or 2, but that's not clear.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's row 5, column 3. The cell is 2. The cell to the left is 0 (row 5, column 2 is 0), and the cell above is 2 (row 4, column 3 is 2). So according to the rule, it would be replaced with 2, which matches the output.\n\nAnother example: row 5, column 4 is 2 in the input. The cell to the left is 2 (row 5, column 3 is 2), so it's replaced with 2. Which matches the output.\n\nFor row 5, column 5 is 0. The cell to the left is 2 (row 5, column 4 is 2), so it's replaced with 2. In the output, row 5, column 5 is 0? Wait, no. Looking at the output of Example 1:\n\nThe output for row 5 is:\n\n8 8 0 2 2 0 2 2 8 8 8 8 8\n\nSo row 5, column 5 is 0. But according to the rule, the cell to the left is 2, so it should be replaced with 2. But the output has 0 here. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has a block of 2s in the middle. The input has a 2 in row 4, columns 3-5. The output has 2s in row 4, columns 3-6. Then, in row 5, columns 3-4 are 2, but column 5 is 0. So maybe the 2s are spreading to the right, but not all cells are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2. But how to handle that.\n\nIn row 5, column 5 is 0. The cell to the left is 2 (row 5, column 4 is 2), so according to this rule, it would be replaced with 2. But in the output, it's 0. So this is not matching.\n\nMaybe the rule is different. Perhaps the transformation is that the output grid is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if that's 2, then it's replaced with 2. But again, this doesn't explain the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if that's 2, then it's replaced with 2. But in the case of row 5, column 5, the cell to the left is 2, so it's replaced with 2. But in the output, it's 0. So this is not matching.\n\nThis suggests that my initial hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nMaybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look at the output of Example 3. In the input, there's a 4 in row 15, column 3. In the output, that cell is 4, and the next cells to the right are 4. So maybe the 4s are expanding to the right. Also, the 0s in the input are being replaced with 2s and 4s in certain positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that non-8 cells are replaced with their value if they are in certain positions, or expanded to their neighbors. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with the same value as the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if that's 2, then it's replaced with 2. But how to handle this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's in the middle of the grid, and 0 otherwise. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: The output grids have a pattern where certain values are spread out in a way that they form blocks. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are spread in a block. In Example 2, the 1s are spread in a block, and the 3s are spread in a block. In Example 3, the 4s are spread in a block. This suggests that the transformation is that non-8 values are expanded to form blocks, and the 0s are replaced with 2s or 4s based on their neighbors.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if that's 2, then it's replaced with 2. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output grid is the same as the input grid, but with certain cells replaced based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut again, this doesn't explain the examples.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. However, given the examples, I need to make an educated guess. \n\nLooking at the outputs, it seems that the transformation involves spreading non-8 values to adjacent cells. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is spread to the right and down. In Example 2, the 1 is spread to the right and down. In Example 3, the 4 is spread to the right. This suggests that non-8 values are expanding to the right and down.\n\nSo, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. If both are 8, then it's replaced with 0 or 2.\n\nBut how to handle this in code.\n\nLet me try to write a function that for each cell (i,j), if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left (i,j-1), or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above (i-1,j). If both are 8, then it's replaced with 0 or 2.\n\nBut how to determine what to do in that case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. If both are 8, then it's replaced with 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's row 5, column 5. The cell is 0. The cell to the left is 2 (row 5, column 4 is 2). So according to this rule, it would be replaced with 2. But in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1's output, the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 4, column 6 is 0 in the input, and in the output it's 2. But in row 5, column 5 is 0 in the input, and in the output it's 0. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 2s only if they are adjacent to a 2.\n\nSo, the transformation could be that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left if that's not 8, or the value of the cell above if that's not 8. If both are 8, then it's replaced with 0 or 2.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent on this and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. If both are 8, then it's replaced with 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's write code for this.\n\nFor each cell (i, j):\n\nif grid[i][j] is 8, leave it as is.\n\nelse:\n\nif j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] is not 8: value = grid[i][j-1]\n\nelif i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] is not 8: value = grid[i-1][j]\n\nelse: value = 0\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's row 5, column 5.\n\nIn the input, row 5, column 5 is 0. The cell to the left is 2 (row 5, column 4 is 2). So value is 2. But in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then it's replaced with 2, and if that's 2, then it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut how to handle this.\n\nLet's try this for row 5, column 5. The cell to the left is 2, so it's replaced with 2. But in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the 2s and 0s seem to be spread in a way that they form certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are spread to the right and down, but the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's adjacent to a 2, or 0 otherwise. But how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain cells replaced based on their position. For example, if a cell is not 8, then it's replaced with 2 if it's in a certain row or column.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following approach: the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. If both are 8, then it's replaced with 0.\n\nEven though this doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would look like:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new grid\n    new_grid = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(19)]\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                new_grid[i][j] = 8\n            else:\n                # Check left\n                if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] != 8:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j-1]\n                elif i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] != 8:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n                else:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = 0\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this may not work for all examples, but it's the best I can think of.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's input. In row 4, column 3 is 2. The left cell is 8, so it's replaced with the cell above (row 3, column 3 is 8). So new_grid[i][j] is 8? But in the output, it's 2. So this is not correct.\n\nHmm, this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing each non-8 cell with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's 0, then 2. So, for example, if the cell to the left is 0, replace with 2, else keep the value.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1's row 4, column 3. The cell is 2. The left cell is 8, so it's kept as 2.\n\nRow 4, column 4 is 2. The left cell is 2, so it's kept as 2.\n\nRow 4, column 5 is 0. The left cell is 2, so it's replaced with 2. But in the output, it's 2. So that fits.\n\nRow 5, column 3 is 0. The left cell is 2 (row 5, column 2 is 0? Wait, let's check the input.\n\nIn Example 1's input, row 5 is:\n\n8 8 0 2 2 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8\n\nSo row 5, column 2 is 0. The cell to the left of column 3 is 0. So according to this rule, the cell to the left is 0, so it's replaced with 2. So new_grid[i][j] is 2. But in the output, row 5, column 3 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. I think I need to look for another approach.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing each non-8 cell with the value of the cell to the left, but if that's 0, then 2, and if that's 2, then 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing each non-8 cell with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above, and if both are 8, then 0.\n\nBut this is not working for the examples.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples.

So perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it's not 8, then it's replaced with the value of the cell to the left, or if that's not available, then the value of the cell above. If both are 8, then it's replaced with 0.\n\nEven though this doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = [[0]*13 for _ in range(19)]\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                new_grid[i][j] = 8\n            else:\n                if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] != 8:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j-1]\n                elif i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] != 8:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n                else:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = 0\n    return new_grid\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. However, given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this.\n"
