The output grid is smaller than the input grid (10x6 vs 12x10)\n2. The output grid appears to be a compressed version of the input grid\n3. The transformation seems to involve identifying patterns and replacing them with specific values\n4. The value 0 seems to be a \"background\" or \"empty\" value\n5. The values 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 appear to be \"features\" or \"objects\" that are being transformed\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves identifying patterns in the input grid and replacing them with specific values in the output grid.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

The output grid is smaller than the input grid (10x6 vs 12x10)\n2. The output grid appears to be a compressed version of the input grid\n3. The transformation seems to involve identifying patterns and replacing them with specific values\n4. The value 0 seems to be a \"background\" or \"empty\" value\n5. The values 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 appear to be \"features\" or \"objects\" that are being transformed\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves identifying patterns in the input grid and replacing them with specific values in the output grid.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
