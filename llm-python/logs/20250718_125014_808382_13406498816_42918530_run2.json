          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from the input to the output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some rows with 3s and 8s, and the output has similar patterns but with some changes. For instance, the second row of the input is 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 4 4 4 4 4 0. The output for that row is the same. But looking at other rows, like the third row of the input is 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 4 0 4 0 4 0. The output for that row is 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 4 0 4 0 4 0. Wait, that's the same as the input. But in the fourth row of the input, the output is different. Wait, no, looking at the output for Example 1, the fourth row of input is 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 4 4 4 4 4 0. The output for that row is 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 4 4 4 4 4 0. So that's the same as input. Hmm, but in the fifth row of the input, the output is different. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 3: 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 4 0 4 0 4 0\nOutput row 3: same as input. But in the output of Example 1, row 4 is same as input row 4? Wait no, looking at the output for Example 1:\n\nThe output for Example 1's row 4 is 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 4 4 4 4 4 0. Which is same as input row 4. But in the input row 5, the input is 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 4 0 4 0 4 0. The output is same as input. So maybe in some examples, the output is same as input? But that can't be right. Wait, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all zeros, same as input. The second row is same as input. The third row is same as input. The fourth row is same as input. The fifth row is same as input. The sixth row is same as input. Then seventh row is same. Then the eighth row is same as input. Then the ninth row of input is 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. The output is 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. So here, the third and fifth elements in the row are changed from 0 to 4. So the input row 9 is 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. The output is 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. So the third and fifth elements (columns 3 and 5) are changed from 0 to 4. Wait, but the input row 9 is 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. So the third element is 0, but in the output it's 4. So that's a change. So what's the pattern here?\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1, the output seems to have some patterns where certain positions are modified. For example, in the input row 9, the third and fifth elements (columns 3 and 5) are changed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are mirrored or transformed based on their position. Let's look at other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input row 9 is 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. So here, the fourth and sixth elements (columns 4 and 6) are changed from 0 to 8. Wait, but the input row 9 of Example 2 is 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. The output for that row is 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. So columns 4 and 6 (original 0s) are changed to 8, and columns 9, 10, 11 (originally 0,0,0) are changed to 3,3,3. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their position in the grid.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. For example, input row 9 is 0 8 0 8 8 8 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0. The output is 0 8 0 8 8 8 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 8 8 8 0. So in the output, the last three elements (columns 13, 14, 15) are changed from 0, 0, 0 to 8, 8, 8. So maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being modified based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of symmetry or mirroring. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 9 is 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. The original input row 9 is 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. So the third, fifth, and seventh elements (columns 3,5,7) are 0 in the input, but in the output they are 4. Wait, but in the input row 9, columns 3 and 5 are 0. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with values based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being filled with values based on their position in the grid. For example, in the input, there are certain regions where numbers are present, and the output is modifying those regions.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input has rows with 3s and 8s in certain positions, and the output seems to have similar structures. However, in some cases, the output has more 4s and 2s, but maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being filled with values based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in a certain position (like in a certain column or row), it's replaced with a different value. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row with 3s and 8s, and the output has similar rows. But in some cases, the output has 4s and 2s. Maybe the pattern is that the output is a combination of the input and some other transformations.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all zeros. The second row has 3s and 8s. The third row has 3s and 8s. The fourth row has 3s and 8s. But the fifth row has 3s and 8s. Then the sixth row is same as input. Then the seventh row is all zeros. Then the eighth row is 4s and 2s. The ninth row has 4s and 2s. The tenth row has 4s and 2s. The eleventh row has 4s and 2s. The twelfth row is same as input. Then the thirteenth row is all zeros. So maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain rows modified. But that doesn't seem to fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 2. The input row 9 is 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. So in the output, columns 4 and 6 are 8, and columns 9,10,11 are 3. So maybe the transformation is that certain positions are being filled with values based on their position. For example, in the middle columns, certain positions are being filled with values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are being filled based on their position. For example, in the input, if a cell is in a certain column, it's replaced with a different value. But how to determine which columns?\n\nLooking at the first example's output row 9: the original input row 9 is 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. The output is 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. So the third and fifth elements (columns 3 and 5) are 0 in the input, but in the output they are 4. So maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the value is replaced with a different value based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output row 9, columns 3 and 5 are 4. The original input row 9 has 0 in those positions. So maybe the transformation is that for certain columns, the value is replaced with a different value. For example, columns 3 and 5 in row 9 are replaced with 4. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output, in the input row 9, the third and fifth elements are 0, but in the output they are 4. Similarly, in the input row 9 of example 2, the fourth and sixth elements are 0, but in the output they are 8. So maybe the pattern is that in certain columns, the value is replaced based on their position. For example, columns that are even or odd, or in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is a combination of the input and some other grid. For example, in some cases, the output is the same as the input, but in other cases, certain positions are modified.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the input and output differ. For example, in Example 1's row 9, the third and fifth elements are changed. Let's check the positions of these elements.\n\nIn the input grid, the rows are 13 rows, and each row has 19 columns. So for example, in row 9 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but the examples are written with rows as 0 to 12 (since there are 13 rows). Let me check the first example's input and output:\n\nThe input for example 1 has 13 rows. The output is the same as the input except for certain rows. For example, in row 9 (assuming 0-based index), the output is modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain columns are filled with values based on their position. For example, in the input, if the column is in a certain range, it's replaced with a different value.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output, the rows that are modified are rows where the original input had certain patterns. For example, the input row 9 has a pattern of 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. The output is 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. So the third and fifth elements (columns 3 and 5) are 4. So maybe the pattern is that for certain positions, the value is replaced with a value based on their position.\n\nAnother observation: looking at the first example's output row 9, the third and fifth elements are 4, which is the same as the value in the input row 9's column 1 (which is 4). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern where the value is replaced based on the value in a certain position. For example, in the input, if a cell is in a certain column, then it's replaced with the value from another column.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output row 9, the third element is 4. In the input row 9, the first element is 4. So maybe the third element is being replaced with the first element's value. But that's just one case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain positions are mirrored. For example, in the input row 9, the third element is 0, but in the output it's 4. The fifth element is 0, but in the output it's 4. Maybe these positions are being filled with the value from the first column. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's input and output, the output seems to have certain patterns where the middle columns are filled with values. For example, in the input row 9, the third and fifth elements are 0, but in the output they are 4. The input row 9 has a 4 in the first column. So maybe the third and fifth columns are being filled with the value from the first column. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output row 9, the third and fifth columns are 4. The input row 9 has 4 in the first column. So maybe the third and fifth columns are being filled with the value from the first column. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain positions, the value is replaced with a value based on the row number. For example, in the first example's output row 9, the third and fifth columns are 4, which is the same as the value in the input row 9's first column. But that's just one case.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the pattern in the output of the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 9 is modified in the third and fifth columns. In Example 2's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are modified. In Example 3's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are modified. So maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, certain columns are modified based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the values in certain columns are replaced with the value from the same row's other columns. For example, in Example 1's row 9, the third and fifth columns are replaced with the value from the first column (which is 4). Similarly, in Example 2's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are replaced with the value from the first column (which is 8). But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's row 9, the third and fifth columns are 4. The input row 9's first column is 4. So maybe the third and fifth columns are being filled with the first column's value. Similarly, in Example 2's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are 8, which is the same as the first column's value (8). So this seems to fit.\n\nBut then, what about other positions? For example, in Example 1's row 9, the fifth column is 4. The first column is 4. So maybe for certain columns, the value is replaced with the value from the first column. But why those columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain columns (like columns 3, 5, 7, etc.), the values are replaced with the value from the first column of that row. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's row 9, the third and fifth columns are 4. These are columns 3 and 5. The first column is 4. So maybe columns that are odd-numbered positions (like 3,5,7, etc.) are being replaced with the value from the first column. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the values in certain columns are replaced with the value from the same row's other columns. For example, in the first example's row 9, the third and fifth columns are replaced with the value from the first column. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output, the rows that have changes are the ones that are in the middle of the grid. For example, the input and output for the first example have the same rows except for the ninth row. But that's not helpful.\n\nAnother observation: the output grid for all examples has the same structure as the input, but with certain patterns. For example, in the first example, the output has the same rows as the input, but in some rows, the middle columns are modified. So perhaps the transformation is that for certain positions, the value is replaced based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values in the columns that are in certain positions are replaced with the value from the same row's first column. For example, in the first example's row 9, the third and fifth columns are replaced with the first column's value (4). Similarly, in the second example's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are replaced with the first column's value (8). But why those columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the value in column 3 is replaced with the value from column 1, and column 5 is replaced with the value from column 1. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's row 9, the third and fifth columns are 4. These are columns that are even-numbered (if we count from 0, they are 2 and 4). Or maybe odd-numbered. Wait, in the first example, the third column is index 2 (assuming 0-based). So maybe the pattern is that for columns 2 and 4, the value is replaced with the value from column 0.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each row, certain columns are replaced with the value from column 0. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's row 9, the third and fifth columns are replaced with 4. The input row 9 has 4 in column 0. So maybe for certain columns, the value is replaced with the value from column 0. But which columns?\n\nIn the first example's row 9, the third and fifth columns are replaced. In the second example's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are replaced. So maybe the columns that are even-numbered (like 2, 4, 6, etc.) are being replaced with the value from column 0. But in the second example's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are replaced. If the columns are 0-based, then 4 is even, 6 is even. But why those columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain columns, the value is replaced with the value from the column that is two positions to the left. For example, in the first example's row 9, column 3 is replaced with the value from column 1. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output row 9, the third column is 4. In the input row 9, column 1 is 4. So maybe the third column is replaced with the value from column 1. Similarly, the fifth column is replaced with the value from column 1. But that's just a guess.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the examples that is consistent across all of them.\n\nLooking at Example 4's input and output. The input row 9 is 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. So the fourth and sixth columns are replaced with 2. The input row 9 has 2 in column 1 and 5. So maybe the fourth and sixth columns are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nIn this case, the fourth column is replaced with the value from column 1 (2). The sixth column is replaced with the value from column 1 (2). So this seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's row 9, the third and fifth columns are replaced with the value from column 1 (4). But in the input row 9, column 1 is 4. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 2's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are replaced with the value from column 1 (8). The input row 9 has 8 in column 1. So this fits.\n\nIn Example 3's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are replaced with the value from column 1 (6). The input row 9 has 6 in column 1. So this seems to fit.\n\nSo this suggests a pattern: for certain columns, the value is replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nBut which columns? In Example 1's row 9, columns 2 and 4 (third and fifth columns) are replaced. In Example 2's row 9, columns 3 and 5 (fourth and sixth) are replaced. In Example 4's row 9, columns 3 and 5 are replaced. So it seems that for certain rows, the columns that are even-numbered (like 2, 4, 6, etc.) are being replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and which columns are being replaced.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, the rows that are modified are the ones that have certain patterns. For example, in Example 1's row 9, the original input has 4 in column 1. The output replaces columns 2 and 4 with 4. Similarly, in Example 2's row 9, the original input has 8 in column 1. The output replaces columns 3 and 5 with 8.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that in certain rows, the columns that are even positions (like 2, 4, 6, etc.) are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Perhaps the rows that are in the middle of the grid are modified, and for those rows, certain columns are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's row 9, it's the 9th row (assuming 0-based index, it's row 8). The input for that row is part of the middle section. Similarly, in the other examples, the rows that are modified are in the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows where the row index is even or odd, certain columns are modified. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in all the examples, the modified rows are the ones that are not the first or last rows. For example, in Example 1, the first and last rows are all zeros. The middle rows are modified. So maybe the transformation is that for certain rows (like rows 1-11), certain columns are modified based on their position.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the modified columns in each example:\n\nExample 1: columns 2 and 4 (third and fifth)\nExample 2: columns 3 and 5 (fourth and sixth)\nExample 3: columns 3 and 5 (fourth and sixth)\nExample 4: columns 3 and 5 (fourth and sixth)\n\nSo, for each example, the columns being modified are columns 3 and 5 (if 0-based, that's columns 3 and 5, which are the fourth and sixth columns). Wait, but in Example 1, it's columns 2 and 4. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns being modified are the ones that are in certain positions relative to the row. For example, in the first example's row 9, the columns being modified are 2 and 4, which are two positions away from column 0. But this is not consistent across examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that in each row, the columns that are in the middle of the row are being replaced with the value from column 1. For example, in the first example's row 9, the middle columns are 2 and 4. In the second example's row 9, the middle columns are 3 and 5. This seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in each row, the columns that are even-numbered (like 2, 4, 6, etc.) are replaced with the value from column 1. But in Example 1, columns 2 and 4 are replaced, which are even. In Example 2, columns 3 and 5 are replaced, which are odd. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns that are at positions where the column index is even are replaced with the value from column 1. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output of the test input. The test input is given, and I need to write a function that transforms it. But the test input is not provided, so I need to find a pattern that works for the training examples.\n\nAnother observation: in all the examples, the output has certain patterns where the middle columns are modified. For example, in Example 1's output, the third row has 3s and 8s, but in the output row 9, the third and fifth columns are replaced with 4. So maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the middle columns are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the value in column 1 is used to fill certain positions. For example, in the first example's row 9, the value in column 1 is 4, and columns 2 and 4 are filled with 4. In the second example's row 9, the value in column 1 is 8, and columns 3 and 5 are filled with 8. In the third example's row 9, the value in column 1 is 6, and columns 3 and 5 are filled with 6. In the fourth example's row 9, the value in column 1 is 2, and columns 3 and 5 are filled with 2. So this seems to be a pattern.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for each row, if the row is in a certain position (like row 8 in 0-based), then columns 2 and 4 are filled with the value from column 1. But why columns 2 and 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns that are at even indices (like 2, 4, 6, etc.) are replaced with the value from column 1. But in the second example, the columns replaced are 3 and 5, which are odd indices. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the columns that are at positions 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1. But how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the columns that are in the middle of the row are replaced with the value from column 1. For example, in a 19-column row, the middle column is column 9 (0-based). But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the first example's output row 9, the third and fifth columns are replaced with the value from column 1. The input row 9 has 4 in column 1. The output replaces columns 2 and 4 with 4. So the pattern is that for certain rows, the columns that are two positions away from column 1 are replaced with the value from column 1. But why two positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the value in column 1 is used to fill columns that are at positions 2 and 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation would be: for each row, replace columns 2 and 4 with the value from column 1. But this doesn't fit the second example's row 9, where columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nSo this suggests that the pattern is not consistent across examples. But maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the value in column 1 is used to fill columns that are at positions 2 and 4 for even rows, and 3 and 5 for odd rows. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for certain rows, the value in column 1 is used to fill the columns that are at positions 2 and 4, and for other rows, it fills columns 3 and 5. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the value in column 1 is used to fill the columns that are at positions 2, 4, 6, etc., for certain rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of the test input. The test input has rows that are similar to the training examples. For example, the test input's row 9 is 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. The output of the test input is 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. So the fourth and sixth columns are replaced with 2. This is similar to the pattern in the other examples where columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1. So this suggests that the pattern is to replace certain columns with the value from column 1.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nIn the test input's row 9, the columns being replaced are 3 and 5 (0-based). In the first example's row 9, the columns being replaced are 2 and 4. In the second example's row 9, columns 3 and 5. In the third example's row 9, columns 3 and 5. In the fourth example's row 9, columns 3 and 5. So this is inconsistent.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is that for rows that are in the middle of the grid, the columns at positions 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the columns at positions 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1, and for other rows, columns 3 and 5 are replaced. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns that are at even positions (like 2, 4, 6, etc.) are replaced with the value from column 1. But this doesn't fit the second example's row 9.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the rows that are modified are the ones that have certain patterns. For example, in the first example's row 9, the input has 4 in column 1. The output replaces columns 2 and 4 with 4. Similarly, in the second example's row 9, the input has 8 in column 1, and the output replaces columns 3 and 5 with 8. In the third example's row 9, the input has 6 in column 1, and the output replaces columns 3 and 5 with 6. In the fourth example's row 9, the input has 2 in column 1, and the output replaces columns 3 and 5 with 2. So this suggests that for certain rows, columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nBut why those columns?\n\nMaybe the rows that are in the middle of the grid (like rows 8 in 0-based, which is the ninth row) are modified, and for those rows, columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation is: for rows where the row index is 8 (assuming 0-based), replace columns 3 and 5 with the value from column 1.\n\nBut this is just for one row. How to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the columns at positions 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1. But this would not fit the first example's row 9, where columns 2 and 4 are replaced.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all the examples, the output has the same structure as the input, but with certain columns modified. For example, the first example's output has the same rows as the input, except for the ninth row. The second example's output has the same rows as the input, except for the ninth row. The third example's output has the same rows as the input, except for the ninth row. The fourth example's output has the same rows as the input, except for the ninth row. So maybe the pattern is that for the ninth row (row 8 in 0-based), certain columns are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nIn the first example's row 9 (row 8 in 0-based), columns 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1. In the second example's row 9, columns 3 and 5 are replaced. In the third example's row 9, columns 3 and 5 are replaced. In the fourth example's row 9, columns 3 and 5 are replaced. So this suggests that for certain rows, the columns are replaced based on their position.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for rows where the row index is even, columns 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1, and for rows where the row index is odd, columns 3 and 5 are replaced. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for the ninth row, the columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1. But this would not fit the first example.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Maybe I should try to write a function that for certain rows and columns replaces the value with the value from column 1.\n\nFor example, in the first example's row 9, columns 2 and 4 are replaced. In the second example's row 9, columns 3 and 5 are replaced. So perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the columns that are at positions 2 and 4 for even rows, and 3 and 5 for odd rows.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1 if the row is in a certain range, and columns 3 and 5 otherwise.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the value in column 1 is used to fill certain columns. For example, in the first example's row 9, the value in column 1 is 4, and columns 2 and 4 are filled with 4. In the second example's row 9, the value in column 1 is 8, and columns 3 and 5 are filled with 8. So this suggests that for each row, the columns that are at positions 2 and 4 are filled with the value from column 1 for some rows, and columns 3 and 5 for others.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1 if the row is in the first part of the grid, and columns 3 and 5 if in the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1 for even rows, and columns 3 and 5 for odd rows.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1 for the first example, and columns 3 and 5 for the others. But this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. However, based on the examples, it seems that for certain rows, certain columns are replaced with the value from column 1. So perhaps the function should replace certain columns in certain rows with the value from column 1.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nLooking at the test input, the ninth row (row 8 in 0-based) is:\n\n0 2 0 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 1 0\n\nThe output for this row is:\n\n0 2 0 2 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 1 0\n\nSo the fourth and sixth columns (0-based 3 and 5) are replaced with 2. The value from column 1 is 2. So this suggests that for this row, columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that for the ninth row (row 8 in 0-based), columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nIf this is the case, then the function would replace columns 3 and 5 in row 8 with the value from column 1.\n\nBut how to generalize this to other rows.\n\nLooking at the first example's row 9 (row 8 in 0-based), the columns replaced are 2 and 4. But in the test input, it's columns 3 and 5. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nBut maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1 for the first example, and columns 3 and 5 for the others. This is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1 if the row is in the first example, and columns 3 and 5 for other examples. But this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. But based on the examples, the transformation seems to involve replacing certain columns in certain rows with the value from column 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the function should replace columns 3 and 5 in row 8 (the ninth row) with the value from column 1.\n\nBut how to determine this for other rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for rows where the row index is 8 (the ninth row), the columns at positions 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nThis would work for the test input and the second, third, and fourth examples. For the first example, it would not work, but maybe the first example has a different pattern.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nSo, the function would check if the row is 8 (0-based), and if so, replace columns 3 and 5 with the value from column 1.\n\nBut this is just for one row. How to handle other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows 1-11 (0-based 1-11), the columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the examples, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for certain rows, the columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1. This seems to work for the test input and some of the examples.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # For rows 8 (0-based), replace columns 3 and 5 with column 1's value\n    for row in transformed:\n        if row is transformed[8]:\n            val = row[1]\n            row[3] = val\n            row[5] = val\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct for the first example's row 9. However, the first example's row 9 is not modified in the output. Wait, in the first example, the output row 9 is modified. So this suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows 8 (0-based), replace columns 2 and 4 with the value from column 1. But this would work for the first example's row 9.\n\nBut this is not consistent with other examples.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I'll proceed with the assumption that the pattern is that for certain rows, certain columns are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nBut since the examples are not consistent, I'll need to find a pattern that works for as many as possible.\n\nLooking at the test input, the ninth row is modified by replacing columns 3 and 5 with the value from column 1. So I'll write the code to replace columns 3 and 5 in row 8 (0-based) with the value from column 1.\n\nBut this would not explain the first example's row 9. However, perhaps the first example's row 9 is not modified, but the other examples' rows are. But this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1, and this is done for all rows.\n\nBut this would not fit the first example's row 9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1, and this is done for all rows. Let's see what happens in the first example.\n\nIn the first example's input row 9, the value in column 1 is 4. So replacing columns 3 and 5 with 4 would give:\n\nOriginal input row 9: 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0\n\nAfter replacing columns 3 and 5 with 4: 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0\n\nWhich matches the first example's output row 9. So this suggests that this is the correct pattern.\n\nBut in the second example's input row 9, the value in column 1 is 8. Replacing columns 3 and 5 with 8 would give:\n\nOriginal input row 9: 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 0\n\nAfter replacing columns 3 and 5 with 8: 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 0\n\nWhich matches the second example's output row 9.\n\nSimilarly, for the third example's input row 9, the value in column 1 is 6. Replacing columns 3 and 5 with 6 would give:\n\nOriginal input row 9: 0 6 0 8 8 8 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0\n\nAfter replacing columns 3 and 5 with 6: 0 6 0 6 6 6 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0\n\nWait, but the third example's output row 9 is 0 6 0 8 8 8 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 8 8 8 0. So this does not match. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nWait, the third example's input row 9 is:\n\n0 6 0 8 8 8 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 6 0 8 8 8 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 8 8 8 0\n\nSo in the output, columns 13, 14, 15 are 8, 8, 8. But according to the previous pattern, columns 3 and 5 are replaced with 6. But in the input, columns 3 and 5 are 8 and 8. So this suggests that the pattern is not to replace columns 3 and 5 with column 1's value.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nBut in the third example's input row 9, the output has columns 13, 14, 15 replaced with 8. So this suggests that the pattern is different for different rows.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1. This works for the first, second, and fourth examples, but not the third. However, perhaps the third example has a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1, and for some rows, other columns are replaced.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and implement the code.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row in transformed:\n        # Replace columns 3 and 5 with value from column 1\n        if len(row) > 5:\n            val = row[1]\n            row[3] = val\n            row[5] = val\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace columns 3 and 5 in all rows. However, in the third example's input row 9, this would replace columns 3 and 5 with 6 (since column 1 is 6). The input row 9 is 0 6 0 8 8 8 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0. After replacing columns 3 and 5 with 6, the row becomes 0 6 0 6 6 6 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0. But the output for this row is 0 6 0 8 8 8 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 8 8 8 0. So this is not matching. So this suggests that the pattern is not this.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is that for certain rows, columns 3 and 5 are replaced, and for others, different columns are replaced.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1, and see if this works for the test input.\n\nThe test input's row 9 is 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. Replacing columns 3 and 5 with 2 gives 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 1 0, which matches the test output.\n\nSo this works for the test input.\n\nFor the first example's row 9, replacing columns 3 and 5 with 4 gives the correct output.\n\nFor the second example's row 9, it works.\n\nFor the third example's row 9, it doesn't, but perhaps there's a different pattern for that row.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code and see.\n\nSo the final code would be to replace columns 3 and 5 in all rows with the value from column 1.\n\nBut wait, in the third example's input row 9, the output is different. So this suggests that this pattern is not correct for all examples. However, the test input and some examples work.\n\nBut the problem says that the function must produce a 13x19 grid. So the code must ensure that the output is 13 rows and 19 columns.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row in transformed:\n        if len(row) > 5:\n            val = row[1]\n            row[3] = val\n            row[5] = val\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace columns 3 and 5 in all rows. But this may not be correct for all examples.\n\nBut given the time, this is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from the input to the output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some rows with 3s and 8s, and the output has similar patterns but with some changes. For instance, the second row of the input is 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 4 4 4 4 4 0. The output for that row is the same. But looking at other rows, like the third row of the input is 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 4 0 4 0 4 0. The output for that row is 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 4 0 4 0 4 0. Wait, that's the same as the input. But in the fourth row of the input, the output is different. Wait, no, looking at the output for Example 1, the fourth row of input is 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 4 4 4 4 4 0. The output for that row is 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 4 4 4 4 4 0. So that's the same as input. Hmm, but in the fifth row of the input, the output is different. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 3: 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 4 0 4 0 4 0\nOutput row 3: same as input. But in the output of Example 1, row 4 is same as input row 4? Wait no, looking at the output for Example 1:\n\nThe output for Example 1's row 4 is 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 4 4 4 4 4 0. Which is same as input row 4. But in the input row 5, the input is 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 4 0 4 0 4 0. The output is same as input. So maybe in some examples, the output is same as input? But that can't be right. Wait, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all zeros, same as input. The second row is same as input. The third row is same as input. The fourth row is same as input. The fifth row is same as input. The sixth row is same as input. Then seventh row is same. Then the eighth row is same as input. Then the ninth row of input is 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. The output is 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. So here, the third and fifth elements in the row are changed from 0 to 4. So the input row 9 is 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. The output is 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. So the third and fifth elements (columns 3 and 5) are changed from 0 to 4. Wait, but the input row 9 is 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. So the third element is 0, but in the output it's 4. So that's a change. So what's the pattern here?\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1, the output seems to have some patterns where certain positions are modified. For example, in the input row 9, the third and fifth elements (columns 3 and 5) are changed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are mirrored or transformed based on their position. Let's look at other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input row 9 is 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. So here, the fourth and sixth elements (columns 4 and 6) are changed from 0 to 8. Wait, but the input row 9 of Example 2 is 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. The output for that row is 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. So columns 4 and 6 (original 0s) are changed to 8, and columns 9, 10, 11 (originally 0,0,0) are changed to 3,3,3. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their position in the grid.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. For example, input row 9 is 0 8 0 8 8 8 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0. The output is 0 8 0 8 8 8 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 8 8 8 0. So in the output, the last three elements (columns 13, 14, 15) are changed from 0, 0, 0 to 8, 8, 8. So maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being modified based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of symmetry or mirroring. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 9 is 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. The original input row 9 is 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. So the third, fifth, and seventh elements (columns 3,5,7) are 0 in the input, but in the output they are 4. Wait, but in the input row 9, columns 3 and 5 are 0. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with values based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being filled with values based on their position in the grid. For example, in the input, there are certain regions where numbers are present, and the output is modifying those regions.\n\nLooking at the first example, the input has rows with 3s and 8s in certain positions, and the output seems to have similar structures. However, in some cases, the output has more 4s and 2s, but maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being filled with values based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in a certain position (like in a certain column or row), it's replaced with a different value. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row with 3s and 8s, and the output has similar rows. But in some cases, the output has 4s and 2s. Maybe the pattern is that the output is a combination of the input and some other transformations.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all zeros. The second row has 3s and 8s. The third row has 3s and 8s. The fourth row has 3s and 8s. But the fifth row has 3s and 8s. Then the sixth row is same as input. Then the seventh row is all zeros. Then the eighth row is 4s and 2s. The ninth row has 4s and 2s. The tenth row has 4s and 2s. The eleventh row has 4s and 2s. The twelfth row is same as input. Then the thirteenth row is all zeros. So maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain rows modified. But that doesn't seem to fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 2. The input row 9 is 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 3 0 3 3 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. So in the output, columns 4 and 6 are 8, and columns 9,10,11 are 3. So maybe the transformation is that certain positions are being filled with values based on their position. For example, in the middle columns, certain positions are being filled with values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are being filled based on their position. For example, in the input, if a cell is in a certain column, it's replaced with a different value. But how to determine which columns?\n\nLooking at the first example's output row 9: the original input row 9 is 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. The output is 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. So the third and fifth elements (columns 3 and 5) are 0 in the input, but in the output they are 4. So maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the value is replaced with a different value based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output row 9, columns 3 and 5 are 4. The original input row 9 has 0 in those positions. So maybe the transformation is that for certain columns, the value is replaced with a different value. For example, columns 3 and 5 in row 9 are replaced with 4. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output, in the input row 9, the third and fifth elements are 0, but in the output they are 4. Similarly, in the input row 9 of example 2, the fourth and sixth elements are 0, but in the output they are 8. So maybe the pattern is that in certain columns, the value is replaced based on their position. For example, columns that are even or odd, or in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is a combination of the input and some other grid. For example, in some cases, the output is the same as the input, but in other cases, certain positions are modified.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the input and output differ. For example, in Example 1's row 9, the third and fifth elements are changed. Let's check the positions of these elements.\n\nIn the input grid, the rows are 13 rows, and each row has 19 columns. So for example, in row 9 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but the examples are written with rows as 0 to 12 (since there are 13 rows). Let me check the first example's input and output:\n\nThe input for example 1 has 13 rows. The output is the same as the input except for certain rows. For example, in row 9 (assuming 0-based index), the output is modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain columns are filled with values based on their position. For example, in the input, if the column is in a certain range, it's replaced with a different value.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output, the rows that are modified are rows where the original input had certain patterns. For example, the input row 9 has a pattern of 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. The output is 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0. So the third and fifth elements (columns 3 and 5) are 4. So maybe the pattern is that for certain positions, the value is replaced with a value based on their position.\n\nAnother observation: looking at the first example's output row 9, the third and fifth elements are 4, which is the same as the value in the input row 9's column 1 (which is 4). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern where the value is replaced based on the value in a certain position. For example, in the input, if a cell is in a certain column, then it's replaced with the value from another column.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output row 9, the third element is 4. In the input row 9, the first element is 4. So maybe the third element is being replaced with the first element's value. But that's just one case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain positions are mirrored. For example, in the input row 9, the third element is 0, but in the output it's 4. The fifth element is 0, but in the output it's 4. Maybe these positions are being filled with the value from the first column. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's input and output, the output seems to have certain patterns where the middle columns are filled with values. For example, in the input row 9, the third and fifth elements are 0, but in the output they are 4. The input row 9 has a 4 in the first column. So maybe the third and fifth columns are being filled with the value from the first column. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output row 9, the third and fifth columns are 4. The input row 9 has 4 in the first column. So maybe the third and fifth columns are being filled with the value from the first column. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain positions, the value is replaced with a value based on the row number. For example, in the first example's output row 9, the third and fifth columns are 4, which is the same as the value in the input row 9's first column. But that's just one case.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the pattern in the output of the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 9 is modified in the third and fifth columns. In Example 2's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are modified. In Example 3's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are modified. So maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, certain columns are modified based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the values in certain columns are replaced with the value from the same row's other columns. For example, in Example 1's row 9, the third and fifth columns are replaced with the value from the first column (which is 4). Similarly, in Example 2's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are replaced with the value from the first column (which is 8). But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's row 9, the third and fifth columns are 4. The input row 9's first column is 4. So maybe the third and fifth columns are being filled with the first column's value. Similarly, in Example 2's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are 8, which is the same as the first column's value (8). So this seems to fit.\n\nBut then, what about other positions? For example, in Example 1's row 9, the fifth column is 4. The first column is 4. So maybe for certain columns, the value is replaced with the value from the first column. But why those columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain columns (like columns 3, 5, 7, etc.), the values are replaced with the value from the first column of that row. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's row 9, the third and fifth columns are 4. These are columns 3 and 5. The first column is 4. So maybe columns that are odd-numbered positions (like 3,5,7, etc.) are being replaced with the value from the first column. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the values in certain columns are replaced with the value from the same row's other columns. For example, in the first example's row 9, the third and fifth columns are replaced with the value from the first column. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output, the rows that have changes are the ones that are in the middle of the grid. For example, the input and output for the first example have the same rows except for the ninth row. But that's not helpful.\n\nAnother observation: the output grid for all examples has the same structure as the input, but with certain patterns. For example, in the first example, the output has the same rows as the input, but in some rows, the middle columns are modified. So perhaps the transformation is that for certain positions, the value is replaced based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values in the columns that are in certain positions are replaced with the value from the same row's first column. For example, in the first example's row 9, the third and fifth columns are replaced with the first column's value (4). Similarly, in the second example's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are replaced with the first column's value (8). But why those columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the value in column 3 is replaced with the value from column 1, and column 5 is replaced with the value from column 1. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's row 9, the third and fifth columns are 4. These are columns that are even-numbered (if we count from 0, they are 2 and 4). Or maybe odd-numbered. Wait, in the first example, the third column is index 2 (assuming 0-based). So maybe the pattern is that for columns 2 and 4, the value is replaced with the value from column 0.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each row, certain columns are replaced with the value from column 0. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's row 9, the third and fifth columns are replaced with 4. The input row 9 has 4 in column 0. So maybe for certain columns, the value is replaced with the value from column 0. But which columns?\n\nIn the first example's row 9, the third and fifth columns are replaced. In the second example's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are replaced. So maybe the columns that are even-numbered (like 2, 4, 6, etc.) are being replaced with the value from column 0. But in the second example's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are replaced. If the columns are 0-based, then 4 is even, 6 is even. But why those columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain columns, the value is replaced with the value from the column that is two positions to the left. For example, in the first example's row 9, column 3 is replaced with the value from column 1. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output row 9, the third column is 4. In the input row 9, column 1 is 4. So maybe the third column is replaced with the value from column 1. Similarly, the fifth column is replaced with the value from column 1. But that's just a guess.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the examples that is consistent across all of them.\n\nLooking at Example 4's input and output. The input row 9 is 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. The output is 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. So the fourth and sixth columns are replaced with 2. The input row 9 has 2 in column 1 and 5. So maybe the fourth and sixth columns are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nIn this case, the fourth column is replaced with the value from column 1 (2). The sixth column is replaced with the value from column 1 (2). So this seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 1's row 9, the third and fifth columns are replaced with the value from column 1 (4). But in the input row 9, column 1 is 4. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn Example 2's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are replaced with the value from column 1 (8). The input row 9 has 8 in column 1. So this fits.\n\nIn Example 3's row 9, the fourth and sixth columns are replaced with the value from column 1 (6). The input row 9 has 6 in column 1. So this seems to fit.\n\nSo this suggests a pattern: for certain columns, the value is replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nBut which columns? In Example 1's row 9, columns 2 and 4 (third and fifth columns) are replaced. In Example 2's row 9, columns 3 and 5 (fourth and sixth) are replaced. In Example 4's row 9, columns 3 and 5 are replaced. So it seems that for certain rows, the columns that are even-numbered (like 2, 4, 6, etc.) are being replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and which columns are being replaced.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, the rows that are modified are the ones that have certain patterns. For example, in Example 1's row 9, the original input has 4 in column 1. The output replaces columns 2 and 4 with 4. Similarly, in Example 2's row 9, the original input has 8 in column 1. The output replaces columns 3 and 5 with 8.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that in certain rows, the columns that are even positions (like 2, 4, 6, etc.) are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Perhaps the rows that are in the middle of the grid are modified, and for those rows, certain columns are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's row 9, it's the 9th row (assuming 0-based index, it's row 8). The input for that row is part of the middle section. Similarly, in the other examples, the rows that are modified are in the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows where the row index is even or odd, certain columns are modified. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in all the examples, the modified rows are the ones that are not the first or last rows. For example, in Example 1, the first and last rows are all zeros. The middle rows are modified. So maybe the transformation is that for certain rows (like rows 1-11), certain columns are modified based on their position.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the modified columns in each example:\n\nExample 1: columns 2 and 4 (third and fifth)\nExample 2: columns 3 and 5 (fourth and sixth)\nExample 3: columns 3 and 5 (fourth and sixth)\nExample 4: columns 3 and 5 (fourth and sixth)\n\nSo, for each example, the columns being modified are columns 3 and 5 (if 0-based, that's columns 3 and 5, which are the fourth and sixth columns). Wait, but in Example 1, it's columns 2 and 4. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns being modified are the ones that are in certain positions relative to the row. For example, in the first example's row 9, the columns being modified are 2 and 4, which are two positions away from column 0. But this is not consistent across examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that in each row, the columns that are in the middle of the row are being replaced with the value from column 1. For example, in the first example's row 9, the middle columns are 2 and 4. In the second example's row 9, the middle columns are 3 and 5. This seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in each row, the columns that are even-numbered (like 2, 4, 6, etc.) are replaced with the value from column 1. But in Example 1, columns 2 and 4 are replaced, which are even. In Example 2, columns 3 and 5 are replaced, which are odd. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns that are at positions where the column index is even are replaced with the value from column 1. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output of the test input. The test input is given, and I need to write a function that transforms it. But the test input is not provided, so I need to find a pattern that works for the training examples.\n\nAnother observation: in all the examples, the output has certain patterns where the middle columns are modified. For example, in Example 1's output, the third row has 3s and 8s, but in the output row 9, the third and fifth columns are replaced with 4. So maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the middle columns are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the value in column 1 is used to fill certain positions. For example, in the first example's row 9, the value in column 1 is 4, and columns 2 and 4 are filled with 4. In the second example's row 9, the value in column 1 is 8, and columns 3 and 5 are filled with 8. In the third example's row 9, the value in column 1 is 6, and columns 3 and 5 are filled with 6. In the fourth example's row 9, the value in column 1 is 2, and columns 3 and 5 are filled with 2. So this seems to be a pattern.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for each row, if the row is in a certain position (like row 8 in 0-based), then columns 2 and 4 are filled with the value from column 1. But why columns 2 and 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns that are at even indices (like 2, 4, 6, etc.) are replaced with the value from column 1. But in the second example, the columns replaced are 3 and 5, which are odd indices. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the columns that are at positions 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1. But how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the columns that are in the middle of the row are replaced with the value from column 1. For example, in a 19-column row, the middle column is column 9 (0-based). But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the first example's output row 9, the third and fifth columns are replaced with the value from column 1. The input row 9 has 4 in column 1. The output replaces columns 2 and 4 with 4. So the pattern is that for certain rows, the columns that are two positions away from column 1 are replaced with the value from column 1. But why two positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the value in column 1 is used to fill columns that are at positions 2 and 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation would be: for each row, replace columns 2 and 4 with the value from column 1. But this doesn't fit the second example's row 9, where columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nSo this suggests that the pattern is not consistent across examples. But maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the value in column 1 is used to fill columns that are at positions 2 and 4 for even rows, and 3 and 5 for odd rows. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for certain rows, the value in column 1 is used to fill the columns that are at positions 2 and 4, and for other rows, it fills columns 3 and 5. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the value in column 1 is used to fill the columns that are at positions 2, 4, 6, etc., for certain rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of the test input. The test input has rows that are similar to the training examples. For example, the test input's row 9 is 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. The output of the test input is 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. So the fourth and sixth columns are replaced with 2. This is similar to the pattern in the other examples where columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1. So this suggests that the pattern is to replace certain columns with the value from column 1.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nIn the test input's row 9, the columns being replaced are 3 and 5 (0-based). In the first example's row 9, the columns being replaced are 2 and 4. In the second example's row 9, columns 3 and 5. In the third example's row 9, columns 3 and 5. In the fourth example's row 9, columns 3 and 5. So this is inconsistent.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is that for rows that are in the middle of the grid, the columns at positions 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the columns at positions 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1, and for other rows, columns 3 and 5 are replaced. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns that are at even positions (like 2, 4, 6, etc.) are replaced with the value from column 1. But this doesn't fit the second example's row 9.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the rows that are modified are the ones that have certain patterns. For example, in the first example's row 9, the input has 4 in column 1. The output replaces columns 2 and 4 with 4. Similarly, in the second example's row 9, the input has 8 in column 1, and the output replaces columns 3 and 5 with 8. In the third example's row 9, the input has 6 in column 1, and the output replaces columns 3 and 5 with 6. In the fourth example's row 9, the input has 2 in column 1, and the output replaces columns 3 and 5 with 2. So this suggests that for certain rows, columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nBut why those columns?\n\nMaybe the rows that are in the middle of the grid (like rows 8 in 0-based, which is the ninth row) are modified, and for those rows, columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation is: for rows where the row index is 8 (assuming 0-based), replace columns 3 and 5 with the value from column 1.\n\nBut this is just for one row. How to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the columns at positions 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1. But this would not fit the first example's row 9, where columns 2 and 4 are replaced.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in all the examples, the output has the same structure as the input, but with certain columns modified. For example, the first example's output has the same rows as the input, except for the ninth row. The second example's output has the same rows as the input, except for the ninth row. The third example's output has the same rows as the input, except for the ninth row. The fourth example's output has the same rows as the input, except for the ninth row. So maybe the pattern is that for the ninth row (row 8 in 0-based), certain columns are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nIn the first example's row 9 (row 8 in 0-based), columns 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1. In the second example's row 9, columns 3 and 5 are replaced. In the third example's row 9, columns 3 and 5 are replaced. In the fourth example's row 9, columns 3 and 5 are replaced. So this suggests that for certain rows, the columns are replaced based on their position.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for rows where the row index is even, columns 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1, and for rows where the row index is odd, columns 3 and 5 are replaced. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for the ninth row, the columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1. But this would not fit the first example.\n\nThis is getting too stuck. Maybe I should try to write a function that for certain rows and columns replaces the value with the value from column 1.\n\nFor example, in the first example's row 9, columns 2 and 4 are replaced. In the second example's row 9, columns 3 and 5 are replaced. So perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the columns that are at positions 2 and 4 for even rows, and 3 and 5 for odd rows.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1 if the row is in a certain range, and columns 3 and 5 otherwise.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the value in column 1 is used to fill certain columns. For example, in the first example's row 9, the value in column 1 is 4, and columns 2 and 4 are filled with 4. In the second example's row 9, the value in column 1 is 8, and columns 3 and 5 are filled with 8. So this suggests that for each row, the columns that are at positions 2 and 4 are filled with the value from column 1 for some rows, and columns 3 and 5 for others.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1 if the row is in the first part of the grid, and columns 3 and 5 if in the second part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1 for even rows, and columns 3 and 5 for odd rows.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1 for the first example, and columns 3 and 5 for the others. But this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. However, based on the examples, it seems that for certain rows, certain columns are replaced with the value from column 1. So perhaps the function should replace certain columns in certain rows with the value from column 1.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nLooking at the test input, the ninth row (row 8 in 0-based) is:\n\n0 2 0 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 1 0\n\nThe output for this row is:\n\n0 2 0 2 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 1 0\n\nSo the fourth and sixth columns (0-based 3 and 5) are replaced with 2. The value from column 1 is 2. So this suggests that for this row, columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that for the ninth row (row 8 in 0-based), columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nIf this is the case, then the function would replace columns 3 and 5 in row 8 with the value from column 1.\n\nBut how to generalize this to other rows.\n\nLooking at the first example's row 9 (row 8 in 0-based), the columns replaced are 2 and 4. But in the test input, it's columns 3 and 5. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nBut maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1 for the first example, and columns 3 and 5 for the others. This is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 2 and 4 are replaced with the value from column 1 if the row is in the first example, and columns 3 and 5 for other examples. But this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. But based on the examples, the transformation seems to involve replacing certain columns in certain rows with the value from column 1.\n\nSo, perhaps the function should replace columns 3 and 5 in row 8 (the ninth row) with the value from column 1.\n\nBut how to determine this for other rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for rows where the row index is 8 (the ninth row), the columns at positions 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nThis would work for the test input and the second, third, and fourth examples. For the first example, it would not work, but maybe the first example has a different pattern.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nSo, the function would check if the row is 8 (0-based), and if so, replace columns 3 and 5 with the value from column 1.\n\nBut this is just for one row. How to handle other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows 1-11 (0-based 1-11), the columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the examples, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for certain rows, the columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1. This seems to work for the test input and some of the examples.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # For rows 8 (0-based), replace columns 3 and 5 with column 1's value\n    for row in transformed:\n        if row is transformed[8]:\n            val = row[1]\n            row[3] = val\n            row[5] = val\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct for the first example's row 9. However, the first example's row 9 is not modified in the output. Wait, in the first example, the output row 9 is modified. So this suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for rows 8 (0-based), replace columns 2 and 4 with the value from column 1. But this would work for the first example's row 9.\n\nBut this is not consistent with other examples.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I'll proceed with the assumption that the pattern is that for certain rows, certain columns are replaced with the value from column 1.\n\nBut since the examples are not consistent, I'll need to find a pattern that works for as many as possible.\n\nLooking at the test input, the ninth row is modified by replacing columns 3 and 5 with the value from column 1. So I'll write the code to replace columns 3 and 5 in row 8 (0-based) with the value from column 1.\n\nBut this would not explain the first example's row 9. However, perhaps the first example's row 9 is not modified, but the other examples' rows are. But this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1, and this is done for all rows.\n\nBut this would not fit the first example's row 9.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the columns at positions 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1, and this is done for all rows. Let's see what happens in the first example.\n\nIn the first example's input row 9, the value in column 1 is 4. So replacing columns 3 and 5 with 4 would give:\n\nOriginal input row 9: 0 4 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0\n\nAfter replacing columns 3 and 5 with 4: 0 4 0 4 0 4 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 0 7 0\n\nWhich matches the first example's output row 9. So this suggests that this is the correct pattern.\n\nBut in the second example's input row 9, the value in column 1 is 8. Replacing columns 3 and 5 with 8 would give:\n\nOriginal input row 9: 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 0\n\nAfter replacing columns 3 and 5 with 8: 0 8 0 8 0 8 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 1 0\n\nWhich matches the second example's output row 9.\n\nSimilarly, for the third example's input row 9, the value in column 1 is 6. Replacing columns 3 and 5 with 6 would give:\n\nOriginal input row 9: 0 6 0 8 8 8 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0\n\nAfter replacing columns 3 and 5 with 6: 0 6 0 6 6 6 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0\n\nWait, but the third example's output row 9 is 0 6 0 8 8 8 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 8 8 8 0. So this does not match. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nWait, the third example's input row 9 is:\n\n0 6 0 8 8 8 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 6 0 8 8 8 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 8 8 8 0\n\nSo in the output, columns 13, 14, 15 are 8, 8, 8. But according to the previous pattern, columns 3 and 5 are replaced with 6. But in the input, columns 3 and 5 are 8 and 8. So this suggests that the pattern is not to replace columns 3 and 5 with column 1's value.\n\nThis is conflicting.\n\nBut in the third example's input row 9, the output has columns 13, 14, 15 replaced with 8. So this suggests that the pattern is different for different rows.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1. This works for the first, second, and fourth examples, but not the third. However, perhaps the third example has a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1, and for some rows, other columns are replaced.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and implement the code.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row in transformed:\n        # Replace columns 3 and 5 with value from column 1\n        if len(row) > 5:\n            val = row[1]\n            row[3] = val\n            row[5] = val\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace columns 3 and 5 in all rows. However, in the third example's input row 9, this would replace columns 3 and 5 with 6 (since column 1 is 6). The input row 9 is 0 6 0 8 8 8 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0. After replacing columns 3 and 5 with 6, the row becomes 0 6 0 6 6 6 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 0 0 8 0. But the output for this row is 0 6 0 8 8 8 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 8 0 8 8 8 0. So this is not matching. So this suggests that the pattern is not this.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is that for certain rows, columns 3 and 5 are replaced, and for others, different columns are replaced.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, columns 3 and 5 are replaced with the value from column 1, and see if this works for the test input.\n\nThe test input's row 9 is 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 1 0. Replacing columns 3 and 5 with 2 gives 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 1 0, which matches the test output.\n\nSo this works for the test input.\n\nFor the first example's row 9, replacing columns 3 and 5 with 4 gives the correct output.\n\nFor the second example's row 9, it works.\n\nFor the third example's row 9, it doesn't, but perhaps there's a different pattern for that row.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code and see.\n\nSo the final code would be to replace columns 3 and 5 in all rows with the value from column 1.\n\nBut wait, in the third example's input row 9, the output is different. So this suggests that this pattern is not correct for all examples. However, the test input and some examples work.\n\nBut the problem says that the function must produce a 13x19 grid. So the code must ensure that the output is 13 rows and 19 columns.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row in transformed:\n        if len(row) > 5:\n            val = row[1]\n            row[3] = val\n            row[5] = val\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace columns 3 and 5 in all rows. But this may not be correct for all examples.\n\nBut given the time, this is the best I can do.\n"
