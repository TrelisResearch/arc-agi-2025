          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe several patterns that might be involved in the transformation:\n\n1. **Propagation of values**: Certain values (like 4, 7, 8, 9) seem to propagate from their initial positions to adjacent cells.\n2. **Expansion of regions**: Values seem to expand from their initial positions, filling neighboring cells.\n3. **Consistency in patterns**: There are consistent patterns in how values spread and how certain numbers are transformed.\n4. **Boundary effects**: Values near the edges of the grid seem to be affected differently.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading values from their initial positions to adjacent cells, with some form of propagation or expansion.\n\nHere's my implementation of this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = np.copy(grid_np)\n    \n    # Define the directions we'll check (up, down, left, right, and diagonals)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(21):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value to neighboring cells\n                for di, dj in directions:\n                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                    if 0 <= ni < 23 and 0 <= nj < 21:\n                        # If the neighboring cell is 0, set it to the same value\n                        if transformed[ni][nj] == 0:\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed = np.copy(grid_np)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 1)]\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(21):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                for di, dj in directions:\n                    ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                    if 0 <= ni < 23 and 0 <= nj < 21:\n                        if transformed[ni][nj] == 0:\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = grid_np[i][j]\n    return transformed.tolist()\n```",

There are specific positions where numbers are transformed from 0 to other values (e.g., 4 to 7, 2 to 2, 3 to 3, etc.)\n2.

Some numbers appear to be replaced with other numbers in a way that seems to be based on their position in the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain numbers with other numbers based on their position\n- Expanding or contracting certain regions of the grid\n- Maintaining the overall structure of the grid\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
