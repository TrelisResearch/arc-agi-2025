If a shape is a single\u2010row bar, rotate it to vertical to approximate the observed rotations in the training examples.\n- Return the transformed grid."

If a shape is a single\u2010row bar, rotate it to vertical to approximate the observed rotations in the training examples.\n- Return the transformed grid."
