          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 22x25. The input seems to have a repeating pattern. Let me check the input and output for that example. The input rows seem to have a pattern that repeats every 6 rows. For instance, looking at the first few rows of input and output:\n\nInput rows 1-6:\nRow 1: 1 6 1 1 1 1 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1\nRow 2: 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 5 4 5 2 1 2 5 4 5 2 1 2 5 4 5 2\nRow 3: 3 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 6 5 6 3 1 1 1 1 1 3 2 3 6 5 6 3\nRow 4: 4 3 1 1 1 1 1 3 4 1 6 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4\nRow 5: 5 4 5 2 1 2 5 4 5 2 1 2 5 1 1 1 1 1 5 4 5 2 1 2 5\nRow 6: 6 5 6 3 2 3 6 5 6 3 2 3 6 1 1 1 1 1 6 5 6 3 2 3 6\n\nThe output for these rows is similar but with some changes. For example, in the first row of output, it's 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. Comparing to the input row 1, it seems like the numbers are changing in a way that might be a shift or replacement. Looking at the first few elements of input row 1: 1 6 1 1 1 1 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. The output row 1 is 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. So the pattern seems to be that the third element is changing from 1 to 4, then 3, then 4, etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their position. Let me check the output of example 1. The output seems to have a structure where every third element is changing. For example, in the first row of input, the third element is 1, but in the output, it's 1 again. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again. The input row 1 starts with 1, 6, 1, then 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1. The output row 1 is 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. So the third element is 1, but the fourth is 4, fifth is 3, sixth is 4, then seventh is 1. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced based on their position in the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain positions are shifted or replaced based on their row and column indices. For example, maybe the output is generated by some kind of rotation or reflection. But looking at the output of example 1, it's possible that the output is a shifted version of the input. For example, in the first row of input, the elements after the first two are 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1. The output row is 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. So the first three elements are the same as input, but then starting from the fourth element, it's 4, 3, 4, 1, 6, etc. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced based on their position in the row.\n\nLooking at example 2, the input and output seem to have similar structures. For example, the first row of input is 7 5 5 7 4 3 4 7 5 5 7 4 3 4 7 5 5 7 4 3 4 7 5 5 7. The output is the same as the input. Wait, that's strange. But looking at the second row of input: 1 6 6 1 5 4 5 1 6 6 1 5 4 5 1 6 6 1 5 4 5 1 6 6 1. The output is the same. But in example 2, the output is the same as the input? Or maybe not. Wait, looking at example 2's output, the first row is the same as input. But in example 2, the input and output are the same for some rows. But in other rows, like row 5 of input, it's 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 1 1 1 1 3 5. The output is 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5. So some elements are changed. So perhaps the pattern is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a transformation that involves rotating the grid in some way. But the output of example 1 seems to have a pattern where certain positions are modified. For example, in the first row of example 1's input, the elements after the first two are 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1. The output row is 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. So the third element is 1, but then the fourth is 4, fifth is 3, sixth is 4, then seventh is 1. So maybe the pattern is that every third element is being replaced with a certain value. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the first three elements are 1,6,1, then the next elements are 4,3,4, then 1,6,1, etc. So maybe the pattern is that in the output, the elements are shifted in some way. For example, the first row of input is 1 6 1 1 1 1 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. The output is 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. So the first three elements are the same as input, then the next three elements are 4,3,4, then 1,6,1, etc. So maybe the pattern is that the elements are being replaced in a certain way based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and replacing certain positions with values based on their position. For example, in the input, the third element is 1, but in the output, it's 1 again. But the fourth element is 1 in input, but in output it's 4. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced based on their row and column indices.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. The input for example 3's first row is 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7. The output is the same as input. But in other rows, like row 2, input is 8 5 4 5 8 5 4 5 8 5 4 5 8 5 4 5 8 5 4 5 8 5 4 5 8. The output is the same. But in row 3, input is 1 6 5 6 1 6 5 6 1 6 5 6 1 6 5 6 1 6 5 6 1 6 5 6 1. Output is same. So maybe for some rows, the output is same as input. But in example 3's row 5, the input is 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4. The output is same. But in row 6, input is 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5. Output is same. So maybe in example 3, the output is same as input. But that's not possible because the test input is different. So perhaps the pattern is different for different examples.\n\nWait, looking at example 1's output, the first row is the same as the input's first row? No. Let me check again. The input for example 1's first row is 1 6 1 1 1 1 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. The output is 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. So the first three elements are same, but then the fourth element is 4, fifth is 3, sixth is 4, seventh is 1. So it seems that the pattern is that certain positions are being replaced. For example, in the input, the fourth element is 1, but in the output, it's 4. The fifth is 1, but in output it's 3. Sixth is 1, but output is 4. So maybe there's a pattern where every third element after the first two is being replaced with a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and replacing certain positions based on their position. For example, in the first row of example 1, the elements are being transformed in a way that every third element (starting from position 3) is being replaced with a certain pattern. Let's see: positions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of rotation or reflection. For example, looking at the first row of example 1's input, maybe the output is a shifted version. But I'm not seeing it clearly.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the elements are grouped in triplets. For example, the first three elements are 1,6,1. Then the next three are 4,3,4. Then 1,6,1, etc. So maybe the pattern is that every three elements are being transformed in a certain way. For example, the first three elements are 1,6,1. Then the next three are 4,3,4, then 1,6,1, etc. So perhaps the pattern is that in the output, certain triplets are being replaced with others.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input? For example, in the input's first row, the elements are 1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1. The output is 1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1. So the first three elements are the same as input. Then the next three elements (positions 3-5) are 1,1,1 in input, but in output they are 4,3,4. Then positions 6-8 are 1,6,1 in input, but in output they are 1,6,1. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions based on their row number. For example, in even rows, certain transformations are applied. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where each row is shifted in some way. For example, in example 1's input, the first row is transformed by replacing certain elements. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The first row of input is 7 5 5 7 4 3 4 7 5 5 7 4 3 4 7 5 5 7 4 3 4 7 5 5 7. The output is the same as input. So perhaps for some rows, the output is same as input. But in other rows, like row 5, the input is 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 1 1 1 1 3 5. The output is 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5. So some elements are changed. So maybe the transformation is not uniform across all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row number. For example, in even rows, certain transformations are applied. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: looking at the output of example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the elements are grouped in triplets. For example, the first three elements are 1,6,1. Then the next three are 4,3,4. Then 1,6,1, and so on. So maybe the pattern is that the output is generated by replacing every third element with a certain value based on the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and replacing certain positions based on their position in the row. For example, in the first row of example 1's input, the fourth element is 1, but in the output it's 4. The fifth is 1, but in output it's 3. The sixth is 1, but output is 4. So maybe the pattern is that for positions starting at 3, every third element is replaced with a certain value.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Let's think about the positions. For example, in the first row of example 1, the elements are:\n\nIndices 0-23 (since it's 25 elements). Let's look at the first row:\n\nInput: [1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\nOutput: [1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\nSo the output is the same as the input except for certain positions. For example, positions 3,4,5 in the input are 1,1,1, but in output they are 4,3,4. Then positions 6,7,8 are 1,6,1 (same as input). Then positions 9,10,11 are 4,3,4 (same as input). Then positions 12,13,14 are 1,6,1 (same as input). Then positions 15,16,17 are 4,3,4 (same as input). Then positions 18,19,20 are 1,6,1 (same as input). Then positions 21,22,23 are 4,3,4 (same as input).\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that in the output, the elements at positions 3,4,5 are 4,3,4. Then positions 6,7,8 are same as input. Then positions 9,10,11 are same as input. Wait, but in the input, positions 3-5 are 1,1,1. In the output, they are 4,3,4. Then positions 6-8 are 1,6,1. Which is same as input. So maybe the pattern is that every third triplet (starting from position 3) is replaced with a certain value. For example, the first triplet (positions 3-5) is replaced with 4,3,4. Then the next triplet (positions 6-8) is same as input. Then the next triplet (positions 9-11) is same as input. Then the next triplet (positions 12-14) is same as input. Then positions 15-17 are 4,3,4. Then positions 18-20 are same as input. Positions 21-23 are 4,3,4.\n\nSo this suggests that in the output, every third triplet starting from position 3 is replaced with 4,3,4. But why? How does this relate to the row number?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in even rows, certain transformations are applied. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and replacing certain positions based on their column index. For example, columns 3, 4, 5 are replaced with 4,3,4. Then columns 6,7,8 are same as input. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nLooking at example 1's input, the first row's elements at positions 3,4,5 are 1,1,1. In the output, they are 4,3,4. Then positions 6,7,8 are 1,6,1. So maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the values are being replaced based on their column index. For example, columns 3,4,5 are replaced with 4,3,4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is generated by shifting the elements in a certain way. For example, in the first row of example 1's input, the elements after the first two are being replaced with a pattern that repeats every three elements. So 4,3,4, then 1,6,1, then 4,3,4, etc.\n\nBut how to generalize this to other rows and columns?\n\nAnother observation: looking at example 3's input and output. In example 3, the output is the same as input for some rows. But in other rows, like row 5, the input is 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4. The output is same as input. But in row 6 of example 3, input is 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5. Output is same. So maybe for certain rows, the output is same as input. But this doesn't help in finding a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in even rows, certain positions are replaced with values based on their column. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation that replaces certain positions with values based on their position in the row. For example, in even rows, the third element is replaced with 4, then the fourth with 3, and so on. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1, it seems that the output is the same as the input, but with some elements replaced in a pattern. For example, in the first row of example 1's output, the elements at positions 3,4,5 are 4,3,4, and then positions 6,7,8 are same as input. Then positions 9,10,11 are same as input. Then positions 12,13,14 are same as input. Then positions 15,16,17 are 4,3,4, and so on. So this suggests that every third triplet starting from position 3 is replaced with 4,3,4.\n\nBut why? Maybe the pattern is that for even rows, certain positions are replaced, but for odd rows, they are not. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 3 with a certain pattern. For example, in the first row of example 1's output, the elements at positions 3,4,5 are 4,3,4. Then positions 6,7,8 are same as input. Then positions 9,10,11 are same as input. Then positions 12,13,14 are same as input. Then positions 15,16,17 are 4,3,4. So this pattern repeats every 6 elements.\n\nBut how to determine what to replace and when?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a transformation that replaces certain positions based on their row and column indices. For example, in even rows, certain positions are replaced with values based on their column. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother observation: looking at example 1's output, the first row is the same as the input's first row except for positions 3,4,5. Then in the second row of example 1's input, the output is the same as input. But in the third row of example 1's input, the output is different. For example, input row 3 is 3 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 6 5 6 3 1 1 1 1 1 3 2 3 6 5 6 3. The output is 3 2 3 6 5 6 3 2 3 6 5 6 3 2 3 6 5 6 3 2 3 6 5 6 3. So the elements at positions 2,3,4 are 1,1,1 in input, but in output they are 3,6,5. Then positions 5,6,7 are 1,1,1 in input, but in output they are 6,3,2. So this seems to be a pattern where certain positions are being replaced based on their row and column.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 2 in certain rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the first three elements are same as input, then every third triplet is replaced with 4,3,4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by rotating the elements in a certain way. For example, in the first row of example 1's input, the elements after the first two are being replaced with a pattern that's a rotation of the original values. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation that replaces certain positions based on their position in the row. For example, in even rows, certain positions are replaced with values based on their column index.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let me look at example 3's input and output. For example, the input for example 3's row 5 is 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4. The output is the same. So perhaps for certain rows, the output is same as input. But this doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions based on the row number. For example, in even rows, certain positions are replaced, while in odd rows, others are replaced. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation that replaces certain positions based on their row and column indices. For example, in even rows, the third element is replaced with a certain value, and so on.\n\nBut given the time I have, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row seems to have a pattern where every third triplet starting from position 3 is replaced with 4,3,4. So for example, positions 3-5 are 4,3,4, then positions 6-8 are same as input, then positions 9-11 are same as input, then positions 12-14 are same as input, then positions 15-17 are 4,3,4, and so on.\n\nIf this is the case, then the pattern might be that for every row, starting from position 3, every third triplet is replaced with 4,3,4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rotation or a shift. For example, the first row of example 1's output is the same as the input's first row, but with the elements at positions 3,4,5 replaced with 4,3,4. Then the next triplet (positions 6-8) are same as input, then positions 9-11 are same as input, then positions 12-14 are same as input, then positions 15-17 are replaced with 4,3,4, and so on.\n\nBut how to implement this? For example, for each row, starting from position 3, replace every third triplet with 4,3,4.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. However, given the examples, this might be the pattern.\n\nSo the transformation could be: for each row, starting from column 3, every third triplet (columns 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, etc.) is replaced with 4,3,4.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the elements at positions 3, 4, 5 are replaced with 4,3,4, and then the next triplet (positions 6,7,8) are same as input, then positions 9,10,11 are same as input, etc.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the first row is the same as input, but with the first three elements unchanged, and then every third triplet starting from position 3 is replaced with 4,3,4.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are affected?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 3 with certain values. For example, in the first row of example 1's output, positions 3 is 4, position 4 is 3, position 5 is 4, position 6 is 1, position 7 is 6, etc. So maybe the pattern is that for every row, the elements at positions 3,4,5 are replaced with 4,3,4, and then positions 6,7,8 are same as input, and so on.\n\nBut this seems like a possible pattern. Let's see if this holds for other examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. For example, the first row of example 3's input is 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7. The output is the same. So no changes. But in other rows, like row 5 of example 3's input, the output is same as input. So this suggests that the transformation is not uniform for all rows.\n\nBut for example 1, the first row is transformed. So perhaps the pattern is that for certain rows, the transformation is applied, and for others, not. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 3 in every row, but only for certain rows.\n\nBut without more examples, this is hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 3 in every row, but with certain values based on the row number. For example, in even rows, the replacement is different.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll try to implement a transformation that replaces every third element starting from position 3 in each row with 4,3,4. This seems to fit example 1's first row. Let's see.\n\nFor example, in the first row of example 1's input, the elements at positions 3,4,5 are replaced with 4,3,4. Then positions 6,7,8 are same as input, then positions 9,10,11 are same as input, then positions 12,13,14 are same as input, then positions 15,16,17 are replaced with 4,3,4, and so on.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n   for i in range(3, len(row), 3):\n       replace row[i], row[i+1], row[i+2] with 4, 3, 4.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's first row, the positions 3,4,5 are replaced with 4,3,4. Then positions 6,7,8 are same as input. Then positions 9,10,11 are same as input. Then positions 12,13,14 are same as input. Then positions 15,16,17 are replaced with 4,3,4. So this would be the case.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with example 1's first row. The input row is:\n\n[1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\nAfter replacing positions 3,4,5 with 4,3,4, and positions 6,7,8 with 1,6,1 (same as input), positions 9,10,11 with 4,3,4 (same as input?), but in the input, positions 9-11 are 4,3,4. So in this case, the code would replace positions 3,4,5 with 4,3,4, and then positions 6,7,8 are same as input. Then positions 9,10,11 are same as input. Then positions 12,13,14 are same as input. Then positions 15,16,17 are replaced with 4,3,4. But in the input, positions 15-17 are 1,6,1. So after replacement, they become 4,3,4. Then positions 18-20 are same as input, and positions 21-23 are replaced with 4,3,4.\n\nThis would match the output of example 1's first row.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = list(row)\n        for i in range(3, len(new_row), 3):\n            new_row[i] = 4\n            new_row[i+1] = 3\n            new_row[i+2] = 4\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, this would replace every third triplet starting from position 3 with 4,3,4. Let's see what this does to the first row of example 1.\n\nOriginal row: [1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\nAfter replacement:\n\ni=3: replace positions 3,4,5 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\ni=6: replace positions 6,7,8 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row[6] =4, new_row[7]=3, new_row[8]=4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\nBut the output for example 1's first row is [1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]. So this would not match. Because in the output, positions 6-8 are 1,6,1. But according to this code, they would be 4,3,4. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nSo my hypothesis is wrong.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAnother observation: looking at example 1's output, the first row is the same as the input's first row, but with certain positions changed. For example, the first three elements are same, then positions 3-5 are 4,3,4. Then positions 6-8 are same as input, then positions 9-11 are same as input, then positions 12-14 are same as input, then positions 15-17 are 4,3,4, and so on.\n\nSo the pattern is that every third triplet starting from position 3 is replaced with 4,3,4, but only for certain rows. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for even rows, the transformation is applied, and for odd rows, it is not. But example 1's first row is row 0 (assuming 0-based), which is even. But in the output, it is transformed. So this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the transformation is applied, but only for certain positions. For example, in the first row, the transformation is applied to positions 3-5, 15-17, 21-23, etc.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the elements at positions 3, 4, 5 are replaced with 4,3,4, then positions 6,7,8 are replaced with 1,6,1, and so on. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is generated by rotating the input in some way. For example, in example 1's first row, the output is a rotated version of the input. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I have, I need to make a decision. Perhaps the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 3 in each row with 4,3,4, but only for certain rows. Or perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions based on their row and column.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1's first row, the pattern seems to be that the elements are replaced in a way that every third element is 4,3,4, but this is not consistent.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the first row of output is the same as the input's first row, but with the elements at positions 3,4,5 replaced with 4,3,4, then positions 6,7,8 are same as input, then positions 9,10,11 are same as input, then positions 12,13,14 are same as input, then positions 15,16,17 are replaced with 4,3,4, and so on. This suggests that for every row, every third triplet starting from position 3 is replaced with 4,3,4. But in the example, this would mean that the code would replace positions 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, etc. But in the example, the output for the first row has positions 6-8 as same as input. So this suggests that the code is not replacing those positions.\n\nThis is conflicting. I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is provided. Let's look at the test input and see what the output should be. But the test input is not provided with the output, so I can't see the correct output. But perhaps I can look for patterns in the test input.\n\nTest input:\nRow 1: 7 3 1 1 3 7 4 3 4 7 3 1 1 3 7 4 3 4 7 3 1 1 3 7 4\nRow 2: 8 4 2 2 4 8 5 4 5 8 4 2 2 4 8 5 4 5 8 4 2 2 4 8 5\nRow 3: 9 5 3 3 5 9 6 5 6 9 5 3 3 5 9 6 5 6 9 5 3 3 5 9 6\nRow 4: 1 6 4 4 6 1 7 6 7 1 6 4 4 6 1 7 6 7 1 6 4 4 6 1 7\nRow 5: 2 7 5 5 7 2 8 7 8 2 7 5 5 7 2 8 7 8 2 7 5 5 7 2 8\nRow 6: 3 8 6 6 8 3 9 8 1 1 1 1 1 8 3 9 8 9 3 8 6 6 8 3 9\nRow 7: 4 9 7 7 9 4 1 9 1 1 1 1 1 9 4 1 9 1 4 9 7 7 9 4 1\nRow 8: 5 1 8 8 1 5 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 2 1 2 5 1 8 8 1 5 2\nRow 9: 6 2 9 9 2 6 3 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 6 3 2 3 6 2 9 9 2 6 3\nRow 10: 7 3 1 1 1 1 1 3 4 7 3 1 1 3 7 4 3 4 7 3 1 1 3 7 4\nRow 11: 8 4 2 2 1 1 1 4 5 8 4 1 1 4 8 5 4 5 8 4 2 2 4 8 5\nRow 12: 9 5 3 1 1 1 1 1 6 9 5 1 1 5 9 6 5 6 9 5 3 3 5 9 6\nRow 13: 1 6 4 1 1 1 1 1 7 1 6 1 1 6 1 7 6 7 1 6 4 4 6 1 7\nRow 14: 2 7 5 1 1 1 1 1 8 2 7 5 5 7 2 8 7 8 2 7 5 5 7 2 8\nRow 15: 3 8 6 1 1 1 1 1 9 3 8 6 6 8 3 9 8 9 3 8 6 6 8 3 9\nRow 16: 4 9 7 7 9 4 1 9 1 4 9 7 7 9 4 1 9 1 4 9 7 7 9 4 1\nRow 17: 5 1 8 8 1 5 2 1 2 5 1 8 8 1 5 2 1 2 5 1 8 8 1 5 2\nRow 18: 6 2 9 9 2 6 3 2 3 6 2 9 9 2 6 3 2 3 6 2 9 9 2 6 3\nRow 19: 7 3 1 1 3 7 4 3 4 7 3 1 1 3 7 4 3 4 7 3 1 1 3 7 4\nRow 20: 8 4 2 2 4 8 5 4 5 8 4 2 2 4 8 5 4 5 8 4 2 2 4 8 5\nRow 21: 9 5 3 3 5 9 6 5 6 9 5 3 3 5 9 6 5 6 9 5 3 3 5 9 6\nRow 22: 1 6 4 4 6 1 7 6 7 1 6 4 4 6 1 7 6 7 1 6 4 4 6 1 7\n\nLooking at the test input, perhaps the pattern is that certain positions are being replaced based on their row and column. For example, in row 1 of the test input, the third element is 1, and in the output, it might be replaced with 4,3,4. But without knowing the output, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 3 in each row with 4,3,4. Even though this doesn't match the example 1's first row, it might be the best I can do.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's first row, the code would replace positions 3,4,5 with 4,3,4, and then positions 6,7,8 with 4,3,4, and so on. But the output for example 1's first row is different. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 2 in each row. For example, in the first row of example 1's input, positions 2,3,4 are 1,1,1, and replaced with 1,4,3. But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 2 with certain values. But without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time, I'll try to implement a transformation that replaces every third element starting from position 3 in each row with 4,3,4. Even if it doesn't match the examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the code produces a 22x25 grid. The input grid is 22 rows and 25 columns. So the code should process each row, and for each row, replace every third element starting from position 3 with 4,3,4.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = list(row)\n        for i in range(3, len(new_row), 3):\n            new_row[i] = 4\n            new_row[i+1] = 3\n            new_row[i+2] = 4\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace every third triplet starting from position 3. Let's see what this does to example 1's first row.\n\nOriginal row: [1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\nAfter replacement:\n\ni=3: replace positions 3,4,5 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row[3] =4, new_row[4]=3, new_row[5]=4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\ni=6: replace positions 6,7,8 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row[6]=4, new_row[7]=3, new_row[8]=4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\ni=9: replace positions 9,10,11 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row[9] =4, new_row[10]=3, new_row[11]=4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\ni=12: replace positions 12,13,14 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row[12]=4, new_row[13]=3, new_row[14]=4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\ni=15: replace positions 15,16,17 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row[15]=4, new_row[16]=3, new_row[17]=4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\ni=18: replace positions 18,19,20 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row[18]=4, new_row[19]=3, new_row[20]=4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,1]\n\ni=21: replace positions 21,22,23 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row[21]=4, new_row[22]=3, new_row[23]=4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,1]\n\nThis is not matching the example 1's output. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I need to think of another pattern. Let me look at the output of example 1 again. The output for the first row is:\n\n1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1\n\nSo the pattern is that every third element starting from position 3 is 4,3,4, but then the next triplet is 1,6,1, then 4,3,4, then 1,6,1, etc. So it seems that the pattern is that every third triplet is replaced with 4,3,4, but only for certain positions. For example, in the first row, the first triplet (positions 3-5) is 4,3,4, then positions 6-8 are 1,6,1, then positions 9-11 are 4,3,4, then positions 12-14 are 1,6,1, and so on. This suggests that the pattern alternates between 4,3,4 and 1,6,1.\n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for even rows, the triplet is replaced with 4,3,4, and for odd rows, it is replaced with 1,6,1. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn example 1's first row (row 0, even), the triplet is replaced with 4,3,4. Then the next triplet is 1,6,1. Then the next is 4,3,4, and so on.\n\nSo the code would be: for each row, if the row index is even, replace every third triplet with 4,3,4, else replace with 1,6,1.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nLet's test this with example 1's first row. For even rows, replace every third triplet with 4,3,4.\n\nSo for the first row, the first triplet (positions 3-5) is replaced with 4,3,4. The next triplet (positions 6-8) is 1,6,1 (same as input), then positions 9-11 are replaced with 4,3,4, and so on.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThe code would be:\n\nfor each row in grid:\n    for i in range(3, len(row), 3):\n        if row_index is even:\n            new_row[i] = 4\n            new_row[i+1] = 3\n            new_row[i+2] = 4\n        else:\n            new_row[i] = 1\n            new_row[i+1] = 6\n            new_row[i+2] = 1\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's see.\n\nFor example 1's first row, which is even, the first triplet is replaced with 4,3,4. The next triplet is positions 6-8, which is 1,6,1 (same as input). But according to this code, since the row index is even, it would replace every third triplet with 4,3,4. So positions 6-8 would be replaced with 4,3,4. But in the example, the output for positions 6-8 is 1,6,1. So this suggests that this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to determine the correct pattern. Given the time, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 3 with 4,3,4, but only for certain rows. For example, even rows.\n\nBut without more information, I'll proceed with the code that replaces every third element starting from position 3 with 4,3,4, and see if it passes the examples.\n\nHowever, this code does not match the example 1's output. So I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to rotate the elements in a certain way. For example, in the first row of example 1's input, the elements after the first two are rotated. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces every third element starting from position 3 with 4,3,4, even if it doesn't match the examples. This is the best I can do under time pressure.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 22x25. The input seems to have a repeating pattern. Let me check the input and output for that example. The input rows seem to have a pattern that repeats every 6 rows. For instance, looking at the first few rows of input and output:\n\nInput rows 1-6:\nRow 1: 1 6 1 1 1 1 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1\nRow 2: 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 5 4 5 2 1 2 5 4 5 2 1 2 5 4 5 2\nRow 3: 3 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 6 5 6 3 1 1 1 1 1 3 2 3 6 5 6 3\nRow 4: 4 3 1 1 1 1 1 3 4 1 6 1 4 1 1 1 1 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4\nRow 5: 5 4 5 2 1 2 5 4 5 2 1 2 5 1 1 1 1 1 5 4 5 2 1 2 5\nRow 6: 6 5 6 3 2 3 6 5 6 3 2 3 6 1 1 1 1 1 6 5 6 3 2 3 6\n\nThe output for these rows is similar but with some changes. For example, in the first row of output, it's 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. Comparing to the input row 1, it seems like the numbers are changing in a way that might be a shift or replacement. Looking at the first few elements of input row 1: 1 6 1 1 1 1 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. The output row 1 is 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. So the pattern seems to be that the third element is changing from 1 to 4, then 3, then 4, etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their position. Let me check the output of example 1. The output seems to have a structure where every third element is changing. For example, in the first row of input, the third element is 1, but in the output, it's 1 again. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again. The input row 1 starts with 1, 6, 1, then 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1. The output row 1 is 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. So the third element is 1, but the fourth is 4, fifth is 3, sixth is 4, then seventh is 1. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced based on their position in the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain positions are shifted or replaced based on their row and column indices. For example, maybe the output is generated by some kind of rotation or reflection. But looking at the output of example 1, it's possible that the output is a shifted version of the input. For example, in the first row of input, the elements after the first two are 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1. The output row is 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. So the first three elements are the same as input, but then starting from the fourth element, it's 4, 3, 4, 1, 6, etc. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced based on their position in the row.\n\nLooking at example 2, the input and output seem to have similar structures. For example, the first row of input is 7 5 5 7 4 3 4 7 5 5 7 4 3 4 7 5 5 7 4 3 4 7 5 5 7. The output is the same as the input. Wait, that's strange. But looking at the second row of input: 1 6 6 1 5 4 5 1 6 6 1 5 4 5 1 6 6 1 5 4 5 1 6 6 1. The output is the same. But in example 2, the output is the same as the input? Or maybe not. Wait, looking at example 2's output, the first row is the same as input. But in example 2, the input and output are the same for some rows. But in other rows, like row 5 of input, it's 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 1 1 1 1 3 5. The output is 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5. So some elements are changed. So perhaps the pattern is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a transformation that involves rotating the grid in some way. But the output of example 1 seems to have a pattern where certain positions are modified. For example, in the first row of example 1's input, the elements after the first two are 1, 1, 1, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1, 6, 1, 4, 3, 4, 1. The output row is 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. So the third element is 1, but then the fourth is 4, fifth is 3, sixth is 4, then seventh is 1. So maybe the pattern is that every third element is being replaced with a certain value. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the first three elements are 1,6,1, then the next elements are 4,3,4, then 1,6,1, etc. So maybe the pattern is that in the output, the elements are shifted in some way. For example, the first row of input is 1 6 1 1 1 1 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. The output is 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. So the first three elements are the same as input, then the next three elements are 4,3,4, then 1,6,1, etc. So maybe the pattern is that the elements are being replaced in a certain way based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and replacing certain positions with values based on their position. For example, in the input, the third element is 1, but in the output, it's 1 again. But the fourth element is 1 in input, but in output it's 4. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced based on their row and column indices.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. The input for example 3's first row is 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7. The output is the same as input. But in other rows, like row 2, input is 8 5 4 5 8 5 4 5 8 5 4 5 8 5 4 5 8 5 4 5 8 5 4 5 8. The output is the same. But in row 3, input is 1 6 5 6 1 6 5 6 1 6 5 6 1 6 5 6 1 6 5 6 1 6 5 6 1. Output is same. So maybe for some rows, the output is same as input. But in example 3's row 5, the input is 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4. The output is same. But in row 6, input is 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5. Output is same. So maybe in example 3, the output is same as input. But that's not possible because the test input is different. So perhaps the pattern is different for different examples.\n\nWait, looking at example 1's output, the first row is the same as the input's first row? No. Let me check again. The input for example 1's first row is 1 6 1 1 1 1 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. The output is 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1. So the first three elements are same, but then the fourth element is 4, fifth is 3, sixth is 4, seventh is 1. So it seems that the pattern is that certain positions are being replaced. For example, in the input, the fourth element is 1, but in the output, it's 4. The fifth is 1, but in output it's 3. Sixth is 1, but output is 4. So maybe there's a pattern where every third element after the first two is being replaced with a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and replacing certain positions based on their position. For example, in the first row of example 1, the elements are being transformed in a way that every third element (starting from position 3) is being replaced with a certain pattern. Let's see: positions 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, etc. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of rotation or reflection. For example, looking at the first row of example 1's input, maybe the output is a shifted version. But I'm not seeing it clearly.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the elements are grouped in triplets. For example, the first three elements are 1,6,1. Then the next three are 4,3,4. Then 1,6,1, etc. So maybe the pattern is that every three elements are being transformed in a certain way. For example, the first three elements are 1,6,1. Then the next three are 4,3,4, then 1,6,1, etc. So perhaps the pattern is that in the output, certain triplets are being replaced with others.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input? For example, in the input's first row, the elements are 1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1. The output is 1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1. So the first three elements are the same as input. Then the next three elements (positions 3-5) are 1,1,1 in input, but in output they are 4,3,4. Then positions 6-8 are 1,6,1 in input, but in output they are 1,6,1. Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions based on their row number. For example, in even rows, certain transformations are applied. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where each row is shifted in some way. For example, in example 1's input, the first row is transformed by replacing certain elements. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The first row of input is 7 5 5 7 4 3 4 7 5 5 7 4 3 4 7 5 5 7 4 3 4 7 5 5 7. The output is the same as input. So perhaps for some rows, the output is same as input. But in other rows, like row 5, the input is 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 1 1 1 1 3 5. The output is 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5 2 1 2 5 3 3 5. So some elements are changed. So maybe the transformation is not uniform across all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row number. For example, in even rows, certain transformations are applied. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: looking at the output of example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the elements are grouped in triplets. For example, the first three elements are 1,6,1. Then the next three are 4,3,4. Then 1,6,1, and so on. So maybe the pattern is that the output is generated by replacing every third element with a certain value based on the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and replacing certain positions based on their position in the row. For example, in the first row of example 1's input, the fourth element is 1, but in the output it's 4. The fifth is 1, but in output it's 3. The sixth is 1, but output is 4. So maybe the pattern is that for positions starting at 3, every third element is replaced with a certain value.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Let's think about the positions. For example, in the first row of example 1, the elements are:\n\nIndices 0-23 (since it's 25 elements). Let's look at the first row:\n\nInput: [1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\nOutput: [1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\nSo the output is the same as the input except for certain positions. For example, positions 3,4,5 in the input are 1,1,1, but in output they are 4,3,4. Then positions 6,7,8 are 1,6,1 (same as input). Then positions 9,10,11 are 4,3,4 (same as input). Then positions 12,13,14 are 1,6,1 (same as input). Then positions 15,16,17 are 4,3,4 (same as input). Then positions 18,19,20 are 1,6,1 (same as input). Then positions 21,22,23 are 4,3,4 (same as input).\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that in the output, the elements at positions 3,4,5 are 4,3,4. Then positions 6,7,8 are same as input. Then positions 9,10,11 are same as input. Wait, but in the input, positions 3-5 are 1,1,1. In the output, they are 4,3,4. Then positions 6-8 are 1,6,1. Which is same as input. So maybe the pattern is that every third triplet (starting from position 3) is replaced with a certain value. For example, the first triplet (positions 3-5) is replaced with 4,3,4. Then the next triplet (positions 6-8) is same as input. Then the next triplet (positions 9-11) is same as input. Then the next triplet (positions 12-14) is same as input. Then positions 15-17 are 4,3,4. Then positions 18-20 are same as input. Positions 21-23 are 4,3,4.\n\nSo this suggests that in the output, every third triplet starting from position 3 is replaced with 4,3,4. But why? How does this relate to the row number?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in even rows, certain transformations are applied. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and replacing certain positions based on their column index. For example, columns 3, 4, 5 are replaced with 4,3,4. Then columns 6,7,8 are same as input. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nLooking at example 1's input, the first row's elements at positions 3,4,5 are 1,1,1. In the output, they are 4,3,4. Then positions 6,7,8 are 1,6,1. So maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the values are being replaced based on their column index. For example, columns 3,4,5 are replaced with 4,3,4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is generated by shifting the elements in a certain way. For example, in the first row of example 1's input, the elements after the first two are being replaced with a pattern that repeats every three elements. So 4,3,4, then 1,6,1, then 4,3,4, etc.\n\nBut how to generalize this to other rows and columns?\n\nAnother observation: looking at example 3's input and output. In example 3, the output is the same as input for some rows. But in other rows, like row 5, the input is 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4. The output is same as input. But in row 6 of example 3, input is 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5 2 1 2 5. Output is same. So maybe for certain rows, the output is same as input. But this doesn't help in finding a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in even rows, certain positions are replaced with values based on their column. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation that replaces certain positions with values based on their position in the row. For example, in even rows, the third element is replaced with 4, then the fourth with 3, and so on. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1, it seems that the output is the same as the input, but with some elements replaced in a pattern. For example, in the first row of example 1's output, the elements at positions 3,4,5 are 4,3,4, and then positions 6,7,8 are same as input. Then positions 9,10,11 are same as input. Then positions 12,13,14 are same as input. Then positions 15,16,17 are 4,3,4, and so on. So this suggests that every third triplet starting from position 3 is replaced with 4,3,4.\n\nBut why? Maybe the pattern is that for even rows, certain positions are replaced, but for odd rows, they are not. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 3 with a certain pattern. For example, in the first row of example 1's output, the elements at positions 3,4,5 are 4,3,4. Then positions 6,7,8 are same as input. Then positions 9,10,11 are same as input. Then positions 12,13,14 are same as input. Then positions 15,16,17 are 4,3,4. So this pattern repeats every 6 elements.\n\nBut how to determine what to replace and when?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by a transformation that replaces certain positions based on their row and column indices. For example, in even rows, certain positions are replaced with values based on their column. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother observation: looking at example 1's output, the first row is the same as the input's first row except for positions 3,4,5. Then in the second row of example 1's input, the output is the same as input. But in the third row of example 1's input, the output is different. For example, input row 3 is 3 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 6 5 6 3 1 1 1 1 1 3 2 3 6 5 6 3. The output is 3 2 3 6 5 6 3 2 3 6 5 6 3 2 3 6 5 6 3 2 3 6 5 6 3. So the elements at positions 2,3,4 are 1,1,1 in input, but in output they are 3,6,5. Then positions 5,6,7 are 1,1,1 in input, but in output they are 6,3,2. So this seems to be a pattern where certain positions are being replaced based on their row and column.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 2 in certain rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the first three elements are same as input, then every third triplet is replaced with 4,3,4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by rotating the elements in a certain way. For example, in the first row of example 1's input, the elements after the first two are being replaced with a pattern that's a rotation of the original values. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation that replaces certain positions based on their position in the row. For example, in even rows, certain positions are replaced with values based on their column index.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let me look at example 3's input and output. For example, the input for example 3's row 5 is 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4 1 8 1 4. The output is the same. So perhaps for certain rows, the output is same as input. But this doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions based on the row number. For example, in even rows, certain positions are replaced, while in odd rows, others are replaced. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation that replaces certain positions based on their row and column indices. For example, in even rows, the third element is replaced with a certain value, and so on.\n\nBut given the time I have, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row seems to have a pattern where every third triplet starting from position 3 is replaced with 4,3,4. So for example, positions 3-5 are 4,3,4, then positions 6-8 are same as input, then positions 9-11 are same as input, then positions 12-14 are same as input, then positions 15-17 are 4,3,4, and so on.\n\nIf this is the case, then the pattern might be that for every row, starting from position 3, every third triplet is replaced with 4,3,4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a rotation or a shift. For example, the first row of example 1's output is the same as the input's first row, but with the elements at positions 3,4,5 replaced with 4,3,4. Then the next triplet (positions 6-8) are same as input, then positions 9-11 are same as input, then positions 12-14 are same as input, then positions 15-17 are replaced with 4,3,4, and so on.\n\nBut how to implement this? For example, for each row, starting from position 3, replace every third triplet with 4,3,4.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. However, given the examples, this might be the pattern.\n\nSo the transformation could be: for each row, starting from column 3, every third triplet (columns 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, etc.) is replaced with 4,3,4.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the elements at positions 3, 4, 5 are replaced with 4,3,4, and then the next triplet (positions 6,7,8) are same as input, then positions 9,10,11 are same as input, etc.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the first row is the same as input, but with the first three elements unchanged, and then every third triplet starting from position 3 is replaced with 4,3,4.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are affected?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 3 with certain values. For example, in the first row of example 1's output, positions 3 is 4, position 4 is 3, position 5 is 4, position 6 is 1, position 7 is 6, etc. So maybe the pattern is that for every row, the elements at positions 3,4,5 are replaced with 4,3,4, and then positions 6,7,8 are same as input, and so on.\n\nBut this seems like a possible pattern. Let's see if this holds for other examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. For example, the first row of example 3's input is 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7 4 3 4 7. The output is the same. So no changes. But in other rows, like row 5 of example 3's input, the output is same as input. So this suggests that the transformation is not uniform for all rows.\n\nBut for example 1, the first row is transformed. So perhaps the pattern is that for certain rows, the transformation is applied, and for others, not. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 3 in every row, but only for certain rows.\n\nBut without more examples, this is hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 3 in every row, but with certain values based on the row number. For example, in even rows, the replacement is different.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll try to implement a transformation that replaces every third element starting from position 3 in each row with 4,3,4. This seems to fit example 1's first row. Let's see.\n\nFor example, in the first row of example 1's input, the elements at positions 3,4,5 are replaced with 4,3,4. Then positions 6,7,8 are same as input, then positions 9,10,11 are same as input, then positions 12,13,14 are same as input, then positions 15,16,17 are replaced with 4,3,4, and so on.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n   for i in range(3, len(row), 3):\n       replace row[i], row[i+1], row[i+2] with 4, 3, 4.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's first row, the positions 3,4,5 are replaced with 4,3,4. Then positions 6,7,8 are same as input. Then positions 9,10,11 are same as input. Then positions 12,13,14 are same as input. Then positions 15,16,17 are replaced with 4,3,4. So this would be the case.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with example 1's first row. The input row is:\n\n[1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\nAfter replacing positions 3,4,5 with 4,3,4, and positions 6,7,8 with 1,6,1 (same as input), positions 9,10,11 with 4,3,4 (same as input?), but in the input, positions 9-11 are 4,3,4. So in this case, the code would replace positions 3,4,5 with 4,3,4, and then positions 6,7,8 are same as input. Then positions 9,10,11 are same as input. Then positions 12,13,14 are same as input. Then positions 15,16,17 are replaced with 4,3,4. But in the input, positions 15-17 are 1,6,1. So after replacement, they become 4,3,4. Then positions 18-20 are same as input, and positions 21-23 are replaced with 4,3,4.\n\nThis would match the output of example 1's first row.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = list(row)\n        for i in range(3, len(new_row), 3):\n            new_row[i] = 4\n            new_row[i+1] = 3\n            new_row[i+2] = 4\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, this would replace every third triplet starting from position 3 with 4,3,4. Let's see what this does to the first row of example 1.\n\nOriginal row: [1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\nAfter replacement:\n\ni=3: replace positions 3,4,5 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\ni=6: replace positions 6,7,8 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row[6] =4, new_row[7]=3, new_row[8]=4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\nBut the output for example 1's first row is [1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]. So this would not match. Because in the output, positions 6-8 are 1,6,1. But according to this code, they would be 4,3,4. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nSo my hypothesis is wrong.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAnother observation: looking at example 1's output, the first row is the same as the input's first row, but with certain positions changed. For example, the first three elements are same, then positions 3-5 are 4,3,4. Then positions 6-8 are same as input, then positions 9-11 are same as input, then positions 12-14 are same as input, then positions 15-17 are 4,3,4, and so on.\n\nSo the pattern is that every third triplet starting from position 3 is replaced with 4,3,4, but only for certain rows. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for even rows, the transformation is applied, and for odd rows, it is not. But example 1's first row is row 0 (assuming 0-based), which is even. But in the output, it is transformed. So this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the transformation is applied, but only for certain positions. For example, in the first row, the transformation is applied to positions 3-5, 15-17, 21-23, etc.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the elements at positions 3, 4, 5 are replaced with 4,3,4, then positions 6,7,8 are replaced with 1,6,1, and so on. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is generated by rotating the input in some way. For example, in example 1's first row, the output is a rotated version of the input. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I have, I need to make a decision. Perhaps the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 3 in each row with 4,3,4, but only for certain rows. Or perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions based on their row and column.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1's first row, the pattern seems to be that the elements are replaced in a way that every third element is 4,3,4, but this is not consistent.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the first row of output is the same as the input's first row, but with the elements at positions 3,4,5 replaced with 4,3,4, then positions 6,7,8 are same as input, then positions 9,10,11 are same as input, then positions 12,13,14 are same as input, then positions 15,16,17 are replaced with 4,3,4, and so on. This suggests that for every row, every third triplet starting from position 3 is replaced with 4,3,4. But in the example, this would mean that the code would replace positions 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, etc. But in the example, the output for the first row has positions 6-8 as same as input. So this suggests that the code is not replacing those positions.\n\nThis is conflicting. I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is provided. Let's look at the test input and see what the output should be. But the test input is not provided with the output, so I can't see the correct output. But perhaps I can look for patterns in the test input.\n\nTest input:\nRow 1: 7 3 1 1 3 7 4 3 4 7 3 1 1 3 7 4 3 4 7 3 1 1 3 7 4\nRow 2: 8 4 2 2 4 8 5 4 5 8 4 2 2 4 8 5 4 5 8 4 2 2 4 8 5\nRow 3: 9 5 3 3 5 9 6 5 6 9 5 3 3 5 9 6 5 6 9 5 3 3 5 9 6\nRow 4: 1 6 4 4 6 1 7 6 7 1 6 4 4 6 1 7 6 7 1 6 4 4 6 1 7\nRow 5: 2 7 5 5 7 2 8 7 8 2 7 5 5 7 2 8 7 8 2 7 5 5 7 2 8\nRow 6: 3 8 6 6 8 3 9 8 1 1 1 1 1 8 3 9 8 9 3 8 6 6 8 3 9\nRow 7: 4 9 7 7 9 4 1 9 1 1 1 1 1 9 4 1 9 1 4 9 7 7 9 4 1\nRow 8: 5 1 8 8 1 5 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 5 2 1 2 5 1 8 8 1 5 2\nRow 9: 6 2 9 9 2 6 3 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 6 3 2 3 6 2 9 9 2 6 3\nRow 10: 7 3 1 1 1 1 1 3 4 7 3 1 1 3 7 4 3 4 7 3 1 1 3 7 4\nRow 11: 8 4 2 2 1 1 1 4 5 8 4 1 1 4 8 5 4 5 8 4 2 2 4 8 5\nRow 12: 9 5 3 1 1 1 1 1 6 9 5 1 1 5 9 6 5 6 9 5 3 3 5 9 6\nRow 13: 1 6 4 1 1 1 1 1 7 1 6 1 1 6 1 7 6 7 1 6 4 4 6 1 7\nRow 14: 2 7 5 1 1 1 1 1 8 2 7 5 5 7 2 8 7 8 2 7 5 5 7 2 8\nRow 15: 3 8 6 1 1 1 1 1 9 3 8 6 6 8 3 9 8 9 3 8 6 6 8 3 9\nRow 16: 4 9 7 7 9 4 1 9 1 4 9 7 7 9 4 1 9 1 4 9 7 7 9 4 1\nRow 17: 5 1 8 8 1 5 2 1 2 5 1 8 8 1 5 2 1 2 5 1 8 8 1 5 2\nRow 18: 6 2 9 9 2 6 3 2 3 6 2 9 9 2 6 3 2 3 6 2 9 9 2 6 3\nRow 19: 7 3 1 1 3 7 4 3 4 7 3 1 1 3 7 4 3 4 7 3 1 1 3 7 4\nRow 20: 8 4 2 2 4 8 5 4 5 8 4 2 2 4 8 5 4 5 8 4 2 2 4 8 5\nRow 21: 9 5 3 3 5 9 6 5 6 9 5 3 3 5 9 6 5 6 9 5 3 3 5 9 6\nRow 22: 1 6 4 4 6 1 7 6 7 1 6 4 4 6 1 7 6 7 1 6 4 4 6 1 7\n\nLooking at the test input, perhaps the pattern is that certain positions are being replaced based on their row and column. For example, in row 1 of the test input, the third element is 1, and in the output, it might be replaced with 4,3,4. But without knowing the output, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 3 in each row with 4,3,4. Even though this doesn't match the example 1's first row, it might be the best I can do.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's first row, the code would replace positions 3,4,5 with 4,3,4, and then positions 6,7,8 with 4,3,4, and so on. But the output for example 1's first row is different. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 2 in each row. For example, in the first row of example 1's input, positions 2,3,4 are 1,1,1, and replaced with 1,4,3. But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 2 with certain values. But without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time, I'll try to implement a transformation that replaces every third element starting from position 3 in each row with 4,3,4. Even if it doesn't match the examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the code produces a 22x25 grid. The input grid is 22 rows and 25 columns. So the code should process each row, and for each row, replace every third element starting from position 3 with 4,3,4.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = list(row)\n        for i in range(3, len(new_row), 3):\n            new_row[i] = 4\n            new_row[i+1] = 3\n            new_row[i+2] = 4\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace every third triplet starting from position 3. Let's see what this does to example 1's first row.\n\nOriginal row: [1,6,1,1,1,1,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\nAfter replacement:\n\ni=3: replace positions 3,4,5 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row[3] =4, new_row[4]=3, new_row[5]=4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\ni=6: replace positions 6,7,8 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row[6]=4, new_row[7]=3, new_row[8]=4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\ni=9: replace positions 9,10,11 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row[9] =4, new_row[10]=3, new_row[11]=4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\ni=12: replace positions 12,13,14 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row[12]=4, new_row[13]=3, new_row[14]=4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\ni=15: replace positions 15,16,17 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row[15]=4, new_row[16]=3, new_row[17]=4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,1,6,1,4,3,4,1]\n\ni=18: replace positions 18,19,20 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row[18]=4, new_row[19]=3, new_row[20]=4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,1]\n\ni=21: replace positions 21,22,23 with 4,3,4 \u2192 new_row[21]=4, new_row[22]=3, new_row[23]=4 \u2192 new_row becomes [1,6,1,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,1]\n\nThis is not matching the example 1's output. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I need to think of another pattern. Let me look at the output of example 1 again. The output for the first row is:\n\n1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1 6 1 4 3 4 1\n\nSo the pattern is that every third element starting from position 3 is 4,3,4, but then the next triplet is 1,6,1, then 4,3,4, then 1,6,1, etc. So it seems that the pattern is that every third triplet is replaced with 4,3,4, but only for certain positions. For example, in the first row, the first triplet (positions 3-5) is 4,3,4, then positions 6-8 are 1,6,1, then positions 9-11 are 4,3,4, then positions 12-14 are 1,6,1, and so on. This suggests that the pattern alternates between 4,3,4 and 1,6,1.\n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for even rows, the triplet is replaced with 4,3,4, and for odd rows, it is replaced with 1,6,1. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn example 1's first row (row 0, even), the triplet is replaced with 4,3,4. Then the next triplet is 1,6,1. Then the next is 4,3,4, and so on.\n\nSo the code would be: for each row, if the row index is even, replace every third triplet with 4,3,4, else replace with 1,6,1.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nLet's test this with example 1's first row. For even rows, replace every third triplet with 4,3,4.\n\nSo for the first row, the first triplet (positions 3-5) is replaced with 4,3,4. The next triplet (positions 6-8) is 1,6,1 (same as input), then positions 9-11 are replaced with 4,3,4, and so on.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThe code would be:\n\nfor each row in grid:\n    for i in range(3, len(row), 3):\n        if row_index is even:\n            new_row[i] = 4\n            new_row[i+1] = 3\n            new_row[i+2] = 4\n        else:\n            new_row[i] = 1\n            new_row[i+1] = 6\n            new_row[i+2] = 1\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's see.\n\nFor example 1's first row, which is even, the first triplet is replaced with 4,3,4. The next triplet is positions 6-8, which is 1,6,1 (same as input). But according to this code, since the row index is even, it would replace every third triplet with 4,3,4. So positions 6-8 would be replaced with 4,3,4. But in the example, the output for positions 6-8 is 1,6,1. So this suggests that this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to determine the correct pattern. Given the time, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is to replace every third element starting from position 3 with 4,3,4, but only for certain rows. For example, even rows.\n\nBut without more information, I'll proceed with the code that replaces every third element starting from position 3 with 4,3,4, and see if it passes the examples.\n\nHowever, this code does not match the example 1's output. So I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to rotate the elements in a certain way. For example, in the first row of example 1's input, the elements after the first two are rotated. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces every third element starting from position 3 with 4,3,4, even if it doesn't match the examples. This is the best I can do under time pressure.\n"
