For example:\n- If the input is 3x3, it's repeated 3 times to make 9x9.\n- If the input is 2x3, it's repeated 3 times to make 9x9.\n\nBased on this, I hypothesize that the transformation is to **repeat the input pattern multiple times** to form a 9x9 grid, where the number of repetitions is determined by the input size.\n\nHere's my implementation of this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Determine the number of repetitions needed to form a 9x9 grid\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    \n    # Calculate how many times to repeat the pattern\n    # To get 9 rows, we need 9 // rows repetitions\n    # To get 9 columns, we need 9 // cols repetitions\n    repeat_rows = 9 // rows\n    repeat_cols = 9 // cols\n    \n    # Create the transformed grid by repeating the pattern\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for i in range(repeat_rows):\n        for j in range(repeat_cols):\n            for row in grid:\n                transformed_grid.append(row.copy())\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
