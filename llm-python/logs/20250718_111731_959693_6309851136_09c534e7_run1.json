          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe that the transformation involves propagating values from certain regions to adjacent cells, with some values being replaced or modified based on their neighbors. There are patterns involving value propagation, replacement, and possibly some form of regional transformation.\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that:\n1. Values like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are being transformed or replaced based on their neighbors.\n2. There seems to be a pattern of value propagation where certain values spread to adjacent cells.\n3. Some values are replaced with other values based on their positions and neighboring values.\n4. The transformation seems to involve some form of regional processing, where values in certain regions influence their neighbors.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that propagates values from certain regions and replaces values based on their neighbors.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe that the transformation involves propagating values from certain regions to adjacent cells, with some values being replaced or modified based on their neighbors. There are patterns involving value propagation, replacement, and possibly some form of regional transformation.\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that:\n1. Values like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 are being transformed or replaced based on their neighbors.\n2. There seems to be a pattern of value propagation where certain values spread to adjacent cells.\n3. Some values are replaced with other values based on their positions and neighboring values.\n4. The transformation seems to involve some form of regional processing, where values in certain regions influence their neighbors.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that propagates values from certain regions and replaces values based on their neighbors.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
