From the examples, it seems that values are being copied or spread in a way that might involve mirroring or repeating patterns.\n\nBased on the examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves copying values from one part of the grid to another in a mirrored or repeated fashion.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the dimensions of the grid\n    rows = len(transformed_grid)\n    cols = len(transformed_grid[0])\n    \n    # Propagate values in a mirrored fashion\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # If the cell is not zero, propagate it to the right and down\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Propagate to the right\n                for k in range(j + 1, cols):\n                    if transformed_grid[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[i][k] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Propagate down\n                for k in range(i + 1, rows):\n                    if transformed_grid[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[k][j] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the dimensions of the grid\n    rows = len(transformed_grid)\n    cols = len(transformed_grid[0])\n    \n    # Propagate values in a mirrored fashion\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # If the cell is not zero, propagate it to the right and down\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Propagate to the right\n                for k in range(j + 1, cols):\n                    if transformed_grid[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[i][k] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Propagate down\n                for k in range(i + 1, rows):\n                    if transformed_grid[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[k][j] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

From the examples, it seems that values are being copied or spread in a way that might involve mirroring or repeating patterns.\n\nBased on the examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves copying values from one part of the grid to another in a mirrored or repeated fashion.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the dimensions of the grid\n    rows = len(transformed_grid)\n    cols = len(transformed_grid[0])\n    \n    # Propagate values in a mirrored fashion\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # If the cell is not zero, propagate it to the right and down\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Propagate to the right\n                for k in range(j + 1, cols):\n                    if transformed_grid[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[i][k] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Propagate down\n                for k in range(i + 1, rows):\n                    if transformed_grid[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[k][j] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the dimensions of the grid\n    rows = len(transformed_grid)\n    cols = len(transformed_grid[0])\n    \n    # Propagate values in a mirrored fashion\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # If the cell is not zero, propagate it to the right and down\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Propagate to the right\n                for k in range(j + 1, cols):\n                    if transformed_grid[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[i][k] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Propagate down\n                for k in range(i + 1, rows):\n                    if transformed_grid[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[k][j] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
