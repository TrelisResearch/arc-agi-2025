In Example 3, certain positions with 5s are transformed to 3s in specific locations.\n3. There seems to be a pattern where certain positions in the grid are replaced with 3s based on their position relative to other values.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain positions with 3s based on their position relative to other values. Specifically, it seems like the middle row (row 4) is being replaced with all 3s in some examples.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace the middle row (row 4) with all 3s\n    for col in range(10):\n        transformed_grid[4][col] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace the middle row (row 4) with all 3s\n    for col in range(10):\n        transformed_grid[4][col] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 3, certain positions with 5s are transformed to 3s in specific locations.\n3. There seems to be a pattern where certain positions in the grid are replaced with 3s based on their position relative to other values.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain positions with 3s based on their position relative to other values. Specifically, it seems like the middle row (row 4) is being replaced with all 3s in some examples.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace the middle row (row 4) with all 3s\n    for col in range(10):\n        transformed_grid[4][col] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace the middle row (row 4) with all 3s\n    for col in range(10):\n        transformed_grid[4][col] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
