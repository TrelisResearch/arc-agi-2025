In Example 1, the output seems to be transforming the input by:\n   - Replacing certain values with 0s and 3s\n   - Creating a vertical line of 3s in the 8th column\n   - Creating horizontal lines of 2s and 3s\n\n2. In Example 2, the output seems to be transforming the input by:\n   - Replacing certain values with 0s and 8s\n   - Creating a vertical line of 8s in the 9th column\n   - Creating horizontal lines of 1s and 8s\n\n3. In Example 3, the output seems to be transforming the input by:\n   - Replacing certain values with 0s and 4s\n   - Creating a vertical line of 4s in the 7th column\n   - Creating horizontal lines of 3s and 4s\n\nFrom these examples, I observe a pattern where:\n- Certain values are replaced with 0s\n- A vertical line of a specific value is created in the 8th column\n- Horizontal lines of values are created in certain rows\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n1. Replaces certain values with 0s\n2. Creates a vertical line of a specific value in the 8th column\n3. Creates horizontal lines of values in certain rows\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values with 0s\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid[i][j] in [3, 2, 8, 4, 6, 7]:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    # Create a vertical line of 3s in the 8th column (index 7)\n    for i in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[i][7] = 3\n    \n    # Create horizontal lines of values in certain rows\n    # Row 2: create a line of 3s\n    for j in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[2][j] = 3\n    \n    # Row 3: create a line of 2s\n    for j in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[3][j] = 2\n    \n    # Row 4: create a line of 2s\n    for j in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[4][j] = 2\n    \n    # Row 5: create a line of 2s\n    for j in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[5][j] = 2\n    \n    # Row 6: create a line of 2s\n    for j in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[6][j] = 2\n    \n    # Row 7: create a line of 2s\n    for j in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[7][j] = 2\n    \n    # Row 8: create a line of 3s\n    for j in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[8][j] = 3\n    \n    # Row 9: create a line of 3s\n    for j in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[9][j] = 3\n    \n    # Row 10: create a line of 3s\n    for j in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[10][j] = 3\n    \n    # Row 11: create a line of 3s\n    for j in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[11][j] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 2, the 8s are being transformed into 0s in certain positions, while the 1s and 8s are being rearranged.\n3. In Example 3, the 4s are being transformed into 0s in certain positions, while the 3s and 4s are being rearranged.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain values (like 3s, 2s, 8s, 4s) with others based on their position\n- Transforming patterns of numbers into different patterns\n- Possibly involving some form of symmetry or reflection\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values and transforms patterns.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(12)]\n    \n    #
