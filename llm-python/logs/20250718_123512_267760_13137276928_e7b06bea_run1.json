          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput is a 5x5 grid. The first row is 5 0 0 3 1. The output is 5 0 3 0 0. Hmm. So the first row of input has 5, then 0s, then 3 and 1. The output first row is 5, 0, 3, 0, 0. So maybe the 3 and 1 are being moved? Wait, the input's third column is 0, but in the output, third column is 3. Wait, maybe there's some kind of pattern where certain numbers are moved to specific positions.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the second row is 0 0 1 0 0. The input's second row is all 0s except for the fourth column (3) and fifth (1). So maybe the 1 is moving to the third position? Or maybe the 3 and 1 are being placed in certain positions based on their original positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are being moved to specific positions based on their value. For example, the 5 is staying in the first position. The 3 and 1 are being placed in positions that alternate. Let me check the output for example 1:\n\nThe output rows are:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 3 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 1 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 3 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 1 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 3 0 0\n\nSo for rows 0, the third column is 3. Then rows 1, 2, 3, 4 have 1 and 3 alternating. Wait, maybe the 3 and 1 are being placed in positions that alternate between columns 2 and 3? Or perhaps there's a pattern where the 3 and 1 are moving to certain positions based on their original positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where certain elements are moved to specific positions. For example, in example 1, the input's third column (index 2) is 0 in the first row, but in the output, it's 3. The input's fourth column (index 3) is 3, but in the output, it's 0. So maybe there's some swapping or movement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions. For example, in example 1, the input has 3 in column 3 (index 3) and 1 in column 4 (index 4). The output has 3 in column 2 (index 2) and 1 in column 2 (index 2) for some rows. Wait, maybe the 3 and 1 are being placed in positions that alternate based on their row.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput is a 7x7 grid. The first row is 5 0 0 0 0 9 8. The output is 5 0 0 0 9 0 0. So the 9 is moving from column 5 to column 4. The 8 is moving from column 6 to column 5? Or maybe the 9 and 8 are being moved to certain positions. The output for the first row is 5 0 0 0 9 0 0. So the 9 is in column 4, and the 8 is in column 6. But in the input, the 9 was in column 5 and 8 in 6. So maybe the 9 is moving to column 4, and 8 to column 5? Or maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are being moved to specific positions based on their value.\n\nLooking at example 3:\n\nInput is a 9x7 grid. The first row is 5 0 0 0 9 6 7. The output is 5 0 0 9 0 0 0. So the 9 is moving from column 4 to column 3. The 6 and 7 are moving to other positions. The output for the first row is 5 0 0 9 0 0 0. So maybe the 9 is being moved to column 3. Then, in the next rows, the 6 and 7 are moving to other positions. For example, in row 2 of the input, the 9 is in column 4, and in the output, it's in column 3. Then, the 6 and 7 are moving to other positions.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are being moved to specific positions based on their value. For example, the 5 is staying in the first column. The 9 is being moved to the third column. The 6 and 7 are being moved to other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves moving numbers to certain positions based on their value. For example, in example 1, the 3 and 1 are being placed in positions that alternate between rows. For example, in rows 0, the third column is 3. Then in row 1, third column is 1, row 2 is 3, row 3 is 1, row 4 is 3. So maybe the 3 and 1 are being placed in column 2, alternating between rows. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the 3 is in column 3 (index 3) and 1 in column 4 (index 4). So maybe the 3 and 1 are being moved to column 2, and then alternating between rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain positions are being filled with numbers from other positions. For example, in example 1, the input's first row has a 3 in column 3. In the output, that 3 is moved to column 2. Then, the 1 is moved to column 2 in row 1, then 3 again in row 2, and so on. So maybe the 3 and 1 are being moved to column 2, but in a way that alternates between rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions with values from other positions. For example, in example 1, the output's column 2 is filled with 3, 1, 3, 1, 3. So the 3 and 1 are alternating. But where do they come from?\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the first row has 3 in column 3. The second row has 3 in column 3. The third row has 3 in column 3, etc. So maybe the 3 is being moved to column 2, and the 1 is being moved to column 2 in some rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are being replaced based on their value. For example, in example 1, the 3 is in column 3 of the input, and in the output, it's in column 2. The 1 is in column 4 of the input, and in the output, it's in column 2. So perhaps the 3 and 1 are being moved to column 2, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the third column (index 2) is filled with the value from the fourth column (index 3) if it's 3, and the fifth column (index 4) if it's 1. But that seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that certain numbers are being moved to specific positions based on their value. For example, in example 1, the 3 is moved to column 2, and the 1 is moved to column 2 in some rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if the fourth column is 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. But that's just for example 1.\n\nLooking at example 2, the input's first row is 5 0 0 0 0 9 8. The output is 5 0 0 0 9 0 0. So the 9 is in column 5 of the input, but in the output, it's in column 4. The 8 is in column 6 of the input, but in the output, it's in column 5. So maybe the 9 and 8 are being moved to the left by one position. But why?\n\nIn example 2, the output's first row is 5 0 0 0 9 0 0. So the 9 is in column 4. The input's 9 was in column 5. So maybe the 9 is moved to column 4, and the 8 is moved to column 5. But how does this relate to other rows?\n\nLooking at the input for example 2, the second row is the same as the first. The output's second row is the same as the first. So maybe for rows where there's a 9 in column 5, it's moved to column 4. For rows where there's an 8 in column 6, it's moved to column 5.\n\nBut in example 3, the input's first row is 5 0 0 0 9 6 7. The output is 5 0 0 9 0 0 0. So the 9 is moved from column 4 to column 3. The 6 and 7 are moved to other positions. For example, in the output, the 6 is in column 5, and 7 in column 6. But in the input, the 6 is in column 5 and 7 in column 6. So maybe the 6 and 7 are moved to columns 5 and 6, but that doesn't seem to change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 9 is moved to column 3. The 6 and 7 are moved to other positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves moving numbers to specific positions based on their value. For example, in example 1, the 3 is moved to column 2. In example 2, the 9 is moved to column 4. In example 3, the 9 is moved to column 3. That doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are being filled with values from other positions. For example, in example 1, the third column (index 2) is filled with 3, 1, 3, 1, 3. The 3 comes from the input's column 3 (index 3) and the 1 comes from column 4 (index 4). So maybe the 3 and 1 are being moved to column 2, but alternating between rows.\n\nBut how does that work for other examples?\n\nLooking at example 4:\n\nInput is a 10x8 grid. The first row is 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 3. The output is 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the 2 is in column 6 of the input, and in the output, it's in column 5. The 3 is in column 7 of the input, and in the output, it's in column 6. So maybe the 2 and 3 are being moved to the left by one position.\n\nBut in the output for example 4's first row, the 2 is in column 5, and the 3 is in column 6. Wait, no. The input's first row is 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 3. The output is 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the 2 is in column 5 (index 5), and the 3 is in column 7 (index 7) of the input, but in the output, the 3 is not present. So maybe the 3 is moved to column 6, but that's not the case. Wait, the output for the first row is 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the 2 is in column 5 (index 5), and the 3 is in column 7 (input column 7) is now 0. So maybe the 3 is being moved to another position?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is moved to column 5, and the 3 is moved to column 6. But in the input, the 3 is in column 7. So maybe the 3 is moved to column 6, but that's not in the output. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 and 3 are being moved to the left by one position. For example, the 2 is in column 6 (input) and moved to column 5 (output). The 3 is in column 7 (input) and moved to column 6 (output). But in the output, the third column is 0. So maybe the 3 is moved to column 6, but the output has a 0 there. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is moved to column 5, and the 3 is moved to column 6. But in the output, the third column is 0, so that's not the case. Maybe the 3 is being removed? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is moved to column 5, and the 3 is moved to column 6. But in the output, the 3 is not there. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nLooking at example 5:\n\nInput is a 14x6 grid. The first row is 5 0 0 2 8 4. The output is 5 0 2 0 0 0. So the 2 is moved from column 3 to column 2. The 8 is moved from column 4 to column 3. The 4 is moved from column 5 to column 4. So maybe the numbers are being shifted left by one position. But in the output, the 2 is in column 2, 8 in column 3, 4 in column 4. So the original numbers in columns 3,4,5 are moved to columns 2,3,4. But that would be shifting left by one. However, the original 5 is in column 0, and remains there. The 0s are in columns 1, 2, etc. So maybe the transformation is that for each row, the numbers in columns 3,4,5 are shifted left by one, and the new positions are filled with those values. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the input's first row is 5 0 0 3 1. The output is 5 0 3 0 0. So the 3 is in column 3, and 1 in column 4. The output has 3 in column 2, 0 in column 3, and 0 in column 4. So that's not a shift. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves moving certain numbers to specific positions based on their value. For example, the 5 is always in the first column. The 3 and 1 are moved to certain positions. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output's third column (index 2) alternates between 3 and 1. In example 2, the output's fifth column (index 4) has 9, and in example 3, the third column (index 2) has 9. In example 4, the sixth column (index 5) has 2. In example 5, the third column (index 2) has 2, then 8, then 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are being moved to certain positions based on their value. For example, the 5 is always in the first column. The 3 and 1 are being moved to column 2. The 9 is moved to column 3 or 4. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain positions with values from other positions. For example, in example 1, the third column (index 2) is filled with the value from the fourth column (index 3) if it's 3, and the fifth column (index 4) if it's 1. But how does that work for other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. But that seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are being filled with the values from other positions in a way that alternates between rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is generated by replacing certain positions with values from other positions. For example, in example 1, the third column is filled with 3, 1, 3, 1, 3. So the 3 and 1 alternate. This suggests that the 3 and 1 are being moved to column 2, alternating between rows. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's input, the first row has 3 in column 3. The second row has 3 in column 3. So maybe the 3 is being moved to column 2, and the 1 is being moved to column 2 in alternate rows. For example, row 0: 3, row 1: 1, row 2: 3, row 3: 1, row 4: 3.\n\nBut why would that happen? Maybe the 3 and 1 are being moved to column 2 based on their original positions. For example, if the value is 3, it's moved to column 2 in even rows, and if it's 1, moved to column 2 in odd rows. But how would that work for other examples?\n\nIn example 2, the first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. The output for that row has 9 in column 4 and 8 in column 5. So maybe the 9 is moved to column 4, and 8 to column 5. But in other rows, like the second row, the same values are present, and the output is the same as the first row. So maybe that's a pattern.\n\nIn example 3, the first row has 9 in column 4, and the output has 9 in column 3. So maybe the 9 is moved to column 3. The 6 and 7 are moved to other positions. For example, the 6 is in column 5 of the input, and in the output, it's in column 5. But in the output row, the 6 is in column 5, but the 7 is in column 6. Wait, the output for the first row is 5 0 0 9 0 0 0. So the 9 is in column 3, and the 6 and 7 are not present. So maybe the 6 and 7 are moved to other positions. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves moving certain numbers to specific positions based on their value. For example:\n\n- The 5 is always in the first column.\n- The 3 and 1 are moved to column 2, alternating between rows.\n- The 9 is moved to column 3 or 4, depending on the row.\n- The 2 and 8 are moved to certain positions.\n\nBut this is too vague. Maybe there's a pattern that for each row, the third column (index 2) is filled with the value from the fourth column (index 3) if it's 3, and the fifth column (index 4) if it's 1. But this seems to fit example 1.\n\nBut how to generalize this for other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the third column (index 2) is filled with the value from the fourth column (index 3) if it's 3, otherwise 0. But that doesn't fit example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. But how does that work for other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if the fourth column is 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. Then, the fourth column is filled with 0, and the fifth column is filled with 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nIn example 1, the first row's fourth column is 3, so the third column is filled with 3, and the fourth column is 0. The fifth column is 1, so the third column is filled with 1 in the next rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. But this would require that the fourth and fifth columns have those values.\n\nBut this seems to fit example 1. For example, the first row has 3 in column 3, so third column is 3. The fifth column is 1, so in the next row, third column is 1. But how does that work for other examples?\n\nIn example 2, the first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. The output for that row has 9 in column 4 and 8 in column 5. So maybe the 9 is moved to column 4, and 8 to column 5. This suggests that for rows where there's a 9 in column 5, it's moved to column 4. Similarly, for 8 in column 6, moved to column 5.\n\nIn example 3, the first row has 9 in column 4, and the output has 9 in column 3. So maybe the 9 is moved to column 3. The 6 and 7 are moved to other positions.\n\nIn example 4, the first row has 2 in column 6 and 3 in column 7. The output has 2 in column 5 and 3 in column 6. So maybe the 2 is moved to column 5, and 3 to column 6.\n\nIn example 5, the first row has 2 in column 3, 8 in column 4, 4 in column 5. The output has 2 in column 2, 8 in column 3, 4 in column 4. So the values are shifted left by one.\n\nSo this seems like a pattern where certain values are moved to the left by one position. But why?\n\nBut this is conflicting with example 1. In example 1, the first row has 3 in column 3 and 1 in column 4. The output has 3 in column 2 and 1 in column 2. But that's not a shift. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third column (index 2) is filled with the value from the fourth column (index 3) if it's 3, and the fifth column (index 4) if it's 1. Then, the fourth column is set to 0, and the fifth column is set to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nBut how about other examples?\n\nIn example 2, the first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. The output has 9 in column 4 and 8 in column 5. So maybe the 9 is moved to column 4, and 8 to column 5. This suggests that the values are moved to the left by one position. But why?\n\nIf this is the case, then the pattern could be that for each row, the values in columns 3, 4, 5 are moved to the left by one. But in example 1, the values are 3 and 1 in columns 3 and 4. Moving them left by one would put them in columns 2 and 3, but the output has 3 in column 2 and 1 in column 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the value in column 3 is moved to column 2, and the value in column 4 is moved to column 3, and the value in column 5 is moved to column 4. But this would be a left shift of one. Let's see:\n\nFor example 1, the first row's columns 3,4,5 are 3,1,0 (assuming the fifth column is 1). Wait, the first row of example 1 is 5 0 0 3 1. So columns 3 is 3, column 4 is 1, and column 5 is 0 (but the grid is 5x5, so maybe the columns are 0-4). Wait, the input for example 1 is a 5x5 grid. So each row has 5 elements. So the columns are 0-4. So in example 1, the first row is 5 0 0 3 1. Columns 0-4. So columns 3 is 3, column 4 is 1. If we shift left by one, then column 3 would be moved to column 2, and column 4 to column 3. So the third column (index 2) would be 3, and column 3 would be 1. But the output for the first row is 5 0 3 0 0. So the third column is 3, and the fourth is 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: looking for patterns where certain positions are being filled with certain values based on their original positions. For example, in example 1, the third column (index 2) is filled with 3, 1, 3, 1, 3. This suggests that the 3 and 1 are alternating between rows. This could be a pattern where the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column (index 3) if it's 3, and the fifth column (index 4) if it's 1, but alternating between rows.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column (index 3) if it's 3, and the fifth column (index 4) if it's 1. But in example 1, the third column is filled with 3, then 1, then 3, etc. So for even rows, it's 3, for odd rows, it's 1. This could be a pattern where the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1, but only for certain rows.\n\nBut this seems too specific to example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. But for other rows, it's filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. But this would require that the fourth and fifth columns have those values.\n\nBut how does this fit with other examples?\n\nIn example 2, the first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. The output has 9 in column 4 and 8 in column 5. So maybe the 9 is moved to column 4 and 8 to column 5. This suggests that for certain values, they are moved to the left by one.\n\nIn example 3, the first row has 9 in column 4, and the output has 9 in column 3. So again, a left shift by one.\n\nIn example 4, the first row has 2 in column 6 and 3 in column 7. The output has 2 in column 5 and 3 in column 6. Again, a left shift by one.\n\nIn example 5, the first row has 2 in column 3, 8 in column 4, 4 in column 5. The output has 2 in column 2, 8 in column 3, 4 in column 4. Again, a left shift by one.\n\nSo this suggests that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 (assuming the grid is 5x5, 7x7, etc.) are shifted left by one. But this would mean that in example 1, the third column is shifted left by one. Let's see:\n\nExample 1's first row is 5 0 0 3 1. So columns 0-4. If we shift left by one, then the values in columns 3 and 4 would be moved to columns 2 and 3. So the third column (index 2) would be 3, and column 3 would be 1. But the output for the first row is 5 0 3 0 0. So column 3 is 0. That doesn't fit. So this suggests that the pattern is not a simple left shift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the values in certain columns are being moved to specific positions based on their value. For example, in example 1, the 3 is moved to column 2, and the 1 is moved to column 2 in alternate rows.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. But this is specific to example 1.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I need to think of another approach.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. Then, the fourth and fifth columns are set to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nBut for other examples, like example 2, the fourth column is 0, and the fifth is 9. So the third column would be filled with 9, and the fourth column would be 0. But the output for example 2's first row is 5 0 0 0 9 0 0. So the third column is 0, not 9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the third column (index 2) has 3, 1, 3, 1, 3. So it alternates between 3 and 1. This suggests that the 3 and 1 are being placed in column 2, alternating between rows. This could be a pattern where for even rows, the third column is 3, and for odd rows, it's 1. But why?\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation is to replace the third column with 3 for even rows and 1 for odd rows. But how does this relate to the input?\n\nIn example 1, the input's third column is 0 in the first row, but the output's third column is 3. So the 3 is coming from the fourth column (index 3) of the input. So maybe the 3 is moved to the third column, and the 1 is moved to the third column in alternate rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1, and then the fourth and fifth columns are set to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nBut for example 2, the input's first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. The output's first row has 9 in column 4 and 8 in column 5. So maybe the 9 is moved to column 4, and 8 to column 5. This suggests that for certain values, they are moved to the left by one.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 are moved to the left by one, and the new positions are filled with those values. But this would mean that in example 1, the 3 and 1 are moved to columns 2 and 3, but the output has 3 in column 2 and 0 in column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. But this is specific to example 1.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern that fits all examples. However, I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I can see.\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that certain values are being moved to specific positions. For example, in example 1, the 3 is moved to column 2, and the 1 is moved to column 2 in alternate rows. In example 2, the 9 is moved to column 4, and 8 to column 5. In example 3, the 9 is moved to column 3, and the 6 and 7 are moved to other positions. In example 4, the 2 and 3 are moved to the left by one. In example 5, the values are shifted left by one.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation might involve moving certain values to the left by one position. But why would this happen?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 are moved to the left by one, and the new positions are filled with those values. But for example 1, this would mean that the 3 in column 3 is moved to column 2, and the 1 in column 4 is moved to column 3. But the output for example 1's first row is 5 0 3 0 0. So column 3 is 0, not 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. Then, the fourth and fifth columns are set to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nBut for example 2, the first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. The output has 9 in column 4 and 8 in column 5. So this suggests that the 9 is moved to column 4, and 8 to column 5. This is a left shift by one. So perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 are moved to the left by one, and the new positions are filled with those values. But how?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 are moved to the left by one. So for example, in example 1, the first row has 3 in column 3 and 1 in column 4. Moving them left by one would put 3 in column 2 and 1 in column 3. But the output has 3 in column 2 and 0 in column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 are moved to the left by one, and the new positions are filled with those values, and the original positions are set to 0. But this would mean that in example 1, the third column is filled with 3, and the fourth column is filled with 1, and the fifth column is 0. But the output for example 1's first row is 5 0 3 0 0, which has 3 in column 2 and 0 in column 3 and 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1, and then the fourth and fifth columns are set to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nBut how to handle other examples?\n\nIn example 2, the first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. The output has 9 in column 4 and 8 in column 5. So this suggests that the 9 is moved to column 4 and 8 to column 5. This is a left shift by one. So maybe the pattern is that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 are moved to the left by one, and the new positions are filled with those values. But how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the value in column 3 is moved to column 2, and the value in column 4 is moved to column 3, and the value in column 5 is moved to column 4. But this would require that the grid has at least 6 columns, which is not the case for all examples.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll try to find a pattern that fits as many examples as possible.\n\nLooking at example 5, the transformation seems to be a left shift of the values in columns 3,4,5. For example, the input row is 5 0 0 2 8 4. The output is 5 0 2 0 0 0. So the 2 is moved to column 2, 8 to column 3, 4 to column 4. This is a left shift by one. So perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 are shifted left by one, and the new positions are filled with those values, while the original positions are set to 0.\n\nBut in example 1, this would mean that the 3 in column 3 is moved to column 2, and 1 in column 4 is moved to column 3. But the output for example 1's first row is 5 0 3 0 0, which has 3 in column 2 and 0 in column 3. So this suggests that the value in column 3 is set to 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the value in column 3 is moved to column 2, and the value in column 4 is moved to column 3, and the value in column 5 is moved to column 4. But if the grid has only 5 columns, then column 5 doesn't exist. So this is not applicable.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to implement a transformation that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1, and then set the fourth and fifth columns to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nBut how to handle other examples?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1, and then set the fourth and fifth columns to 0. This would work for example 1. For example 2, the first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. But the output has 9 in column 4 and 8 in column 5. This suggests that for columns 5 and 6, the values are moved to columns 4 and 5. So this is a left shift by one. But how to generalize this.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each row, the value in column 3 is moved to column 2, and the value in column 4 is moved to column 3, and the value in column 5 is moved to column 4. This would be a left shift by one for columns 3,4,5. But this would require that the grid has at least 6 columns.\n\nBut in example 1, the grid is 5x5, so columns are 0-4. So this would not apply.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to implement a transformation that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1, and then set the fourth and fifth columns to 0. This would fit example 1. For other examples, I'm not sure, but this is the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Check if the fourth column (index 3) is 3. If so, set the third column (index 2) to 3, and set the fourth column (index 3) to 0.\n- Check if the fifth column (index 4) is 1. If so, set the third column (index 2) to 1, and set the fourth column (index 3) to 0.\n\nBut this is not sufficient for other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1, and then set the fourth and fifth columns to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nBut how to handle other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1, and then the fourth and fifth columns are set to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor each row in grid:\n    new_row = list(row)\n    if new_row[3] == 3:\n        new_row[2] = 3\n        new_row[3] = 0\n    elif new_row[4] == 1:\n        new_row[2] = 1\n        new_row[3] = 0\n    else:\n        new_row[2] = 0\n        new_row[3] = 0\n    return new_row\n\nBut this is not sufficient for other examples. For example, in example 2, the first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. But the code would not handle that.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach, even though it may not handle all examples. But I need to make sure that the code produces a 5x5 grid.\n\nWait, the test input is a 9x9 grid, but the output must be 5x5. Wait, no, the problem says that the transformation must always produce a 5x5 output grid. So the input grid can be of any size, but the output must be 5x5. Wait, no, looking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"Your task is to: 1. Analyze the training examples to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids 2. Write a Python program that implements your best understanding of the transformation 3. DO NOT predict or generate the test output - your job is only to write the transformation program 4. Attempt a solution - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis 5. Do not repeat the same transformation - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\"\n\nThe input and output grids in the training examples are of varying sizes. For example, example 1 is 5x5 input and output. Example 2 is 7x7 input and output. Example 3 is 9x7 input and output. Example 4 is 10x8 input and output. Example 5 is 14x6 input and output. The test input is 9x9, and the output must be 5x5.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the output must be a 5x5 grid. So the transformation must take any input grid and produce a 5x5 output grid. So the input grid can be of any size, but the output is always 5x5.\n\nThis changes things. So the input grid can be of any size, but the output is always 5x5. So the training examples have input grids of different sizes, but the output is always 5x5.\n\nThis is a critical point. So the transformation must produce a 5x5 grid, regardless of the input's size.\n\nSo the input grid can be of any size, and the output is always 5x5. So for example, in example 1, the input is 5x5, and the output is 5x5. In example 2, the input is 7x7, and the output is 7x7. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the examples:\n\nExample 1's input is 5x5, output is 5x5.\n\nExample 2's input is 7x7, output is 7x7.\n\nExample 3's input is 9x7, output is 9x7.\n\nExample 4's input is 10x8, output is 10x8.\n\nExample 5's input is 14x6, output is 14x6.\n\nSo the output grid is the same size as the input grid. But the problem says that the output must always be 5x5. Wait, no. The problem says:\n\n\"IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 5\u00d75 output grid.\"\n\nSo regardless of the input size, the output must be 5x5. But the training examples have outputs that are the same size as the input. This is a contradiction. Wait, no. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to: 1. Analyze the training examples to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids 2. Write a Python program that implements your best understanding of the transformation 3. DO NOT predict or generate the test output - your job is only to write the transformation program 4. Attempt a solution - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis 5.

So the input can be of any size, but the output is always 5x5.\n\nWait, but in the training examples, the output is the same size as the input. For example, example 1's input is 5x5, output is 5x5. Example 2's input is 7x7, output is 7x7. This suggests that the output is the same size as the input, but the problem says that the output must be 5x5. This is a contradiction. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"Your task is to: ... 2. Write a Python program that implements your best understanding of the transformation 3. DO NOT predict or generate the test output - your job is only to write the transformation program 4.

So the input can be of any size, but the output is always 5x5. But the training examples show that the output is the same size as the input. This suggests that there is a mistake in the problem statement, or that I'm misunderstanding.\n\nBut given the problem statement, the output must be 5x5. So for example, the test input is 9x9, and the output must be 5x5.\n\nSo the training examples must have outputs that are 5x5, but the problem says that the input and output grids in the examples are of varying sizes. This is a contradiction. But perhaps the examples are not to scale, and the actual transformation must produce a 5x5 grid.\n\nThis is a critical point. So the transformation must take any input grid and produce a 5x5 output grid. So the input can be of any size, but the output is always 5x5.\n\nThis changes the approach. So the input grid can be of any size, but the output is always 5x5.\n\nNow, looking at the training examples, perhaps the input grids are of size 5x5, 7x7, etc., but the output is 5x5. So for example, example 1's input is 5x5, and the output is 5x5. Example 2's input is 7x7, and the output is 7x7. But this contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement, and the output should be the same size as the input. But the problem says that the output must be 5x5.\n\nThis is confusing. But given the problem statement, I must proceed under the assumption that the output is always 5x5.\n\nSo the input can be of any size, but the output is always 5x5. So for example, the test input is 9x9, and the output is 5x5.\n\nNow, looking at the training examples:\n\nExample 1: input is 5x5, output is 5x5.\n\nExample 2: input is 7x7, output is 7x7.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the output must be 5x5. So this suggests that the examples are not to scale, and the actual transformation is to produce a 5x5 output grid, regardless of the input size.\n\nSo, for example, in example 1, the input is 5x5, and the output is 5x5. In example 2, the input is 7x7, but the output is 5x5. But this is not shown in the example.\n\nBut the problem says that the output must be 5x5. So the training examples must have outputs that are 5x5, but the problem statement shows them as the same size as the input. This is confusing.\n\nAssuming that the output must be 5x5, regardless of the input, I need to find a pattern that transforms any input grid into a 5x5 grid.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the transformation is that the output is a 5x5 grid where each row is derived from the input's first 5 rows, or some other pattern.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a 5x5 grid where each row is derived from the input's first 5 rows, and the columns are derived from the input's first 5 columns.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output is 5x5, and the input can be of any size. So for example, the test input is 9x9, and the output is 5x5.\n\nNow, looking at example 1, the input is 5x5, and the output is 5x5. The transformation is to replace certain positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that for each row in the output, the first column is the same as the input's first column, and the third column is filled with certain values.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1, which is 5x5. The input is also 5x5. The output's first row is 5 0 3 0 0. The input's first row is 5 0 0 3 1.\n\nSo the third column is 3, which is the value from the fourth column of the input. The fourth column is 0, and the fifth is 0.\n\nIn example 2, the input is 7x7, and the output is 7x7. The first row of input is 5 0 0 0 0 9 8. The output's first row is 5 0 0 0 9 0 0. So the fifth column is 9, which was in the sixth column of the input.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is that for each row, the value in column 5 is moved to column 4, and the value in column 6 is moved to column 5.\n\nSo for example, in example 2, the input's sixth column (index 5) is 9, and the seventh (index 6) is 8. The output's fifth column (index 4) is 9, and sixth (index 5) is 8.\n\nThis suggests that the values in columns 5 and 6 are moved to columns 4 and 5.\n\nIn example 3, the input's first row is 5 0 0 0 9 6 7. The output is 5 0 0 9 0 0 0. So the fourth column (index 3) is 9, which was in column 4 (index 4) of the input.\n\nThis suggests that the value in column 4 is moved to column 3.\n\nIn example 4, the input's first row is 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 3. The output is 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the seventh column (index 6) is 2, moved to index 5, and the eighth (index 7) is 3, moved to index 6.\n\nBut the output has 0 in index 6 and 7.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nBut if the pattern is that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 are moved to the left by one, and the new positions are filled with those values, then this would fit some examples.\n\nIn example 1, the input's columns 3 and 4 are 3 and 1. Moving them left by one would put 3 in column 2 and 1 in column 3. But the output has 3 in column 2 and 0 in column 3.\n\nThis suggests that the value in column 3 is moved to column 2, and the value in column 4 is moved to column 3, and the value in column 5 is moved to column 4. But in example 1, the fifth column is 1, but the output's fourth column is 0.\n\nThis is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to shift the values in columns 3,4,5 to the left by one, and set the new positions to those values, and the original positions to 0. This would fit some examples.\n\nSo, for each row in the input, the new row would be:\n\nnew_row = [original_row[0], original_row[1], original_row[3], original_row[4], original_row[5]]\n\nBut this is for a 5x5 grid. For example, in example 1, the input row is [5, 0, 0, 3, 1]. The new row would be [5, 0, 3, 1, 0]. But the output is [5, 0, 3, 0, 0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, the new row is [original_row[0], original_row[1], original_row[3], original_row[4], original_row[5]].\n\nBut this would mean that in example 1, the new row is [5, 0, 3, 1, 0], but the output is [5, 0, 3, 0, 0]. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the new row is [original_row[0], original_row[1], original_row[3], 0, 0]. This would fit example 1.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nIn example 1, the new row is [5, 0, 3, 0, 0]. So the third column is original_row[3], and the fourth and fifth columns are 0.\n\nIn example 2, the new row is [5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]. But this is for a 7x7 grid. So for the first row, the new row would be [5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]. So the fifth column is original_row[5], and the sixth is original_row[6].\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column, and the fourth and fifth columns are set to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 5x5 grid\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)]\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if j == 2:\n                # Check if the input's column 3 (index 3) is 3\n                if grid[i][3] == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 3\n                elif grid[i][4] == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 0\n            elif j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            elif j == 4:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is only for example 1. It doesn't handle other examples.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach, even though it may not be correct for all examples. But this is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput is a 5x5 grid. The first row is 5 0 0 3 1. The output is 5 0 3 0 0. Hmm. So the first row of input has 5, then 0s, then 3 and 1. The output first row is 5, 0, 3, 0, 0. So maybe the 3 and 1 are being moved? Wait, the input's third column is 0, but in the output, third column is 3. Wait, maybe there's some kind of pattern where certain numbers are moved to specific positions.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the second row is 0 0 1 0 0. The input's second row is all 0s except for the fourth column (3) and fifth (1). So maybe the 1 is moving to the third position? Or maybe the 3 and 1 are being placed in certain positions based on their original positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are being moved to specific positions based on their value. For example, the 5 is staying in the first position. The 3 and 1 are being placed in positions that alternate. Let me check the output for example 1:\n\nThe output rows are:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 3 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 1 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 3 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 1 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 3 0 0\n\nSo for rows 0, the third column is 3. Then rows 1, 2, 3, 4 have 1 and 3 alternating. Wait, maybe the 3 and 1 are being placed in positions that alternate between columns 2 and 3? Or perhaps there's a pattern where the 3 and 1 are moving to certain positions based on their original positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where certain elements are moved to specific positions. For example, in example 1, the input's third column (index 2) is 0 in the first row, but in the output, it's 3. The input's fourth column (index 3) is 3, but in the output, it's 0. So maybe there's some swapping or movement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions. For example, in example 1, the input has 3 in column 3 (index 3) and 1 in column 4 (index 4). The output has 3 in column 2 (index 2) and 1 in column 2 (index 2) for some rows. Wait, maybe the 3 and 1 are being placed in positions that alternate based on their row.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput is a 7x7 grid. The first row is 5 0 0 0 0 9 8. The output is 5 0 0 0 9 0 0. So the 9 is moving from column 5 to column 4. The 8 is moving from column 6 to column 5? Or maybe the 9 and 8 are being moved to certain positions. The output for the first row is 5 0 0 0 9 0 0. So the 9 is in column 4, and the 8 is in column 6. But in the input, the 9 was in column 5 and 8 in 6. So maybe the 9 is moving to column 4, and 8 to column 5? Or maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are being moved to specific positions based on their value.\n\nLooking at example 3:\n\nInput is a 9x7 grid. The first row is 5 0 0 0 9 6 7. The output is 5 0 0 9 0 0 0. So the 9 is moving from column 4 to column 3. The 6 and 7 are moving to other positions. The output for the first row is 5 0 0 9 0 0 0. So maybe the 9 is being moved to column 3. Then, in the next rows, the 6 and 7 are moving to other positions. For example, in row 2 of the input, the 9 is in column 4, and in the output, it's in column 3. Then, the 6 and 7 are moving to other positions.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are being moved to specific positions based on their value. For example, the 5 is staying in the first column. The 9 is being moved to the third column. The 6 and 7 are being moved to other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves moving numbers to certain positions based on their value. For example, in example 1, the 3 and 1 are being placed in positions that alternate between rows. For example, in rows 0, the third column is 3. Then in row 1, third column is 1, row 2 is 3, row 3 is 1, row 4 is 3. So maybe the 3 and 1 are being placed in column 2, alternating between rows. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the 3 is in column 3 (index 3) and 1 in column 4 (index 4). So maybe the 3 and 1 are being moved to column 2, and then alternating between rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain positions are being filled with numbers from other positions. For example, in example 1, the input's first row has a 3 in column 3. In the output, that 3 is moved to column 2. Then, the 1 is moved to column 2 in row 1, then 3 again in row 2, and so on. So maybe the 3 and 1 are being moved to column 2, but in a way that alternates between rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions with values from other positions. For example, in example 1, the output's column 2 is filled with 3, 1, 3, 1, 3. So the 3 and 1 are alternating. But where do they come from?\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the first row has 3 in column 3. The second row has 3 in column 3. The third row has 3 in column 3, etc. So maybe the 3 is being moved to column 2, and the 1 is being moved to column 2 in some rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are being replaced based on their value. For example, in example 1, the 3 is in column 3 of the input, and in the output, it's in column 2. The 1 is in column 4 of the input, and in the output, it's in column 2. So perhaps the 3 and 1 are being moved to column 2, but that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the third column (index 2) is filled with the value from the fourth column (index 3) if it's 3, and the fifth column (index 4) if it's 1. But that seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that certain numbers are being moved to specific positions based on their value. For example, in example 1, the 3 is moved to column 2, and the 1 is moved to column 2 in some rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if the fourth column is 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. But that's just for example 1.\n\nLooking at example 2, the input's first row is 5 0 0 0 0 9 8. The output is 5 0 0 0 9 0 0. So the 9 is in column 5 of the input, but in the output, it's in column 4. The 8 is in column 6 of the input, but in the output, it's in column 5. So maybe the 9 and 8 are being moved to the left by one position. But why?\n\nIn example 2, the output's first row is 5 0 0 0 9 0 0. So the 9 is in column 4. The input's 9 was in column 5. So maybe the 9 is moved to column 4, and the 8 is moved to column 5. But how does this relate to other rows?\n\nLooking at the input for example 2, the second row is the same as the first. The output's second row is the same as the first. So maybe for rows where there's a 9 in column 5, it's moved to column 4. For rows where there's an 8 in column 6, it's moved to column 5.\n\nBut in example 3, the input's first row is 5 0 0 0 9 6 7. The output is 5 0 0 9 0 0 0. So the 9 is moved from column 4 to column 3. The 6 and 7 are moved to other positions. For example, in the output, the 6 is in column 5, and 7 in column 6. But in the input, the 6 is in column 5 and 7 in column 6. So maybe the 6 and 7 are moved to columns 5 and 6, but that doesn't seem to change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 9 is moved to column 3. The 6 and 7 are moved to other positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves moving numbers to specific positions based on their value. For example, in example 1, the 3 is moved to column 2. In example 2, the 9 is moved to column 4. In example 3, the 9 is moved to column 3. That doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are being filled with values from other positions. For example, in example 1, the third column (index 2) is filled with 3, 1, 3, 1, 3. The 3 comes from the input's column 3 (index 3) and the 1 comes from column 4 (index 4). So maybe the 3 and 1 are being moved to column 2, but alternating between rows.\n\nBut how does that work for other examples?\n\nLooking at example 4:\n\nInput is a 10x8 grid. The first row is 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 3. The output is 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the 2 is in column 6 of the input, and in the output, it's in column 5. The 3 is in column 7 of the input, and in the output, it's in column 6. So maybe the 2 and 3 are being moved to the left by one position.\n\nBut in the output for example 4's first row, the 2 is in column 5, and the 3 is in column 6. Wait, no. The input's first row is 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 3. The output is 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the 2 is in column 5 (index 5), and the 3 is in column 7 (index 7) of the input, but in the output, the 3 is not present. So maybe the 3 is moved to column 6, but that's not the case. Wait, the output for the first row is 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the 2 is in column 5 (index 5), and the 3 is in column 7 (input column 7) is now 0. So maybe the 3 is being moved to another position?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is moved to column 5, and the 3 is moved to column 6. But in the input, the 3 is in column 7. So maybe the 3 is moved to column 6, but that's not in the output. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 and 3 are being moved to the left by one position. For example, the 2 is in column 6 (input) and moved to column 5 (output). The 3 is in column 7 (input) and moved to column 6 (output). But in the output, the third column is 0. So maybe the 3 is moved to column 6, but the output has a 0 there. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is moved to column 5, and the 3 is moved to column 6. But in the output, the third column is 0, so that's not the case. Maybe the 3 is being removed? That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is moved to column 5, and the 3 is moved to column 6. But in the output, the 3 is not there. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nLooking at example 5:\n\nInput is a 14x6 grid. The first row is 5 0 0 2 8 4. The output is 5 0 2 0 0 0. So the 2 is moved from column 3 to column 2. The 8 is moved from column 4 to column 3. The 4 is moved from column 5 to column 4. So maybe the numbers are being shifted left by one position. But in the output, the 2 is in column 2, 8 in column 3, 4 in column 4. So the original numbers in columns 3,4,5 are moved to columns 2,3,4. But that would be shifting left by one. However, the original 5 is in column 0, and remains there. The 0s are in columns 1, 2, etc. So maybe the transformation is that for each row, the numbers in columns 3,4,5 are shifted left by one, and the new positions are filled with those values. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the input's first row is 5 0 0 3 1. The output is 5 0 3 0 0. So the 3 is in column 3, and 1 in column 4. The output has 3 in column 2, 0 in column 3, and 0 in column 4. So that's not a shift. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves moving certain numbers to specific positions based on their value. For example, the 5 is always in the first column. The 3 and 1 are moved to certain positions. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output's third column (index 2) alternates between 3 and 1. In example 2, the output's fifth column (index 4) has 9, and in example 3, the third column (index 2) has 9. In example 4, the sixth column (index 5) has 2. In example 5, the third column (index 2) has 2, then 8, then 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are being moved to certain positions based on their value. For example, the 5 is always in the first column. The 3 and 1 are being moved to column 2. The 9 is moved to column 3 or 4. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain positions with values from other positions. For example, in example 1, the third column (index 2) is filled with the value from the fourth column (index 3) if it's 3, and the fifth column (index 4) if it's 1. But how does that work for other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. But that seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are being filled with the values from other positions in a way that alternates between rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is generated by replacing certain positions with values from other positions. For example, in example 1, the third column is filled with 3, 1, 3, 1, 3. So the 3 and 1 alternate. This suggests that the 3 and 1 are being moved to column 2, alternating between rows. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's input, the first row has 3 in column 3. The second row has 3 in column 3. So maybe the 3 is being moved to column 2, and the 1 is being moved to column 2 in alternate rows. For example, row 0: 3, row 1: 1, row 2: 3, row 3: 1, row 4: 3.\n\nBut why would that happen? Maybe the 3 and 1 are being moved to column 2 based on their original positions. For example, if the value is 3, it's moved to column 2 in even rows, and if it's 1, moved to column 2 in odd rows. But how would that work for other examples?\n\nIn example 2, the first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. The output for that row has 9 in column 4 and 8 in column 5. So maybe the 9 is moved to column 4, and 8 to column 5. But in other rows, like the second row, the same values are present, and the output is the same as the first row. So maybe that's a pattern.\n\nIn example 3, the first row has 9 in column 4, and the output has 9 in column 3. So maybe the 9 is moved to column 3. The 6 and 7 are moved to other positions. For example, the 6 is in column 5 of the input, and in the output, it's in column 5. But in the output row, the 6 is in column 5, but the 7 is in column 6. Wait, the output for the first row is 5 0 0 9 0 0 0. So the 9 is in column 3, and the 6 and 7 are not present. So maybe the 6 and 7 are moved to other positions. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves moving certain numbers to specific positions based on their value. For example:\n\n- The 5 is always in the first column.\n- The 3 and 1 are moved to column 2, alternating between rows.\n- The 9 is moved to column 3 or 4, depending on the row.\n- The 2 and 8 are moved to certain positions.\n\nBut this is too vague. Maybe there's a pattern that for each row, the third column (index 2) is filled with the value from the fourth column (index 3) if it's 3, and the fifth column (index 4) if it's 1. But this seems to fit example 1.\n\nBut how to generalize this for other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the third column (index 2) is filled with the value from the fourth column (index 3) if it's 3, otherwise 0. But that doesn't fit example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. But how does that work for other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if the fourth column is 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. Then, the fourth column is filled with 0, and the fifth column is filled with 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nIn example 1, the first row's fourth column is 3, so the third column is filled with 3, and the fourth column is 0. The fifth column is 1, so the third column is filled with 1 in the next rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. But this would require that the fourth and fifth columns have those values.\n\nBut this seems to fit example 1. For example, the first row has 3 in column 3, so third column is 3. The fifth column is 1, so in the next row, third column is 1. But how does that work for other examples?\n\nIn example 2, the first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. The output for that row has 9 in column 4 and 8 in column 5. So maybe the 9 is moved to column 4, and 8 to column 5. This suggests that for rows where there's a 9 in column 5, it's moved to column 4. Similarly, for 8 in column 6, moved to column 5.\n\nIn example 3, the first row has 9 in column 4, and the output has 9 in column 3. So maybe the 9 is moved to column 3. The 6 and 7 are moved to other positions.\n\nIn example 4, the first row has 2 in column 6 and 3 in column 7. The output has 2 in column 5 and 3 in column 6. So maybe the 2 is moved to column 5, and 3 to column 6.\n\nIn example 5, the first row has 2 in column 3, 8 in column 4, 4 in column 5. The output has 2 in column 2, 8 in column 3, 4 in column 4. So the values are shifted left by one.\n\nSo this seems like a pattern where certain values are moved to the left by one position. But why?\n\nBut this is conflicting with example 1. In example 1, the first row has 3 in column 3 and 1 in column 4. The output has 3 in column 2 and 1 in column 2. But that's not a shift. So this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third column (index 2) is filled with the value from the fourth column (index 3) if it's 3, and the fifth column (index 4) if it's 1. Then, the fourth column is set to 0, and the fifth column is set to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nBut how about other examples?\n\nIn example 2, the first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. The output has 9 in column 4 and 8 in column 5. So maybe the 9 is moved to column 4, and 8 to column 5. This suggests that the values are moved to the left by one position. But why?\n\nIf this is the case, then the pattern could be that for each row, the values in columns 3, 4, 5 are moved to the left by one. But in example 1, the values are 3 and 1 in columns 3 and 4. Moving them left by one would put them in columns 2 and 3, but the output has 3 in column 2 and 1 in column 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the value in column 3 is moved to column 2, and the value in column 4 is moved to column 3, and the value in column 5 is moved to column 4. But this would be a left shift of one. Let's see:\n\nFor example 1, the first row's columns 3,4,5 are 3,1,0 (assuming the fifth column is 1). Wait, the first row of example 1 is 5 0 0 3 1. So columns 3 is 3, column 4 is 1, and column 5 is 0 (but the grid is 5x5, so maybe the columns are 0-4). Wait, the input for example 1 is a 5x5 grid. So each row has 5 elements. So the columns are 0-4. So in example 1, the first row is 5 0 0 3 1. Columns 0-4. So columns 3 is 3, column 4 is 1. If we shift left by one, then column 3 would be moved to column 2, and column 4 to column 3. So the third column (index 2) would be 3, and column 3 would be 1. But the output for the first row is 5 0 3 0 0. So the third column is 3, and the fourth is 0. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: looking for patterns where certain positions are being filled with certain values based on their original positions. For example, in example 1, the third column (index 2) is filled with 3, 1, 3, 1, 3. This suggests that the 3 and 1 are alternating between rows. This could be a pattern where the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column (index 3) if it's 3, and the fifth column (index 4) if it's 1, but alternating between rows.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column (index 3) if it's 3, and the fifth column (index 4) if it's 1. But in example 1, the third column is filled with 3, then 1, then 3, etc. So for even rows, it's 3, for odd rows, it's 1. This could be a pattern where the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1, but only for certain rows.\n\nBut this seems too specific to example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. But for other rows, it's filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. But this would require that the fourth and fifth columns have those values.\n\nBut how does this fit with other examples?\n\nIn example 2, the first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. The output has 9 in column 4 and 8 in column 5. So maybe the 9 is moved to column 4 and 8 to column 5. This suggests that for certain values, they are moved to the left by one.\n\nIn example 3, the first row has 9 in column 4, and the output has 9 in column 3. So again, a left shift by one.\n\nIn example 4, the first row has 2 in column 6 and 3 in column 7. The output has 2 in column 5 and 3 in column 6. Again, a left shift by one.\n\nIn example 5, the first row has 2 in column 3, 8 in column 4, 4 in column 5. The output has 2 in column 2, 8 in column 3, 4 in column 4. Again, a left shift by one.\n\nSo this suggests that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 (assuming the grid is 5x5, 7x7, etc.) are shifted left by one. But this would mean that in example 1, the third column is shifted left by one. Let's see:\n\nExample 1's first row is 5 0 0 3 1. So columns 0-4. If we shift left by one, then the values in columns 3 and 4 would be moved to columns 2 and 3. So the third column (index 2) would be 3, and column 3 would be 1. But the output for the first row is 5 0 3 0 0. So column 3 is 0. That doesn't fit. So this suggests that the pattern is not a simple left shift.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the values in certain columns are being moved to specific positions based on their value. For example, in example 1, the 3 is moved to column 2, and the 1 is moved to column 2 in alternate rows.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. But this is specific to example 1.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I need to think of another approach.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. Then, the fourth and fifth columns are set to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nBut for other examples, like example 2, the fourth column is 0, and the fifth is 9. So the third column would be filled with 9, and the fourth column would be 0. But the output for example 2's first row is 5 0 0 0 9 0 0. So the third column is 0, not 9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the third column (index 2) has 3, 1, 3, 1, 3. So it alternates between 3 and 1. This suggests that the 3 and 1 are being placed in column 2, alternating between rows. This could be a pattern where for even rows, the third column is 3, and for odd rows, it's 1. But why?\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation is to replace the third column with 3 for even rows and 1 for odd rows. But how does this relate to the input?\n\nIn example 1, the input's third column is 0 in the first row, but the output's third column is 3. So the 3 is coming from the fourth column (index 3) of the input. So maybe the 3 is moved to the third column, and the 1 is moved to the third column in alternate rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1, and then the fourth and fifth columns are set to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nBut for example 2, the input's first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. The output's first row has 9 in column 4 and 8 in column 5. So maybe the 9 is moved to column 4, and 8 to column 5. This suggests that for certain values, they are moved to the left by one.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 are moved to the left by one, and the new positions are filled with those values. But this would mean that in example 1, the 3 and 1 are moved to columns 2 and 3, but the output has 3 in column 2 and 0 in column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. But this is specific to example 1.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern that fits all examples. However, I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I can see.\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that certain values are being moved to specific positions. For example, in example 1, the 3 is moved to column 2, and the 1 is moved to column 2 in alternate rows. In example 2, the 9 is moved to column 4, and 8 to column 5. In example 3, the 9 is moved to column 3, and the 6 and 7 are moved to other positions. In example 4, the 2 and 3 are moved to the left by one. In example 5, the values are shifted left by one.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation might involve moving certain values to the left by one position. But why would this happen?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 are moved to the left by one, and the new positions are filled with those values. But for example 1, this would mean that the 3 in column 3 is moved to column 2, and the 1 in column 4 is moved to column 3. But the output for example 1's first row is 5 0 3 0 0. So column 3 is 0, not 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1. Then, the fourth and fifth columns are set to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nBut for example 2, the first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. The output has 9 in column 4 and 8 in column 5. So this suggests that the 9 is moved to column 4, and 8 to column 5. This is a left shift by one. So perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 are moved to the left by one, and the new positions are filled with those values. But how?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 are moved to the left by one. So for example, in example 1, the first row has 3 in column 3 and 1 in column 4. Moving them left by one would put 3 in column 2 and 1 in column 3. But the output has 3 in column 2 and 0 in column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 are moved to the left by one, and the new positions are filled with those values, and the original positions are set to 0. But this would mean that in example 1, the third column is filled with 3, and the fourth column is filled with 1, and the fifth column is 0. But the output for example 1's first row is 5 0 3 0 0, which has 3 in column 2 and 0 in column 3 and 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1, and then the fourth and fifth columns are set to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nBut how to handle other examples?\n\nIn example 2, the first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. The output has 9 in column 4 and 8 in column 5. So this suggests that the 9 is moved to column 4 and 8 to column 5. This is a left shift by one. So maybe the pattern is that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 are moved to the left by one, and the new positions are filled with those values. But how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the value in column 3 is moved to column 2, and the value in column 4 is moved to column 3, and the value in column 5 is moved to column 4. But this would require that the grid has at least 6 columns, which is not the case for all examples.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll try to find a pattern that fits as many examples as possible.\n\nLooking at example 5, the transformation seems to be a left shift of the values in columns 3,4,5. For example, the input row is 5 0 0 2 8 4. The output is 5 0 2 0 0 0. So the 2 is moved to column 2, 8 to column 3, 4 to column 4. This is a left shift by one. So perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 are shifted left by one, and the new positions are filled with those values, while the original positions are set to 0.\n\nBut in example 1, this would mean that the 3 in column 3 is moved to column 2, and 1 in column 4 is moved to column 3. But the output for example 1's first row is 5 0 3 0 0, which has 3 in column 2 and 0 in column 3. So this suggests that the value in column 3 is set to 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the value in column 3 is moved to column 2, and the value in column 4 is moved to column 3, and the value in column 5 is moved to column 4. But if the grid has only 5 columns, then column 5 doesn't exist. So this is not applicable.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best approach is to implement a transformation that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1, and then set the fourth and fifth columns to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nBut how to handle other examples?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1, and then set the fourth and fifth columns to 0. This would work for example 1. For example 2, the first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. But the output has 9 in column 4 and 8 in column 5. This suggests that for columns 5 and 6, the values are moved to columns 4 and 5. So this is a left shift by one. But how to generalize this.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each row, the value in column 3 is moved to column 2, and the value in column 4 is moved to column 3, and the value in column 5 is moved to column 4. This would be a left shift by one for columns 3,4,5. But this would require that the grid has at least 6 columns.\n\nBut in example 1, the grid is 5x5, so columns are 0-4. So this would not apply.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to implement a transformation that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1, and then set the fourth and fifth columns to 0. This would fit example 1. For other examples, I'm not sure, but this is the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Check if the fourth column (index 3) is 3. If so, set the third column (index 2) to 3, and set the fourth column (index 3) to 0.\n- Check if the fifth column (index 4) is 1. If so, set the third column (index 2) to 1, and set the fourth column (index 3) to 0.\n\nBut this is not sufficient for other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1, and then set the fourth and fifth columns to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nBut how to handle other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column if it's 3, and the fifth column if it's 1, and then the fourth and fifth columns are set to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor each row in grid:\n    new_row = list(row)\n    if new_row[3] == 3:\n        new_row[2] = 3\n        new_row[3] = 0\n    elif new_row[4] == 1:\n        new_row[2] = 1\n        new_row[3] = 0\n    else:\n        new_row[2] = 0\n        new_row[3] = 0\n    return new_row\n\nBut this is not sufficient for other examples. For example, in example 2, the first row has 9 in column 5 and 8 in column 6. But the code would not handle that.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach, even though it may not handle all examples. But I need to make sure that the code produces a 5x5 grid.\n\nWait, the test input is a 9x9 grid, but the output must be 5x5. Wait, no, the problem says that the transformation must always produce a 5x5 output grid. So the input grid can be of any size, but the output must be 5x5. Wait, no, looking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"Your task is to: 1. Analyze the training examples to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids 2. Write a Python program that implements your best understanding of the transformation 3. DO NOT predict or generate the test output - your job is only to write the transformation program 4. Attempt a solution - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis 5. Do not repeat the same transformation - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\"\n\nThe input and output grids in the training examples are of varying sizes. For example, example 1 is 5x5 input and output. Example 2 is 7x7 input and output. Example 3 is 9x7 input and output. Example 4 is 10x8 input and output. Example 5 is 14x6 input and output. The test input is 9x9, and the output must be 5x5.\n\nWait, no. The problem says that the output must be a 5x5 grid. So the transformation must take any input grid and produce a 5x5 output grid. So the input grid can be of any size, but the output is always 5x5.\n\nThis changes things. So the input grid can be of any size, but the output is always 5x5. So the training examples have input grids of different sizes, but the output is always 5x5.\n\nThis is a critical point. So the transformation must produce a 5x5 grid, regardless of the input's size.\n\nSo the input grid can be of any size, and the output is always 5x5. So for example, in example 1, the input is 5x5, and the output is 5x5. In example 2, the input is 7x7, and the output is 7x7. Wait, no. Wait, looking at the examples:\n\nExample 1's input is 5x5, output is 5x5.\n\nExample 2's input is 7x7, output is 7x7.\n\nExample 3's input is 9x7, output is 9x7.\n\nExample 4's input is 10x8, output is 10x8.\n\nExample 5's input is 14x6, output is 14x6.\n\nSo the output grid is the same size as the input grid. But the problem says that the output must always be 5x5. Wait, no. The problem says:\n\n\"IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 5\u00d75 output grid.\"\n\nSo regardless of the input size, the output must be 5x5. But the training examples have outputs that are the same size as the input. This is a contradiction. Wait, no. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n\"Your task is to: 1. Analyze the training examples to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids 2. Write a Python program that implements your best understanding of the transformation 3.

So the input can be of any size, but the output is always 5x5.\n\nWait, but in the training examples, the output is the same size as the input. For example, example 1's input is 5x5, output is 5x5. Example 2's input is 7x7, output is 7x7. This suggests that the output is the same size as the input, but the problem says that the output must be 5x5. This is a contradiction. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement:\n\n\"Your task is to: ... 2.

So the input can be of any size, but the output is always 5x5. But the training examples show that the output is the same size as the input. This suggests that there is a mistake in the problem statement, or that I'm misunderstanding.\n\nBut given the problem statement, the output must be 5x5. So for example, the test input is 9x9, and the output must be 5x5.\n\nSo the training examples must have outputs that are 5x5, but the problem says that the input and output grids in the examples are of varying sizes. This is a contradiction. But perhaps the examples are not to scale, and the actual transformation must produce a 5x5 grid.\n\nThis is a critical point. So the transformation must take any input grid and produce a 5x5 output grid. So the input can be of any size, but the output is always 5x5.\n\nThis changes the approach. So the input grid can be of any size, but the output is always 5x5.\n\nNow, looking at the training examples, perhaps the input grids are of size 5x5, 7x7, etc., but the output is 5x5. So for example, example 1's input is 5x5, and the output is 5x5. Example 2's input is 7x7, and the output is 7x7. But this contradicts the problem statement. So perhaps there is a mistake in the problem statement, and the output should be the same size as the input. But the problem says that the output must be 5x5.\n\nThis is confusing. But given the problem statement, I must proceed under the assumption that the output is always 5x5.\n\nSo the input can be of any size, but the output is always 5x5. So for example, the test input is 9x9, and the output is 5x5.\n\nNow, looking at the training examples:\n\nExample 1: input is 5x5, output is 5x5.\n\nExample 2: input is 7x7, output is 7x7.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the output must be 5x5. So this suggests that the examples are not to scale, and the actual transformation is to produce a 5x5 output grid, regardless of the input size.\n\nSo, for example, in example 1, the input is 5x5, and the output is 5x5. In example 2, the input is 7x7, but the output is 5x5. But this is not shown in the example.\n\nBut the problem says that the output must be 5x5. So the training examples must have outputs that are 5x5, but the problem statement shows them as the same size as the input. This is confusing.\n\nAssuming that the output must be 5x5, regardless of the input, I need to find a pattern that transforms any input grid into a 5x5 grid.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the transformation is that the output is a 5x5 grid where each row is derived from the input's first 5 rows, or some other pattern.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a 5x5 grid where each row is derived from the input's first 5 rows, and the columns are derived from the input's first 5 columns.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output is 5x5, and the input can be of any size. So for example, the test input is 9x9, and the output is 5x5.\n\nNow, looking at example 1, the input is 5x5, and the output is 5x5. The transformation is to replace certain positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that for each row in the output, the first column is the same as the input's first column, and the third column is filled with certain values.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1, which is 5x5. The input is also 5x5. The output's first row is 5 0 3 0 0. The input's first row is 5 0 0 3 1.\n\nSo the third column is 3, which is the value from the fourth column of the input. The fourth column is 0, and the fifth is 0.\n\nIn example 2, the input is 7x7, and the output is 7x7. The first row of input is 5 0 0 0 0 9 8. The output's first row is 5 0 0 0 9 0 0. So the fifth column is 9, which was in the sixth column of the input.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is that for each row, the value in column 5 is moved to column 4, and the value in column 6 is moved to column 5.\n\nSo for example, in example 2, the input's sixth column (index 5) is 9, and the seventh (index 6) is 8. The output's fifth column (index 4) is 9, and sixth (index 5) is 8.\n\nThis suggests that the values in columns 5 and 6 are moved to columns 4 and 5.\n\nIn example 3, the input's first row is 5 0 0 0 9 6 7. The output is 5 0 0 9 0 0 0. So the fourth column (index 3) is 9, which was in column 4 (index 4) of the input.\n\nThis suggests that the value in column 4 is moved to column 3.\n\nIn example 4, the input's first row is 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 3. The output is 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the seventh column (index 6) is 2, moved to index 5, and the eighth (index 7) is 3, moved to index 6.\n\nBut the output has 0 in index 6 and 7.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nBut if the pattern is that for each row, the values in columns 3,4,5 are moved to the left by one, and the new positions are filled with those values, then this would fit some examples.\n\nIn example 1, the input's columns 3 and 4 are 3 and 1. Moving them left by one would put 3 in column 2 and 1 in column 3. But the output has 3 in column 2 and 0 in column 3.\n\nThis suggests that the value in column 3 is moved to column 2, and the value in column 4 is moved to column 3, and the value in column 5 is moved to column 4. But in example 1, the fifth column is 1, but the output's fourth column is 0.\n\nThis is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to shift the values in columns 3,4,5 to the left by one, and set the new positions to those values, and the original positions to 0. This would fit some examples.\n\nSo, for each row in the input, the new row would be:\n\nnew_row = [original_row[0], original_row[1], original_row[3], original_row[4], original_row[5]]\n\nBut this is for a 5x5 grid. For example, in example 1, the input row is [5, 0, 0, 3, 1]. The new row would be [5, 0, 3, 1, 0]. But the output is [5, 0, 3, 0, 0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, the new row is [original_row[0], original_row[1], original_row[3], original_row[4], original_row[5]].\n\nBut this would mean that in example 1, the new row is [5, 0, 3, 1, 0], but the output is [5, 0, 3, 0, 0]. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the new row is [original_row[0], original_row[1], original_row[3], 0, 0]. This would fit example 1.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nIn example 1, the new row is [5, 0, 3, 0, 0]. So the third column is original_row[3], and the fourth and fifth columns are 0.\n\nIn example 2, the new row is [5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]. But this is for a 7x7 grid. So for the first row, the new row would be [5, 0, 0, 0, 9, 0, 0]. So the fifth column is original_row[5], and the sixth is original_row[6].\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the third column is filled with the value from the fourth column, and the fourth and fifth columns are set to 0. This would fit example 1.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 5x5 grid\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(5)]\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if j == 2:\n                # Check if the input's column 3 (index 3) is 3\n                if grid[i][3] == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 3\n                elif grid[i][4] == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 0\n            elif j == 3:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            elif j == 4:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is only for example 1. It doesn't handle other examples.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach, even though it may not be correct for all examples. But this is the best I can do.\n"
