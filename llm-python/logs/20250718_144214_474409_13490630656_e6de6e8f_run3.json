          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let's start by analyzing the first example.\n\nExample 1:\nInput is a 3x4 grid (since each line has 12 numbers, which is 3 rows of 4 elements each?), wait wait, no. Wait, the input for example 1 is given as 12 numbers per line. Wait, the input is 3 rows, each with 12 elements? Wait, no. Wait, the input for example 1 is:\n\nInput lines:\n2 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 2\n2 2 0 2 2 0 2 0 2 2 0 2\nSo each line is 12 numbers. But the output is 8x7. Wait, the output is 8 rows and 7 columns. So the input is 3 rows, 12 columns? Wait, maybe the input is 3 rows, each with 12 elements. But the output is 8x7. So how does that transformation work?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is a grid, and the output is an 8x7 grid. So the input for the training examples must be of a certain size. Let me check the examples again.\n\nLooking at example 1's input: each line has 12 numbers. So the input grid is 3 rows by 12 columns. The output is 8 rows by 7 columns. So how does that transformation happen?\n\nHmm. Let me think about the output. For example 1's output, each row is 7 elements. So the output is 8 rows, each with 7 elements. The input is 3 rows, 12 columns. So the transformation is from 3x12 to 8x7. That seems like a non-trivial transformation.\n\nBut how? Maybe there's some pattern based on the positions of the numbers. Let me look at the first example's input and output.\n\nLooking at example 1's input:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 2\nRow 1: 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 0 2 2 0 2\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nLooking at the output, there's a 3 in the fourth position of the first output row. Maybe that's related to the input. Let's see where the 2s are in the input. For example, in the first input row, there are 2s at positions 0, 4, 6, 8, 11. Maybe the output is generated based on some kind of pattern where certain positions in the input are mapped to certain positions in the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of transformation that involves the positions of the numbers. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cells in certain positions.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is generated by taking some kind of pattern that's derived from the input. For example, in example 1, the output has 3s and 2s. Let's see:\n\nIn the output, the first row has a 3 in the fourth column. Let's check the input. In the first input row, the fourth column (index 3) is 0. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 3 is a result of some calculation based on neighboring cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking for certain patterns in the input. For example, in the first example, the input has a lot of 2s. The output has 3s and 2s. Maybe the 3s are where there are certain configurations of 2s. For example, maybe the 3 is in a position where there are three 2s in a row or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of convolution or kernel. But that's probably too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking for the positions of the 2s in the input and then mapping them to certain positions in the output. For example, in the first example, the output has a 3 in the fourth column of the first row. Maybe that's where there's a cluster of 2s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where the input is processed to create a grid that has certain patterns. For example, the output seems to have vertical lines of 2s and 3s. Let's look at the output of example 1. The first row has a 3 in the fourth column. Then, rows 1-2 have 2s in columns 3 and 4. Rows 3-4 have 2s in column 3. Rows 5 has 2s in columns 3 and 4. Rows 6-7 have 2 in column 4.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is generated by some kind of vertical lines. Let's think about the input. For example, in the first input row, the 2s are at positions 0,4,6,8,11. Maybe the output is generated by taking some kind of vertical lines based on the positions of the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions where the input has 2s and then creating a pattern based on that. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in a certain area, and 2 otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of transformation where the input is processed to create a grid where the 2s are replaced by certain values based on their positions.\n\nLooking at example 2's input:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 2\n2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 0 2\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nIn this case, the first row of output has a 3 in column 3. The second and third rows have 2s in columns 3 and 4. The fourth row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. Then rows 5-7 have 2 in column 4.\n\nSo similar to example 1. Maybe the 3 is in a position where there are three 2s in the input. Let's check the input for example 2. The first row of input is 0,2,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,2. So the 2s are at positions 1,3,6,9,11. The second row is 2,2,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,2,0,2. So 2s at 0,1,3,4,6,7,9,11.\n\nIn the output, the first row's 3 is in column 3. Let's see if that's where there's a cluster of 2s. For example, in the first input row, the 2s are at positions 1,3,6,9,11. In the second input row, positions 0,1,3,4,6,7,9,11. So in the input, there's a cluster of 2s in the second row's columns 3-4. Maybe that's why the output has a 3 in the first row's column 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking for certain patterns in the input. For example, in example 1, the output's first row has a 3 in column 3. Maybe that's because in the input, there are three 2s in a certain area. Let me check the input for example 1's first row. The first row of input is 2 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 2. So the positions of 2s are 0,4,6,8,11. In the second row, 2s are at 0,1,3,4,6,8,10. So in the second row, there are 2s at positions 3,4,6, etc. Maybe the 3 in the output is where there are three 2s in a row in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of convolution where the input is processed to create a grid where each cell is determined by the number of 2s in a certain window. For example, if there are three 2s in a certain area, then it becomes 3, otherwise 2. But how to map that to the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of the 2s in the input and then creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in a certain pattern, and 2 otherwise.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 3.\n\nInput for example 3:\n2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 2\n2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 0 2\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nIn this case, the output has a 3 in the first row's column 3. Then, the next rows have 2s in columns 3-4, then 3-4, then 4-5, etc. So it seems like the 3 is in a position where there are three 2s in the input. Let me check the input for example 3.\n\nFirst row of input: 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 2. So 2s at positions 0,3,6,9,11.\n\nSecond row: 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 0 2. So 2s at positions 0,1,3,4,6,7,9,11.\n\nSo in the first row of input, there's a 2 at position 3, and in the second row, positions 3 and 4. So maybe the 3 in the output is where there are three 2s in the input. For example, in the first row of input, there are two 2s in the first row, but in the second row, there are two 2s in positions 3 and 4. So maybe the 3 is generated when there's a cluster of three 2s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the input's 2s and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in a certain pattern, otherwise 2. But how to map that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of the 2s in the input and then creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in a certain vertical or horizontal line. For example, in the first example, the first row of output has a 3 in column 3. Let's see if that's where there are three 2s in the input's columns.\n\nLooking at column 3 of the input:\n\nIn example 1's input, column 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 (from the first row's 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 2? Wait, the first row is 2 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 2. So the columns are 0-11. Let me reindex:\n\nRow 0: positions 0-11: [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n\nSo column 3 is 0 (index 3). Column 4 is 2 (index 4). Column 6 is 2 (index 6). Column 8 is 2 (index 8). Column 11 is 2 (index 11). \n\nIn row 1: [2,2,0,2,2,0,2,0,2,2,0,2]. So column 3 is 2, column 4 is 2, column 6 is 2, column 8 is 2, column 10 is 2, etc.\n\nSo for column 3, in the input, there are 2s in row 1, column 3. So maybe the 3 in the output is in column 3 of row 0, which is where there's a 2 in row 1, column 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the positions of 2s in the input and then creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in the same column or row, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell in the output is determined by the number of 2s in a certain area. For example, if there are three 2s in a certain area, the output cell is 3, otherwise 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of 2s in the input and then creating a grid that represents the vertical lines. For example, in the first example, the output's first row has a 3 in column 3. Then, rows 1-2 have 2s in columns 3 and 4. Maybe that's because there are two 2s in the input's columns 3 and 4 of the second row.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid where each row corresponds to a certain vertical line in the input. For example, the output has 8 rows, which may correspond to the 8 rows of the output. But how to map the input's 3 rows to 8 rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid that is 8 rows tall and 7 columns wide, where each cell is determined by the number of 2s in a certain vertical strip of the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's 2s and creating a grid where each cell in the output is 3 if there are three 2s in the same column of the input, otherwise 2. But that seems not to fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking for certain patterns in the input. For example, the output's 3 is in the first row's column 3, which is where the input's second row has two consecutive 2s (columns 3 and 4). Maybe that's where the 3 comes from.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that involves the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, if a cell in the input has a 2, then in the output, certain positions are filled with 2s or 3s based on their positions.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1. The output has 8 rows. The input has 3 rows. How to map 3 rows to 8 rows. Maybe the output is generated by some kind of expansion of the input's 2s into multiple rows.\n\nFor example, the first example's output has 8 rows. Maybe each row in the output corresponds to a certain vertical line in the input. For example, the first three rows of the output may correspond to the first row of the input, and the next rows correspond to the second row of the input. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is determined by the number of times a certain pattern appears in the input. For example, in the first example, the first row of the output has a 3. That might be because in the input's second row, there are two 2s in columns 3 and 4, which is a horizontal line. So the output's first row has a 3 in that position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 2s and creating a grid that represents the vertical lines. For example, in example 1's input, the second row has 2s in columns 0,1,3,4,6,8,10. So maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of the 2s in the input and creating vertical lines in the output.\n\nBut how to map this to the output's 8 rows and 7 columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the positions of the 2s in the input and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in a certain vertical or horizontal line. For example, in the first example's input, the second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. So the output's first row has a 3 in column 3. Then, rows 1-2 have 2s in columns 3 and 4. Rows 3-4 have 2s in column 3. Rows 5 has 2s in columns 3 and 4. Rows 6-7 have 2 in column 4.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the output is generated by some kind of vertical line pattern. For example, the output's first row has a 3 in column 3, which might correspond to the second row of the input having two 2s in columns 3 and 4. Then, the output rows 1-2 have 2s in columns 3 and 4, which might correspond to the same two columns in the input's second row.\n\nBut how to generate this for the output's 8 rows. Maybe the output is generated by expanding the input's 2s into a grid of 8 rows, where each row corresponds to a certain vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that involves the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the output's first row has a 3 in column 3, which is the position where there are three 2s in the input's second row. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in a certain vertical strip of the input. For example, in the first example, the second row of the input has 2s in columns 3 and 4, but maybe that's not enough for a 3. However, the output has a 3 in the first row's column 3. Maybe the 3 is generated by some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 2s and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in a certain vertical or horizontal line. For example, if there are three 2s in a vertical line in the input, then the output has a 3 in that position. But how to map that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the input's 2s and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in a certain vertical or horizontal line. For example, in the first example, the second row of the input has two 2s in columns 3 and 4. But that's not three. However, the output has a 3 in column 3 of the first row. Maybe the 3 is generated by some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the positions of the 2s in the input and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in the same column. For example, in the first example, column 3 of the input has 0 in row 0, 2 in row 1. That's not three 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of convolution. For example, the output is generated by taking the input and applying a kernel that looks for certain patterns. But this seems complicated.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output's structure. For example, in all three examples, the output has a vertical line of 2s in certain columns. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s in column 3 and 4 for rows 1-2, then column 3 for rows 3-4, then column 3 and 4 for row 5, and column 4 for rows 6-7. This seems like a vertical line that starts at column 3 and extends down the rows, with some variation.\n\nIn example 2's output, the first row has a 3 in column 3, then rows 1-3 have 2s in columns 3 and 4. Then rows 4-7 have 2 in column 4.\n\nIn example 3's output, the first row has a 3 in column 3, then rows 1-2 have 2s in columns 3 and 4, rows 3-4 have 2s in column 4 and 5, etc.\n\nThis suggests that the output is generated by some kind of vertical line pattern, where the 3 is in a position that indicates the start of a vertical line, and the 2s follow.\n\nSo maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of 2s in the input and creating vertical lines in the output. For example, the first example's input has 2s in the second row's columns 3 and 4. This could be the start of a vertical line in the output. The output then has a 3 in column 3 of the first row, and 2s in columns 3 and 4 of rows 1-2, then columns 3 of rows 3-4, etc.\n\nBut how to map this to the output's 8 rows. Maybe the output is generated by expanding the input's 2s into multiple rows. For example, each 2 in the input's second row generates a vertical line in the output's rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 2s and creating a grid where each row in the output corresponds to a certain vertical line in the input. For example, the first three rows of the output may correspond to the first row of the input, and the next five rows correspond to the second row of the input.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think about the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n2 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 2\n2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2\n\nSo the input is two rows, each with 12 elements. The output should be 8x7.\n\nLooking at the input, the first row has 2s at positions 0, 2, 5, 9, 11. The second row has 2s at positions 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.\n\nSo the output should be generated based on these positions. The output for the test input would be 8 rows of 7 elements each.\n\nAssuming that the pattern is similar to the training examples, the output might have a vertical line of 2s starting from column 3 or 2, with a 3 in the first row.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's 2s and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in the same column of the input, otherwise 2. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 2s and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in the same row of the input, otherwise 2. But in example 1's input, the first row has 2s at positions 0,4,6,8,11. That's five 2s, but the output has a 3 in the first row's column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 2s and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three consecutive 2s in the input's row or column. For example, in example 1's input, the second row has 2s at positions 0,1,3,4,6,7,9,11. So there are consecutive 2s at positions 0-1, 3-4, 6-7, etc. So the output's first row has a 3 in column 3, which is where the consecutive 2s start in the input's second row.\n\nBut how to map this to the output's rows.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows and creating a vertical line in the output. For example, each row in the output corresponds to a certain vertical line in the input. For example, the first three rows of the output correspond to the first row of the input, and the next five rows correspond to the second row of the input.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's rows and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in the same column in the input's rows. For example, in the first example, the second row has 2s in column 3, and the first row has 0 in column 3. So that's not three 2s.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output's structure. The output has 8 rows and 7 columns. The input has 3 rows and 12 columns. So perhaps the output is generated by some kind of transformation that involves the input's columns being mapped to the output's columns.\n\nFor example, the input has 12 columns, and the output has 7 columns. So maybe the input's columns are grouped into certain positions. For example, columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-11. But the output has 7 columns, so perhaps the columns are mapped in a way that each output column corresponds to a certain group of input columns.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output's columns may be derived from the input's columns. For example, the first output column is derived from the first input column, the second output column from the second input column, etc. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output's columns are derived from the input's columns in a certain way. For example, the first output column is the sum of certain input columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output's first row. In example 1, the first row has a 3 in column 3. In example 2, the first row also has a 3 in column 3. In example 3, the first row has a 3 in column 3. So this suggests that the 3 is in column 3 of the first row of the output. So perhaps the 3 is generated in column 3 of the first row of the output, and the rest of the rows are filled with 2s based on the input's second row.\n\nSo maybe the first row of the output is always 3 in column 3, and the rest of the rows are filled with 2s in certain columns based on the input's second row.\n\nBut how to determine the columns for the rest of the rows.\n\nIn example 1's output, the second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. In example 2's output, the second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. In example 3's output, the second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. So this suggests that the 2s are in columns 3 and 4 of the output's rows 1-2, then columns 3 for rows 3-4, and so on.\n\nSo maybe the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a vertical line in the output's rows. For example, the input's second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4, so the output has 2s in columns 3 and 4 for the first few rows.\n\nBut how to map this to the 8 rows.\n\nMaybe the output's rows are generated by taking the input's second row and expanding it into multiple rows. For example, each 2 in the input's second row generates a certain number of rows in the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows are generated by taking the input's second row and creating a vertical line of 2s in the output's columns.\n\nBut this is still not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each cell is 2 if there is a 2 in the input's second row, and 3 if there are three consecutive 2s in the input's second row.\n\nIn example 1's second row, the input has 2s at positions 0,1,3,4,6,8,10. So there are consecutive 2s at positions 0-1, 3-4, 6-8, etc. So the first row of the output has a 3 in column 3, which is where the consecutive 2s start at positions 3-4 in the input's second row.\n\nSo perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three consecutive 2s in the input's second row, and 2 otherwise.\n\nBut how to map that to the output's rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows are generated by taking the input's second row and creating a vertical line in the output. For example, the first row of the output has a 3 in column 3, and the next rows have 2s in columns 3 and 4, then 3 and 4, etc.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the key is to find a pattern that can be implemented in code.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1, the first row has a 3 in column 3. The second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The third row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The fourth row has 2 in column 3. The fifth row has 2 in column 3. The sixth row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The seventh and eighth rows have 2 in column 4.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where the columns 3 and 4 are filled with 2s for the first few rows, then some variation.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in certain columns based on the positions of the 2s in the input's second row.\n\nFor example, if the input's second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4, then the output has 2s in columns 3 and 4 for the first few rows.\n\nBut how to determine the number of rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row is filled with 2s in the columns where the input's second row has 2s. But this would not explain the 3 in the first row.\n\nAlternatively, the 3 is generated when there are three consecutive 2s in the input's second row. For example, in example 1's second row, there are consecutive 2s at positions 3-4, which is two 2s. But the output has a 3 in column 3 of the first row. This doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: let's think about the output's structure. The output has 8 rows. The input has 3 rows. Perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating 8 rows of output, where each row corresponds to a certain position in the input's second row.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output is filled with 2s in certain columns based on the positions of the 2s in the input's second row.\n\nFor example, in example 1's input, the second row has 2s in columns 0,1,3,4,6,8,10. So the output's first row has a 3 in column 3, and the rest of the rows have 2s in columns 3 and 4, 3 and 4, etc.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's second row and for each position in the input's second row, if there is a 2, then in the output's rows, certain positions are filled with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in the same columns as the input's second row, but with some variation.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to find a pattern that can be coded.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the first row has a 3 in column 3. The second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The third row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The fourth row has 2 in column 3. The fifth row has 2 in column 3. The sixth row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The seventh and eighth rows have 2 in column 4.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in certain columns, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nMaybe the 3 is generated when there are three 2s in the input's second row's columns 3-4. But that's two 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the 3 is generated when there are three 2s in the input's second row's columns 3, 4, and 5. But in example 1's second row, column 5 is 0.\n\nThis is not helpful.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each cell in the output is 3 if there are three 2s in the input's second row's columns, and 2 otherwise. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each cell in the output is 3 if there are three 2s in the input's second row's columns, and 2 otherwise. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in the input's second row's columns. But this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples.\n\nLet's look at the output for example 1. The first row has a 3 in column 3. The second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The third row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The fourth row has 2 in column 3. The fifth row has 2 in column 3. The sixth row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The seventh and eighth rows have 2 in column 4.\n\nThis suggests that the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output corresponds to a certain vertical line in the input's second row.\n\nFor example, the first row of the output has a 3 in column 3, which is where the input's second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. Then, the next rows have 2s in columns 3 and 4, then column 3, etc.\n\nThis suggests that the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in certain columns based on the positions of the 2s in the input's second row.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's second row and for each column in the input's second row, if there is a 2, then in the output's rows, certain positions are filled with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in the columns where the input's second row has 2s, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nBut how to determine the number of rows.\n\nMaybe the output has 8 rows, which is the number of rows in the input's second row plus some other value. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in the same columns as the input's second row, but with some variation. For example, the first row has a 3 in column 3, and the rest of the rows have 2s in columns 3 and 4, then 3 and 4, etc.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's second row and for each column in the input's second row, if there is a 2, then in the output's rows, certain positions are filled with 2s.\n\nFor example, in example 1's input, the second row has 2s in columns 0,1,3,4,6,8,10. So the output has 2s in columns 3 and 4 for the first few rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLet's assume that the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in certain columns, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nSo, for the test input, which has two rows, the second row is the one to consider. Let's look at the test input's second row: 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2.\n\nThe 2s are at positions 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11.\n\nSo the output should have a 3 in column 3 of the first row. Then, the next rows have 2s in columns 3 and 4, etc.\n\nBut how to map this to the output's 8 rows.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in the columns where the input's second row has 2s, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nSo, for the test input, the output would have:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nSo the code would need to take the input's second row, find the positions of the 2s, and then create a grid where each row has 2s in certain columns, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThe code would need to:\n\n1. Take the input grid.\n2. Assume that the second row is the one to process.\n3. For each column in the second row, if it's a 2, then in the output, certain rows have 2s in that column.\n4. The first row of the output has a 3 in column 3.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each cell in the output is 3 if there are three 2s in the input's second row's columns, and 2 otherwise. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in the columns where the input's second row has 2s, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nBut how to determine the number of rows.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with this hypothesis.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- Take the input grid.\n- Assume that the second row is the one to process.\n- For each column in the second row, if it is a 2, then in the output, certain rows have 2s in that column.\n- The first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to use.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in columns 3 and 4, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the examples, the output for example 1 has 3 in column 3 of the first row, and 2s in columns 3 and 4 for the next rows. So perhaps the code is:\n\nFor each row in the output:\n\n- If it's the first row, then set column 3 to 3, others to 0.\n- For other rows, set columns 3 and 4 to 2, others to 0.\n\nBut this would not explain the other rows in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in columns where the input's second row has 2s, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Assume that the second row is the one to process\n    second_row = grid[1]\n    output = [[0]*7 for _ in range(8)]\n    # For the first row, set column 3 to 3\n    output[0][3] = 3\n    # For other rows, set columns where second_row has 2s to 2\n    for row in range(1, 8):\n        for col in range(7):\n            if second_row[3 + col] == 2:\n                output[row][col] = 2\n    return output\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nWait, in example 1's second row, the columns with 2s are at positions 0,1,3,4,6,8,10. But the output's columns are 0-6. So this code would not work.\n\nAlternatively, the code is taking the input's second row and mapping it to the output's columns. For example, the input's second row has 12 columns, and the output has 7 columns. So perhaps the output's columns are derived from certain positions in the input's second row.\n\nFor example, in example 1's second row, the columns with 2s are 0,1,3,4,6,8,10. The output has 7 columns. Maybe the output's columns are derived from the input's second row's columns 3,4,6,8,10, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in columns 3 and 4, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*7 for _ in range(8)]\n    # First row\n    output[0][3] = 3\n    # Other rows\n    for row in range(1, 8):\n        output[row][3] = 2\n        output[row][4] = 2\n    return output\n\nBut this would not handle the examples correctly. For example, in example 1's output, the fourth row has 2 in column 3, but the fifth row has 2 in column 3. But according to this code, all rows from 1 to 7 would have 2 in columns 3 and 4. This doesn't match the examples.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in certain columns, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nIn example 1's second row, the 2s are in columns 0,1,3,4,6,8,10. The output's columns are 0-6. So perhaps the output's columns 3 and 4 are derived from the input's second row's columns 3 and 4.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*7 for _ in range(8)]\n    # First row\n    output[0][3] = 3\n    # For other rows, set columns 3 and 4 to 2\n    for row in range(1, 8):\n        output[row][3] = 2\n        output[row][4] = 2\n    return output\n\nBut this would not explain the other rows in the examples. For example, in example 1's output, rows 3 and 4 have 2 in column 3, but rows 5 has 2 in columns 3 and 4, and rows 6-7 have 2 in column 4.\n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with this hypothesis, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's output, the rows 1-2 have 2 in columns 3 and 4, rows 3-4 have 2 in column 3, row 5 has 2 in columns 3 and 4, and rows 6-7 have 2 in column 4. So this suggests that the output is generated by a pattern that starts with 2 in columns 3 and 4, then 3 and 4, then 3, then 3, then 3 and 4, then 4 and 4.\n\nThis is too complex to code without more information.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in the columns where the input's second row has 2s, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- For each row in the output, set the columns to 2 if the input's second row has 2 in that column.\n\nBut how to map the input's columns to the output's columns.\n\nFor example, the input's second row has 12 columns. The output has 7 columns. So perhaps the output's columns are derived from the input's columns 3-9, or some other range.\n\nIn example 1's second row, columns 3-9 are 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2. So the output's columns 3-9 would be 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2. But the output's columns are 0-6. So perhaps the output's columns 3-9 are mapped to 0-6.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with the code that generates the first row with 3 in column 3, and the rest of the rows with 2 in columns 3 and 4. This is a guess based on the examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*7 for _ in range(8)]\n    output[0][3] = 3\n    for row in range(1, 8):\n        output[row][3] = 2\n        output[row][4] = 2\n    return output\n\nBut this would not handle the other rows in the examples. For example, in example 1's output, rows 3 and 4 have 2 in column 3, but the code would set columns 3 and 4 to 2 for all rows.\n\nBut given the time, this is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let's start by analyzing the first example.\n\nExample 1:\nInput is a 3x4 grid (since each line has 12 numbers, which is 3 rows of 4 elements each?), wait wait, no. Wait, the input for example 1 is given as 12 numbers per line. Wait, the input is 3 rows, each with 12 elements? Wait, no. Wait, the input for example 1 is:\n\nInput lines:\n2 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 2\n2 2 0 2 2 0 2 0 2 2 0 2\nSo each line is 12 numbers. But the output is 8x7. Wait, the output is 8 rows and 7 columns. So the input is 3 rows, 12 columns? Wait, maybe the input is 3 rows, each with 12 elements. But the output is 8x7. So how does that transformation work?\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is a grid, and the output is an 8x7 grid. So the input for the training examples must be of a certain size. Let me check the examples again.\n\nLooking at example 1's input: each line has 12 numbers. So the input grid is 3 rows by 12 columns. The output is 8 rows by 7 columns. So how does that transformation happen?\n\nHmm. Let me think about the output. For example 1's output, each row is 7 elements. So the output is 8 rows, each with 7 elements. The input is 3 rows, 12 columns. So the transformation is from 3x12 to 8x7. That seems like a non-trivial transformation.\n\nBut how? Maybe there's some pattern based on the positions of the numbers. Let me look at the first example's input and output.\n\nLooking at example 1's input:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 2\nRow 1: 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 0 2 2 0 2\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nLooking at the output, there's a 3 in the fourth position of the first output row. Maybe that's related to the input. Let's see where the 2s are in the input. For example, in the first input row, there are 2s at positions 0, 4, 6, 8, 11. Maybe the output is generated based on some kind of pattern where certain positions in the input are mapped to certain positions in the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of transformation that involves the positions of the numbers. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cells in certain positions.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is generated by taking some kind of pattern that's derived from the input. For example, in example 1, the output has 3s and 2s. Let's see:\n\nIn the output, the first row has a 3 in the fourth column. Let's check the input. In the first input row, the fourth column (index 3) is 0. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the 3 is a result of some calculation based on neighboring cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking for certain patterns in the input. For example, in the first example, the input has a lot of 2s. The output has 3s and 2s. Maybe the 3s are where there are certain configurations of 2s. For example, maybe the 3 is in a position where there are three 2s in a row or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of convolution or kernel. But that's probably too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking for the positions of the 2s in the input and then mapping them to certain positions in the output. For example, in the first example, the output has a 3 in the fourth column of the first row. Maybe that's where there's a cluster of 2s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where the input is processed to create a grid that has certain patterns. For example, the output seems to have vertical lines of 2s and 3s. Let's look at the output of example 1. The first row has a 3 in the fourth column. Then, rows 1-2 have 2s in columns 3 and 4. Rows 3-4 have 2s in column 3. Rows 5 has 2s in columns 3 and 4. Rows 6-7 have 2 in column 4.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is generated by some kind of vertical lines. Let's think about the input. For example, in the first input row, the 2s are at positions 0,4,6,8,11. Maybe the output is generated by taking some kind of vertical lines based on the positions of the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions where the input has 2s and then creating a pattern based on that. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in a certain area, and 2 otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of transformation where the input is processed to create a grid where the 2s are replaced by certain values based on their positions.\n\nLooking at example 2's input:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 2\n2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 0 2\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nIn this case, the first row of output has a 3 in column 3. The second and third rows have 2s in columns 3 and 4. The fourth row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. Then rows 5-7 have 2 in column 4.\n\nSo similar to example 1. Maybe the 3 is in a position where there are three 2s in the input. Let's check the input for example 2. The first row of input is 0,2,0,2,0,0,2,0,0,2,0,2. So the 2s are at positions 1,3,6,9,11. The second row is 2,2,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,2,0,2. So 2s at 0,1,3,4,6,7,9,11.\n\nIn the output, the first row's 3 is in column 3. Let's see if that's where there's a cluster of 2s. For example, in the first input row, the 2s are at positions 1,3,6,9,11. In the second input row, positions 0,1,3,4,6,7,9,11. So in the input, there's a cluster of 2s in the second row's columns 3-4. Maybe that's why the output has a 3 in the first row's column 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking for certain patterns in the input. For example, in example 1, the output's first row has a 3 in column 3. Maybe that's because in the input, there are three 2s in a certain area. Let me check the input for example 1's first row. The first row of input is 2 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 2. So the positions of 2s are 0,4,6,8,11. In the second row, 2s are at 0,1,3,4,6,8,10. So in the second row, there are 2s at positions 3,4,6, etc. Maybe the 3 in the output is where there are three 2s in a row in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of convolution where the input is processed to create a grid where each cell is determined by the number of 2s in a certain window. For example, if there are three 2s in a certain area, then it becomes 3, otherwise 2. But how to map that to the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of the 2s in the input and then creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in a certain pattern, and 2 otherwise.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 3.\n\nInput for example 3:\n2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 2\n2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 0 2\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nIn this case, the output has a 3 in the first row's column 3. Then, the next rows have 2s in columns 3-4, then 3-4, then 4-5, etc. So it seems like the 3 is in a position where there are three 2s in the input. Let me check the input for example 3.\n\nFirst row of input: 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 2. So 2s at positions 0,3,6,9,11.\n\nSecond row: 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 0 2. So 2s at positions 0,1,3,4,6,7,9,11.\n\nSo in the first row of input, there's a 2 at position 3, and in the second row, positions 3 and 4. So maybe the 3 in the output is where there are three 2s in the input. For example, in the first row of input, there are two 2s in the first row, but in the second row, there are two 2s in positions 3 and 4. So maybe the 3 is generated when there's a cluster of three 2s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the input's 2s and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in a certain pattern, otherwise 2. But how to map that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of the 2s in the input and then creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in a certain vertical or horizontal line. For example, in the first example, the first row of output has a 3 in column 3. Let's see if that's where there are three 2s in the input's columns.\n\nLooking at column 3 of the input:\n\nIn example 1's input, column 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 (from the first row's 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 2? Wait, the first row is 2 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 2. So the columns are 0-11. Let me reindex:\n\nRow 0: positions 0-11: [2, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2]\n\nSo column 3 is 0 (index 3). Column 4 is 2 (index 4). Column 6 is 2 (index 6). Column 8 is 2 (index 8). Column 11 is 2 (index 11). \n\nIn row 1: [2,2,0,2,2,0,2,0,2,2,0,2]. So column 3 is 2, column 4 is 2, column 6 is 2, column 8 is 2, column 10 is 2, etc.\n\nSo for column 3, in the input, there are 2s in row 1, column 3. So maybe the 3 in the output is in column 3 of row 0, which is where there's a 2 in row 1, column 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the positions of 2s in the input and then creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in the same column or row, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell in the output is determined by the number of 2s in a certain area. For example, if there are three 2s in a certain area, the output cell is 3, otherwise 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of 2s in the input and then creating a grid that represents the vertical lines. For example, in the first example, the output's first row has a 3 in column 3. Then, rows 1-2 have 2s in columns 3 and 4. Maybe that's because there are two 2s in the input's columns 3 and 4 of the second row.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid where each row corresponds to a certain vertical line in the input. For example, the output has 8 rows, which may correspond to the 8 rows of the output. But how to map the input's 3 rows to 8 rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid that is 8 rows tall and 7 columns wide, where each cell is determined by the number of 2s in a certain vertical strip of the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's 2s and creating a grid where each cell in the output is 3 if there are three 2s in the same column of the input, otherwise 2. But that seems not to fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking for certain patterns in the input. For example, the output's 3 is in the first row's column 3, which is where the input's second row has two consecutive 2s (columns 3 and 4). Maybe that's where the 3 comes from.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that involves the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, if a cell in the input has a 2, then in the output, certain positions are filled with 2s or 3s based on their positions.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1. The output has 8 rows. The input has 3 rows. How to map 3 rows to 8 rows. Maybe the output is generated by some kind of expansion of the input's 2s into multiple rows.\n\nFor example, the first example's output has 8 rows. Maybe each row in the output corresponds to a certain vertical line in the input. For example, the first three rows of the output may correspond to the first row of the input, and the next rows correspond to the second row of the input. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is determined by the number of times a certain pattern appears in the input. For example, in the first example, the first row of the output has a 3. That might be because in the input's second row, there are two 2s in columns 3 and 4, which is a horizontal line. So the output's first row has a 3 in that position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 2s and creating a grid that represents the vertical lines. For example, in example 1's input, the second row has 2s in columns 0,1,3,4,6,8,10. So maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of the 2s in the input and creating vertical lines in the output.\n\nBut how to map this to the output's 8 rows and 7 columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the positions of the 2s in the input and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in a certain vertical or horizontal line. For example, in the first example's input, the second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. So the output's first row has a 3 in column 3. Then, rows 1-2 have 2s in columns 3 and 4. Rows 3-4 have 2s in column 3. Rows 5 has 2s in columns 3 and 4. Rows 6-7 have 2 in column 4.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the output is generated by some kind of vertical line pattern. For example, the output's first row has a 3 in column 3, which might correspond to the second row of the input having two 2s in columns 3 and 4. Then, the output rows 1-2 have 2s in columns 3 and 4, which might correspond to the same two columns in the input's second row.\n\nBut how to generate this for the output's 8 rows. Maybe the output is generated by expanding the input's 2s into a grid of 8 rows, where each row corresponds to a certain vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that involves the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the output's first row has a 3 in column 3, which is the position where there are three 2s in the input's second row. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in a certain vertical strip of the input. For example, in the first example, the second row of the input has 2s in columns 3 and 4, but maybe that's not enough for a 3. However, the output has a 3 in the first row's column 3. Maybe the 3 is generated by some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 2s and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in a certain vertical or horizontal line. For example, if there are three 2s in a vertical line in the input, then the output has a 3 in that position. But how to map that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the input's 2s and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in a certain vertical or horizontal line. For example, in the first example, the second row of the input has two 2s in columns 3 and 4. But that's not three. However, the output has a 3 in column 3 of the first row. Maybe the 3 is generated by some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the positions of the 2s in the input and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in the same column. For example, in the first example, column 3 of the input has 0 in row 0, 2 in row 1. That's not three 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of convolution. For example, the output is generated by taking the input and applying a kernel that looks for certain patterns. But this seems complicated.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output's structure. For example, in all three examples, the output has a vertical line of 2s in certain columns. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s in column 3 and 4 for rows 1-2, then column 3 for rows 3-4, then column 3 and 4 for row 5, and column 4 for rows 6-7. This seems like a vertical line that starts at column 3 and extends down the rows, with some variation.\n\nIn example 2's output, the first row has a 3 in column 3, then rows 1-3 have 2s in columns 3 and 4. Then rows 4-7 have 2 in column 4.\n\nIn example 3's output, the first row has a 3 in column 3, then rows 1-2 have 2s in columns 3 and 4, rows 3-4 have 2s in column 4 and 5, etc.\n\nThis suggests that the output is generated by some kind of vertical line pattern, where the 3 is in a position that indicates the start of a vertical line, and the 2s follow.\n\nSo maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of 2s in the input and creating vertical lines in the output. For example, the first example's input has 2s in the second row's columns 3 and 4. This could be the start of a vertical line in the output. The output then has a 3 in column 3 of the first row, and 2s in columns 3 and 4 of rows 1-2, then columns 3 of rows 3-4, etc.\n\nBut how to map this to the output's 8 rows. Maybe the output is generated by expanding the input's 2s into multiple rows. For example, each 2 in the input's second row generates a vertical line in the output's rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 2s and creating a grid where each row in the output corresponds to a certain vertical line in the input. For example, the first three rows of the output may correspond to the first row of the input, and the next five rows correspond to the second row of the input.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's think about the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n2 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 2\n2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2\n\nSo the input is two rows, each with 12 elements. The output should be 8x7.\n\nLooking at the input, the first row has 2s at positions 0, 2, 5, 9, 11. The second row has 2s at positions 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11.\n\nSo the output should be generated based on these positions. The output for the test input would be 8 rows of 7 elements each.\n\nAssuming that the pattern is similar to the training examples, the output might have a vertical line of 2s starting from column 3 or 2, with a 3 in the first row.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's 2s and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in the same column of the input, otherwise 2. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 2s and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in the same row of the input, otherwise 2. But in example 1's input, the first row has 2s at positions 0,4,6,8,11. That's five 2s, but the output has a 3 in the first row's column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 2s and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three consecutive 2s in the input's row or column. For example, in example 1's input, the second row has 2s at positions 0,1,3,4,6,7,9,11. So there are consecutive 2s at positions 0-1, 3-4, 6-7, etc. So the output's first row has a 3 in column 3, which is where the consecutive 2s start in the input's second row.\n\nBut how to map this to the output's rows.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's rows and creating a vertical line in the output. For example, each row in the output corresponds to a certain vertical line in the input. For example, the first three rows of the output correspond to the first row of the input, and the next five rows correspond to the second row of the input.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's rows and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three 2s in the same column in the input's rows. For example, in the first example, the second row has 2s in column 3, and the first row has 0 in column 3. So that's not three 2s.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output's structure. The output has 8 rows and 7 columns. The input has 3 rows and 12 columns. So perhaps the output is generated by some kind of transformation that involves the input's columns being mapped to the output's columns.\n\nFor example, the input has 12 columns, and the output has 7 columns. So maybe the input's columns are grouped into certain positions. For example, columns 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-11. But the output has 7 columns, so perhaps the columns are mapped in a way that each output column corresponds to a certain group of input columns.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output's columns may be derived from the input's columns. For example, the first output column is derived from the first input column, the second output column from the second input column, etc. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output's columns are derived from the input's columns in a certain way. For example, the first output column is the sum of certain input columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output's first row. In example 1, the first row has a 3 in column 3. In example 2, the first row also has a 3 in column 3. In example 3, the first row has a 3 in column 3. So this suggests that the 3 is in column 3 of the first row of the output. So perhaps the 3 is generated in column 3 of the first row of the output, and the rest of the rows are filled with 2s based on the input's second row.\n\nSo maybe the first row of the output is always 3 in column 3, and the rest of the rows are filled with 2s in certain columns based on the input's second row.\n\nBut how to determine the columns for the rest of the rows.\n\nIn example 1's output, the second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. In example 2's output, the second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. In example 3's output, the second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. So this suggests that the 2s are in columns 3 and 4 of the output's rows 1-2, then columns 3 for rows 3-4, and so on.\n\nSo maybe the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a vertical line in the output's rows. For example, the input's second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4, so the output has 2s in columns 3 and 4 for the first few rows.\n\nBut how to map this to the 8 rows.\n\nMaybe the output's rows are generated by taking the input's second row and expanding it into multiple rows. For example, each 2 in the input's second row generates a certain number of rows in the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows are generated by taking the input's second row and creating a vertical line of 2s in the output's columns.\n\nBut this is still not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each cell is 2 if there is a 2 in the input's second row, and 3 if there are three consecutive 2s in the input's second row.\n\nIn example 1's second row, the input has 2s at positions 0,1,3,4,6,8,10. So there are consecutive 2s at positions 0-1, 3-4, 6-8, etc. So the first row of the output has a 3 in column 3, which is where the consecutive 2s start at positions 3-4 in the input's second row.\n\nSo perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each cell is 3 if there are three consecutive 2s in the input's second row, and 2 otherwise.\n\nBut how to map that to the output's rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output's rows are generated by taking the input's second row and creating a vertical line in the output. For example, the first row of the output has a 3 in column 3, and the next rows have 2s in columns 3 and 4, then 3 and 4, etc.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the key is to find a pattern that can be implemented in code.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1, the first row has a 3 in column 3. The second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The third row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The fourth row has 2 in column 3. The fifth row has 2 in column 3. The sixth row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The seventh and eighth rows have 2 in column 4.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where the columns 3 and 4 are filled with 2s for the first few rows, then some variation.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in certain columns based on the positions of the 2s in the input's second row.\n\nFor example, if the input's second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4, then the output has 2s in columns 3 and 4 for the first few rows.\n\nBut how to determine the number of rows.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row is filled with 2s in the columns where the input's second row has 2s. But this would not explain the 3 in the first row.\n\nAlternatively, the 3 is generated when there are three consecutive 2s in the input's second row. For example, in example 1's second row, there are consecutive 2s at positions 3-4, which is two 2s. But the output has a 3 in column 3 of the first row. This doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: let's think about the output's structure. The output has 8 rows. The input has 3 rows. Perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating 8 rows of output, where each row corresponds to a certain position in the input's second row.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output is filled with 2s in certain columns based on the positions of the 2s in the input's second row.\n\nFor example, in example 1's input, the second row has 2s in columns 0,1,3,4,6,8,10. So the output's first row has a 3 in column 3, and the rest of the rows have 2s in columns 3 and 4, 3 and 4, etc.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's second row and for each position in the input's second row, if there is a 2, then in the output's rows, certain positions are filled with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in the same columns as the input's second row, but with some variation.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to find a pattern that can be coded.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the first row has a 3 in column 3. The second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The third row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The fourth row has 2 in column 3. The fifth row has 2 in column 3. The sixth row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The seventh and eighth rows have 2 in column 4.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in certain columns, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nMaybe the 3 is generated when there are three 2s in the input's second row's columns 3-4. But that's two 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the 3 is generated when there are three 2s in the input's second row's columns 3, 4, and 5. But in example 1's second row, column 5 is 0.\n\nThis is not helpful.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each cell in the output is 3 if there are three 2s in the input's second row's columns, and 2 otherwise. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each cell in the output is 3 if there are three 2s in the input's second row's columns, and 2 otherwise.

The second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The third row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The fourth row has 2 in column 3. The fifth row has 2 in column 3. The sixth row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. The seventh and eighth rows have 2 in column 4.\n\nThis suggests that the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output corresponds to a certain vertical line in the input's second row.\n\nFor example, the first row of the output has a 3 in column 3, which is where the input's second row has 2s in columns 3 and 4. Then, the next rows have 2s in columns 3 and 4, then column 3, etc.\n\nThis suggests that the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in certain columns based on the positions of the 2s in the input's second row.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's second row and for each column in the input's second row, if there is a 2, then in the output's rows, certain positions are filled with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in the columns where the input's second row has 2s, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nBut how to determine the number of rows.\n\nMaybe the output has 8 rows, which is the number of rows in the input's second row plus some other value. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in the same columns as the input's second row, but with some variation. For example, the first row has a 3 in column 3, and the rest of the rows have 2s in columns 3 and 4, then 3 and 4, etc.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's second row and for each column in the input's second row, if there is a 2, then in the output's rows, certain positions are filled with 2s.\n\nFor example, in example 1's input, the second row has 2s in columns 0,1,3,4,6,8,10. So the output has 2s in columns 3 and 4 for the first few rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLet's assume that the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in certain columns, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nSo, for the test input, which has two rows, the second row is the one to consider. Let's look at the test input's second row: 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2.\n\nThe 2s are at positions 0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11.\n\nSo the output should have a 3 in column 3 of the first row. Then, the next rows have 2s in columns 3 and 4, etc.\n\nBut how to map this to the output's 8 rows.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in the columns where the input's second row has 2s, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nSo, for the test input, the output would have:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nSo the code would need to take the input's second row, find the positions of the 2s, and then create a grid where each row has 2s in certain columns, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThe code would need to:\n\n1. Take the input grid.\n2. Assume that the second row is the one to process.\n3. For each column in the second row, if it's a 2, then in the output, certain rows have 2s in that column.\n4. The first row of the output has a 3 in column 3.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each cell in the output is 3 if there are three 2s in the input's second row's columns, and 2 otherwise. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in the columns where the input's second row has 2s, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nBut how to determine the number of rows.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with this hypothesis.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- Take the input grid.\n- Assume that the second row is the one to process.\n- For each column in the second row, if it is a 2, then in the output, certain rows have 2s in that column.\n- The first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to use.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in columns 3 and 4, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the examples, the output for example 1 has 3 in column 3 of the first row, and 2s in columns 3 and 4 for the next rows. So perhaps the code is:\n\nFor each row in the output:\n\n- If it's the first row, then set column 3 to 3, others to 0.\n- For other rows, set columns 3 and 4 to 2, others to 0.\n\nBut this would not explain the other rows in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in columns where the input's second row has 2s, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Assume that the second row is the one to process\n    second_row = grid[1]\n    output = [[0]*7 for _ in range(8)]\n    # For the first row, set column 3 to 3\n    output[0][3] = 3\n    # For other rows, set columns where second_row has 2s to 2\n    for row in range(1, 8):\n        for col in range(7):\n            if second_row[3 + col] == 2:\n                output[row][col] = 2\n    return output\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nWait, in example 1's second row, the columns with 2s are at positions 0,1,3,4,6,8,10. But the output's columns are 0-6. So this code would not work.\n\nAlternatively, the code is taking the input's second row and mapping it to the output's columns. For example, the input's second row has 12 columns, and the output has 7 columns. So perhaps the output's columns are derived from certain positions in the input's second row.\n\nFor example, in example 1's second row, the columns with 2s are 0,1,3,4,6,8,10. The output has 7 columns. Maybe the output's columns are derived from the input's second row's columns 3,4,6,8,10, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in columns 3 and 4, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*7 for _ in range(8)]\n    # First row\n    output[0][3] = 3\n    # Other rows\n    for row in range(1, 8):\n        output[row][3] = 2\n        output[row][4] = 2\n    return output\n\nBut this would not handle the examples correctly. For example, in example 1's output, the fourth row has 2 in column 3, but the fifth row has 2 in column 3. But according to this code, all rows from 1 to 7 would have 2 in columns 3 and 4. This doesn't match the examples.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in certain columns, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nIn example 1's second row, the 2s are in columns 0,1,3,4,6,8,10. The output's columns are 0-6. So perhaps the output's columns 3 and 4 are derived from the input's second row's columns 3 and 4.\n\nSo, the code could be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*7 for _ in range(8)]\n    # First row\n    output[0][3] = 3\n    # For other rows, set columns 3 and 4 to 2\n    for row in range(1, 8):\n        output[row][3] = 2\n        output[row][4] = 2\n    return output\n\nBut this would not explain the other rows in the examples. For example, in example 1's output, rows 3 and 4 have 2 in column 3, but rows 5 has 2 in columns 3 and 4, and rows 6-7 have 2 in column 4.\n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with this hypothesis, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's output, the rows 1-2 have 2 in columns 3 and 4, rows 3-4 have 2 in column 3, row 5 has 2 in columns 3 and 4, and rows 6-7 have 2 in column 4. So this suggests that the output is generated by a pattern that starts with 2 in columns 3 and 4, then 3 and 4, then 3, then 3, then 3 and 4, then 4 and 4.\n\nThis is too complex to code without more information.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's second row and creating a grid where each row in the output has 2s in the columns where the input's second row has 2s, and the first row has a 3 in column 3.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- For each row in the output, set the columns to 2 if the input's second row has 2 in that column.\n\nBut how to map the input's columns to the output's columns.\n\nFor example, the input's second row has 12 columns. The output has 7 columns. So perhaps the output's columns are derived from the input's columns 3-9, or some other range.\n\nIn example 1's second row, columns 3-9 are 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2. So the output's columns 3-9 would be 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 0, 2. But the output's columns are 0-6. So perhaps the output's columns 3-9 are mapped to 0-6.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with the code that generates the first row with 3 in column 3, and the rest of the rows with 2 in columns 3 and 4. This is a guess based on the examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*7 for _ in range(8)]\n    output[0][3] = 3\n    for row in range(1, 8):\n        output[row][3] = 2\n        output[row][4] = 2\n    return output\n\nBut this would not handle the other rows in the examples. For example, in example 1's output, rows 3 and 4 have 2 in column 3, but the code would set columns 3 and 4 to 2 for all rows.\n\nBut given the time, this is the best I can do.\n"
