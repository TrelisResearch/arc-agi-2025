          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that:\n1. The numbers in the output grids seem to be related to the numbers in the input grids\n2. There appears to be some kind of propagation or transformation of numbers from one cell to others\n3. In Example 1, the number 1 in the input becomes 1 in the output, but the number 3 appears in the output where there was no 3 in the input\n4. In Example 2, the number 1 in the input becomes 1 in the output, but numbers like 2, 6, and 4 appear in the output where there were no such numbers in the input\n5. In Example 3, the number 1 in the input becomes 1 in the output, but numbers like 8, 6, 4, and 2 appear in the output where there were no such numbers in the input\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves propagating values from one cell to others in a way that creates a kind of \"spread\" or \"influence\" pattern.\n\nHere's my best attempt at implementing this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is not zero, propagate its value to neighboring cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Check all 8 neighboring cells\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 10 and 0 <= nj < 10:\n                            # If the neighboring cell is zero, set it to the current cell's value\n                            if transformed_grid[ni][nj] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is not zero, propagate its value to neighboring cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Check all 8 neighboring cells\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 10 and 0 <= nj < 10:\n                            # If the neighboring cell is zero, set it to the current cell's value\n                            if transformed_grid[ni][nj] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 1, the number 1 in the input becomes 1 in the output, but the number 3 appears in the output where there was no 3 in the input\n4. In Example 2, the number 1 in the input becomes 1 in the output, but numbers like 2, 6, and 4 appear in the output where there were no such numbers in the input\n5. In Example 3, the number 1 in the input becomes 1 in the output, but numbers like 8, 6, 4, and 2 appear in the output where there were no such numbers in the input\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves propagating values from one cell to others in a way that creates a kind of \"spread\" or \"influence\" pattern.\n\nHere's my best attempt at implementing this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is not zero, propagate its value to neighboring cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Check all 8 neighboring cells\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 10 and 0 <= nj < 10:\n                            # If the neighboring cell is zero, set it to the current cell's value\n                            if transformed_grid[ni][nj] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is not zero, propagate its value to neighboring cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Check all 8 neighboring cells\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 10 and 0 <= nj < 10:\n                            # If the neighboring cell is zero, set it to the current cell's value\n                            if transformed_grid[ni][nj] == 0:\n                                transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
