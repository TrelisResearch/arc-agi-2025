    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are two training examples given, and I need to find out what transformation is happening between the input and output grids. Let's look at Example 1 first.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 10x4 grid. The output seems to be a reversed version of the input. Wait, looking at the input and output:\n\nThe input's last row is [2 4 3 9], and the output's first row is [2 4 3 9]. Then the next row of the output is [2 0 3 9], which was the row above in the input. Wait, the input's 9th row (if counting from 0, maybe?) is [2 0 3 9], and the output's second row is that. So maybe the output is the input grid reversed vertically? Let me check.\n\nOriginal input rows (assuming 10 rows):\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0\n...\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nThe output for Example 1 starts with [2 4 3 9], which is the input's row 9. Then [2 0 3 9] (row 8), then [0 0 3 9] (row 7?), then [0 0 3 9] (row 6?), then [0 0 0 9] (row 5?), then the next rows are the same as the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9? Wait, the output has 10 rows. Let me check the output:\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9 (input row 9)\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9 (input row 8)\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9 (input row 7)\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9 (input row 6)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 (input row 5)\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9 (input row 5 again?)\nWait, maybe the output is the input reversed. Like, the first row of output is the last row of input, second row is the second last, etc. Let's check:\n\nInput has 10 rows. Output's first row is input row 9. Second row is input row 8. Third row input row 7. Fourth row input row 6. Fifth row input row 5. Then the sixth row of output is input row 4? Let me check the output's sixth row. The output's fifth row (index 5) is 0 0 0 9, which was input row 5. Then the sixth row of output is 0 0 3 9, which is input row 6? Wait, maybe the output is the input reversed. So for example, the output is the input grid reversed vertically. So for each row in the output, it's the input's row in reverse order.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output, the first five rows are the input's rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then the next five rows are input's rows 4,3,2,1,0? Let me check:\n\nOriginal input rows 5-9:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nOutput's first 5 rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9 (row9)\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9 (row8)\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9 (row7)\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9 (row6)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 (row5)\n\nThen the output's next rows (rows 5-9) are:\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 9 (row5 again?), then row6: 0 0 3 9 (row6?), etc. Wait, no. Let me check the output given for example 1:\n\nThe output is:\n\n2 4 3 9\n2 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n2 0 3 9\n2 4 3 9\n\nSo rows 5-9 of output are:\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 9 (same as input row5)\nRow6: 0 0 3 9 (input row6)\nRow7: 0 0 3 9 (input row7)\nRow8: 2 0 3 9 (input row8)\nRow9: 2 4 3 9 (input row9)\n\nSo the output is the input reversed. Because the first five rows are the input's rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then the next five rows are input's rows 5,6,7,8,9? Wait, no. Because row5 of output is input row5, row6 is input row6, etc. So the output is the input reversed. Because the entire grid is reversed. So the output is the input grid reversed vertically. So for example, the first row of output is the last row of input, second row is second last, etc. So for a 10-row grid, output[i] = input[9 - i].\n\nLet me check Example 2. Input for example 2 is:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 0 2\nRow6: 0 0 0 2\nRow7: 0 8 0 2\nRow8: 0 3 8 2\nRow9: 3 3 8 2\n\nOutput for example 2 is:\n\n3 3 8 2\n0 3 8 2\n0 8 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n0 8 0 2\n0 3 8 2\n3 3 8 2\n\nSo the output's first row is input row9, second row input row8, third input row7, fourth input row6, fifth input row5, then sixth row is input row5 again? Let me check:\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: 3 3 8 2 (input row9)\nRow1: 0 3 8 2 (input row8)\nRow2: 0 8 0 2 (input row7)\nRow3: 0 0 0 2 (input row6)\nRow4: 0 0 0 2 (input row5)\nRow5: 0 0 0 2 (input row5 again?)\nRow6: 0 0 0 2 (input row5?)\nRow7: 0 8 0 2 (input row7?)\nRow8: 0 3 8 2 (input row8)\nRow9: 3 3 8 2 (input row9)\n\nHmm, this seems like the output is the input reversed. For example, the first five rows are input rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then the next five rows are input rows 5,6,7,8,9. So the entire grid is reversed. So the output is the input grid reversed vertically. So for each row in the output, it's the input's row in reverse order.\n\nSo for example, in Example 1, the output is the input reversed. So the transformation is to reverse the rows of the input grid. So the first row of the output is the last row of the input, the second row is the second last, etc.\n\nBut let's check the test input. The test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n7 1 0 0\n7 1 3 0\n7 1 3 3\n7 1 4 4\n\nIf the transformation is to reverse the rows, then the output would be:\n\nOriginal rows 0-9:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 0\nRow5: 0 1 0 0\nRow6: 7 1 0 0\nRow7: 7 1 3 0\nRow8: 7 1 3 3\nRow9: 7 1 4 4\n\nReversed, the output would be:\n\nRow0: 7 1 4 4 (original row9)\nRow1: 7 1 3 3 (row8)\nRow2: 7 1 3 0 (row7)\nRow3: 7 1 0 0 (row6)\nRow4: 0 1 0 0 (row5)\nRow5: 0 0 0 0 (row4)\nRow6: 0 0 0 0 (row3)\nRow7: 0 0 0 0 (row2)\nRow8: 0 0 0 0 (row1)\nRow9: 0 0 0 0 (row0)\n\nBut the test input's output isn't provided, but according to the problem statement, the function must return a 10x4 grid. So according to this pattern, the code would reverse the input grid's rows.\n\nSo the transformation is to reverse the rows of the input grid. So the function would take the input grid, reverse the order of the rows, and return that as the output.\n\nLet me check Example 2's output again. The input's row5 is [0 0 0 2], and in the output, row4 is [0 0 0 2], which would be the original row5. So in the output, the first five rows are the original rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then the next five rows are original rows 5,6,7,8,9. So the entire grid is reversed. So for a 10-row grid, the output is input[::-1], i.e., reversed.\n\nSo the code would be as simple as returning the reversed grid.\n\nSo the Python function would take the grid, reverse the rows, and return that.\n\nBut let me make sure. For example 1, the output is the reversed input. So for the input grid, the output is [row9, row8, row7, row6, row5, row4, row3, row2, row1, row0]? Wait, no. Because in example 1's output, the first five rows are row9, row8, row7, row6, row5. Then the next five rows are row5, row6, row7, row8, row9? No, looking at example 1's output:\n\nThe output has 10 rows. The first five rows are the input's rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then the next five rows are input's rows 5,6,7,8,9? Let me check:\n\nOriginal input rows 5-9:\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 9\nRow6: 0 0 3 9\nRow7: 0 0 3 9\nRow8: 2 0 3 9\nRow9: 2 4 3 9\n\nOutput rows 0-4: row9, row8, row7, row6, row5.\n\nOutput rows 5-9: row5, row6, row7, row8, row9.\n\nSo the entire output is the input reversed. Because the output is the input rows in reverse order. So for example, the output is the input grid reversed. So for a 10-row grid, the output is input[::-1].\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    return [row for row in reversed(grid)]\n\nBut wait, the input is a list of lists. So reversed(grid) would reverse the order of the rows. So for example, if the input is a list of 10 rows, reversed would give the rows in reverse order.\n\nBut let me check for example 2. The input's row5 is [0 0 0 2], row6 [0 0 0 2], row7 [0 8 0 2], row8 [0 3 8 2], row9 [3 3 8 2]. The output's first row is row9, then row8, then row7, then row6, then row5. Then the next rows are row5, row6, row7, row8, row9. So the output is the input reversed. So yes, the code would work.\n\nSo the transformation is simply reversing the rows of the input grid.\n\nTherefore, the Python function would be to reverse the rows of the input grid.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    return list(reversed(grid))\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the output must be a 10x4 grid. The input is 10x4, so reversed would also be 10x4. So that's correct.\n\nBut let me check for example 1. The input is 10 rows. The output is 10 rows. So yes.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach. Let me check if there's any other pattern. For example, maybe there's some other transformation, but given the examples, this seems to fit.\n\nSo the code would be as simple as returning the reversed grid.\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the output's row 5 is 0 0 0 9, which is the same as input's row5. So when reversed, the output's row 5 would be input's row 4. Wait, no. Let me think. For a 10-row grid, the reversed grid would have row 0 as input row9, row1 as input row8, ..., row9 as input row0.\n\nBut in example 1's output, the fifth row (index 5) is 0 0 0 9, which is input row5. So that would be the case if the output is the input reversed. Let me see:\n\nOriginal input rows 0-9:\n\nRow0: ... \nRow5: 0 0 0 9\nRow9: 2 4 3 9\n\nReversed grid would have row0 as input row9, row1 as input row8, row2 as input row7, row3 as input row6, row4 as input row5, row5 as input row4, etc. So in example 1's output, the fifth row (index 5) is input row4. But according to the example 1's output, the fifth row is 0 0 0 9, which is input row5. So this suggests that perhaps my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Let me re-examine example 1's output.\n\nExample 1's output:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9 \u2192 input row9\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9 \u2192 input row8\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 input row7\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 input row6\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 \u2192 input row5\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9 \u2192 input row5?\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 input row6?\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 input row7?\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9 \u2192 input row8?\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9 \u2192 input row9?\n\nSo the output is not the full reversed grid. Because the first five rows are input rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then the next five rows are input rows 5,6,7,8,9. So the output is the input grid reversed, but only for the first five rows, and then the same as the original? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the output is the input grid reversed, but the input grid has 10 rows. So reversed would be 10 rows. Let's think:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow0, row1, row2, row3, row4, row5, row6, row7, row8, row9.\n\nReversed would be:\n\nrow9, row8, row7, row6, row5, row4, row3, row2, row1, row0.\n\nBut in example 1's output, the first five rows are row9, row8, row7, row6, row5. Then the next five rows are row5, row6, row7, row8, row9. Which is not the reversed grid. So this suggests that the pattern isn't simply reversing the entire grid.\n\nHmm, this contradicts my previous conclusion. So what's going on here?\n\nLet me re-examine the example 1's output. Let me list all the output rows:\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9 \u2192 input row9\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9 \u2192 input row8\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 input row7\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 input row6\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 \u2192 input row5\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9 \u2192 input row5\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 input row6\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 input row7\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9 \u2192 input row8\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9 \u2192 input row9\n\nSo the output is the first five rows of the reversed grid (row9, row8, row7, row6, row5), followed by the original first five rows (row5, row6, row7, row8, row9)? No, because row5 of the output is input row5, row6 is input row6, etc. So the output is the first five rows of the reversed grid, then the original first five rows?\n\nBut why? That would make the output have the first five rows as reversed, and the next five as original. But that seems arbitrary. What's the pattern here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid reversed, but with some other transformation. Or perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid, but then mirror it in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid and then duplicate it. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid, but then for some reason, the first five rows are the reversed, and the next five are the original. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input grid reversed, but the input grid has some symmetry. For example, if the input grid is symmetric, then reversing it would produce the same as the original. But in example 1, the input is not symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid, but the output is the reversed grid. But according to the example 1's output, the reversed grid would have row5 as input row4, but in the output, row5 is input row5.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. Which means that my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nSo what's the correct pattern?\n\nLet me think again. Let's look at example 1's input and output.\n\nInput:\n\nRow 0-4: all zeros.\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 9\n\nRow6: 0 0 3 9\n\nRow7: 0 0 3 9\n\nRow8: 2 0 3 9\n\nRow9: 2 4 3 9\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: 2 4 3 9 \u2192 row9\n\nRow1: 2 0 3 9 \u2192 row8\n\nRow2: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 row7\n\nRow3: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 row6\n\nRow4: 0 0 0 9 \u2192 row5\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 9 \u2192 row5\n\nRow6: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 row6\n\nRow7: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 row7\n\nRow8: 2 0 3 9 \u2192 row8\n\nRow9: 2 4 3 9 \u2192 row9\n\nSo the output is the input's rows 9,8,7,6,5,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo the first five rows are the input's rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then the next five rows are the input's rows 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo the output is the input's rows from 9 to 5, then from 5 to 9. So it's like a palindrome. So the output is the input's rows reversed, but then the first half is the reversed part, and the second half is the original part.\n\nBut why? What's the pattern here?\n\nLooking at example 2's output:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0-4: all zeros.\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 2\n\nRow6: 0 0 0 2\n\nRow7: 0 8 0 2\n\nRow8: 0 3 8 2\n\nRow9: 3 3 8 2\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: 3 3 8 2 \u2192 row9\n\nRow1: 0 3 8 2 \u2192 row8\n\nRow2: 0 8 0 2 \u2192 row7\n\nRow3: 0 0 0 2 \u2192 row6\n\nRow4: 0 0 0 2 \u2192 row5\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 2 \u2192 row5\n\nRow6: 0 0 0 2 \u2192 row6\n\nRow7: 0 8 0 2 \u2192 row7\n\nRow8: 0 3 8 2 \u2192 row8\n\nRow9: 3 3 8 2 \u2192 row9\n\nSo the output is the input rows 9,8,7,6,5,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo the pattern is the same as example 1. So the output is the input's rows from 9 to 5, then from 5 to 9. So the output is a combination of the reversed part and the original part.\n\nBut why? What's the logic here?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to take the input grid, and for each row, mirror it in some way. Or perhaps it's a reflection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid and then duplicate it. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to take the input grid, and for the first five rows, take the reversed rows, and for the next five rows, take the original rows. But why five?\n\nLooking at the input grids, they have 10 rows. So perhaps the transformation is to take the first five rows of the reversed grid, and then the last five rows of the original grid? Or something like that.\n\nBut in example 1, the output is the first five rows of the reversed grid (rows 9,8,7,6,5), followed by the original rows 5,6,7,8,9. So it's like the output is the reversed grid's first five rows, then the original grid's rows 5-9.\n\nBut why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid, but for some reason, the middle rows are duplicated. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid, but the output is the reversed grid with the first five rows and the last five rows being the same as the original. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to reverse the grid and then for each row, if it's in the first half, keep it, and for the second half, mirror it. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input grid reversed, but with some parts duplicated. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to reverse the grid and then duplicate it. But example 1's output has 10 rows, which is the same as the input. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid, and then for each row, if it's in the first half, keep it, and for the second half, reverse it again. But this is just speculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to reverse the grid, but only for the first half of the rows, and then leave the second half as is. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid, and then for the second half, take the original rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as a combination of the reversed grid and the original grid. For example, the output is the reversed grid's first five rows, then the original grid's first five rows. But in example 1, the output's first five rows are the reversed grid's first five rows (rows 9,8,7,6,5), and the next five rows are the original grid's rows 5,6,7,8,9. So it's not the first five rows of the original grid, but the rows 5-9.\n\nBut why would that be the case?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to take the input grid, reverse it, and then for the first five rows, keep them, and for the next five rows, take the original grid's rows from 5 to 9. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the input grid and create a new grid where the first five rows are the reversed input, and the next five rows are the original input's rows from 5 to 9. But why?\n\nThis is confusing. Let's think of the output as being the input grid reversed, but with the middle rows duplicated. For example, in example 1, the output's row4 is input row5, and row5 is also input row5. So perhaps the middle row is duplicated.\n\nBut what's the pattern here? It seems like the output is the reversed grid, but with the middle part duplicated. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid and then mirror it. For example, the output is the reversed grid, but then the first five rows are the reversed, and the next five are the same as the first five. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as being the input grid reversed, but with the first five rows and the last five rows being the same as the original. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to reverse the grid, but for some reason, the middle rows are kept as is. For example, in example 1, the output has rows 5-9 as the original rows 5-9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the input grid reversed, but with the first five rows being the reversed version, and the next five rows being the original. But this would mean that for example 1, the output is:\n\nreversed input rows 0-4 (which are input rows 9,8,7,6,5), then input rows 0-4 (which are all zeros). But that's not the case. In example 1's output, the rows 5-9 are input rows 5-9.\n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is to take the first five rows of the reversed input, and then the last five rows of the original input. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to take the input grid, reverse it, and then for each row, if it's in the first five, keep it, otherwise, take the original row. But this would mean that for example 1, the output is:\n\nreversed rows 0-4 (input rows 9,8,7,6,5), then original rows 5-9. Which matches the example.\n\nSo for example 1, the output is:\n\nreversed input rows 0-4 (rows 9,8,7,6,5) + original input rows 5-9 (rows 5,6,7,8,9).\n\nBut why would that be the case?\n\nThis seems to fit both examples. Let's check example 2:\n\nInput rows 0-4 are all zeros. rows 5-9 are:\n\nrow5: 0 0 0 2\n\nrow6: 0 0 0 2\n\nrow7: 0 8 0 2\n\nrow8: 0 3 8 2\n\nrow9: 3 3 8 2\n\nReversed input rows 0-4 would be input rows 9,8,7,6,5. So:\n\nrow0: 3 3 8 2 (row9)\n\nrow1: 0 3 8 2 (row8)\n\nrow2: 0 8 0 2 (row7)\n\nrow3: 0 0 0 2 (row6)\n\nrow4: 0 0 0 2 (row5)\n\nThen the output's rows 5-9 are the original input rows 5-9: row5, row6, row7, row8, row9.\n\nWhich matches example 2's output.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. The transformation is to take the first five rows of the reversed input, and then the last five rows of the original input.\n\nSo the output grid is:\n\noutput[0-4] = reversed_input[0-4] (which is input[9], input[8], input[7], input[6], input[5])\n\noutput[5-9] = input[5], input[6], input[7], input[8], input[9]\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    reversed_grid = grid[::-1]\n    first_part = reversed_grid[:5]\n    second_part = grid[5:]\n    return first_part + second_part\n\nLet me test this with example 1:\n\nReversed_grid is grid[::-1], which is [row9, row8, row7, row6, row5, row4, row3, row2, row1, row0].\n\nfirst_part is reversed_grid[:5] \u2192 [row9, row8, row7, row6, row5]\n\nsecond_part is grid[5:] \u2192 [row5, row6, row7, row8, row9]\n\nSo the output is first_part + second_part \u2192 [row9, row8, row7, row6, row5, row5, row6, row7, row8, row9], which matches example 1's output.\n\nSimilarly for example 2, this would work.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern.\n\nSo the code should take the reversed grid, take the first five rows, and then append the original grid's rows from index 5 to the end.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    reversed_grid = grid[::-1]\n    return reversed_grid[:5] + grid[5:]\n\nBut wait, grid is a list of lists. So grid[::-1] reverses the rows. Then, take the first 5 rows of that reversed grid, and then take the original grid's rows from index 5 onwards.\n\nYes.\n\nLet me test this with example 1's input.\n\nOriginal grid has 10 rows. reversed_grid is the reversed list. So reversed_grid[:5] is rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then grid[5:] is rows 5,6,7,8,9. So combined, the output is the desired one.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be the correct transformation.\n\nNow, for the test input, applying this transformation would give:\n\nTest input's rows 0-9:\n\nrow0: 0 0 0 0\n\nrow1: 0 0 0 0\n\nrow2: 0 0 0 0\n\nrow3: 0 0 0 0\n\nrow4: 0 0 0 0\n\nrow5: 0 1 0 0\n\nrow6: 7 1 0 0\n\nrow7: 7 1 3 0\n\nrow8: 7 1 3 3\n\nrow9: 7 1 4 4\n\nreversed_grid is [row9, row8, row7, row6, row5, row4, row3, row2, row1, row0]\n\nreversed_grid[:5] is [row9, row8, row7, row6, row5]\n\ngrid[5:] is [row5, row6, row7, row8, row9]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nrow9: 7 1 4 4\n\nrow8: 7 1 3 3\n\nrow7: 7 1 3 0\n\nrow6: 7 1 0 0\n\nrow5: 0 1 0 0\n\nrow5: 0 1 0 0\n\nrow6: 7 1 0 0\n\nrow7: 7 1 3 0\n\nrow8: 7 1 3 3\n\nrow9: 7 1 4 4\n\nSo the output is:\n\n7 1 4 4\n\n7 1 3 3\n\n7 1 3 0\n\n7 1 0 0\n\n0 1 0 0\n\n0 1 0 0\n\n7 1 0 0\n\n7 1 3 0\n\n7 1 3 3\n\n7 1 4 4\n\nWhich is the transformed grid.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nThus, the code should be as described.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, looking at the training examples. \n\nIn Example 1, the input is a grid where the bottom rows have some numbers. The output seems to be a reversed version of the input. Wait, looking at the input and output. Let me check:\n\nThe input for example 1 has 10 rows. The output is the input reversed. Like, the first row of the output is the last row of the input. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input's last row is 2 4 3 9. The output's first row is 2 4 3 9. Then the next row of the output is 2 0 3 9, which is the second last row of the input. So yes, it's reversed. But wait, the input's 6th row (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's check the example. The input has 10 rows. For example 1, the input's 6th row (if counting from 0, maybe) is 0 0 0 9. The output's 5th row (if 0-based) is 0 0 0 9. So it seems like the output is the input reversed. But why?\n\nBut then in example 2, the input's last row is 3 3 8 2. The output's first row is 3 3 8 2. Then the next row is 0 3 8 2, which is the input's 4th row. So again, the output is the input reversed. So maybe the transformation is to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nBut wait, the test input given is:\n\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n7 1 0 0\n7 1 3 0\n7 1 3 3\n7 1 4 4\n\nIf we reverse this, the output would be the rows in reverse order. So the first row of the output would be 7 1 4 4, then 7 1 3 3, etc. But the problem says that the output must be 10x4. So the transformation is simply reversing the order of the rows. \n\nBut why in the first example, the output is the reversed input. Let me check example 1's input and output again. The input's rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0\n...\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9 (original row 9)\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9 (original row 8)\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9 (original row 7)\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9 (original row 6)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 (original row 5)\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9 (original row 5? Wait, original row 5 is 0 0 0 9. Then in the output, row 4 is 0 0 0 9. Then row 5 is 0 0 3 9? Wait, maybe I'm getting the indices wrong. Let me count the rows. The output has 10 rows. Let me check the example 1's output:\n\nThe output's first row is 2 4 3 9 (original row 9), then 2 0 3 9 (row 8), then 0 0 3 9 (row 7), then 0 0 3 9 (row 6), then 0 0 0 9 (row 5), then 0 0 0 9 (row 5?), then 0 0 3 9 (row 6?), etc. Wait, maybe the output is the input reversed. So the output is the input rows in reverse order. So for example, the first row of the output is the last row of the input, the second row is the second last, etc. \n\nSo for example 1, the input has 10 rows. The output is the input reversed. Similarly for example 2. So the transformation is to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nSo the code would be to take the input grid, reverse the order of the rows, and return that as the output. \n\nBut let's check example 2. The input's rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0\n...\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2\nRow 6: 0 0 0 2\nRow 7: 0 8 0 2\nRow 8: 0 3 8 2\nRow 9: 3 3 8 2\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 8 2 (row 9)\nRow 1: 0 3 8 2 (row 8)\nRow 2: 0 8 0 2 (row 7)\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 (row 6)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 (row 5)\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2 (row 5?)\nWait, the output has 10 rows. So the output is the input reversed. So for example, the output's row 0 is input's row 9, row 1 is input's row 8, etc. \n\nSo the code would be to reverse the rows. So the transformed grid is grid[::-1]. \n\nBut then, the test input given is:\n\nThe input is 10 rows. The output would be the reversed rows. So for the test input, the first row of the output would be the last row of the input, which is 7 1 4 4. Then the next row is 7 1 3 3, then 7 1 3 0, etc. \n\nSo the code would be straightforward. \n\nBut why do the examples have such transformations? Maybe the pattern is that the output is the input grid with rows reversed. \n\nSo the Python function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    return [row for row in reversed(grid)]\n\nBut wait, the grid is a list of lists. So reversed(grid) would reverse the order of the rows. \n\nBut let me check. For example 1, the input is 10 rows. The output is the reversed rows. \n\nYes. So this seems to fit. \n\nBut why in the first example, the output's 5th row (assuming 0-based) is 0 0 0 9. Let me check. The input's row 5 is 0 0 0 9. When reversed, the output's row 4 would be input's row 5. Because for 10 rows, the original row 0 becomes output row 9, row 1 becomes 8, etc. So for row i in input, it's placed at row 9 - i in the output. \n\nSo for example, in example 1's output, the 5th row (index 5) is 0 0 3 9, which is the original row 4? Or maybe I'm getting the indices wrong. \n\nBut regardless, the code would be to reverse the rows. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    return grid[::-1]\n\nBut wait, the grid is a list of lists. So grid[::-1] reverses the order of the rows. \n\nYes. So this would work. \n\nBut let me check the example 1's output. The input's rows are 10 rows. The output is the reversed rows. \n\nYes. So this seems to fit. \n\nSo the answer is to reverse the rows of the input grid.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are two training examples given, and I need to find out what transformation is happening between the input and output grids. Let's look at Example 1 first.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 10x4 grid. The output seems to be a reversed version of the input. Wait, looking at the input and output:\n\nThe input's last row is [2 4 3 9], and the output's first row is [2 4 3 9]. Then the next row of the output is [2 0 3 9], which was the row above in the input. Wait, the input's 9th row (if counting from 0, maybe?) is [2 0 3 9], and the output's second row is that. So maybe the output is the input grid reversed vertically? Let me check.\n\nOriginal input rows (assuming 10 rows):\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0\n...\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nThe output for Example 1 starts with [2 4 3 9], which is the input's row 9. Then [2 0 3 9] (row 8), then [0 0 3 9] (row 7?), then [0 0 3 9] (row 6?), then [0 0 0 9] (row 5?), then the next rows are the same as the input's rows 5, 6, 7, 8, 9? Wait, the output has 10 rows. Let me check the output:\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9 (input row 9)\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9 (input row 8)\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9 (input row 7)\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9 (input row 6)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 (input row 5)\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9 (input row 5 again?)\nWait, maybe the output is the input reversed. Like, the first row of output is the last row of input, second row is the second last, etc. Let's check:\n\nInput has 10 rows. Output's first row is input row 9. Second row is input row 8. Third row input row 7. Fourth row input row 6. Fifth row input row 5. Then the sixth row of output is input row 4? Let me check the output's sixth row. The output's fifth row (index 5) is 0 0 0 9, which was input row 5. Then the sixth row of output is 0 0 3 9, which is input row 6? Wait, maybe the output is the input reversed. So for example, the output is the input grid reversed vertically. So for each row in the output, it's the input's row in reverse order.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output, the first five rows are the input's rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then the next five rows are input's rows 4,3,2,1,0? Let me check:\n\nOriginal input rows 5-9:\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9\n\nOutput's first 5 rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9 (row9)\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9 (row8)\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9 (row7)\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9 (row6)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 (row5)\n\nThen the output's next rows (rows 5-9) are:\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 9 (row5 again?), then row6: 0 0 3 9 (row6?), etc. Wait, no. Let me check the output given for example 1:\n\nThe output is:\n\n2 4 3 9\n2 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 0 9\n0 0 0 9\n0 0 3 9\n0 0 3 9\n2 0 3 9\n2 4 3 9\n\nSo rows 5-9 of output are:\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 9 (same as input row5)\nRow6: 0 0 3 9 (input row6)\nRow7: 0 0 3 9 (input row7)\nRow8: 2 0 3 9 (input row8)\nRow9: 2 4 3 9 (input row9)\n\nSo the output is the input reversed. Because the first five rows are the input's rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then the next five rows are input's rows 5,6,7,8,9? Wait, no. Because row5 of output is input row5, row6 is input row6, etc. So the output is the input reversed. Because the entire grid is reversed. So the output is the input grid reversed vertically. So for example, the first row of output is the last row of input, second row is second last, etc. So for a 10-row grid, output[i] = input[9 - i].\n\nLet me check Example 2. Input for example 2 is:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 0\nRow5: 0 0 0 2\nRow6: 0 0 0 2\nRow7: 0 8 0 2\nRow8: 0 3 8 2\nRow9: 3 3 8 2\n\nOutput for example 2 is:\n\n3 3 8 2\n0 3 8 2\n0 8 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 2\n0 8 0 2\n0 3 8 2\n3 3 8 2\n\nSo the output's first row is input row9, second row input row8, third input row7, fourth input row6, fifth input row5, then sixth row is input row5 again? Let me check:\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow0: 3 3 8 2 (input row9)\nRow1: 0 3 8 2 (input row8)\nRow2: 0 8 0 2 (input row7)\nRow3: 0 0 0 2 (input row6)\nRow4: 0 0 0 2 (input row5)\nRow5: 0 0 0 2 (input row5 again?)\nRow6: 0 0 0 2 (input row5?)\nRow7: 0 8 0 2 (input row7?)\nRow8: 0 3 8 2 (input row8)\nRow9: 3 3 8 2 (input row9)\n\nHmm, this seems like the output is the input reversed. For example, the first five rows are input rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then the next five rows are input rows 5,6,7,8,9. So the entire grid is reversed. So the output is the input grid reversed vertically. So for each row in the output, it's the input's row in reverse order.\n\nSo for example, in Example 1, the output is the input reversed. So the transformation is to reverse the rows of the input grid. So the first row of the output is the last row of the input, the second row is the second last, etc.\n\nBut let's check the test input. The test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0\n7 1 0 0\n7 1 3 0\n7 1 3 3\n7 1 4 4\n\nIf the transformation is to reverse the rows, then the output would be:\n\nOriginal rows 0-9:\n\nRow0: 0 0 0 0\nRow1: 0 0 0 0\nRow2: 0 0 0 0\nRow3: 0 0 0 0\nRow4: 0 0 0 0\nRow5: 0 1 0 0\nRow6: 7 1 0 0\nRow7: 7 1 3 0\nRow8: 7 1 3 3\nRow9: 7 1 4 4\n\nReversed, the output would be:\n\nRow0: 7 1 4 4 (original row9)\nRow1: 7 1 3 3 (row8)\nRow2: 7 1 3 0 (row7)\nRow3: 7 1 0 0 (row6)\nRow4: 0 1 0 0 (row5)\nRow5: 0 0 0 0 (row4)\nRow6: 0 0 0 0 (row3)\nRow7: 0 0 0 0 (row2)\nRow8: 0 0 0 0 (row1)\nRow9: 0 0 0 0 (row0)\n\nBut the test input's output isn't provided, but according to the problem statement, the function must return a 10x4 grid. So according to this pattern, the code would reverse the input grid's rows.\n\nSo the transformation is to reverse the rows of the input grid. So the function would take the input grid, reverse the order of the rows, and return that as the output.\n\nLet me check Example 2's output again. The input's row5 is [0 0 0 2], and in the output, row4 is [0 0 0 2], which would be the original row5. So in the output, the first five rows are the original rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then the next five rows are original rows 5,6,7,8,9. So the entire grid is reversed. So for a 10-row grid, the output is input[::-1], i.e., reversed.\n\nSo the code would be as simple as returning the reversed grid.\n\nSo the Python function would take the grid, reverse the rows, and return that.\n\nBut let me make sure. For example 1, the output is the reversed input. So for the input grid, the output is [row9, row8, row7, row6, row5, row4, row3, row2, row1, row0]? Wait, no. Because in example 1's output, the first five rows are row9, row8, row7, row6, row5. Then the next five rows are row5, row6, row7, row8, row9? No, looking at example 1's output:\n\nThe output has 10 rows. The first five rows are the input's rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then the next five rows are input's rows 5,6,7,8,9? Let me check:\n\nOriginal input rows 5-9:\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 9\nRow6: 0 0 3 9\nRow7: 0 0 3 9\nRow8: 2 0 3 9\nRow9: 2 4 3 9\n\nOutput rows 0-4: row9, row8, row7, row6, row5.\n\nOutput rows 5-9: row5, row6, row7, row8, row9.\n\nSo the entire output is the input reversed. Because the output is the input rows in reverse order. So for example, the output is the input grid reversed. So for a 10-row grid, the output is input[::-1].\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    return [row for row in reversed(grid)]\n\nBut wait, the input is a list of lists. So reversed(grid) would reverse the order of the rows. So for example, if the input is a list of 10 rows, reversed would give the rows in reverse order.\n\nBut let me check for example 2. The input's row5 is [0 0 0 2], row6 [0 0 0 2], row7 [0 8 0 2], row8 [0 3 8 2], row9 [3 3 8 2]. The output's first row is row9, then row8, then row7, then row6, then row5. Then the next rows are row5, row6, row7, row8, row9. So the output is the input reversed. So yes, the code would work.\n\nSo the transformation is simply reversing the rows of the input grid.\n\nTherefore, the Python function would be to reverse the rows of the input grid.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    return list(reversed(grid))\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the output must be a 10x4 grid. The input is 10x4, so reversed would also be 10x4. So that's correct.\n\nBut let me check for example 1. The input is 10 rows. The output is 10 rows. So yes.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach. Let me check if there's any other pattern. For example, maybe there's some other transformation, but given the examples, this seems to fit.\n\nSo the code would be as simple as returning the reversed grid.\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the output's row 5 is 0 0 0 9, which is the same as input's row5. So when reversed, the output's row 5 would be input's row 4. Wait, no. Let me think. For a 10-row grid, the reversed grid would have row 0 as input row9, row1 as input row8, ..., row9 as input row0.\n\nBut in example 1's output, the fifth row (index 5) is 0 0 0 9, which is input row5. So that would be the case if the output is the input reversed. Let me see:\n\nOriginal input rows 0-9:\n\nRow0: ... \nRow5: 0 0 0 9\nRow9: 2 4 3 9\n\nReversed grid would have row0 as input row9, row1 as input row8, row2 as input row7, row3 as input row6, row4 as input row5, row5 as input row4, etc. So in example 1's output, the fifth row (index 5) is input row4. But according to the example 1's output, the fifth row is 0 0 0 9, which is input row5. So this suggests that perhaps my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nWait, this is a problem. Let me re-examine example 1's output.\n\nExample 1's output:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9 \u2192 input row9\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9 \u2192 input row8\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 input row7\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 input row6\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 \u2192 input row5\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9 \u2192 input row5?\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 input row6?\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 input row7?\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9 \u2192 input row8?\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9 \u2192 input row9?\n\nSo the output is not the full reversed grid. Because the first five rows are input rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then the next five rows are input rows 5,6,7,8,9. So the output is the input grid reversed, but only for the first five rows, and then the same as the original? That doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the output is the input grid reversed, but the input grid has 10 rows. So reversed would be 10 rows. Let's think:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow0, row1, row2, row3, row4, row5, row6, row7, row8, row9.\n\nReversed would be:\n\nrow9, row8, row7, row6, row5, row4, row3, row2, row1, row0.\n\nBut in example 1's output, the first five rows are row9, row8, row7, row6, row5. Then the next five rows are row5, row6, row7, row8, row9. Which is not the reversed grid. So this suggests that the pattern isn't simply reversing the entire grid.\n\nHmm, this contradicts my previous conclusion. So what's going on here?\n\nLet me re-examine the example 1's output. Let me list all the output rows:\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 9 \u2192 input row9\nRow 1: 2 0 3 9 \u2192 input row8\nRow 2: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 input row7\nRow 3: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 input row6\nRow 4: 0 0 0 9 \u2192 input row5\nRow 5: 0 0 0 9 \u2192 input row5\nRow 6: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 input row6\nRow 7: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 input row7\nRow 8: 2 0 3 9 \u2192 input row8\nRow 9: 2 4 3 9 \u2192 input row9\n\nSo the output is the first five rows of the reversed grid (row9, row8, row7, row6, row5), followed by the original first five rows (row5, row6, row7, row8, row9)? No, because row5 of the output is input row5, row6 is input row6, etc. So the output is the first five rows of the reversed grid, then the original first five rows?\n\nBut why? That would make the output have the first five rows as reversed, and the next five as original. But that seems arbitrary. What's the pattern here?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid reversed, but with some other transformation. Or perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid, but then mirror it in some way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid and then duplicate it. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid, but then for some reason, the first five rows are the reversed, and the next five are the original. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input grid reversed, but the input grid has some symmetry. For example, if the input grid is symmetric, then reversing it would produce the same as the original. But in example 1, the input is not symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid, but the output is the reversed grid. But according to the example 1's output, the reversed grid would have row5 as input row4, but in the output, row5 is input row5.\n\nSo there's a contradiction here. Which means that my initial hypothesis is wrong.\n\nSo what's the correct pattern?\n\nLet me think again. Let's look at example 1's input and output.\n\nInput:\n\nRow 0-4: all zeros.\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 9\n\nRow6: 0 0 3 9\n\nRow7: 0 0 3 9\n\nRow8: 2 0 3 9\n\nRow9: 2 4 3 9\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: 2 4 3 9 \u2192 row9\n\nRow1: 2 0 3 9 \u2192 row8\n\nRow2: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 row7\n\nRow3: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 row6\n\nRow4: 0 0 0 9 \u2192 row5\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 9 \u2192 row5\n\nRow6: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 row6\n\nRow7: 0 0 3 9 \u2192 row7\n\nRow8: 2 0 3 9 \u2192 row8\n\nRow9: 2 4 3 9 \u2192 row9\n\nSo the output is the input's rows 9,8,7,6,5,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo the first five rows are the input's rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then the next five rows are the input's rows 5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo the output is the input's rows from 9 to 5, then from 5 to 9. So it's like a palindrome. So the output is the input's rows reversed, but then the first half is the reversed part, and the second half is the original part.\n\nBut why? What's the pattern here?\n\nLooking at example 2's output:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow0-4: all zeros.\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 2\n\nRow6: 0 0 0 2\n\nRow7: 0 8 0 2\n\nRow8: 0 3 8 2\n\nRow9: 3 3 8 2\n\nOutput:\n\nRow0: 3 3 8 2 \u2192 row9\n\nRow1: 0 3 8 2 \u2192 row8\n\nRow2: 0 8 0 2 \u2192 row7\n\nRow3: 0 0 0 2 \u2192 row6\n\nRow4: 0 0 0 2 \u2192 row5\n\nRow5: 0 0 0 2 \u2192 row5\n\nRow6: 0 0 0 2 \u2192 row6\n\nRow7: 0 8 0 2 \u2192 row7\n\nRow8: 0 3 8 2 \u2192 row8\n\nRow9: 3 3 8 2 \u2192 row9\n\nSo the output is the input rows 9,8,7,6,5,5,6,7,8,9.\n\nSo the pattern is the same as example 1. So the output is the input's rows from 9 to 5, then from 5 to 9. So the output is a combination of the reversed part and the original part.\n\nBut why? What's the logic here?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to take the input grid, and for each row, mirror it in some way. Or perhaps it's a reflection.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid and then duplicate it. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to take the input grid, and for the first five rows, take the reversed rows, and for the next five rows, take the original rows. But why five?\n\nLooking at the input grids, they have 10 rows. So perhaps the transformation is to take the first five rows of the reversed grid, and then the last five rows of the original grid? Or something like that.\n\nBut in example 1, the output is the first five rows of the reversed grid (rows 9,8,7,6,5), followed by the original rows 5,6,7,8,9. So it's like the output is the reversed grid's first five rows, then the original grid's rows 5-9.\n\nBut why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid, but for some reason, the middle rows are duplicated. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid, but the output is the reversed grid with the first five rows and the last five rows being the same as the original. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to reverse the grid and then for each row, if it's in the first half, keep it, and for the second half, mirror it. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input grid reversed, but with some parts duplicated. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to reverse the grid and then duplicate it. But example 1's output has 10 rows, which is the same as the input. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid, and then for each row, if it's in the first half, keep it, and for the second half, reverse it again. But this is just speculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to reverse the grid, but only for the first half of the rows, and then leave the second half as is. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid, and then for the second half, take the original rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as a combination of the reversed grid and the original grid. For example, the output is the reversed grid's first five rows, then the original grid's first five rows. But in example 1, the output's first five rows are the reversed grid's first five rows (rows 9,8,7,6,5), and the next five rows are the original grid's rows 5,6,7,8,9. So it's not the first five rows of the original grid, but the rows 5-9.\n\nBut why would that be the case?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to take the input grid, reverse it, and then for the first five rows, keep them, and for the next five rows, take the original grid's rows from 5 to 9. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to take the input grid and create a new grid where the first five rows are the reversed input, and the next five rows are the original input's rows from 5 to 9. But why?\n\nThis is confusing. Let's think of the output as being the input grid reversed, but with the middle rows duplicated. For example, in example 1, the output's row4 is input row5, and row5 is also input row5. So perhaps the middle row is duplicated.\n\nBut what's the pattern here? It seems like the output is the reversed grid, but with the middle part duplicated. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to reverse the grid and then mirror it. For example, the output is the reversed grid, but then the first five rows are the reversed, and the next five are the same as the first five. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output as being the input grid reversed, but with the first five rows and the last five rows being the same as the original. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to reverse the grid, but for some reason, the middle rows are kept as is. For example, in example 1, the output has rows 5-9 as the original rows 5-9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as the input grid reversed, but with the first five rows being the reversed version, and the next five rows being the original. But this would mean that for example 1, the output is:\n\nreversed input rows 0-4 (which are input rows 9,8,7,6,5), then input rows 0-4 (which are all zeros). But that's not the case. In example 1's output, the rows 5-9 are input rows 5-9.\n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is to take the first five rows of the reversed input, and then the last five rows of the original input. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to take the input grid, reverse it, and then for each row, if it's in the first five, keep it, otherwise, take the original row. But this would mean that for example 1, the output is:\n\nreversed rows 0-4 (input rows 9,8,7,6,5), then original rows 5-9. Which matches the example.\n\nSo for example 1, the output is:\n\nreversed input rows 0-4 (rows 9,8,7,6,5) + original input rows 5-9 (rows 5,6,7,8,9).\n\nBut why would that be the case?\n\nThis seems to fit both examples. Let's check example 2:\n\nInput rows 0-4 are all zeros. rows 5-9 are:\n\nrow5: 0 0 0 2\n\nrow6: 0 0 0 2\n\nrow7: 0 8 0 2\n\nrow8: 0 3 8 2\n\nrow9: 3 3 8 2\n\nReversed input rows 0-4 would be input rows 9,8,7,6,5. So:\n\nrow0: 3 3 8 2 (row9)\n\nrow1: 0 3 8 2 (row8)\n\nrow2: 0 8 0 2 (row7)\n\nrow3: 0 0 0 2 (row6)\n\nrow4: 0 0 0 2 (row5)\n\nThen the output's rows 5-9 are the original input rows 5-9: row5, row6, row7, row8, row9.\n\nWhich matches example 2's output.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. The transformation is to take the first five rows of the reversed input, and then the last five rows of the original input.\n\nSo the output grid is:\n\noutput[0-4] = reversed_input[0-4] (which is input[9], input[8], input[7], input[6], input[5])\n\noutput[5-9] = input[5], input[6], input[7], input[8], input[9]\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    reversed_grid = grid[::-1]\n    first_part = reversed_grid[:5]\n    second_part = grid[5:]\n    return first_part + second_part\n\nLet me test this with example 1:\n\nReversed_grid is grid[::-1], which is [row9, row8, row7, row6, row5, row4, row3, row2, row1, row0].\n\nfirst_part is reversed_grid[:5] \u2192 [row9, row8, row7, row6, row5]\n\nsecond_part is grid[5:] \u2192 [row5, row6, row7, row8, row9]\n\nSo the output is first_part + second_part \u2192 [row9, row8, row7, row6, row5, row5, row6, row7, row8, row9], which matches example 1's output.\n\nSimilarly for example 2, this would work.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern.\n\nSo the code should take the reversed grid, take the first five rows, and then append the original grid's rows from index 5 to the end.\n\nSo the Python code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    reversed_grid = grid[::-1]\n    return reversed_grid[:5] + grid[5:]\n\nBut wait, grid is a list of lists. So grid[::-1] reverses the rows. Then, take the first 5 rows of that reversed grid, and then take the original grid's rows from index 5 onwards.\n\nYes.\n\nLet me test this with example 1's input.\n\nOriginal grid has 10 rows. reversed_grid is the reversed list. So reversed_grid[:5] is rows 9,8,7,6,5. Then grid[5:] is rows 5,6,7,8,9. So combined, the output is the desired one.\n\nYes.\n\nSo this should be the correct transformation.\n\nNow, for the test input, applying this transformation would give:\n\nTest input's rows 0-9:\n\nrow0: 0 0 0 0\n\nrow1: 0 0 0 0\n\nrow2: 0 0 0 0\n\nrow3: 0 0 0 0\n\nrow4: 0 0 0 0\n\nrow5: 0 1 0 0\n\nrow6: 7 1 0 0\n\nrow7: 7 1 3 0\n\nrow8: 7 1 3 3\n\nrow9: 7 1 4 4\n\nreversed_grid is [row9, row8, row7, row6, row5, row4, row3, row2, row1, row0]\n\nreversed_grid[:5] is [row9, row8, row7, row6, row5]\n\ngrid[5:] is [row5, row6, row7, row8, row9]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nrow9: 7 1 4 4\n\nrow8: 7 1 3 3\n\nrow7: 7 1 3 0\n\nrow6: 7 1 0 0\n\nrow5: 0 1 0 0\n\nrow5: 0 1 0 0\n\nrow6: 7 1 0 0\n\nrow7: 7 1 3 0\n\nrow8: 7 1 3 3\n\nrow9: 7 1 4 4\n\nSo the output is:\n\n7 1 4 4\n\n7 1 3 3\n\n7 1 3 0\n\n7 1 0 0\n\n0 1 0 0\n\n0 1 0 0\n\n7 1 0 0\n\n7 1 3 0\n\n7 1 3 3\n\n7 1 4 4\n\nWhich is the transformed grid.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach.\n\nThus, the code should be as described.\n"
