The output grid is always 10 rows by 14 columns\n2. Values propagate from certain positions to spread out in a specific pattern\n3. The propagation seems to be influenced by the values in the input grid\n4. The spread pattern appears to be a kind of \"expansion\" where values spread from their original positions to adjacent cells\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Expands values from their original positions\n- Spreads values to adjacent cells in a specific pattern\n- Leaves 0 values unchanged\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(14):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            if value == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # Spread the value to adjacent cells in a specific pattern\n            # This is a simplified version of the observed pattern\n            # We'll spread the value to cells that are 2 or more rows or columns away\n            # This is a hypothesis based on the training examples\n            for i in range(row - 2, row + 3):\n                for j in range(col - 2, col + 3):\n                    if 0 <= i < 10 and 0 <= j < 14:\n                        output[i][j] = value\n    \n    return output\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(14):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            if value == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # Spread the value to adjacent cells in a specific pattern\n            # This is a simplified version of the observed pattern\n            # We'll spread the value to cells that are 2 or more rows or columns away\n            # This is a hypothesis based on the training examples\n            for i in range(row - 2, row + 3):\n                for j in range(col - 2, col + 3):\n                    if 0 <= i < 10 and 0 <= j < 14:\n                        output[i][j] = value\n    \n    return output\n```",

The output grid is always 10 rows by 14 columns\n2. Values propagate from certain positions to spread out in a specific pattern\n3. The propagation seems to be influenced by the values in the input grid\n4. The spread pattern appears to be a kind of \"expansion\" where values spread from their original positions to adjacent cells\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Expands values from their original positions\n- Spreads values to adjacent cells in a specific pattern\n- Leaves 0 values unchanged\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(14):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            if value == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # Spread the value to adjacent cells in a specific pattern\n            # This is a simplified version of the observed pattern\n            # We'll spread the value to cells that are 2 or more rows or columns away\n            # This is a hypothesis based on the training examples\n            for i in range(row - 2, row + 3):\n                for j in range(col - 2, col + 3):\n                    if 0 <= i < 10 and 0 <= j < 14:\n                        output[i][j] = value\n    \n    return output\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(14):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            if value == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # Spread the value to adjacent cells in a specific pattern\n            # This is a simplified version of the observed pattern\n            # We'll spread the value to cells that are 2 or more rows or columns away\n            # This is a hypothesis based on the training examples\n            for i in range(row - 2, row + 3):\n                for j in range(col - 2, col + 3):\n                    if 0 <= i < 10 and 0 <= j < 14:\n                        output[i][j] = value\n    \n    return output\n```",
