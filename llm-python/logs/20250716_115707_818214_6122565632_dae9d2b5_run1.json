    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are five training examples, each with an input grid and an output grid. My job is to find out what transformation is happening from input to output.\n\nLet me start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nExample 1:\nInput is a 3x6 grid. The output is a 3x3 grid. Let me write down the input and output.\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 4 4 0 3 3 0\nRow 1: 4 0 0 3 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 3\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 6 6 0\nRow 1: 6 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 6\n\nHmm. The output is 3x3. So maybe the input is being processed in some way to reduce it to 3x3. Let's think about how the input's elements are mapped to the output.\n\nLooking at the output, the numbers are 6s and 0s. The input has 4s, 3s, and 0s. So maybe there's some conversion from the input values to 6s and 0s. But how?\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output is based on the presence of certain numbers in the input. For example, if there's a 4 or 3 in a certain region, it becomes a 6. Or maybe it's about counting the number of non-zero elements in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by looking at certain positions in the input. For example, the output's top-left cell (0,0) might be determined by the input's (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) or something like that. But since the input is 3x6, maybe it's divided into 3x3 regions?\n\nWait, the input is 3 rows by 6 columns. So maybe each 3x3 section of the input is processed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by checking for the presence of certain numbers in specific positions. For example, if there's a 4 in the first row, first column, then the output's (0,0) becomes 6. But looking at example 1's input:\n\nIn the first row of input, the first two elements are 4. So maybe that's why the output's (0,0) is 6. But then the output's (0,1) is 6 as well. Maybe it's looking for consecutive numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the presence of non-zero elements in certain positions. For instance, if there's a non-zero in the first row's first two columns, then the output's (0,0) and (0,1) become 6. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nLooking at example 2's input:\n\nInput:\n4 0 4 3 3 0\n4 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 4 3 0 0\n\nOutput:\n6 6 6\n6 0 0\n6 0 6\n\nSo the output has a lot of 6s. Maybe the presence of any 4 or 3 in certain positions leads to 6 in the output. But how to map that?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output grids. All outputs have 6s and 0s. So maybe the transformation is replacing certain values with 6, and others with 0. But what's the condition?\n\nLooking at example 1's input, the output's (0,0) is 6. The input's (0,0) is 4. The output's (0,1) is 6, which comes from input's (0,1) being 4. The output's (0,2) is 0. Maybe the output is looking for regions where there are certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as being divided into 3x3 blocks. But the input has 6 columns, which is 2x3. So perhaps the input is split into two 3x3 blocks? For example, the first three columns and the last three columns. Then, for each 3x3 block, we process it into a 3x3 output. But how?\n\nBut the output is 3x3, so maybe each input's 3x6 is processed into a 3x3 by some aggregation.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is based on the count of non-zero elements in certain positions. For example, if a cell in the output is 6 if there's at least one non-zero in the corresponding input positions, else 0. But how to map the 3x6 input to 3x3 output?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by looking at each 2x2 region in the input and doing some operation. But the input is 3 rows, so maybe 2x2 regions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by looking at the first three columns and the last three columns of the input. For example, for each cell in the output, check if there's a non-zero in the corresponding position of the input's first three columns or the last three columns.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about example 1's output. The output's first row is 6 6 0. Let's see:\n\nIn the input's first row (columns 0-5): 4,4,0,3,3,0. So for the first output row, maybe the first two columns of the input's first row are non-zero (so 4 and 4), hence 6. Then the third column in the output is 0, perhaps because the third column in the input's first row is 0. But how does that fit with the rest?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each cell in the output grid, we look at the corresponding positions in the input's first three columns and the last three columns. For example, the output's (0,0) is 6 if there's a non-zero in the input's (0,0) or (0,3) (since 0,3 is the first column of the second half). But in example 1, input (0,0) is 4, so that's non-zero, hence 6. Similarly, output (0,1) would check (0,1) and (0,4). Both are 4 and 3, non-zero. So 6. Output (0,2) would check (0,2) and (0,5), which are 0 and 0. So 0. That would explain the first row of output.\n\nThen for the second row of output: (1,0) would check input (1,0) and (1,3). Input (1,0) is 4, (1,3) is 3. Both non-zero, so 6. (1,1) checks (1,1) and (1,4): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (1,2) checks (1,2) and (1,5): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. So output row 1 is 6 0 0. Which matches example 1's output.\n\nThird row of output: (2,0) checks input (2,0) and (2,3). Input (2,0) is 0, (2,3) is 0 \u2192 0? But example 1's output third row is 0 0 6. Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, the third row of output is 0 0 6. So for (2,2), it would check (2,2) and (2,5). Input (2,2) is 0, (2,5) is 3. So non-zero \u2192 6. So that would fit. But for (2,0) and (2,1), they would check (2,0) and (2,3) (0 and 0) \u2192 0. (2,1) checks (2,1) and (2,4) \u2192 0 and 0 \u2192 0. So the third row would be 0 0 6. Which matches. So this seems to fit example 1.\n\nLet me check example 2's input. Input is:\n\nRow 0: 4 0 4 3 3 0\nRow 1: 4 0 0 3 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 4 3 0 0\n\nOutput is:\n\n6 6 6\n6 0 0\n6 0 6\n\nSo for output row 0, (0,0) checks input (0,0) and (0,3) \u2192 4 and 3 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. (0,1) checks (0,1) and (0,4): 0 and 3 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. (0,2) checks (0,2) and (0,5): 4 and 0 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. So first row is 6 6 6. Which matches.\n\nSecond row (1,0): (1,0) and (1,3): 4 and 3 \u2192 6. (1,1): (1,1) and (1,4): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (1,2): (1,2) and (1,5): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. So second row is 6 0 0. Which matches.\n\nThird row (2,0): (2,0) and (2,3): 0 and 3 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. (2,1): (2,1) and (2,4): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (2,2): (2,2) and (2,5): 4 and 0 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. So third row is 6 0 6. Which matches the example 2's output. So this seems to fit.\n\nLet me check example 3. Input:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 4 0 3 0\nRow 1: 0 4 4 3 0 3\nRow 2: 4 4 0 0 0 3\n\nOutput:\n0 6 6\n6 6 6\n6 6 6\n\nSo for output row 0:\n\n(0,0) checks (0,0) and (0,3): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (0,1) checks (0,1) and (0,4): 0 and 3 \u2192 3 is non-zero \u2192 6. (0,2) checks (0,2) and (0,5): 4 and 0 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. So first row is 0 6 6. Which matches.\n\nSecond row (1,0): (1,0) and (1,3): 0 and 3 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. (1,1): (1,1) and (1,4): 4 and 0 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. (1,2): (1,2) and (1,5): 4 and 3 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. So second row is 6 6 6. Which matches.\n\nThird row (2,0): (2,0) and (2,3): 4 and 0 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. (2,1): (2,1) and (2,4): 4 and 0 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. (2,2): (2,2) and (2,5): 0 and 3 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. So third row is 6 6 6. Which matches the output. So this seems to fit.\n\nAnother example: example 4's input:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 4 4 0 3 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 3\nRow 2: 4 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n6 6 0\n0 0 6\n6 0 0\n\nLet's check:\n\nOutput row 0:\n\n(0,0) checks (0,0) and (0,3): 4 and 3 \u2192 6. (0,1): (0,1) and (0,4): 4 and 0 \u2192 6. (0,2): (0,2) and (0,5): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. So first row 6 6 0. Correct.\n\nRow 1:\n\n(1,0): (1,0) and (1,3): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (1,1): (1,1) and (1,4): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (1,2): (1,2) and (1,5): 0 and 3 \u2192 6. So row is 0 0 6. Which matches.\n\nRow 2:\n\n(2,0): (2,0) and (2,3): 4 and 0 \u2192 6. (2,1): (2,1) and (2,4): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (2,2): (2,2) and (2,5): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. So row is 6 0 0. Which matches the output. So this seems to fit.\n\nExample 5's input:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 3 0\nRow 1: 4 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 4 3 3 0\n\nOutput:\n0 6 0\n6 0 0\n6 6 6\n\nLet's check:\n\nOutput row 0:\n\n(0,0): (0,0) and (0,3): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (0,1): (0,1) and (0,4): 0 and 3 \u2192 6. (0,2): (0,2) and (0,5): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. So row 0: 0 6 0. Correct.\n\nRow 1:\n\n(1,0): (1,0) and (1,3): 4 and 0 \u2192 6. (1,1): (1,1) and (1,4): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (1,2): (1,2) and (1,5): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. So row 1: 6 0 0. Correct.\n\nRow 2:\n\n(2,0): (2,0) and (2,3): 0 and 0 \u2192 0? But output row 2 is 6 6 6. Wait, what's the input for row 2?\n\nRow 2: 0 0 4 3 3 0. So (2,0) is 0, (2,3) is 3. So (2,0) checks 0 and 3 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. (2,1): (2,1) and (2,4): 0 and 3 \u2192 6. (2,2): (2,2) and (2,5): 4 and 0 \u2192 6. So row 2 is 6 6 6. Which matches the output. So yes, this seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each cell (i,j) in the output grid, check if either the input cell (i,j) or the input cell (i, j+3) is non-zero. If at least one is non-zero, then output 6, else 0.\n\nWait, but the input has 6 columns. So for each output cell (i,j), the input positions are (i, j) and (i, j+3). Because j can be 0,1,2. For example, j=0: columns 0 and 3. j=1: columns 1 and 4. j=2: columns 2 and 5.\n\nYes. So for each output cell (i,j), we look at the input's (i,j) and (i,j+3). If either is non-zero, then output 6, else 0.\n\nThat seems to fit all the examples. So the transformation is: for each row in the input, and for each column in 0-2, check if the cell in the same row and column, or the same row and column +3 is non-zero. If yes, output 6, else 0.\n\nSo the code would need to process the input grid (which is 3x6) into a 3x3 grid. For each row in the input, and for each j in 0,1,2, check if grid[i][j] or grid[i][j+3] is non-zero. Then set the output cell (i,j) to 6 if so, else 0.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0 or grid[i][j+3] != 0:\n                output[i][j] = 6\n            else:\n                output[i][j] = 0\n    return output\n\nWait, but let me check example 3's input. For example, in row 0, j=0: input is 0 and 0 (columns 0 and 3). So output is 0. Which matches the first row of example 3's output. Then for j=1, input is 0 and 3 (columns 1 and 4) \u2192 3 is non-zero \u2192 6. And j=2: input is 4 (column 2) and 0 (column 5) \u2192 4 is non-zero \u2192 6. So first row is 0 6 6. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So this seems to be the correct pattern.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 4 4 3 0 0\n4 0 0 3 3 0\n0 4 0 3 0 0\n\nSo for each row:\n\nRow 0: [0,4,4,3,0,0]\n\nFor output row 0:\n\nj=0: check 0 and 3 (columns 0 and 3) \u2192 3 is non-zero \u2192 6.\n\nj=1: check 4 (column 1) and 0 (column 4) \u2192 4 is non-zero \u2192 6.\n\nj=2: check 4 (column 2) and 0 (column 5) \u2192 4 is non-zero \u2192 6. So output row 0 is [6,6,6].\n\nRow 1: [4,0,0,3,3,0]\n\nj=0: 4 (col 0) and 3 (col 3) \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6.\n\nj=1: 0 (col 1) and 3 (col 4) \u2192 3 \u2192 6.\n\nj=2: 0 (col 2) and 0 (col 5) \u2192 0. So output row 1 is [6,6,0].\n\nRow 2: [0,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nj=0: 0 (col 0) and 3 (col 3) \u2192 3 \u2192 6.\n\nj=1: 4 (col 1) and 0 (col 4) \u2192 4 \u2192 6.\n\nj=2: 0 (col 2) and 0 (col 5) \u2192 0. So output row 2 is [6,6,0].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n6 6 6\n\n6 6 0\n\n6 6 0\n\nBut I need to write the code. So the code is as described.\n\nBut wait, the code as written would check for grid[i][j] or grid[i][j+3]. So for each row i, and columns 0-2.\n\nYes. So the code should work.\n\nSo the Python function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0 or grid[i][j+3] != 0:\n                row.append(6)\n            else:\n                row.append(0)\n        result.append(row)\n    return result\n\nYes. That should do it. Let me check the examples again.\n\nYes, all examples fit this logic. So this should be the correct transformation.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are five training examples, each with an input grid and an output grid. My job is to find out what transformation is happening from input to output.\n\nLet me start by looking at the examples one by one.\n\nExample 1:\nInput is a 3x6 grid. The output is a 3x3 grid. Let me write down the input and output.\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 4 4 0 3 3 0\nRow 1: 4 0 0 3 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 3\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 6 6 0\nRow 1: 6 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 6\n\nHmm. The output is 3x3. So maybe the input is being processed in some way to reduce it to 3x3. Let's think about how the input's elements are mapped to the output.\n\nLooking at the output, the numbers are 6s and 0s. The input has 4s, 3s, and 0s. So maybe there's some conversion from the input values to 6s and 0s. But how?\n\nAnother thought: maybe the output is based on the presence of certain numbers in the input. For example, if there's a 4 or 3 in a certain region, it becomes a 6. Or maybe it's about counting the number of non-zero elements in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by looking at certain positions in the input. For example, the output's top-left cell (0,0) might be determined by the input's (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) or something like that. But since the input is 3x6, maybe it's divided into 3x3 regions?\n\nWait, the input is 3 rows by 6 columns. So maybe each 3x3 section of the input is processed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by checking for the presence of certain numbers in specific positions. For example, if there's a 4 in the first row, first column, then the output's (0,0) becomes 6. But looking at example 1's input:\n\nIn the first row of input, the first two elements are 4. So maybe that's why the output's (0,0) is 6. But then the output's (0,1) is 6 as well. Maybe it's looking for consecutive numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the presence of non-zero elements in certain positions. For instance, if there's a non-zero in the first row's first two columns, then the output's (0,0) and (0,1) become 6. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nLooking at example 2's input:\n\nInput:\n4 0 4 3 3 0\n4 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 4 3 0 0\n\nOutput:\n6 6 6\n6 0 0\n6 0 6\n\nSo the output has a lot of 6s. Maybe the presence of any 4 or 3 in certain positions leads to 6 in the output. But how to map that?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output grids. All outputs have 6s and 0s. So maybe the transformation is replacing certain values with 6, and others with 0. But what's the condition?\n\nLooking at example 1's input, the output's (0,0) is 6. The input's (0,0) is 4. The output's (0,1) is 6, which comes from input's (0,1) being 4. The output's (0,2) is 0. Maybe the output is looking for regions where there are certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, think of the input as being divided into 3x3 blocks. But the input has 6 columns, which is 2x3. So perhaps the input is split into two 3x3 blocks? For example, the first three columns and the last three columns. Then, for each 3x3 block, we process it into a 3x3 output. But how?\n\nBut the output is 3x3, so maybe each input's 3x6 is processed into a 3x3 by some aggregation.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is based on the count of non-zero elements in certain positions. For example, if a cell in the output is 6 if there's at least one non-zero in the corresponding input positions, else 0. But how to map the 3x6 input to 3x3 output?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by looking at each 2x2 region in the input and doing some operation. But the input is 3 rows, so maybe 2x2 regions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by looking at the first three columns and the last three columns of the input. For example, for each cell in the output, check if there's a non-zero in the corresponding position of the input's first three columns or the last three columns.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet me think about example 1's output. The output's first row is 6 6 0. Let's see:\n\nIn the input's first row (columns 0-5): 4,4,0,3,3,0. So for the first output row, maybe the first two columns of the input's first row are non-zero (so 4 and 4), hence 6. Then the third column in the output is 0, perhaps because the third column in the input's first row is 0. But how does that fit with the rest?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each cell in the output grid, we look at the corresponding positions in the input's first three columns and the last three columns. For example, the output's (0,0) is 6 if there's a non-zero in the input's (0,0) or (0,3) (since 0,3 is the first column of the second half). But in example 1, input (0,0) is 4, so that's non-zero, hence 6. Similarly, output (0,1) would check (0,1) and (0,4). Both are 4 and 3, non-zero. So 6. Output (0,2) would check (0,2) and (0,5), which are 0 and 0. So 0. That would explain the first row of output.\n\nThen for the second row of output: (1,0) would check input (1,0) and (1,3). Input (1,0) is 4, (1,3) is 3. Both non-zero, so 6. (1,1) checks (1,1) and (1,4): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (1,2) checks (1,2) and (1,5): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. So output row 1 is 6 0 0. Which matches example 1's output.\n\nThird row of output: (2,0) checks input (2,0) and (2,3). Input (2,0) is 0, (2,3) is 0 \u2192 0? But example 1's output third row is 0 0 6. Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, the third row of output is 0 0 6. So for (2,2), it would check (2,2) and (2,5). Input (2,2) is 0, (2,5) is 3. So non-zero \u2192 6. So that would fit. But for (2,0) and (2,1), they would check (2,0) and (2,3) (0 and 0) \u2192 0. (2,1) checks (2,1) and (2,4) \u2192 0 and 0 \u2192 0. So the third row would be 0 0 6. Which matches. So this seems to fit example 1.\n\nLet me check example 2's input. Input is:\n\nRow 0: 4 0 4 3 3 0\nRow 1: 4 0 0 3 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 4 3 0 0\n\nOutput is:\n\n6 6 6\n6 0 0\n6 0 6\n\nSo for output row 0, (0,0) checks input (0,0) and (0,3) \u2192 4 and 3 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. (0,1) checks (0,1) and (0,4): 0 and 3 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. (0,2) checks (0,2) and (0,5): 4 and 0 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. So first row is 6 6 6. Which matches.\n\nSecond row (1,0): (1,0) and (1,3): 4 and 3 \u2192 6. (1,1): (1,1) and (1,4): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (1,2): (1,2) and (1,5): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. So second row is 6 0 0. Which matches.\n\nThird row (2,0): (2,0) and (2,3): 0 and 3 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. (2,1): (2,1) and (2,4): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (2,2): (2,2) and (2,5): 4 and 0 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. So third row is 6 0 6. Which matches the example 2's output. So this seems to fit.\n\nLet me check example 3. Input:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 4 0 3 0\nRow 1: 0 4 4 3 0 3\nRow 2: 4 4 0 0 0 3\n\nOutput:\n0 6 6\n6 6 6\n6 6 6\n\nSo for output row 0:\n\n(0,0) checks (0,0) and (0,3): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (0,1) checks (0,1) and (0,4): 0 and 3 \u2192 3 is non-zero \u2192 6. (0,2) checks (0,2) and (0,5): 4 and 0 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. So first row is 0 6 6. Which matches.\n\nSecond row (1,0): (1,0) and (1,3): 0 and 3 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. (1,1): (1,1) and (1,4): 4 and 0 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. (1,2): (1,2) and (1,5): 4 and 3 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. So second row is 6 6 6. Which matches.\n\nThird row (2,0): (2,0) and (2,3): 4 and 0 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. (2,1): (2,1) and (2,4): 4 and 0 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. (2,2): (2,2) and (2,5): 0 and 3 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. So third row is 6 6 6. Which matches the output. So this seems to fit.\n\nAnother example: example 4's input:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 4 4 0 3 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 3\nRow 2: 4 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n6 6 0\n0 0 6\n6 0 0\n\nLet's check:\n\nOutput row 0:\n\n(0,0) checks (0,0) and (0,3): 4 and 3 \u2192 6. (0,1): (0,1) and (0,4): 4 and 0 \u2192 6. (0,2): (0,2) and (0,5): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. So first row 6 6 0. Correct.\n\nRow 1:\n\n(1,0): (1,0) and (1,3): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (1,1): (1,1) and (1,4): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (1,2): (1,2) and (1,5): 0 and 3 \u2192 6. So row is 0 0 6. Which matches.\n\nRow 2:\n\n(2,0): (2,0) and (2,3): 4 and 0 \u2192 6. (2,1): (2,1) and (2,4): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (2,2): (2,2) and (2,5): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. So row is 6 0 0. Which matches the output. So this seems to fit.\n\nExample 5's input:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 3 0\nRow 1: 4 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 4 3 3 0\n\nOutput:\n0 6 0\n6 0 0\n6 6 6\n\nLet's check:\n\nOutput row 0:\n\n(0,0): (0,0) and (0,3): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (0,1): (0,1) and (0,4): 0 and 3 \u2192 6. (0,2): (0,2) and (0,5): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. So row 0: 0 6 0. Correct.\n\nRow 1:\n\n(1,0): (1,0) and (1,3): 4 and 0 \u2192 6. (1,1): (1,1) and (1,4): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. (1,2): (1,2) and (1,5): 0 and 0 \u2192 0. So row 1: 6 0 0. Correct.\n\nRow 2:\n\n(2,0): (2,0) and (2,3): 0 and 0 \u2192 0? But output row 2 is 6 6 6. Wait, what's the input for row 2?\n\nRow 2: 0 0 4 3 3 0. So (2,0) is 0, (2,3) is 3. So (2,0) checks 0 and 3 \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6. (2,1): (2,1) and (2,4): 0 and 3 \u2192 6. (2,2): (2,2) and (2,5): 4 and 0 \u2192 6. So row 2 is 6 6 6. Which matches the output. So yes, this seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each cell (i,j) in the output grid, check if either the input cell (i,j) or the input cell (i, j+3) is non-zero. If at least one is non-zero, then output 6, else 0.\n\nWait, but the input has 6 columns. So for each output cell (i,j), the input positions are (i, j) and (i, j+3). Because j can be 0,1,2. For example, j=0: columns 0 and 3. j=1: columns 1 and 4. j=2: columns 2 and 5.\n\nYes. So for each output cell (i,j), we look at the input's (i,j) and (i,j+3). If either is non-zero, then output 6, else 0.\n\nThat seems to fit all the examples. So the transformation is: for each row in the input, and for each column in 0-2, check if the cell in the same row and column, or the same row and column +3 is non-zero. If yes, output 6, else 0.\n\nSo the code would need to process the input grid (which is 3x6) into a 3x3 grid. For each row in the input, and for each j in 0,1,2, check if grid[i][j] or grid[i][j+3] is non-zero. Then set the output cell (i,j) to 6 if so, else 0.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0 or grid[i][j+3] != 0:\n                output[i][j] = 6\n            else:\n                output[i][j] = 0\n    return output\n\nWait, but let me check example 3's input. For example, in row 0, j=0: input is 0 and 0 (columns 0 and 3). So output is 0. Which matches the first row of example 3's output. Then for j=1, input is 0 and 3 (columns 1 and 4) \u2192 3 is non-zero \u2192 6. And j=2: input is 4 (column 2) and 0 (column 5) \u2192 4 is non-zero \u2192 6. So first row is 0 6 6. Which is correct.\n\nYes. So this seems to be the correct pattern.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 4 4 3 0 0\n4 0 0 3 3 0\n0 4 0 3 0 0\n\nSo for each row:\n\nRow 0: [0,4,4,3,0,0]\n\nFor output row 0:\n\nj=0: check 0 and 3 (columns 0 and 3) \u2192 3 is non-zero \u2192 6.\n\nj=1: check 4 (column 1) and 0 (column 4) \u2192 4 is non-zero \u2192 6.\n\nj=2: check 4 (column 2) and 0 (column 5) \u2192 4 is non-zero \u2192 6. So output row 0 is [6,6,6].\n\nRow 1: [4,0,0,3,3,0]\n\nj=0: 4 (col 0) and 3 (col 3) \u2192 non-zero \u2192 6.\n\nj=1: 0 (col 1) and 3 (col 4) \u2192 3 \u2192 6.\n\nj=2: 0 (col 2) and 0 (col 5) \u2192 0. So output row 1 is [6,6,0].\n\nRow 2: [0,4,0,3,0,0]\n\nj=0: 0 (col 0) and 3 (col 3) \u2192 3 \u2192 6.\n\nj=1: 4 (col 1) and 0 (col 4) \u2192 4 \u2192 6.\n\nj=2: 0 (col 2) and 0 (col 5) \u2192 0. So output row 2 is [6,6,0].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n6 6 6\n\n6 6 0\n\n6 6 0\n\nBut I need to write the code. So the code is as described.\n\nBut wait, the code as written would check for grid[i][j] or grid[i][j+3]. So for each row i, and columns 0-2.\n\nYes. So the code should work.\n\nSo the Python function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0 or grid[i][j+3] != 0:\n                row.append(6)\n            else:\n                row.append(0)\n        result.append(row)\n    return result\n\nYes. That should do it. Let me check the examples again.\n\nYes, all examples fit this logic. So this should be the correct transformation.\n"
