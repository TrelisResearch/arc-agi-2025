In Example 1, the output grid has 2s replacing some 5s and 0s, and 1s replacing some 0s in certain positions.\n2. In Example 2, similar patterns are observed with 2s replacing some 5s and 0s, and 1s replacing some 0s.\n3. In Example 3, the pattern is similar with 2s replacing some 5s and 0s, and 1s replacing some 0s in certain positions.\n\nA possible pattern is:\n- Replace 5s with 2s in certain positions\n- Replace 0s with 1s in certain positions\n- Keep other values unchanged\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces 5s with 2s and 0s with 1s in certain positions, based on their positions in the grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for col in row:\n            if col == 5:\n                new_row.append(2)\n            elif col == 0:\n                new_row.append(1)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(col)\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 2, similar transformations occur, with values being replaced by 2 and 1 in specific patterns.\n3. In Example 3, the transformation involves replacing values with 2 in certain positions and 1 in others.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain values with 2 in specific patterns\n- Replacing other values with 1 in specific patterns\n- The transformation seems to be based on the position of the values in the grid\n\nBased on this, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with 2 and 1 based on their position in the grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 5:\n                new_row.append(2)\n            elif val == 0:\n                new_row.append(1)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n```",

In Example 2, similar patterns are observed with 2s replacing some 5s and 0s, and 1s replacing some 0s.\n3.
