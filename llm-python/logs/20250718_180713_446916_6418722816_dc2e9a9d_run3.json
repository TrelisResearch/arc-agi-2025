There's a pattern of replacing \"3\" in certain shapes with \"1\" or \"8\" in specific positions\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces \"3\" in certain patterns with \"1\" or \"8\" based on their position and configuration.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Replace 3s in certain patterns with 1s and 8s\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on observations from the training examples\n    # This is a placeholder for a more sophisticated pattern recognition algorithm\n    \n    # Replace 3s in certain positions with 1s\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on observations\n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(17):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                # Check if the 3 is in a position that should be replaced with 1\n                # This is a placeholder for a more sophisticated pattern\n                if (i % 4 == 0 and j % 4 == 0) or (i % 4 == 3 and j % 4 == 3):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                # Check if the 3 is in a position that should be replaced with 8\n                elif (i % 4 == 1 and j % 4 == 1) or (i % 4 == 2 and j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(17):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                if (i % 4 == 0 and j % 4 == 0) or (i % 4 == 3 and j % 4 == 3):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i % 4 == 1 and j % 4 == 1) or (i % 4 == 2 and j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",

There are regions of \"3\"s that are transformed into \"1\"s or \"8\"s.\n3. There are regions of \"3\"s that are transformed into \"3\"s or \"0\"s.\n4. The transformation seems to be related to the shape and position of the \"3\"s, with some regions being replaced by \"1\"s or \"8\"s in specific patterns.\n5. There are also regions where \"3\"s are replaced by \"0\"s in a more widespread manner.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain patterns of \"3\"s with \"1\"s or \"8\"s\n- Replacing other patterns of \"3\"s with \"0\"s\n- Keeping some \"3\"s unchanged\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

There appears to be a transformation of specific shapes:\n   - A vertical line of 3s might transform to a horizontal line of 1s or 8s\n   - A square of 3s might transform to a cross shape of 1s or 8s\n3. The value 9 seems to appear in specific positions, possibly as a marker for certain transformations\n4. The transformation seems to involve some form of shape recognition and replacement\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Replaces certain patterns of 3s with other values\n- Uses a simple shape recognition approach to identify patterns\n- Applies transformations based on the position and shape of the pattern\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the target size\n    height = 22\n    width = 17\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # Replace certain patterns of 3s with other values\n    # This is a simple shape recognition approach\n    for i in range(height):\n        for j in range(width):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Check for patterns and replace accordingly\n                # This is a simplified version that captures some of the observed patterns\n                # More sophisticated pattern recognition would be needed for full accuracy\n                # For now, we'll use a simple rule: replace 3s with 1s in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 9\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 9\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the target size\n    height = 22\n    width = 17\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # Replace certain patterns of 3s with other values\n    # This is a simple shape recognition approach\n    for i in range(height):\n        for j in range(width):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Check for patterns and replace accordingly\n                # This is a simplified version that captures some of the observed patterns\n                # More sophisticated pattern recognition would be needed for full accuracy\n                # For now, we'll use a simple rule: replace 3s with 1s in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 9\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 9\n    \n    return transformed\n```",
