              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to write a Python function that transforms the input grid to the output grid. Let's start by analyzing the examples provided.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput grid has 5s in certain positions, and the output grid has 1s and 2s. The output seems to be based on some rule that depends on the number of 5s in a certain region or in a certain way. For instance, the output cells are 1s or 2s where the input has 5s, but the exact rules are not obvious.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\nThe input has 5s arranged in various lines and colors, and the output has 1s and 2s. The output seems to be different based on the distance from the nearest 5 in a certain direction. For example, cells adjacent to 5s might be 1s, and cells further away might be 2s. Or maybe it's based on the number of 5s in a diagonal or row.\n\nExample 3:\nOutput has 1s and 2s based on the positions of 5s. It seems like the output depends on the minimum distance to the nearest 5 in specific diagonals or directions. For instance, if the cell is in the main diagonal, maybe the value is 1, and in the anti-diagonal, it's 2. Or maybe it's based on the parity of the sum of coordinates.\n\nWait, looking at the output for Example 1, let's look at the output coordinates where the value is 2. For example, in row 0, column 2, 3, 4 are 2s. But in the input grid for example 1, the 5s are in columns 2-4 of rows 2-3, and in rows 5-8, columns 6-7. The output 2s in those columns might be related to the nearest 5 in a specific diagonal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the minimum number of steps from the cell to the nearest 5 in the same diagonal. For example, if the cell is on the main diagonal (row - column = 0), then the output is 1, and if it's on the anti-diagonal (row + column = 7), then it's 2. \n\nLooking at the output in example 1 for cell (6, 6), which is 2. The input cell (5, 6) is 5. So the distance is 1 step. But output is 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit the idea of distance. Maybe it's based on the number of 5s in a certain direction, like the number of 5s along the main or anti-diagonal.\n\nIn example 1, the output cell (7, 1) is 1. Input cell (7, 1) is 5? Wait no. Wait in example 1, the input grid has 5s in certain positions. Let me check example 1's input again. \n\nExample 1 input:\nRow 0: all zeros except row 2,3 have 5s in columns 2-4.\nRow 5,6,7,8 have 5s in specific columns. \n\nBut the output for example 1 has output cell (0,2) as 2. But input cell (0,2) is 0. So how is that determined? It's not directly from the input cell value. So the output is not based on the input cell's value, but rather based on the nearest 5 in certain directions. \n\nAnother idea: for each cell in the output grid, the value is 1 if it's on the main diagonal (row - col == 0) and the nearest 5 is in a certain way, else 2. But I need to find the pattern.\n\nLooking at example 1's output (row 0, column 2 is 2). The nearest 5 is in row 2, column 2. The difference in rows is 2, and columns is 0. So the distance is 2 steps. So if the output is 1 or 2 based on the parity of the distance? Or maybe based on the sum of the steps in row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of 5s in a specific area. For example, if the cell is in a region where there are multiple 5s, the output is 1, else 2. But that seems too vague.\n\nLooking at example 3's output. The input has 5s in various positions, and the output has 1s and 2s. For example, in the output grid, cells on the main diagonal (row - col = 0) are 1s. The anti-diagonal (row + col = 7) cells are 2s. For example, cell (0,0) is 1, (1,1) is 1, (2,2) is 1, (3,3) is 1, (4,4) is 2, (5,5) is 2, (6,6) is 2, (7,7) is 2, (8,8) is 1. Wait, that's inconsistent. Wait in example 3's output, (4,4) is 2, but (8,8) is 1. That suggests that the parity of the sum of row and column (row + col) determines the output. For example, if row + col is even, output is 1; if odd, output is 2. Let's check:\n\nFor example 1's output: (0,2) sum is 2, even \u2192 output 2. (0, 2) is 2, which matches. (4,4) sum is 8 even \u2192 output 2, but in example 1's output, (4,4) is 0. So that idea doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, in example 1's output, cell (4,4) is 0. So that pattern is not the case. So that approach is invalid.\n\nAlternative idea: the output value is determined by the number of 5s in the input grid that are in the same diagonal as the current cell.\n\nBut that's too vague. Hmm.\n\nAnother approach: for each cell (r,c) in the output grid, the value is 1 if there is at least one 5 in the same diagonal (r - c = k) and the input cell (r,c) is 0, otherwise 2. Or something similar.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 1 if the cell is on the main diagonal and the nearest 5 is in the main diagonal, and 2 if it's on the anti-diagonal and the nearest 5 is in the anti-diagonal. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, the output is determined by the parity of the number of 5s in the main or anti-diagonal that lie within certain bounds. This is getting complicated.\n\nWait, looking at example 1's output: the output is 2 in cells that are in the same column as some 5s but not in the same row. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The input has 5s in various places, and the output has 1s and 2s. For example, in the output grid, cell (0, 0) is 0. But in the input grid, (0,0) is 0. So the output is 0 here. So perhaps the output is determined by whether the input cell is 5 or not. No, but in example 1, the input cell (0,2) is 0, but the output is 2. So the output isn't directly based on the input cell's value.\n\nWait, the output is 0 for cells where the input is 0 and no 5s are in a certain diagonal. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the output is determined by the nearest 5 in the main diagonal (r - c = k) or anti-diagonal (r + c = m). For example, if the nearest 5 is in the main diagonal, then output is 1 if the distance is even, else 2? Or the other way around?\n\nAlternatively, the output is 1 if the cell is in the main diagonal and there's a 5 in the same main diagonal, 2 if in the anti-diagonal and there's a 5 in the same anti-diagonal, and 0 otherwise. But then in example 3, cell (0,0) is on main diagonal and input has a 5 in (0,0). So output is 1. Cell (1,1) is main diagonal, and input has 5 in (1,1)? Wait in example 3's input, row 0 has 5 in (0,0), (0,2), (0,5), (0,8). Row 1 has 5 in (1,1), (1,4), (1,5). So cell (1,1) in input is 5, so output is 1. Cell (4,4) in input is 0. So output is 0. But in example 3's output, (4,4) is 2. So that contradicts the idea.\n\nThis is getting too complicated."

The output seems to be based on some rule that depends on the number of 5s in a certain region or in a certain way. For instance, the output cells are 1s or 2s where the input has 5s, but the exact rules are not obvious.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\nThe input has 5s arranged in various lines and colors, and the output has 1s and 2s.

It seems like the output depends on the minimum distance to the nearest 5 in specific diagonals or directions. For instance, if the cell is in the main diagonal, maybe the value is 1, and in the anti-diagonal, it's 2. Or maybe it's based on the parity of the sum of coordinates.\n\nWait, looking at the output for Example 1, let's look at the output coordinates where the value is 2. For example, in row 0, column 2, 3, 4 are 2s. But in the input grid for example 1, the 5s are in columns 2-4 of rows 2-3, and in rows 5-8, columns 6-7. The output 2s in those columns might be related to the nearest 5 in a specific diagonal. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the minimum number of steps from the cell to the nearest 5 in the same diagonal. For example, if the cell is on the main diagonal (row - column = 0), then the output is 1, and if it's on the anti-diagonal (row + column = 7), then it's 2. \n\nLooking at the output in example 1 for cell (6, 6), which is 2. The input cell (5, 6) is 5. So the distance is 1 step. But output is 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit the idea of distance. Maybe it's based on the number of 5s in a certain direction, like the number of 5s along the main or anti-diagonal.\n\nIn example 1, the output cell (7, 1) is 1. Input cell (7, 1) is 5? Wait no. Wait in example 1, the input grid has 5s in certain positions. Let me check example 1's input again. \n\nExample 1 input:\nRow 0: all zeros except row 2,3 have 5s in columns 2-4.\nRow 5,6,7,8 have 5s in specific columns. \n\nBut the output for example 1 has output cell (0,2) as 2. But input cell (0,2) is 0. So how is that determined? It's not directly from the input cell value.

The input has 5s in various positions, and the output has 1s and 2s. For example, in the output grid, cells on the main diagonal (row - col = 0) are 1s. The anti-diagonal (row + col = 7) cells are 2s. For example, cell (0,0) is 1, (1,1) is 1, (2,2) is 1, (3,3) is 1, (4,4) is 2, (5,5) is 2, (6,6) is 2, (7,7) is 2, (8,8) is 1.
