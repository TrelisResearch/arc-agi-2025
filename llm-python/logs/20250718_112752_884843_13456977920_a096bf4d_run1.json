The input and output grids have a similar structure with 0s forming borders and other numbers in the middle.\n2. In Example 1, the number 4 appears in the input and is replaced with 4 in the output.\n3. In Example 2, the number 6 appears in the input and is replaced with 6 in the output.\n4. In Example 3, the number 7 appears in the input and is replaced with 7 in the output.\n5. In Example 2, the number 3 appears in the input and is replaced with 3 in the output.\n6. In Example 2, the number 8 appears in the input and is replaced with 8 in the output.\n7. In Example 2, the number 4 appears in the input and is replaced with 4 in the output.\n8. In Example 2, the number 2 appears in the input and is replaced with 2 in the output.\n9. In Example 2, the number 1 appears in the input and is replaced with 1 in the output.\n10. In Example 2, the number 5 appears in the input and is replaced with 5 in the output.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that the transformation is identity - the output grid is the same as the input grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # The transformation is identity - output grid is the same as input grid\n    return [row[:] for row in grid]\n```",
