Specifically, it appears that the output grid is filled with zeros wherever there are certain patterns or values in the input grid.\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the transformation involves:\n1. Identifying regions or patterns in the input grid\n2. Replacing those regions with zeros in the output grid\n3. Leaving the rest of the grid as zeros\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain patterns (like sequences of 5s or 6s) with zeros in the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 output grid filled with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Check for patterns and replace them with zeros\n    # This is a simple pattern detection that looks for sequences of 5s or 6s\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            # Check if the current cell is part of a pattern\n            if grid[row][col] in [5, 6]:\n                # Check if it's part of a horizontal or vertical sequence\n                # This is a simple check for sequences of 3 or more\n                count = 1\n                # Check right\n                for c in range(col + 1, 10):\n                    if grid[row][c] in [5, 6]:\n                        count += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Check left\n                for c in range(col - 1, -1, -1):\n                    if grid[row][c] in [5, 6]:\n                        count += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Check down\n                for r in range(row + 1, 10):\n                    if grid[r][col] in [5, 6]:\n                        count += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Check up\n                for r in range(row - 1, -1, -1):\n                    if grid[r][col] in [5, 6]:\n                        count += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # If it's part of a sequence of 3 or more, replace with zero\n                if count >= 3:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 output grid filled with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Check for patterns and replace them with zeros\n    # This is a simple pattern detection that looks for sequences of 5s or 6s\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            # Check if the current cell is part of a pattern\n            if grid[row][col] in [5, 6]:\n                # Check if it's part of a horizontal or vertical sequence\n                # This is a simple check for sequences of 3 or more\n                count = 1\n                # Check right\n                for c in range(col + 1, 10):\n                    if grid[row][c] in [5, 6]:\n                        count += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Check left\n                for c in range(col - 1, -1, -1):\n                    if grid[row][c] in [5, 6]:\n                        count += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Check down\n                for r in range(row + 1, 10):\n                    if grid[r][col] in [5, 6]:\n                        count += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Check up\n                for r in range(row - 1, -1, -1):\n                    if grid[r][col] in [5, 6]:\n                        count += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # If it's part of a sequence of 3 or more, replace with zero\n                if count >= 3:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "Looking at the training examples, I observe that the transformation seems to involve identifying certain patterns in the input grid and then \"erasing\" or \"blurring\" them in the output grid. Specifically, it appears that the output grid is filled with zeros wherever there are certain patterns or values in the input grid.\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the transformation involves:\n1. Identifying regions or patterns in the input grid\n2. Replacing those regions with zeros in the output grid\n3. Leaving the rest of the grid as zeros\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain patterns (like sequences of 5s or 6s) with zeros in the output grid.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 output grid filled with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Check for patterns and replace them with zeros\n    # This is a simple pattern detection that looks for sequences of 5s or 6s\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            # Check if the current cell is part of a pattern\n            if grid[row][col] in [5, 6]:\n                # Check if it's part of a horizontal or vertical sequence\n                # This is a simple check for sequences of 3 or more\n                count = 1\n                # Check right\n                for c in range(col + 1, 10):\n                    if grid[row][c] in [5, 6]:\n                        count += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Check left\n                for c in range(col - 1, -1, -1):\n                    if grid[row][c] in [5, 6]:\n                        count += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Check down\n                for r in range(row + 1, 10):\n                    if grid[r][col] in [5, 6]:\n                        count += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Check up\n                for r in range(row - 1, -1, -1):\n                    if grid[r][col] in [5, 6]:\n                        count += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # If it's part of a sequence of 3 or more, replace with zero\n                if count >= 3:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 output grid filled with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Check for patterns and replace them with zeros\n    # This is a simple pattern detection that looks for sequences of 5s or 6s\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            # Check if the current cell is part of a pattern\n            if grid[row][col] in [5, 6]:\n                # Check if it's part of a horizontal or vertical sequence\n                # This is a simple check for sequences of 3 or more\n                count = 1\n                # Check right\n                for c in range(col + 1, 10):\n                    if grid[row][c] in [5, 6]:\n                        count += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Check left\n                for c in range(col - 1, -1, -1):\n                    if grid[row][c] in [5, 6]:\n                        count += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Check down\n                for r in range(row + 1, 10):\n                    if grid[r][col] in [5, 6]:\n                        count += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Check up\n                for r in range(row - 1, -1, -1):\n                    if grid[r][col] in [5, 6]:\n                        count += 1\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # If it's part of a sequence of 3 or more, replace with zero\n                if count >= 3:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
