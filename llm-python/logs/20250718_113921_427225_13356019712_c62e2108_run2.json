The transformation seems to involve expanding or extending certain patterns (like the 2s and 3s) in specific ways.\n2. There appears to be a pattern of expanding the 2s and 3s in a way that forms larger blocks or extended lines.\n3. The 1s in the input seem to be transformed into 2s or 3s in the output, depending on their position.\n4. The 4s in the third example seem to be transformed into 3s in the output.\n5. The transformation appears to involve some form of expansion or propagation of values from certain positions to adjacent positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that expands certain values (like 2s and 3s) in a way that forms larger blocks or extended lines.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

The transformation seems to involve expanding or extending certain patterns (like the 2s and 3s) in specific ways.\n2. There appears to be a pattern of expanding the 2s and 3s in a way that forms larger blocks or extended lines.\n3. The 1s in the input seem to be transformed into 2s or 3s in the output, depending on their position.\n4. The 4s in the third example seem to be transformed into 3s in the output.\n5. The transformation appears to involve some form of expansion or propagation of values from certain positions to adjacent positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that expands certain values (like 2s and 3s) in a way that forms larger blocks or extended lines.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
