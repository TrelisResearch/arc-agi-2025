The output grids seem to be formed by repeating or expanding patterns from the input.\n3. In Example 1, the input has a 3x3 grid and the output is a 6x6 grid that appears to be a repetition of the input pattern in a specific way.\n4. In Example 2, the input is 2x2 and the output is 4x4, with a pattern that seems to be a repetition of the input pattern in a checkerboard fashion.\n5. In Example 3, the input is 4x4 and the output is 8x8, with a more complex pattern that appears to be a repetition of the input pattern in a more intricate way.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves repeating the input pattern in a specific way to form a 6x6 output grid.
