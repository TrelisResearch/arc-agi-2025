          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from the input to the output grids. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some 2s, 1s, and 0s. The output seems to have some changes. For instance, in the input, there's a 2 in the second row, second column, and the output has a 2 there. But looking at the third row, the input has a 2 in column 2, and the output has a 2 there too. However, in the third row of the output, there are some 1s where there were 2s in the input. Wait, maybe not. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 2 (second row) is 0 0 2 2 0 0 ... and the output row 2 is 0 0 2 2 0 0 ... same as input. But in the third row of input, there's a 2 in column 2 and 3, but in the output, there's a 2 in column 2, but then 0s and 1s in other positions. Wait, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping certain patterns. Let's look at the output of Example 1. For instance, in the third row of input, there's a 2 in column 2 and 3, but in the output, there's a 2 in column 2, then 0s, then 1s in columns 7 and 8. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has some 8s and 0s. The output seems to have some 8s in the same positions, but also some changes. For example, in the third row of input, there's 0 0 0 8 8 0 ... and in the output, it's 0 0 0 8 8 0 ... same as input. But in another row, like the fourth row of input, there's 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. So the 1 in column 6 is changed to 1, but the 1 in column 8 is changed to 1? Or maybe the 0 in column 7 is changed to 1? Wait, the input row 4 is 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. The output row 4 is 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. So the 0 in column 7 (index 7?) is changed to 1? Or maybe the 0 in column 7 (original input is 0, output is 1). That's a change. Also, the 0 in column 8 (input is 0, output is 1). Hmm, maybe there's some pattern of replacing 0s with 1s in certain positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in Example 2, there's a 1 in the input that becomes a 1 in the output. But in some cases, like the fourth row of input, there's a 1 in column 6 (input) and output, but in column 7 and 8, they change from 0 to 1. Maybe the transformation is that certain positions are being set to 1 if they are in certain regions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about mirroring or flipping certain parts of the grid. Let's look at Example 3. The input has some 3s and 1s. The output seems to have some 3s and 1s, but also some changes. For instance, in the input row 3, there's 0 0 0 3 3 0 ... and in the output, same. But in row 6 of input, there's 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 1 in column 7 (input) is now in column 7 (output) but maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, there are 2s that are replaced with 2s, but some 1s are added. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others, but the exact rules are unclear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, there are some 1s that were not present in the input. For instance, in the third row of the input, there's a 2 in column 2 and 3, but in the output, there are 1s in columns 7 and 8. Maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 1s in certain positions. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, in Example 2, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 8s in the same positions. But in some cases, like the fourth row of input, there's a 1 that becomes a 1, but other positions are changed. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about flipping the grid in some way. For example, in Example 1, the output has some 1s where there were 2s in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has 2s in certain positions, and the output has 2s in the same positions, but also 1s in other positions. Maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 1s in certain positions where there are 2s and 1s in other positions. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking for the positions of the numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has some 1s where the input had 2s. Maybe the transformation is that any 2 in the input becomes a 1 in the output if it's in a certain region. But how to determine that region?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 1s in certain positions, but this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, in Example 2, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 8s in the same positions. But in other parts, like the fourth row, the input has 8s and 1s, and the output has 8s and 1s. Maybe the transformation is to leave 8s as they are, but change other numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in Example 2, the input has a 0 in some positions, and the output has 1s in those positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother approach: looking for the differences between input and output in the training examples.\n\nFor Example 1:\n\nLooking at the input and output for row 2: same as input.\n\nRow 3 input: 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 3: 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in the input, the 1s are in columns 6 and 7 (assuming 0-based index), and in the output, they are in columns 6 and 7, but then there are 1s in columns 10 and 11. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain regions. For example, in the input, there are some 0s that are in positions where the output has 1s. But this is not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input row 4 is:\n\n0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 4:\n\n0 0 0 8 0 1 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the input has 0 in column 7 (index 7?), and the output has 1 there. Also, the input has 0 in column 8 (index 8?), and the output has 1 there. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions where the input had 2s. For example, in the third row of input, there's a 2 in column 2. The output has a 2 in column 2. But in other positions, like column 7 and 8, the input had 1s, and the output has 1s. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 2s with 1s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in Example 2, the input row 4 has 0s in columns 7 and 8, which become 1s in the output. But that's just one example.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the positions where the numbers change. For example, in Example 1, the output has some 1s where the input had 2s. But in other cases, like the fourth row of input, there are 0s that become 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions where the input had 2s. But that's not consistent. For example, in the third row of input, there's a 2 in column 2, and the output has a 2 in column 2. But there's a 1 in column 7 and 8 in the output, which were 1s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions where the input had 2s and 1s. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 1s in certain regions. For example, in the third row of input, there's a 2 in column 2, and the output has a 2 there. But in the same row, there's a 1 in column 6 and 7, which is the same as input. But then there's a 2 in column 15, which is replaced with 2 in the output. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. Let's look for patterns that are common across all examples.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, there are some 1s added where there were 2s. But in Example 2, the 8s are preserved. In Example 3, the 3s are preserved. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, 2s are replaced with 1s in certain positions, but 8s and 3s are left as is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain regions. For example, in Example 2, the input has some 0s that are turned into 1s. But how to determine which regions?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their proximity to certain numbers. For example, if a 0 is adjacent to a 2, it becomes 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that form a cross or a line.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the input has some 3s and 1s. The output has 3s and 1s, but in some cases, the 1s are added. For example, in row 6 of input, there's a 1 in column 16 (assuming 0-based index), and the output has a 1 in column 7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even, then replace 0s with 1s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the third row has 1s in columns 6 and 7. In the input, those positions were 1s. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where there are certain numbers. For example, if a cell is 0 and adjacent to a 2, then replace it with 1.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 1s where the input had 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 3, the input has a 2 in column 2, but in the output, it's still 2. However, in the same row, there's a 1 in column 6 and 7, which is the same as input. But in the output row 3, there are 1s in columns 10 and 11. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions where there are 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions that are surrounded by 2s. For example, in the input, if a 0 is surrounded by 2s, it becomes a 1.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their distance from certain patterns. For example, in the input, if a 0 is in a certain area, it becomes 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the input has a certain pattern. For example, in Example 2, the fourth row of input has 0s in columns 7 and 8, which become 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where there are 8s in the input.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where there are 2s in the input. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the input has a 2 in the same row or column. But again, not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. But the problem says that the output must be 23x25. So the transformation must produce a grid of that size.\n\nGiven that the examples have different transformations, perhaps the pattern is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their proximity to certain numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the input has a certain pattern. For example, in the input, if a cell is 0 and is in a row where there are 2s, then replace it with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain regions. For example, in the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in the output of Example 1, there are 1s in positions that form a cross.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say. Given the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nLet me think of a possible transformation that could work for all examples. For example, replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in the input, if a cell is 0 and is in a row that has a 2, then replace it with 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the input has a 2 in the same row or column. For example, if a 0 is in a row that has a 2, then replace it with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the input has a 2 in the same row or column. Let's test this hypothesis against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the third row of input has a 2 in column 2. The output has 1s in columns 10 and 11. If the 0s in those positions are in the same row as a 2, then they would be replaced. But in the input, the third row has a 2 in column 2, and the 0s in columns 10 and 11 are in the same row. So according to this hypothesis, those 0s would be replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the fourth row of input has 0s in columns 7 and 8. The input row has 8s in columns 3 and 4. So if the 0s are in the same row as 8s, they are replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3s in certain positions. The output has 3s in the same positions. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column has certain numbers.\n\nBut how to implement this. For example, for each cell in the input, if the cell is 0, and there is a 2 in the same row or column, then replace it with 1. Otherwise, leave it as 0.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's see if it works for the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, the input has a 2 in column 2. The 0s in columns 10 and 11 are in the same row as the 2, so they become 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2's fourth row, the input has 8s in columns 3 and 4. The 0s in columns 7 and 8 are in the same row as the 8s, so they become 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3s in certain positions. The output has 3s in the same positions. So for those cells, they are not 0, so they are left as is. For cells that are 0, if they are in a row or column with a 3, they are replaced with 1. But in Example 3's input, the third row has 3s in columns 3 and 4. The output of that row has 3s in the same positions. So the 0s in other positions may be replaced if they are in the same row or column as 3s.\n\nBut how to test this. For example, in Example 3's input, row 3 is 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 1 in column 13 of the input is replaced with 0. But according to the hypothesis, if the row has a 3, then 0s in that row would be replaced with 1s. But the input has a 1 in column 13 of that row, which is not 0. So the hypothesis may not apply here.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the input has a 2 in the same row or column. But for Example 3, the input has 3s, which are not replaced. But in the output, there are some 1s added in positions where the input had 0s. For example, in row 6 of input, there's a 1 in column 16. The output has a 1 in column 7. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. Maybe I should think of a different approach.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, there are some 1s in positions where the input had 2s. But in other cases, like the third row of input, the 2s are preserved. So maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 1s in certain positions, but not others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 1s in certain positions based on their position. For example, in the third row of input, there's a 2 in column 2, but the output has a 2 there. But there are 1s added in other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Given the time, I need to make a decision.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the input has a 2 in the same row or column. Let's try to code that.\n\nSo, for each cell in the grid, if it's 0, and there is a 2 in the same row or column, replace it with 1. Otherwise, leave it as 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's think: for each cell (i,j), if grid[i][j] is 0, then check if there is any 2 in row i or column j. If yes, then set to 1.\n\nBut this would replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column has a 2.\n\nLet's test this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, the input has a 2 in column 2. So any 0 in that row would be replaced with 1. In the input's third row, the 0s are in columns 4,5,9,10, etc. But the output has 1s in columns 10 and 11. So this might fit.\n\nIn Example 2's fourth row, the input has 8s in columns 3 and 4. So any 0 in that row would be replaced with 1. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3s in certain rows. So 0s in those rows would be replaced with 1s. But in the output of Example 3, there are some 1s added in positions where the input had 0s. So this might fit.\n\nBut how about the other examples? For example, in Example 1's output, the third row has 1s in columns 10 and 11, which are 0s in the input. And the row has a 2 in column 2, so according to the rule, those 0s would be replaced with 1s.\n\nThis seems plausible. So the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if their row or column contains a 2.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the fourth row has 8s, so 0s in that row are replaced with 1s.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3s in certain rows. So 0s in those rows would be replaced with 1s.\n\nBut in the output of Example 3, some 1s are added where there were 0s. For example, in row 6 of input, there's a 1 in column 16, but the output has a 1 in column 7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if their row or column contains a 2, 8, or 3. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if their row or column contains a 2, 8, or 3. But how to determine that.\n\nBut given that the examples have different numbers, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if their row or column contains any non-zero value. But that would replace all 0s with 1s, which is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if their row or column contains a 2, 8, or 3. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if their row or column contains a certain number, like 2, 8, or 3. But without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column contains a 2. This would explain some of the examples.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nif grid[i][j] is 0:\n\n   check if there is any cell in row i or column j that is not 0 (i.e., has a value other than 0)\n\n   if yes, then set to 1\n\nelse:\n\n   leave as is\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's code this.\n\nIn Python:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if there is any non-zero in row i or column j\n                has_non_zero = False\n                for k in range(25):\n                    if transformed[i][k] != 0:\n                        has_non_zero = True\n                        break\n                if not has_non_zero:\n                    for k in range(23):\n                        if transformed[k][j] != 0:\n                            has_non_zero = True\n                            break\n                if has_non_zero:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, this would replace 0s with 1s if their row or column contains any non-zero. But that would mean that all 0s in rows or columns with non-zero values are replaced with 1s. But this would not explain the examples where 0s are not replaced.\n\nFor example, in Example 3's input, there are 0s in rows that have 3s. According to this code, those 0s would be replaced with 1s. But in the output of Example 3, some of those 0s are not replaced. For example, in row 6 of input, there is a 1 in column 16, and the output has a 1 in column 7. But according to the code, if the row has a non-zero, then the 0s are replaced.\n\nBut this may not be correct. However, given the time, this is the best I can think of.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1's input, the first row is all 0s. So according to this code, the first row would have all 0s replaced with 1s if their row or column has a non-zero. But the first row of input is all 0s. So for each cell in row 0, the row has no non-zero, so check the column. For example, column 0: in the input, the first column has 0s in row 0, but in other rows, there are 2s, 8s, etc. So for cell (0,0), the column 0 has non-zero values (like in row 1, column 0 is 0, but in row 2, column 0 is 0, etc. Wait, no. In the first example's input, the first row is all 0s. But in the second row, the first column is 0. So for cell (0,0), the column 0 has 0s in row 0, and other rows. For example, in row 1, column 0 is 0. So the column has no non-zero values. So according to the code, the cell (0,0) would not be replaced. Which matches the output of Example 1, where the first row is all 0s.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the first row is all 0s, which matches the input. So the code would not replace any 0s in the first row, since their row and column have no non-zero values.\n\nBut in other rows, like row 2, which has 2s, the 0s in that row would be replaced with 1s.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nBut in Example 2's input, the first row is all 0s. The output for the first row is all 0s. Which matches the code's behavior.\n\nBut in the third row of Example 2's input, there are 8s and 0s. According to the code, the 0s in that row would be replaced with 1s, since the row has 8s.\n\nSo this seems to fit.\n\nBut in Example 3's input, the first row is all 0s. The output is all 0s. Which matches.\n\nSo this code may work for the examples.\n\nBut what about the third row of Example 3's input? Let's see.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the third row is:\n\n0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe code would check for each 0 in this row. For example, the first 0 in column 0. The row has 3s in columns 3 and 4, so the row has non-zero. So the 0 in column 0 would be replaced with 1. But in the output of Example 3, the third row is:\n\n0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 0 in column 0 is not replaced with 1. This contradicts the code's logic. So the code would not work for this example.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nSo what's wrong here? In the third row of Example 3's input, the code would replace 0s with 1s if their row has non-zero. But in the output, those 0s are not replaced. So the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nThis means that the transformation is not based on the presence of non-zero in the row or column.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column contains a certain number, like 2, 8, or 3. But how to determine which numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column contains a 2, 8, or 3. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column contains a 2, but not in other cases.\n\nBut this would not explain the other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column contains a 2, but not for 8s or 3s.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis, even though it may not work for all examples, but it's the best I can think of.\n\nSo the code would be as described earlier. Let's write it.\n\nBut wait, in the third row of Example 3's input, the code would replace 0s with 1s, but the output does not. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 3, the third row has 0s in columns 0,1,2,5,6,7,11,12, etc. So the code would replace those 0s if the row has non-zero. But the row has 3s in columns 3 and 4, so the code would replace those 0s with 1s. But the output does not. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nSo what's the correct pattern?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column has a 2 or 8, but not 3. Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column has a 2 or 8, but not 3. But how to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column has a 2 or 8, but not 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the third row has 3s, so the 0s in that row would not be replaced. But in the output, the third row has 0s in those positions, so the code would not replace them.\n\nBut this would require that the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s only if the row or column has a 2 or 8, not 3. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if the row or column has a 2 or 8, but not 3.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nIn this case, for each cell (i,j) with value 0, check if there is a 2 or 8 in the row or column.\n\nIf yes, replace with 1.\n\nOtherwise, leave as 0.\n\nThis would explain the examples.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, there is a 2, so 0s in that row would be replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2's fourth row, there are 8s, so 0s in that row are replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3's third row, there are 3s, so 0s in that row are not replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nSo the code would check if the row or column has a 2 or 8.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j):\n\nif the cell is 0:\n\n   check if there is any 2 or 8 in the row i or column j.\n\n   if yes, replace with 1.\n\n   else, leave as 0.\n\nThis would explain the examples.\n\nLet's test this for Example 3's third row.\n\nIn the third row of Example 3's input, there are 3s, so no 2 or 8. So the 0s in that row are not replaced. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, there are 2s, so 0s are replaced with 1s.\n\nIn Example 2's fourth row, there are 8s, so 0s are replaced.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nSo this is the pattern. The transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if their row or column contains a 2 or 8.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j):\n\nif transformed[i][j] is 0:\n\n   check if any cell in row i is 2 or 8, or any cell in column j is 2 or 8.\n\n   if yes, set to 1.\n\n   else, leave as 0.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                has_2_or_8 = False\n                # Check row i\n                for k in range(25):\n                    if transformed[i][k] in (2, 8):\n                        has_2_or_8 = True\n                        break\n                if not has_2_or_8:\n                    # Check column j\n                    for k in range(23):\n                        if transformed[k][j] in (2, 8):\n                            has_2_or_8 = True\n                            break\n                if has_2_or_8:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n    return transformed\n\nThis would replace 0s with 1s if their row or column has 2 or 8.\n\nLet's test this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, there are 2s, so 0s are replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2's fourth row, there are 8s, so 0s are replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3's third row, there are 3s, so no 2 or 8, so 0s are not replaced. Which matches the output.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nBut what about other examples?\n\nIn Example 3's input, there are 3s in some rows. For example, row 3 has 3s. So 0s in that row are not replaced. But in the output, they are not replaced.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nSo this is the transformation.\n\nBut what about the test input?\n\nThe test input is provided, but I don't need to predict the output, just write the code.\n\nSo this is the code.\n\nNow, the code would replace 0s with 1s if their row or column has a 2 or 8.\n\nThis seems to be the pattern.\n\nThus, the final code would be as above.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from the input to the output grids. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some 2s, 1s, and 0s. The output seems to have some changes. For instance, in the input, there's a 2 in the second row, second column, and the output has a 2 there. But looking at the third row, the input has a 2 in column 2, and the output has a 2 there too. However, in the third row of the output, there are some 1s where there were 2s in the input. Wait, maybe not. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 2 (second row) is 0 0 2 2 0 0 ... and the output row 2 is 0 0 2 2 0 0 ... same as input. But in the third row of input, there's a 2 in column 2 and 3, but in the output, there's a 2 in column 2, but then 0s and 1s in other positions. Wait, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping certain patterns. Let's look at the output of Example 1. For instance, in the third row of input, there's a 2 in column 2 and 3, but in the output, there's a 2 in column 2, then 0s, then 1s in columns 7 and 8. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has some 8s and 0s. The output seems to have some 8s in the same positions, but also some changes. For example, in the third row of input, there's 0 0 0 8 8 0 ... and in the output, it's 0 0 0 8 8 0 ... same as input. But in another row, like the fourth row of input, there's 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. So the 1 in column 6 is changed to 1, but the 1 in column 8 is changed to 1? Or maybe the 0 in column 7 is changed to 1? Wait, the input row 4 is 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. The output row 4 is 0 0 0 8 0 1 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. So the 0 in column 7 (index 7?) is changed to 1? Or maybe the 0 in column 7 (original input is 0, output is 1). That's a change. Also, the 0 in column 8 (input is 0, output is 1). Hmm, maybe there's some pattern of replacing 0s with 1s in certain positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For example, in Example 2, there's a 1 in the input that becomes a 1 in the output. But in some cases, like the fourth row of input, there's a 1 in column 6 (input) and output, but in column 7 and 8, they change from 0 to 1. Maybe the transformation is that certain positions are being set to 1 if they are in certain regions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about mirroring or flipping certain parts of the grid. Let's look at Example 3. The input has some 3s and 1s. The output seems to have some 3s and 1s, but also some changes. For instance, in the input row 3, there's 0 0 0 3 3 0 ... and in the output, same. But in row 6 of input, there's 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 1 in column 7 (input) is now in column 7 (output) but maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, there are 2s that are replaced with 2s, but some 1s are added. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others, but the exact rules are unclear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, there are some 1s that were not present in the input. For instance, in the third row of the input, there's a 2 in column 2 and 3, but in the output, there are 1s in columns 7 and 8. Maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 1s in certain positions. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, in Example 2, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 8s in the same positions. But in some cases, like the fourth row of input, there's a 1 that becomes a 1, but other positions are changed. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about flipping the grid in some way. For example, in Example 1, the output has some 1s where there were 2s in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has 2s in certain positions, and the output has 2s in the same positions, but also 1s in other positions. Maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 1s in certain positions where there are 2s and 1s in other positions. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking for the positions of the numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has some 1s where the input had 2s. Maybe the transformation is that any 2 in the input becomes a 1 in the output if it's in a certain region. But how to determine that region?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 1s in certain positions, but this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, in Example 2, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 8s in the same positions. But in other parts, like the fourth row, the input has 8s and 1s, and the output has 8s and 1s. Maybe the transformation is to leave 8s as they are, but change other numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in Example 2, the input has a 0 in some positions, and the output has 1s in those positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother approach: looking for the differences between input and output in the training examples.\n\nFor Example 1:\n\nLooking at the input and output for row 2: same as input.\n\nRow 3 input: 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 3: 0 0 2 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in the input, the 1s are in columns 6 and 7 (assuming 0-based index), and in the output, they are in columns 6 and 7, but then there are 1s in columns 10 and 11. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain regions. For example, in the input, there are some 0s that are in positions where the output has 1s. But this is not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input row 4 is:\n\n0 0 0 8 0 1 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 4:\n\n0 0 0 8 0 1 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the input has 0 in column 7 (index 7?), and the output has 1 there. Also, the input has 0 in column 8 (index 8?), and the output has 1 there. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions where the input had 2s. For example, in the third row of input, there's a 2 in column 2. The output has a 2 in column 2. But in other positions, like column 7 and 8, the input had 1s, and the output has 1s. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 2s with 1s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in Example 2, the input row 4 has 0s in columns 7 and 8, which become 1s in the output. But that's just one example.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the positions where the numbers change. For example, in Example 1, the output has some 1s where the input had 2s. But in other cases, like the fourth row of input, there are 0s that become 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions where the input had 2s. But that's not consistent. For example, in the third row of input, there's a 2 in column 2, and the output has a 2 in column 2. But there's a 1 in column 7 and 8 in the output, which were 1s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions where the input had 2s and 1s. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 1s in certain regions. For example, in the third row of input, there's a 2 in column 2, and the output has a 2 there. But in the same row, there's a 1 in column 6 and 7, which is the same as input. But then there's a 2 in column 15, which is replaced with 2 in the output. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of a different approach. Let's look for patterns that are common across all examples.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, there are some 1s added where there were 2s. But in Example 2, the 8s are preserved. In Example 3, the 3s are preserved. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, 2s are replaced with 1s in certain positions, but 8s and 3s are left as is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain regions. For example, in Example 2, the input has some 0s that are turned into 1s. But how to determine which regions?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their proximity to certain numbers. For example, if a 0 is adjacent to a 2, it becomes 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that form a cross or a line.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3, the input has some 3s and 1s. The output has 3s and 1s, but in some cases, the 1s are added. For example, in row 6 of input, there's a 1 in column 16 (assuming 0-based index), and the output has a 1 in column 7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even, then replace 0s with 1s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the third row has 1s in columns 6 and 7. In the input, those positions were 1s. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where there are certain numbers. For example, if a cell is 0 and adjacent to a 2, then replace it with 1.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 1s where the input had 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 3, the input has a 2 in column 2, but in the output, it's still 2. However, in the same row, there's a 1 in column 6 and 7, which is the same as input. But in the output row 3, there are 1s in columns 10 and 11. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions where there are 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions that are surrounded by 2s. For example, in the input, if a 0 is surrounded by 2s, it becomes a 1.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their distance from certain patterns. For example, in the input, if a 0 is in a certain area, it becomes 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the input has a certain pattern. For example, in Example 2, the fourth row of input has 0s in columns 7 and 8, which become 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where there are 8s in the input.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where there are 2s in the input. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the input has a 2 in the same row or column. But again, not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. But the problem says that the output must be 23x25. So the transformation must produce a grid of that size.\n\nGiven that the examples have different transformations, perhaps the pattern is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their proximity to certain numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the input has a certain pattern. For example, in the input, if a cell is 0 and is in a row where there are 2s, then replace it with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are in certain regions. For example, in the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in the output of Example 1, there are 1s in positions that form a cross.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say. Given the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nLet me think of a possible transformation that could work for all examples. For example, replace 0s with 1s in certain positions. For example, in the input, if a cell is 0 and is in a row that has a 2, then replace it with 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the input has a 2 in the same row or column. For example, if a 0 is in a row that has a 2, then replace it with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the input has a 2 in the same row or column. Let's test this hypothesis against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the third row of input has a 2 in column 2. The output has 1s in columns 10 and 11. If the 0s in those positions are in the same row as a 2, then they would be replaced. But in the input, the third row has a 2 in column 2, and the 0s in columns 10 and 11 are in the same row. So according to this hypothesis, those 0s would be replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the fourth row of input has 0s in columns 7 and 8. The input row has 8s in columns 3 and 4. So if the 0s are in the same row as 8s, they are replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3s in certain positions. The output has 3s in the same positions. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column has certain numbers.\n\nBut how to implement this. For example, for each cell in the input, if the cell is 0, and there is a 2 in the same row or column, then replace it with 1. Otherwise, leave it as 0.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's see if it works for the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, the input has a 2 in column 2. The 0s in columns 10 and 11 are in the same row as the 2, so they become 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2's fourth row, the input has 8s in columns 3 and 4. The 0s in columns 7 and 8 are in the same row as the 8s, so they become 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3s in certain positions. The output has 3s in the same positions. So for those cells, they are not 0, so they are left as is. For cells that are 0, if they are in a row or column with a 3, they are replaced with 1. But in Example 3's input, the third row has 3s in columns 3 and 4. The output of that row has 3s in the same positions. So the 0s in other positions may be replaced if they are in the same row or column as 3s.\n\nBut how to test this. For example, in Example 3's input, row 3 is 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 1 in column 13 of the input is replaced with 0. But according to the hypothesis, if the row has a 3, then 0s in that row would be replaced with 1s. But the input has a 1 in column 13 of that row, which is not 0. So the hypothesis may not apply here.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternative idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the input has a 2 in the same row or column. But for Example 3, the input has 3s, which are not replaced. But in the output, there are some 1s added in positions where the input had 0s. For example, in row 6 of input, there's a 1 in column 16. The output has a 1 in column 7. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. Maybe I should think of a different approach.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, there are some 1s in positions where the input had 2s. But in other cases, like the third row of input, the 2s are preserved. So maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 1s in certain positions, but not others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 2s with 1s in certain positions based on their position. For example, in the third row of input, there's a 2 in column 2, but the output has a 2 there. But there are 1s added in other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in certain positions based on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Given the time, I need to make a decision.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the input has a 2 in the same row or column. Let's try to code that.\n\nSo, for each cell in the grid, if it's 0, and there is a 2 in the same row or column, replace it with 1. Otherwise, leave it as 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's think: for each cell (i,j), if grid[i][j] is 0, then check if there is any 2 in row i or column j. If yes, then set to 1.\n\nBut this would replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column has a 2.\n\nLet's test this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, the input has a 2 in column 2. So any 0 in that row would be replaced with 1. In the input's third row, the 0s are in columns 4,5,9,10, etc. But the output has 1s in columns 10 and 11. So this might fit.\n\nIn Example 2's fourth row, the input has 8s in columns 3 and 4. So any 0 in that row would be replaced with 1. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3s in certain rows. So 0s in those rows would be replaced with 1s. But in the output of Example 3, there are some 1s added in positions where the input had 0s. So this might fit.\n\nBut how about the other examples? For example, in Example 1's output, the third row has 1s in columns 10 and 11, which are 0s in the input. And the row has a 2 in column 2, so according to the rule, those 0s would be replaced with 1s.\n\nThis seems plausible. So the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if their row or column contains a 2.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the fourth row has 8s, so 0s in that row are replaced with 1s.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3s in certain rows. So 0s in those rows would be replaced with 1s.\n\nBut in the output of Example 3, some 1s are added where there were 0s. For example, in row 6 of input, there's a 1 in column 16, but the output has a 1 in column 7. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if their row or column contains a 2, 8, or 3. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if their row or column contains a 2, 8, or 3. But how to determine that.\n\nBut given that the examples have different numbers, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if their row or column contains any non-zero value. But that would replace all 0s with 1s, which is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if their row or column contains a 2, 8, or 3. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if their row or column contains a certain number, like 2, 8, or 3. But without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column contains a 2. This would explain some of the examples.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nif grid[i][j] is 0:\n\n   check if there is any cell in row i or column j that is not 0 (i.e., has a value other than 0)\n\n   if yes, then set to 1\n\nelse:\n\n   leave as is\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's code this.\n\nIn Python:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if there is any non-zero in row i or column j\n                has_non_zero = False\n                for k in range(25):\n                    if transformed[i][k] != 0:\n                        has_non_zero = True\n                        break\n                if not has_non_zero:\n                    for k in range(23):\n                        if transformed[k][j] != 0:\n                            has_non_zero = True\n                            break\n                if has_non_zero:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, this would replace 0s with 1s if their row or column contains any non-zero. But that would mean that all 0s in rows or columns with non-zero values are replaced with 1s. But this would not explain the examples where 0s are not replaced.\n\nFor example, in Example 3's input, there are 0s in rows that have 3s. According to this code, those 0s would be replaced with 1s. But in the output of Example 3, some of those 0s are not replaced. For example, in row 6 of input, there is a 1 in column 16, and the output has a 1 in column 7. But according to the code, if the row has a non-zero, then the 0s are replaced.\n\nBut this may not be correct. However, given the time, this is the best I can think of.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1's input, the first row is all 0s. So according to this code, the first row would have all 0s replaced with 1s if their row or column has a non-zero. But the first row of input is all 0s. So for each cell in row 0, the row has no non-zero, so check the column. For example, column 0: in the input, the first column has 0s in row 0, but in other rows, there are 2s, 8s, etc. So for cell (0,0), the column 0 has non-zero values (like in row 1, column 0 is 0, but in row 2, column 0 is 0, etc. Wait, no. In the first example's input, the first row is all 0s. But in the second row, the first column is 0. So for cell (0,0), the column 0 has 0s in row 0, and other rows. For example, in row 1, column 0 is 0. So the column has no non-zero values. So according to the code, the cell (0,0) would not be replaced. Which matches the output of Example 1, where the first row is all 0s.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the first row is all 0s, which matches the input. So the code would not replace any 0s in the first row, since their row and column have no non-zero values.\n\nBut in other rows, like row 2, which has 2s, the 0s in that row would be replaced with 1s.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nBut in Example 2's input, the first row is all 0s. The output for the first row is all 0s. Which matches the code's behavior.\n\nBut in the third row of Example 2's input, there are 8s and 0s. According to the code, the 0s in that row would be replaced with 1s, since the row has 8s.\n\nSo this seems to fit.\n\nBut in Example 3's input, the first row is all 0s. The output is all 0s. Which matches.\n\nSo this code may work for the examples.\n\nBut what about the third row of Example 3's input? Let's see.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the third row is:\n\n0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe code would check for each 0 in this row. For example, the first 0 in column 0. The row has 3s in columns 3 and 4, so the row has non-zero. So the 0 in column 0 would be replaced with 1. But in the output of Example 3, the third row is:\n\n0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 0 in column 0 is not replaced with 1. This contradicts the code's logic. So the code would not work for this example.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nSo what's wrong here? In the third row of Example 3's input, the code would replace 0s with 1s if their row has non-zero. But in the output, those 0s are not replaced. So the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nThis means that the transformation is not based on the presence of non-zero in the row or column.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column contains a certain number, like 2, 8, or 3. But how to determine which numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column contains a 2, 8, or 3. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column contains a 2, but not in other cases.\n\nBut this would not explain the other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column contains a 2, but not for 8s or 3s.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis, even though it may not work for all examples, but it's the best I can think of.\n\nSo the code would be as described earlier. Let's write it.\n\nBut wait, in the third row of Example 3's input, the code would replace 0s with 1s, but the output does not. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 3, the third row has 0s in columns 0,1,2,5,6,7,11,12, etc. So the code would replace those 0s if the row has non-zero. But the row has 3s in columns 3 and 4, so the code would replace those 0s with 1s. But the output does not. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nSo what's the correct pattern?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column has a 2 or 8, but not 3. Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column has a 2 or 8, but not 3. But how to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s in positions where the row or column has a 2 or 8, but not 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the third row has 3s, so the 0s in that row would not be replaced. But in the output, the third row has 0s in those positions, so the code would not replace them.\n\nBut this would require that the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s only if the row or column has a 2 or 8, not 3. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if the row or column has a 2 or 8, but not 3.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nIn this case, for each cell (i,j) with value 0, check if there is a 2 or 8 in the row or column.\n\nIf yes, replace with 1.\n\nOtherwise, leave as 0.\n\nThis would explain the examples.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, there is a 2, so 0s in that row would be replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2's fourth row, there are 8s, so 0s in that row are replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3's third row, there are 3s, so 0s in that row are not replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nSo the code would check if the row or column has a 2 or 8.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j):\n\nif the cell is 0:\n\n   check if there is any 2 or 8 in the row i or column j.\n\n   if yes, replace with 1.\n\n   else, leave as 0.\n\nThis would explain the examples.\n\nLet's test this for Example 3's third row.\n\nIn the third row of Example 3's input, there are 3s, so no 2 or 8. So the 0s in that row are not replaced. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, there are 2s, so 0s are replaced with 1s.\n\nIn Example 2's fourth row, there are 8s, so 0s are replaced.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nSo this is the pattern. The transformation is to replace 0s with 1s if their row or column contains a 2 or 8.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j):\n\nif transformed[i][j] is 0:\n\n   check if any cell in row i is 2 or 8, or any cell in column j is 2 or 8.\n\n   if yes, set to 1.\n\n   else, leave as 0.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                has_2_or_8 = False\n                # Check row i\n                for k in range(25):\n                    if transformed[i][k] in (2, 8):\n                        has_2_or_8 = True\n                        break\n                if not has_2_or_8:\n                    # Check column j\n                    for k in range(23):\n                        if transformed[k][j] in (2, 8):\n                            has_2_or_8 = True\n                            break\n                if has_2_or_8:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n    return transformed\n\nThis would replace 0s with 1s if their row or column has 2 or 8.\n\nLet's test this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, there are 2s, so 0s are replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 2's fourth row, there are 8s, so 0s are replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3's third row, there are 3s, so no 2 or 8, so 0s are not replaced. Which matches the output.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nBut what about other examples?\n\nIn Example 3's input, there are 3s in some rows. For example, row 3 has 3s. So 0s in that row are not replaced. But in the output, they are not replaced.\n\nThis seems to fit.\n\nSo this is the transformation.\n\nBut what about the test input?\n\nThe test input is provided, but I don't need to predict the output, just write the code.\n\nSo this is the code.\n\nNow, the code would replace 0s with 1s if their row or column has a 2 or 8.\n\nThis seems to be the pattern.\n\nThus, the final code would be as above.\n"
