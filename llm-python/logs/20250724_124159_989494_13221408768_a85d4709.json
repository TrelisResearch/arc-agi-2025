All inputs have 5s in various positions and 0s elsewhere\n2. All outputs use values 2, 3, and 4 arranged in rows\n3. It seems like the pattern might be related to which columns or rows have 5s\n\nLet me check column-wise patterns:\n- Example 1: 5s in columns 2, 1, 0 (from top to bottom) - Output rows are 3, 4, 2\n- Example 2: All 5s in column 2 - Output is all 3s\n- Example 3: 5s in columns 0, 1, 0 (from top to bottom) - Output rows are 2, 4, 2\n- Example 4: 5s in columns 1, 2, 1 (from top to bottom) - Output rows are 4, 3, 4\n\nLet me think differently - maybe it's about the position of 5s in each row:\n- Row 0: which column has the 5\n- Row 1: which column has the 5  \n- Row 2: which column has the 5\n\nThen map these column positions to output values:\n- Example 1: cols [2, 1, 0] -> [3, 4, 2] \n- Example 2: cols [2, 2, 2] -> [3, 3, 3]\n- Example 3: cols [0, 1, 0] -> [2, 4, 2]\n- Example 4: cols [1, 2, 1] -> [4, 3, 4]\n\nThis looks like a mapping:\n- Column 0 -> 2\n- Column 1 -> 4  \n- Column 2 -> 3\n\nLet me verify:\n- Example 1: [2,1,0] -> [2->2, 1->4, 0->3] = [3,4,2] - Wait, this doesn't match the output order\n- Actually the output is [3,4,2] for input cols [2,1,0]\n\nLet me recheck by looking at what each ROW in the output corresponds to:\nLooking at output rows:\n- Row 0 of output\n- Row 1 of output  \n- Row 2 of output\n\nMaybe it's about which COLUMN has the 5 in each ROW of the input:\n- Example 1: Row 0 col 2, Row 1 col 1, Row 2 col 0 \u2192 [2,1,0] \u2192 Output rows [3,4,2]\n- Example 2: Row 0 col 2, Row 1 col 2, Row 2 col 2 \u2192 [2,2,2] \u2192 Output rows [3,3,3]  \n- Example 3: Row 0 col 0, Row 1 col 1, Row 2 col 0 \u2192 [0,1,0] \u2192 Output rows [2,4,2]\n- Example 4: Row 0 col 1, Row 1 col 2, Row 2 col 1 \u2192 [1,2,1] \u2192 Output rows [4,3,4]\n\nSo the mapping seems to be:\n- Column index 0 \u2192 Fill row with 2s\n- Column index 1 \u2192 Fill row with 4s  \n- Column index 2 \u2192 Fill row with 3s\n\nThis makes sense!\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 3x3 output grid filled with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # For each row in the input grid, find which column has the 5\n    # Then fill the corresponding output row with a specific value\n    column_mapping = {0: 2, 1: 4, 2: 3}\n    \n    for i in range(3):  # For each row\n        # Find the column that has 5 in this row\n        col_with_5 = -1\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                col_with_5 = j\n                break\n        \n        # Fill the entire output row with the mapped value\n        if col_with_5 != -1:\n            fill_value = column_mapping[col_with_5]\n            for j in range(3):\n                output[i][j] = fill_value\n    \n    return output\n```",
