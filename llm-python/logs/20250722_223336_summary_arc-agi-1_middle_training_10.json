              "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's try to figure out the transformation pattern based on the training examples. First, looking at Example 1: the input grid has some 5s, and the output grid has 1s and 2s. The output colors seem to depend on the positions of the 5s. For example, in the input, the 5s are in a cluster forming a diagonal, and the output has 1s and 2s in different regions. \n\nIn Example 2, the output has 1s and 2s in regions that might be based on the 5s' coordinates. For instance, in the output, the cell (0,2) is 1, which might be related to the input's 5s. Also, the output color seems to depend on the row number and column number. For example, cells with row number less than 2 and column number less than 2 might have 1s, while others have 2s. Wait, maybe the color is determined by whether the row number plus column number is even or odd. Let me check.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output, the output is 2s in certain cells and 1s in others. For example, in the input, the 5s are in cells (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), etc. The output for these positions is 2. However, in the input, there's a 5 at (7,1) which outputs 1. So maybe the color depends on the cell's coordinates. \n\nAnother idea: The output color is 1 if the cell is in a certain way and 2 otherwise. For example, maybe the cell's row number plus column number is even, or odd. Let me check for example 1. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output for cell (7,1): row 7, column 1. 7+1=8, even. Output color is 1. Hmm, that's inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe the output is determined by the minimal row and column indices of the 5s that are connected. Wait, that might be a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is determined by the cell's distance to the nearest 5. But that's not clear from the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is 1 if the cell is in a certain region and 2 otherwise. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in the lower left corner and 2s elsewhere. But that doesn't fit perfectly.\n\nAnother approach: Check the output color based on the cell's coordinates. For example, in Example 1, the output color for cell (0,2) is 1. The cell (0,2) has row 0, column 2. 0 + 2 = 2, which is even. But the output is 1. In cell (7,1), 7+1=8 even, output is 1. In cell (2,2) from input, which is 5, but output is 2. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on whether the cell is in the same row or column as a 5. For example, if the cell is in a row that contains a 5, then color is 1 or 2. But this seems too vague.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input: there are 5s in multiple rows and columns, and the output has 1s and 2s. In that output, the color seems to be determined by the row or column index. For instance, in the output, the first row's cells (0,0) and (0,1) are 2, but (0,2) is 1. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the color is determined by the minimal distance from the nearest 5 in the input grid. For example, if the cell is adjacent to a 5, then output is 1 or 2 based on something else. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the color is determined by the row and column numbers. For example, if row number is less than column number, output is 1, otherwise 2. But in Example 1, cell (0,2) has row 0 < column 2 \u2192 output 1, which matches. Cell (2,2) has row 2 = column 2 \u2192 output 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the color is based on whether the cell's row or column is part of a certain set. For example, if the row number is even, output is 2; if odd, 1. But in Example 1's output, cell (0,2) is 1 (row 0 is even) which contradicts that. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: Look for regions of output colors that correspond to certain patterns in the input. For instance, in Example 1, the output has a 2x2 block in certain rows. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3's output: the output has 1s and 2s in different regions. For example, the output for cell (0,2) is 1, which might be the minimal row or column. But again, not sure.\n\nMaybe there's a rule that the color depends on whether the cell is in the same row or column as a 5. For example, if the cell is in the same row as a 5, then its color is determined by the column index. If it's in the same column as a 5, then based on the row index. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is determined by the minimal row and column indices of the input 5s. For example, in Example 1, the minimal row is 2, column is 2. So any cell with row < 2 or column < 2 is color 1. But in Example 1, the output for cell (7,1) is 1, which is column 1 < 2. So that fits. The output for cell (0,2) is 1, which is row 0 < 2. So that fits. But in cell (2,2), which is the minimal row and column, the color is 2. So that seems to fit. Maybe the color is 1 if the cell is in a region where row < min_row or column < min_col, and 2 otherwise. But what is min_row and min_col? The minimal row and column of the input 5s. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's 5s are in rows from 2 to 7 and columns from 2 to 4. The min_row is 2, min_col is 2. So output color for a cell (r, c) is 1 if r < 2 or c < 2, else 2. But in the output for cell (2,2), the color is 2. That fits. For cell (7,1), c=1 < 2 \u2192 color 1. For cell (0,2), r=0 < 2 \u2192 color 1. For cell (7,2), r=7 >=2, c=2 >= 2 \u2192 color 2. That seems to fit. Let's check Example 3.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the 5s are in cells like (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (0,10?), but wait, the input is a 10x10 grid. Wait, the input for Example 3 is given as a grid of 10 rows and 10 columns. Looking at the input for Example 3:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 \u2192 cells (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8)\nRow 1: 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 \u2192 cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,7)\nRow 2: 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 \u2192 cells (2,2), (2,4), (2,5), (2,7)\nRow 3: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 \u2192 cells (3,2), (3,7)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 \u2192 cells (4,4), (4,5), (4,9)\nRow 5: 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 5 \u2192 cells (5,1), (5,2), (5,5), (5,6), (5,9)\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 5 \u2192 cells (6,5), (6,6), (6,9)\nRow 7: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 cells (7,2)\nRow 8: 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 cells (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)\nRow 9: 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 cells (9,2), (9,3)\n\nSo the minimal row is 0, minimal column is 0. So according to the rule above, any cell where r < 0 (which is impossible) or c < 0 (also impossible) \u2192 no, but the rule would be color 1 if r < min_row (0) or c < min_col (0). Since r and c are >=0, those conditions are false. So the output would be 2 for all cells. But the actual output for Example 3 is 1 and 2 in different regions. So that contradicts the previous hypothesis. Therefore, that approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output color is determined by the cell's row and column indices, but in a more complex way. For example, if the cell is in the same row as a 5 and the column is less than the minimal column of the 5s in that row, then color is 1. Otherwise, color is 2. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output color depends on the cell's row and column indices in relation to the input's regions of 5s. For example, if the cell is in a region that is part of a certain connected component, then color is 1 or 2. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Since the output has 1s and 2s, maybe the color is determined by whether the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in the lower left and 2s elsewhere. But that's not a clear rule.\n\nAlternatively, the color is based on the cell's row and column indices. For example, if the sum of row and column is even, color is 2, else 1. Let's check Example 1. For cell (0,2), sum is 2 even \u2192 color 2, but output is 1. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum is even, color is 1, else 2. For cell (0,2), sum 2 even \u2192 color 1. That fits. For cell (7,1), sum 8 even \u2192 color 1. For cell (2,2), sum 4 even \u2192 color 1. But the output for cell (2,2) is 2. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output for cells in the same row as the input's 5s are different. For example, in row 0 of input, there are 5s, but the output for cell (0,0) is 1. So the color depends on the cell's position in relation to some feature of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is 1 if the cell is in a certain set of cells where their coordinates are in the same row or column as a 5 but not part of a certain larger region. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 2, the output has regions of 1s and 2s that might be based on the minimal row and column of the 5s. For example, in Example 2, the input's 5s have minimal row 0 and column 0. But the output for cell (0,0) is 1. The sum of row and column is 0, which is even, and the output is 1. But in Example 1, the minimal row and column are 2, and the output for cell (2,2) is 2, which is even. So this contradicts the previous idea.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output has cells with color 1 in row 0, columns 0, 1, 5, 6, etc. But this is hard to see.\n\nMaybe the color is determined by whether the cell is in the same row or column as a 5, and then further conditions. For example, if the cell is in a row that has a 5 in a certain column, then color is 1 or 2 based on that.\n\nAlternatively, after a lot of thinking, perhaps the output color is determined by the following rule: For each cell (r,c) in the input grid, if the cell is part of a cluster of connected 5s with certain properties, then assign color 1 or 2. But without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being determined by the cell's row and column relative to the input's 5s. For example, if the cell is in a row that has a 5 in a column less than the current cell's column, then color is 1. Otherwise, color is 2. But again, not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern in the output colors based on the row and column indices of the input 5s. For example, the output color for cell (r,c) is 1 if r < min_row or c < min_col, and 2 otherwise. In Example 1, min_row is 2, min_col is 2. So any cell with r < 2 or c < 2 would be color 1. For cell (0,2), r < 2 \u2192 color 1. For cell (7,1), c < 2 \u2192 color 1. For cell (2,2), r >= min_row and c >= min_col \u2192 color 2. That fits example 1's output. For example 3, the min_row is 0, min_col is 0. So any cell with r < 0 or c < 0 would be color 1 (which is impossible), so all cells would be 2. But the actual output for example 3 is a mix of 1s and 2s. So this suggests that the rule is not correct. However, maybe the min_row and min_col are derived differently. For example, the min_row is the minimal row that contains a 5, and min_col is the minimal column that contains a 5. In example 3, the input has 5s starting from row 0 and column 0. So the min_row is 0, min_col is 0. So according to the rule, all cells would be color 2. But in the output of example 3, there are 1s. So this rule is invalid.\n\nAnother idea: The output color is 1 if the cell is in the same row or column as a 5 and the sum of r and c is odd. For example, cell (0,2) sum is 2 even \u2192 color 1. But that doesn't fit. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is 1 if the sum of r and c is even and the cell is in a certain way, and 2 otherwise. But again, this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern that fits all three examples. Let's try to find such a rule.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput has a lot of 5s, including (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), etc. The output for cell (0,0) is 1, cell (0,1) is 1, cell (0,2) is 1. For cell (8,1), sum r + c = 9 (odd), output is 1. For cell (8,2), sum is 10 (even), output is 2. Hmm, so this suggests that the output is 1 for cells where row + column is odd, and 2 for even. But let's check Example 1's output for cell (0,2): sum is 2 even, output is 1. Which contradicts the idea. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, output is 1 if the sum is even and the cell is in a certain region. But again, not sure.\n\nAfter struggling with patterns, I think the correct approach is to look at the minimal row and column of the input 5s. For example, if there are no 5s in the input grid, output is all 0s. Otherwise, the output color is 1 if the cell is in a certain region, else 2. But how to determine that region.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is 1 for cells in the same row or column as the minimal row or column. For example, if the input has 5s, then the minimal row is r_min, and minimal column is c_min. Then, for any cell (r,c), if r == r_min or c == c_min, output is 1; else, output is 2. Let's check this with example 1:\n\nExample 1 input has 5s with r_min = 2, c_min = 2. So any cell with r=2 or c=2 would be color 1. But in example 1's output, for cell (2,2), output is 2. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: Output is 1 if the cell is in the same row as the minimal column of the input 5s, or in the same column as the minimal row of the input 5s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 1 if the cell is in a certain region determined by the input's 5s. For example, for each cell (r,c) in the input grid, if it's part of a certain connected component of 5s, then output is 1 or 2. But without seeing all examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the output color for a cell (r,c) is 1 if it is in the same row or column as the minimal row or column of the input 5s, and 2 otherwise. But how to define this.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is 1 if the cell is in the same row or column as a 5, and 2 otherwise. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is 2 for cells in the same row or column as the minimal row or column of the input 5s, and 1 otherwise. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. After thinking for a long time, I'll try to code a solution that checks for the minimal row and column of the input 5s, and then determines the output color based on those. For example, if the input has no 5s, output is all 0s. Otherwise, for each cell (r,c), if r == r_min or c == c_min, output is 1, else 2. But this may not fit all examples. Let's test it with example 1:\n\nExample 1's input has r_min = 2, c_min = 2. So for cell (0,2), c == c_min \u2192 output 1. For cell (2,0), r == r_min \u2192 output 1. For cell (2,2), r == r_min and c == c_min \u2192 output 1. But in the output of example 1, cell (2,2) is 2. So this is not correct.\n\nHmm. So this hypothesis is wrong.\n\nFinal attempt: Maybe the output color is 1 if the cell is in the same row as the minimal row of the input 5s and the column is less than the minimal column of the input 5s, or vice versa. For example, in example 1, r_min is 2, c_min is 2. So cell (0,2) is r < r_min (0 < 2) and c == c_min \u2192 output 1. Cell (2,0) is r == r_min, c < c_min (0 < 2) \u2192 output 1. Cell (2,2) is r == r_min and c == c_min \u2192 output 2. This fits example 1's output. For example 3, if the minimal row is 0, and minimal column is 0, then cells (r,c) where r == r_min and c < c_min (which is 0 < 0 \u2192 false) or c == c_min and r < r_min (0 < 0 \u2192 false). So output is 2 for all cells. But in example 3's output, there are cells with color 1. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAfter all these attempts, I think the correct approach is to compute the minimal row and column of the input 5s, and then for each cell (r,c), if r < r_min or c < c_min, output 1, else 2. This fits example 1's output. For example 3, if r_min is 0 and c_min is 0, then all cells would have r >= r_min and c >= c_min \u2192 output 2. But the actual output for example 3 has cells with color 1. So this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I need to look for another pattern. Let me check example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input has 5s in row 0, column 0, and others. The output has 1s in certain cells, like (0,2) and others. The output for (0,2) is 1. The minimal row is 0, minimal column is 0. So according to the earlier hypothesis, r < r_min (0 < 0 is false), c < c_min (2 < 0 is false) \u2192 output 2. But in the output, it's 1. So this is not correct.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I'll proceed to implement the hypothesis that the output color is 1 if r + c is even, and 2 otherwise. But let's check example 1's output. Cell (0,2): 0+2=2 even \u2192 output 1. Cell (7,1): 8 even \u2192 output 1. Cell (2,2):4 even \u2192 output 1. But in the output example 1, cell (2,2) is 2. So this is not correct.\n\nFinal decision: Given the time constraints and the complexity of the problem, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output color is 1 if the cell is in the same row or column as a 5, and 2 otherwise. But this may not fit all examples. However, based on the examples given, this is the best I can do.\n</think>\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport sys\ndef transform(grid):\n    r_min = None\n    c_min = None\n    for r in range(10):\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                if r_min is None or r < r_min:\n                    r_min = r\n                if c_min is None or c < c_min:\n                    c_min = c\n    if r_min is None or c_min is None:\n        return [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    for r in range(10):\n        for c in range(10):\n            if r < r_min or c < c_min:\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = 1\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = 2\n    return transformed_grid\n```",

First, looking at Example 1: the input grid has some 5s, and the output grid has 1s and 2s. The output colors seem to depend on the positions of the 5s. For example, in the input, the 5s are in a cluster forming a diagonal, and the output has 1s and 2s in different regions. \n\nIn Example 2, the output has 1s and 2s in regions that might be based on the 5s' coordinates. For instance, in the output, the cell (0,2) is 1, which might be related to the input's 5s. Also, the output color seems to depend on the row number and column number. For example, cells with row number less than 2 and column number less than 2 might have 1s, while others have 2s. Wait, maybe the color is determined by whether the row number plus column number is even or odd. Let me check.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output, the output is 2s in certain cells and 1s in others. For example, in the input, the 5s are in cells (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), etc. The output for these positions is 2. However, in the input, there's a 5 at (7,1) which outputs 1. So maybe the color depends on the cell's coordinates. \n\nAnother idea: The output color is 1 if the cell is in a certain way and 2 otherwise. For example, maybe the cell's row number plus column number is even, or odd. Let me check for example 1. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output for cell (7,1): row 7, column 1. 7+1=8, even. Output color is 1. Hmm, that's inconsistent. Alternatively, maybe the output is determined by the minimal row and column indices of the 5s that are connected. Wait, that might be a stretch.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is determined by the cell's distance to the nearest 5. But that's not clear from the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is 1 if the cell is in a certain region and 2 otherwise. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in the lower left corner and 2s elsewhere. But that doesn't fit perfectly.\n\nAnother approach: Check the output color based on the cell's coordinates. For example, in Example 1, the output color for cell (0,2) is 1. The cell (0,2) has row 0, column 2. 0 + 2 = 2, which is even. But the output is 1. In cell (7,1), 7+1=8 even, output is 1. In cell (2,2) from input, which is 5, but output is 2. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on whether the cell is in the same row or column as a 5. For example, if the cell is in a row that contains a 5, then color is 1 or 2. But this seems too vague.\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's input: there are 5s in multiple rows and columns, and the output has 1s and 2s. In that output, the color seems to be determined by the row or column index. For instance, in the output, the first row's cells (0,0) and (0,1) are 2, but (0,2) is 1. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the color is determined by the minimal distance from the nearest 5 in the input grid. For example, if the cell is adjacent to a 5, then output is 1 or 2 based on something else. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the color is determined by the row and column numbers. For example, if row number is less than column number, output is 1, otherwise 2. But in Example 1, cell (0,2) has row 0 < column 2 \u2192 output 1, which matches. Cell (2,2) has row 2 = column 2 \u2192 output 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the color is based on whether the cell's row or column is part of a certain set. For example, if the row number is even, output is 2; if odd, 1. But in Example 1's output, cell (0,2) is 1 (row 0 is even) which contradicts that. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: Look for regions of output colors that correspond to certain patterns in the input. For instance, in Example 1, the output has a 2x2 block in certain rows. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3's output: the output has 1s and 2s in different regions. For example, the output for cell (0,2) is 1, which might be the minimal row or column. But again, not sure.\n\nMaybe there's a rule that the color depends on whether the cell is in the same row or column as a 5. For example, if the cell is in the same row as a 5, then its color is determined by the column index. If it's in the same column as a 5, then based on the row index. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is determined by the minimal row and column indices of the input 5s. For example, in Example 1, the minimal row is 2, column is 2. So any cell with row < 2 or column < 2 is color 1. But in Example 1, the output for cell (7,1) is 1, which is column 1 < 2. So that fits. The output for cell (0,2) is 1, which is row 0 < 2. So that fits. But in cell (2,2), which is the minimal row and column, the color is 2. So that seems to fit. Maybe the color is 1 if the cell is in a region where row < min_row or column < min_col, and 2 otherwise. But what is min_row and min_col? The minimal row and column of the input 5s. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's 5s are in rows from 2 to 7 and columns from 2 to 4. The min_row is 2, min_col is 2. So output color for a cell (r, c) is 1 if r < 2 or c < 2, else 2. But in the output for cell (2,2), the color is 2. That fits. For cell (7,1), c=1 < 2 \u2192 color 1. For cell (0,2), r=0 < 2 \u2192 color 1. For cell (7,2), r=7 >=2, c=2 >= 2 \u2192 color 2. That seems to fit. Let's check Example 3.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the 5s are in cells like (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,3), (0,4), (0,5), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8), (0,9), (0,10?), but wait, the input is a 10x10 grid. Wait, the input for Example 3 is given as a grid of 10 rows and 10 columns. Looking at the input for Example 3:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 \u2192 cells (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), (0,6), (0,7), (0,8)\nRow 1: 0 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 \u2192 cells (1,1), (1,2), (1,4), (1,5), (1,7)\nRow 2: 0 0 5 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 \u2192 cells (2,2), (2,4), (2,5), (2,7)\nRow 3: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 \u2192 cells (3,2), (3,7)\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 \u2192 cells (4,4), (4,5), (4,9)\nRow 5: 0 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 5 \u2192 cells (5,1), (5,2), (5,5), (5,6), (5,9)\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 5 \u2192 cells (6,5), (6,6), (6,9)\nRow 7: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 cells (7,2)\nRow 8: 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 cells (8,1), (8,2), (8,3), (8,4)\nRow 9: 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 cells (9,2), (9,3)\n\nSo the minimal row is 0, minimal column is 0. So according to the rule above, any cell where r < 0 (which is impossible) or c < 0 (also impossible) \u2192 no, but the rule would be color 1 if r < min_row (0) or c < min_col (0). Since r and c are >=0, those conditions are false. So the output would be 2 for all cells. But the actual output for Example 3 is 1 and 2 in different regions. So that contradicts the previous hypothesis. Therefore, that approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output color is determined by the cell's row and column indices, but in a more complex way. For example, if the cell is in the same row as a 5 and the column is less than the minimal column of the 5s in that row, then color is 1. Otherwise, color is 2. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output color depends on the cell's row and column indices in relation to the input's regions of 5s. For example, if the cell is in a region that is part of a certain connected component, then color is 1 or 2. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Since the output has 1s and 2s, maybe the color is determined by whether the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in the lower left and 2s elsewhere. But that's not a clear rule.\n\nAlternatively, the color is based on the cell's row and column indices. For example, if the sum of row and column is even, color is 2, else 1. Let's check Example 1. For cell (0,2), sum is 2 even \u2192 color 2, but output is 1. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, if the sum is even, color is 1, else 2. For cell (0,2), sum 2 even \u2192 color 1. That fits. For cell (7,1), sum 8 even \u2192 color 1. For cell (2,2), sum 4 even \u2192 color 1. But the output for cell (2,2) is 2. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output for cells in the same row as the input's 5s are different. For example, in row 0 of input, there are 5s, but the output for cell (0,0) is 1. So the color depends on the cell's position in relation to some feature of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output color is 1 if the cell is in a certain set of cells where their coordinates are in the same row or column as a 5 but not part of a certain larger region. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 2, the output has regions of 1s and 2s that might be based on the minimal row and column of the 5s. For example, in Example 2, the input's 5s have minimal row 0 and column 0. But the output for cell (0,0) is 1. The sum of row and column is 0, which is even, and the output is 1. But in Example 1, the minimal row and column are 2, and the output for cell (2,2) is 2, which is even. So this contradicts the previous idea.\n\nWait, in Example 2, the output has cells with color 1 in row 0, columns 0, 1, 5, 6, etc. But this is hard to see.\n\nMaybe the color is determined by whether the cell is in the same row or column as a 5, and then further conditions. For example, if the cell is in a row that has a 5 in a certain column, then color is 1 or 2 based on that.\n\nAlternatively, after a lot of thinking, perhaps the output color is determined by the following rule: For each cell (r,c) in the input grid, if the cell is part of a cluster of connected 5s with certain properties, then assign color 1 or 2. But without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being determined by the cell's row and column relative to the input's 5s. For example, if the cell is in a row that has a 5 in a column less than the current cell's column, then color is 1. Otherwise, color is 2. But again, not sure.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern in the output colors based on the row and column indices of the input 5s. For example, the output color for cell (r,c) is 1 if r < min_row or c < min_col, and 2 otherwise. In Example 1, min_row is 2, min_col is 2. So any cell with r < 2 or c < 2 would be color 1. For cell (0,2), r < 2 \u2192 color 1. For cell (7,1), c < 2 \u2192 color 1. For cell (2,2), r >= min_row and c >= min_col \u2192 color 2. That fits example 1's output. For example 3, the min_row is 0, min_col is 0. So any cell with r < 0 or c < 0 would be color 1 (which is impossible), so all cells would be 2. But the actual output for example 3 is a mix of 1s and 2s. So this suggests that the rule is not correct. However, maybe the min_row and min_col are derived differently. For example, the min_row is the minimal row that contains a 5, and min_col is the minimal column that contains a 5. In example 3, the input has 5s starting from row 0 and column 0. So the min_row is 0, min_col is 0. So according to the rule, all cells would be color 2. But in the output of example 3, there are 1s. So this rule is invalid.\n\nAnother idea: The output color is 1 if the cell is in the same row or column as a 5 and the sum of r and c is odd. For example, cell (0,2) sum is 2 even \u2192 color 1. But that doesn't fit. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is 1 if the sum of r and c is even and the cell is in a certain way, and 2 otherwise. But again, this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern that fits all three examples. Let's try to find such a rule.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output:\n\nInput has a lot of 5s, including (0,0), (0,1), (0,2), etc. The output for cell (0,0) is 1, cell (0,1) is 1, cell (0,2) is 1. For cell (8,1), sum r + c = 9 (odd), output is 1. For cell (8,2), sum is 10 (even), output is 2. Hmm, so this suggests that the output is 1 for cells where row + column is odd, and 2 for even. But let's check Example 1's output for cell (0,2): sum is 2 even, output is 1. Which contradicts the idea. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, output is 1 if the sum is even and the cell is in a certain region. But again, not sure.\n\nAfter struggling with patterns, I think the correct approach is to look at the minimal row and column of the input 5s. For example, if there are no 5s in the input grid, output is all 0s. Otherwise, the output color is 1 if the cell is in a certain region, else 2. But how to determine that region.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is 1 for cells in the same row or column as the minimal row or column. For example, if the input has 5s, then the minimal row is r_min, and minimal column is c_min. Then, for any cell (r,c), if r == r_min or c == c_min, output is 1; else, output is 2. Let's check this with example 1:\n\nExample 1 input has 5s with r_min = 2, c_min = 2. So any cell with r=2 or c=2 would be color 1. But in example 1's output, for cell (2,2), output is 2. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: Output is 1 if the cell is in the same row as the minimal column of the input 5s, or in the same column as the minimal row of the input 5s. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is 1 if the cell is in a certain region determined by the input's 5s. For example, for each cell (r,c) in the input grid, if it's part of a certain connected component of 5s, then output is 1 or 2. But without seeing all examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the output color for a cell (r,c) is 1 if it is in the same row or column as the minimal row or column of the input 5s, and 2 otherwise. But how to define this.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is 1 if the cell is in the same row or column as a 5, and 2 otherwise. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output color is 2 for cells in the same row or column as the minimal row or column of the input 5s, and 1 otherwise. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. After thinking for a long time, I'll try to code a solution that checks for the minimal row and column of the input 5s, and then determines the output color based on those. For example, if the input has no 5s, output is all 0s. Otherwise, for each cell (r,c), if r == r_min or c == c_min, output is 1, else 2. But this may not fit all examples. Let's test it with example 1:\n\nExample 1's input has r_min = 2, c_min = 2. So for cell (0,2), c == c_min \u2192 output 1. For cell (2,0), r == r_min \u2192 output 1. For cell (2,2), r == r_min and c == c_min \u2192 output 1. But in the output of example 1, cell (2,2) is 2. So this is not correct.\n\nHmm. So this hypothesis is wrong.\n\nFinal attempt: Maybe the output color is 1 if the cell is in the same row as the minimal row of the input 5s and the column is less than the minimal column of the input 5s, or vice versa. For example, in example 1, r_min is 2, c_min is 2. So cell (0,2) is r < r_min (0 < 2) and c == c_min \u2192 output 1. Cell (2,0) is r == r_min, c < c_min (0 < 2) \u2192 output 1. Cell (2,2) is r == r_min and c == c_min \u2192 output 2. This fits example 1's output. For example 3, if the minimal row is 0, and minimal column is 0, then cells (r,c) where r == r_min and c < c_min (which is 0 < 0 \u2192 false) or c == c_min and r < r_min (0 < 0 \u2192 false). So output is 2 for all cells. But in example 3's output, there are cells with color 1. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAfter all these attempts, I think the correct approach is to compute the minimal row and column of the input 5s, and then for each cell (r,c), if r < r_min or c < c_min, output 1, else 2. This fits example 1's output. For example 3, if r_min is 0 and c_min is 0, then all cells would have r >= r_min and c >= c_min \u2192 output 2. But the actual output for example 3 has cells with color 1. So this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, perhaps I need to look for another pattern. Let me check example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input has 5s in row 0, column 0, and others. The output has 1s in certain cells, like (0,2) and others. The output for (0,2) is 1. The minimal row is 0, minimal column is 0. So according to the earlier hypothesis, r < r_min (0 < 0 is false), c < c_min (2 < 0 is false) \u2192 output 2. But in the output, it's 1. So this is not correct.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I'll proceed to implement the hypothesis that the output color is 1 if r + c is even, and 2 otherwise. But let's check example 1's output. Cell (0,2): 0+2=2 even \u2192 output 1. Cell (7,1): 8 even \u2192 output 1. Cell (2,2):4 even \u2192 output 1. But in the output example 1, cell (2,2) is 2. So this is not correct.\n\nFinal decision: Given the time constraints and the complexity of the problem, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output color is 1 if the cell is in the same row or column as a 5, and 2 otherwise. But this may not fit all examples. However, based on the examples given, this is the best I can do.\n</think>\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport sys\ndef transform(grid):\n    r_min = None\n    c_min = None\n    for r in range(10):\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                if r_min is None or r < r_min:\n                    r_min = r\n                if c_min is None or c < c_min:\n                    c_min = c\n    if r_min is None or c_min is None:\n        return [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    for r in range(10):\n        for c in range(10):\n            if r < r_min or c < c_min:\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = 1\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = 2\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
