          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let me start by analyzing each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a bunch of 0s except for a vertical line of 3s in the middle. The output seems to have some kind of expansion or movement of those 3s. Wait, in the input, the 3s are in rows 4 (assuming 0-based index) and then rows 5-10. The output shows that the 3s are spread out more. Wait, looking at the output, the 3s are in positions that might be shifted. For example, in the input, row 4 has 3s from column 3 to 8. In the output, row 4 has 3s from column 3 to 8, but then in row 5, the 3s are in column 2 and 7, maybe? Or maybe it's a rotation or some kind of pattern expansion.\n\nWait, looking at the output for example 1, the 3s are spread out in a way that maybe they're forming a diamond shape? Or perhaps they're moving in a certain pattern. Alternatively, maybe the 3s are being mirrored or shifted in some way.\n\nLet me check Example 2. The input has a 2 in the middle, and the output seems to have the 2s spread out in a cross shape. For instance, the input has a vertical line of 2s in the middle, but the output has the 2s in a more spread-out pattern. For example, in the input, row 3 has 2s in columns 3-8, but in the output, the 2s are in positions that form a cross, maybe?\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's output, the 2s are spread out in a way that maybe they're moving to the left and right. For example, in the input, the 2s are in positions that form a vertical line. The output seems to have the 2s in positions that form a cross, with some 2s in the middle and spreading out. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about rotating or reflecting the pattern. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s, and the output has them spread out in a diamond shape. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the 3s in the input are being mirrored or rotated. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s, and the output has them in a horizontal line. Wait, no. Let me check the input and output for Example 1 again.\n\nInput for Example 1: The 3s start at row 4 (assuming rows are 0-based?), but looking at the input, row 4 is the fifth row. The input has 3s from column 3 to 8. The output for that row is the same. But in row 5 of the input, the 3s are in column 3, then 0s, then 3 in column 7. In the output, row 5 has 3s in column 2 and 7. So maybe the 3s are being shifted left and right? Or maybe they are being mirrored?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are being spread out in a way that they form a diamond shape. For example, in the input, the 3s are in a vertical line, but the output has them in a diamond shape, with some 3s in positions that are diagonally adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the 3s are being expanded into a cross shape. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has a 5 in the middle, and the output seems to have the 5s spread out in a way that maybe they are forming a cross. For example, the input has a vertical line of 5s in the middle, and the output has them spread out in a cross shape. But how?\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a vertical line of 5s in the middle. The output has the 5s spread out in a way that they form a cross. For example, in the output, row 2 has 5s in columns 3-8, but then in row 3, the 5s are in columns 3, 5, and 7. Wait, maybe the 5s are being spread out in a way that they form a cross, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the 3s, 2s, 5s, and 8s are being mirrored or rotated in some way. For example, the input for Example 1 has a vertical line of 3s, and the output has them spread out in a way that they form a diamond shape. Maybe the 3s are being mirrored in some way.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the pattern is that for each cell in the input, if it's a certain number (like 3, 2, 5, 8), then in the output, it's replaced with a certain pattern. For example, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a cross or diamond shape. Or perhaps the numbers are being mirrored in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being rotated 90 degrees. But that would require checking if the input and output grids have that pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value, the output is determined by some rule based on the cell's position and the value. For example, if the cell has a value of 3, then in the output, it's part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s, and the output has them spread out in a cross shape. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 4: The input has a vertical line of 8s in the middle. The output seems to have those 8s spread out in a cross shape. For example, in the input, row 2 has 8s in columns 4-8. The output has 8s in columns 4-8, but then in row 3, there's an 8 in column 4 and 7, and so on. So maybe the 8s are being spread out in a cross shape.\n\nWait, looking at the output for Example 4, the 8s are spread out in a way that they form a cross. For example, in row 2, the 8s are in columns 4-8. In row 3, the 8s are in columns 4 and 7. Then in row 4, there's an 8 in column 4, then 8 in column 7. Then in row 5, there's 8 in column 4 and 7, etc. So it seems like the 8s are forming a cross shape. But how does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the input's pattern is being expanded into a cross shape. For example, for each cell that has a value, the output is a cross that expands from that cell. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being mirrored in a certain way. For example, the input for Example 1 has a vertical line of 3s, and the output has them spread out in a way that they form a diamond shape. So perhaps the 3s are being mirrored in a way that they form a diamond.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being mirrored in the vertical and horizontal directions. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has them spread out in a way that they form a diamond shape. So maybe the 3s are being mirrored in the horizontal direction, creating a diamond.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell in the input that has a value, the output is a cross shape centered at that cell. For example, if a cell has a value, then the output has that value in a cross pattern around it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being expanded into a cross shape, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in the input, the 3s are in a vertical line, and the output has them in a cross shape. Similarly for the 2s, 5s, and 8s.\n\nLooking at the examples, the input for Example 1 has a vertical line of 3s, and the output has them spread out in a way that forms a cross. For example, in the output, the 3s are in positions that form a cross. So maybe the transformation is that the input's line of 3s is being expanded into a cross shape.\n\nBut how to model this in code? Let's think about the positions.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s in rows 4-10, columns 3-8. The output has those 3s spread out in a cross shape. For example, in row 4, the 3s are in columns 3-8. In row 5, there's a 3 in column 2 and 7. Then row 6 has a 3 in column 3, and so on. It seems like the 3s are being spread out in a way that forms a cross, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value, the output has that value in a cross shape around it. For example, if a cell has a value, then in the output, that value is placed in positions that form a cross. But how to determine which cells to change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input that is not zero, the output has that value in a cross shape. For example, for each non-zero cell, the output has that value in positions that form a cross. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in a certain way. For example, the input's 3s are in a vertical line, and the output's 3s are spread out in a way that they form a diamond. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal and vertical directions. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has those 3s spread out in a way that they form a cross. Maybe the 3s are being mirrored in the horizontal direction. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, in the input, the 3s are in a vertical line. The output has those 3s in positions that form a cross. For example, the 3s in the input are in positions (row, col) where row is between 4 and 10, and col is between 3 and 8. In the output, the 3s are spread out in a cross shape. For example, in the output, the 3s are in positions that form a cross, with the middle of the cross being the original vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in a certain way. For example, for each cell (i, j) that has a non-zero value, the output has that value in positions (i, j), (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1). But that would be a cross shape. However, looking at Example 1, the output for row 5 has 3s in column 2 and 7, which might be the result of expanding the original 3s in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal direction. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has those 3s spread out in a way that they form a cross. For example, the 3s in the input are in positions (row, col) where col is between 3 and 8. The output has 3s in positions that are mirrored in the horizontal direction. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, for each cell in the input that has a value, the output has that value in positions that form a cross. So for each cell (i, j) with value v, the output has v in (i, j), (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1). But that would be a cross shape. However, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. So if we expand each of those cells into a cross, the output would have a cross shape. But looking at the output for Example 1, the 3s are spread out in a way that forms a cross. For example, in row 4, the 3s are in columns 3-8. In row 5, there's 3s in columns 2 and 7. That seems like a cross shape.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's think. For each cell in the input grid that is not zero, we need to set the output grid's cells in a cross pattern. But maybe the cross is only in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal and vertical directions. For example, for each non-zero cell (i, j), the output has that value in (i, j), (i, 13 - j), (13 - i, j), (13 - i, 13 - j). But that would be a rotation. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal direction. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has those 3s spread out in a way that they form a cross. So for each cell in the input that is non-zero, the output has that value in positions that are mirrored in the horizontal direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero cell, the output has that value in positions that form a cross, but only in certain positions. For example, in the input, the 3s are in a vertical line. The output has those 3s in positions that form a cross. So for each cell in the input, the output has that value in positions that are adjacent in the cross.\n\nBut how to code this. Let's think about the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has those 3s spread out in a cross. So perhaps for each cell in the input that is non-zero, the output has that value in positions that form a cross. For example, the output for a cell (i, j) in the input would have the value in (i, j), (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1). But this would create a cross shape. However, this would also affect neighboring cells, leading to overlapping.\n\nBut looking at the output for Example 1, the 3s are spread out in a way that seems to form a cross. For example, in the output, row 5 has 3s in column 2 and 7. That would be the left and right of the original vertical line. So maybe the transformation is that each non-zero cell in the input is expanded into a cross shape. But how to handle overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal direction. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has those 3s mirrored in the horizontal direction. So for each cell (i, j) in the input, the output has the value in (i, j) and (i, 13 - j - 1), assuming that the grid is 13x14. Wait, the output grid is 13x14. So for a 14-column grid, the mirror would be j and 13 - j. For example, if the input has a 3 in column 3, the output would have a 3 in column 3 and 13-3 = 10 (since 13 is the number of columns minus 1? Wait, the grid is 13 rows and 14 columns. So columns are 0 to 13. So for a column j, the mirrored column is 13 - j. For example, column 3 would be mirrored to 13 - 3 = 10. So in Example 1, the input has 3s in columns 3-8. The output has 3s in columns 3-8, and also mirrored in columns 10-5 (since 13-3=10, 13-8=5). But in the output for Example 1, the 3s are in columns 3-8, but also in columns 2 and 7. Wait, that doesn't match. Maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the vertical direction. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in rows 4-10. The output has those 3s in rows 4-10, but also mirrored in rows 3 and 11. But looking at the output for Example 1, the 3s are in rows 4-10, and in row 5, there's a 3 in column 2 and 7. So that doesn't seem to be a vertical mirror.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think of the examples in terms of patterns. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has those 3s spread out in a way that forms a cross. So perhaps the transformation is that the 3s are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, the vertical line becomes a cross shape, with the 3s in the middle and spread out in the horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think of the cross as a plus sign. For example, the center of the cross is the original vertical line. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal and vertical directions. For example, for each non-zero cell (i, j), the output has that value in (i, j), (i, 13-j), (13-i, j), (13-i, 13-j). But this would be a rotation. However, looking at the examples, that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal direction. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s in columns 3-8. The output has those 3s in columns 3-8 and also mirrored in columns 10-5 (since 13-3=10, 13-8=5). But in the output, the 3s are in columns 3-8, but also in columns 2 and 7. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal direction and then expanded into a cross. For example, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has those 3s mirrored in the horizontal direction, and then expanded into a cross.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the examples in terms of their outputs.\n\nFor Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s in the middle. The output has those 3s spread out in a cross shape. For example, in row 4, the 3s are in columns 3-8. In row 5, the 3s are in columns 2 and 7. In row 6, the 3s are in column 3. In row 7, the 3s are in columns 3-8. In row 8, the 3s are in columns 2 and 7. And so on. So it seems like the 3s are forming a cross shape. The cross has the vertical line in the middle, and horizontal lines extending from it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, for each cell (i, j) in the input, the output has that value in (i, j), (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1). But this would create a cross. However, in the output for Example 1, the 3s are not just in the cross around the original cells but also spread out in a way that suggests a diamond.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being expanded into a diamond shape. For example, the input has a vertical line of 3s, and the output has those 3s in a diamond shape. So the 3s are spread out in a diamond pattern, with the center being the original vertical line.\n\nBut how to code this. Let's think of the diamond shape. For example, the original vertical line of 3s is in the middle. The output has the 3s in positions that form a diamond. For example, in the output, the 3s are in positions that form a diamond around the original line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal direction. For example, for each non-zero cell (i, j), the output has that value in (i, j) and (i, 13 - j). But that would mirror the horizontal direction.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 3s in columns 3-8. The output has 3s in columns 3-8 and also in columns 13-3=10, 13-8=5. So columns 5-10. But in the output, the 3s are in columns 3-8, but also in columns 2 and 7. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the vertical direction. For example, for each non-zero cell (i, j), the output has that value in (i, j) and (13 - i, j). But that would mirror vertically.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 3s in rows 4-10. The output has 3s in those rows and also in rows 13-4=9, 13-10=3. But in the output, the 3s are in rows 4-10, but also in row 3 and 9. However, looking at the output for Example 1, row 3 has 3s in columns 3-8. So that would match.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero cell, the output has that value in the same cell and in the mirrored cell (i, j) and (13 - i, j). But that would mirror vertically. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a vertical line of 2s in the middle. The output has those 2s spread out in a cross shape. If we mirror vertically, the input's 2s would be mirrored in the vertical direction. But the output for Example 2 seems to have a cross shape, not just a vertical mirror.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a vertical line of 5s in the middle. The output has those 5s spread out in a cross shape. So maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero cell, the output has that value in the same cell and in the mirrored cell (i, j) and (13 - i, j). But that would mirror vertically. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero cell, the output has that value in the same cell and in the mirrored cell (i, j) and (13 - i, j), and also mirrored horizontally. But that would be a rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in both horizontal and vertical directions, creating a cross shape.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal direction. For example, for each non-zero cell (i, j), the output has that value in (i, j) and (i, 13 - j). This would mirror the horizontal direction.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 3s in columns 3-8. The output would have those 3s mirrored in columns 10-5 (since 13-3=10, 13-8=5). So columns 5-10. But in the output for Example 1, the 3s are in columns 3-8 and also in columns 2 and 7. That doesn't match. So this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal direction and then expanded into a cross. For example, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has those 3s mirrored in the horizontal direction, and then expanded into a cross.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think of the examples in terms of the output's pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 4, the input has a vertical line of 8s. The output has those 8s spread out in a cross shape. For example, in row 2, the 8s are in columns 4-8. In row 3, the 8s are in columns 4 and 7. In row 4, columns 4 and 7. In row 5, columns 4 and 7. And so on. This seems to form a cross shape, with the vertical line in the middle and horizontal lines extending from it.\n\nSo for the input's vertical line of 8s, the output has a cross shape. So the transformation is that the vertical line is being expanded into a cross shape.\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be that for each non-zero cell, the output has that value in a cross shape. So, for each cell (i, j) in the input, if it's non-zero, then in the output, the value is set in (i, j), (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1). But this would create a cross shape around each cell. However, this might lead to overlapping, but in the examples, it seems to be the case.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. So for each of those cells, the output would have a cross around them. But that would create a cross shape. For example, in the input, the cell (4,3) is 3. So in the output, (4,3), (3,3), (5,3), (4,2), (4,4) are 3. But in the output for Example 1, row 4 has 3s in columns 3-8. Row 5 has 3s in columns 2 and 7. So this seems to fit. For example, the cell (4,3) would have a cross around it, but the other cells in the vertical line would also contribute to the cross.\n\nBut this would mean that for each non-zero cell, we set the output's cells in the cross pattern. However, this might not be the case, since in the output for Example 1, the 3s are in a cross shape, but the original vertical line is preserved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being expanded into a cross shape, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's think about the code.\n\nThe code needs to take a grid and produce a new grid of 13x14. For each cell in the input grid, if it's non-zero, we need to set the output grid's cells in a cross pattern around it.\n\nBut how to do that. For example, for each cell (i, j) in the input grid:\n\nif grid[i][j] != 0:\n\n   for each direction in up, down, left, right, and the cell itself:\n\n       set the output grid's cell (i + di, j + dj) to the value of grid[i][j]\n\nBut this would create a cross shape around each cell. However, this might lead to overlapping. For example, if two cells are adjacent, their cross would overlap. But in the examples, this seems to be the case.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. For each cell in that line, the code would set the output's cross around it. So for the cell (4,3), the output would have (4,3), (3,3), (5,3), (4,2), (4,4) as 3. For the cell (4,4), the output would have (4,4), (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5). So this would create a cross shape around each cell, which would overlap with the cross from the previous cell. This could lead to the 3s forming a cross shape.\n\nBut how would this work for the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has the 3s in a cross shape. This seems to fit.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each non-zero cell in the input, set the output grid's cells in the cross pattern around it. But what about overlapping? For example, if two cells are adjacent, their cross would overlap. But in the output, it seems that the 3s are present in the cross.\n\nBut this would mean that the output grid is filled with 3s in all the cross positions of the input's non-zero cells. But in the examples, the output seems to have the 3s in a cross shape.\n\nBut how to implement this. The code would need to iterate over each cell in the input, and for each non-zero cell, set the output grid's cells in the cross pattern.\n\nBut wait, this would overwrite the output grid. For example, if a cell is part of multiple crosses, it would be set to the value of the input cell. But in the examples, the output seems to have the same value as the input's non-zero cells. So this approach might work.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1. The input has a vertical line of 3s. For each cell in that line, we set the output's cross. So for the cell (4,3), the output's (4,3), (3,3), (5,3), (4,2), (4,4) are set to 3. For the cell (4,4), the output's (4,4), (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5) are set to 3. This would create a cross shape. Similarly for other cells. So the output would have a cross shape of 3s.\n\nBut in the output for Example 1, the 3s are in a cross shape. So this seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly for Example 2, where the input has a vertical line of 2s. The output would have a cross shape of 2s. But in the output for Example 2, the 2s are in a cross shape. So this seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the input has a vertical line of 2s in the middle. The output has the 2s in a cross shape. So this approach would work.\n\nSo the transformation is that for each non-zero cell in the input, the output grid has that value in the cross pattern around it.\n\nBut how to implement this. The code would need to create a new grid, and for each cell in the input, if it is non-zero, then for each of the five positions (up, down, left, right, and itself), set the output grid's cell to the input's value.\n\nBut this would mean that the output grid is filled with the input's non-zero values in their cross patterns.\n\nHowever, this might not be the case for all examples. For example, in Example 3, the input has a vertical line of 5s. The output has the 5s in a cross shape. So this approach would work.\n\nBut what about the test input? The test input has a vertical line of 7s. The output would be a cross shape of 7s.\n\nBut let's check the test input. The test input has a vertical line of 7s in the middle. The output would be a cross shape of 7s. But the test input's output is not provided, but according to the problem, the code should generate the correct output based on the pattern.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new grid of 13x14 filled with 0s\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(13)]\n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Set the cross pattern around this cell\n                # Current cell\n                output[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n                # Up\n                if i - 1 >= 0:\n                    output[i-1][j] = grid[i][j]\n                # Down\n                if i + 1 < 13:\n                    output[i+1][j] = grid[i][j]\n                # Left\n                if j - 1 >= 0:\n                    output[i][j-1] = grid[i][j]\n                # Right\n                if j + 1 < 14:\n                    output[i][j+1] = grid[i][j]\n    return output\n\nWait, but this would set the output grid's cells to the input's value for the cross pattern. But in the examples, this would generate the cross shape.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1. The input has a vertical line of 3s. For each cell in that line, the code would set the cross around it. For example, the cell (4,3) would set (4,3), (3,3), (5,3), (4,2), (4,4) to 3. Similarly for other cells. This would create a cross shape.\n\nBut in the output for Example 1, the 3s are in a cross shape. So this seems to fit.\n\nBut what about overlapping? For example, if two cells are adjacent, their cross patterns would overlap. But the code would overwrite the output grid with the input's value. So in the output, the cells would be set to the input's value. So this would work.\n\nBut let's check Example 2. The input has a vertical line of 2s. The code would generate a cross shape of 2s. The output for Example 2 has a cross shape of 2s. So this would fit.\n\nBut what about the examples where the input has a horizontal line? For example, in Example 3, the input has a horizontal line of 5s. Wait, no, in Example 3, the input has a vertical line of 5s. The code would generate a cross shape of 5s. Which matches the output.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3, the input has a vertical line of 5s in the middle. The output has those 5s spread out in a cross shape. So this approach would work.\n\nBut what about the test input? The test input has a vertical line of 7s. The code would generate a cross shape of 7s. Which would be the correct output.\n\nBut according to the examples, this seems to be the correct pattern. So this is the transformation.\n\nBut wait, looking at Example 2's output, the 2s are spread out in a cross shape. Let's see:\n\nIn the input for Example 2, the 2s are in a vertical line. The code would generate a cross shape. The output for Example 2 has the 2s in a cross shape. So this seems correct.\n\nBut in the output for Example 2, the 2s are in positions that form a cross. For example, in row 3, the 2s are in columns 3-8. But in the output, row 3 has 2s in columns 3-8, but also in row 4, columns 4 and 7. This seems to fit the cross pattern.\n\nSo this approach seems to work for all the examples.\n\nThus, the code would be as above. However, I need to make sure that the output grid is 13x14, which it is.\n\nBut wait, the code initializes output as 13 rows and 14 columns, which is correct.\n\nBut in the code, for each cell in the input, if it's non-zero, the code sets the output's cross pattern. This would generate the correct output.\n\nSo this is the transformation.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let me start by analyzing each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a bunch of 0s except for a vertical line of 3s in the middle. The output seems to have some kind of expansion or movement of those 3s. Wait, in the input, the 3s are in rows 4 (assuming 0-based index) and then rows 5-10. The output shows that the 3s are spread out more. Wait, looking at the output, the 3s are in positions that might be shifted. For example, in the input, row 4 has 3s from column 3 to 8. In the output, row 4 has 3s from column 3 to 8, but then in row 5, the 3s are in column 2 and 7, maybe? Or maybe it's a rotation or some kind of pattern expansion.\n\nWait, looking at the output for example 1, the 3s are spread out in a way that maybe they're forming a diamond shape? Or perhaps they're moving in a certain pattern. Alternatively, maybe the 3s are being mirrored or shifted in some way.\n\nLet me check Example 2. The input has a 2 in the middle, and the output seems to have the 2s spread out in a cross shape. For instance, the input has a vertical line of 2s in the middle, but the output has the 2s in a more spread-out pattern. For example, in the input, row 3 has 2s in columns 3-8, but in the output, the 2s are in positions that form a cross, maybe?\n\nWait, looking at Example 2's output, the 2s are spread out in a way that maybe they're moving to the left and right. For example, in the input, the 2s are in positions that form a vertical line. The output seems to have the 2s in positions that form a cross, with some 2s in the middle and spreading out. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about rotating or reflecting the pattern. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s, and the output has them spread out in a diamond shape. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the 3s in the input are being mirrored or rotated. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s, and the output has them in a horizontal line. Wait, no. Let me check the input and output for Example 1 again.\n\nInput for Example 1: The 3s start at row 4 (assuming rows are 0-based?), but looking at the input, row 4 is the fifth row. The input has 3s from column 3 to 8. The output for that row is the same. But in row 5 of the input, the 3s are in column 3, then 0s, then 3 in column 7. In the output, row 5 has 3s in column 2 and 7. So maybe the 3s are being shifted left and right? Or maybe they are being mirrored?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are being spread out in a way that they form a diamond shape. For example, in the input, the 3s are in a vertical line, but the output has them in a diamond shape, with some 3s in positions that are diagonally adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the 3s are being expanded into a cross shape. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has a 5 in the middle, and the output seems to have the 5s spread out in a way that maybe they are forming a cross. For example, the input has a vertical line of 5s in the middle, and the output has them spread out in a cross shape. But how?\n\nIn Example 3, the input has a vertical line of 5s in the middle. The output has the 5s spread out in a way that they form a cross. For example, in the output, row 2 has 5s in columns 3-8, but then in row 3, the 5s are in columns 3, 5, and 7. Wait, maybe the 5s are being spread out in a way that they form a cross, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the 3s, 2s, 5s, and 8s are being mirrored or rotated in some way. For example, the input for Example 1 has a vertical line of 3s, and the output has them spread out in a way that they form a diamond shape. Maybe the 3s are being mirrored in some way.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the pattern is that for each cell in the input, if it's a certain number (like 3, 2, 5, 8), then in the output, it's replaced with a certain pattern. For example, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a cross or diamond shape. Or perhaps the numbers are being mirrored in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being rotated 90 degrees. But that would require checking if the input and output grids have that pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value, the output is determined by some rule based on the cell's position and the value. For example, if the cell has a value of 3, then in the output, it's part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s, and the output has them spread out in a cross shape. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 4: The input has a vertical line of 8s in the middle. The output seems to have those 8s spread out in a cross shape. For example, in the input, row 2 has 8s in columns 4-8. The output has 8s in columns 4-8, but then in row 3, there's an 8 in column 4 and 7, and so on. So maybe the 8s are being spread out in a cross shape.\n\nWait, looking at the output for Example 4, the 8s are spread out in a way that they form a cross. For example, in row 2, the 8s are in columns 4-8. In row 3, the 8s are in columns 4 and 7. Then in row 4, there's an 8 in column 4, then 8 in column 7. Then in row 5, there's 8 in column 4 and 7, etc. So it seems like the 8s are forming a cross shape. But how does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the input's pattern is being expanded into a cross shape. For example, for each cell that has a value, the output is a cross that expands from that cell. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being mirrored in a certain way. For example, the input for Example 1 has a vertical line of 3s, and the output has them spread out in a way that they form a diamond shape. So perhaps the 3s are being mirrored in a way that they form a diamond.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being mirrored in the vertical and horizontal directions. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has them spread out in a way that they form a diamond shape. So maybe the 3s are being mirrored in the horizontal direction, creating a diamond.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell in the input that has a value, the output is a cross shape centered at that cell. For example, if a cell has a value, then the output has that value in a cross pattern around it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being expanded into a cross shape, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in the input, the 3s are in a vertical line, and the output has them in a cross shape. Similarly for the 2s, 5s, and 8s.\n\nLooking at the examples, the input for Example 1 has a vertical line of 3s, and the output has them spread out in a way that forms a cross. For example, in the output, the 3s are in positions that form a cross. So maybe the transformation is that the input's line of 3s is being expanded into a cross shape.\n\nBut how to model this in code? Let's think about the positions.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s in rows 4-10, columns 3-8. The output has those 3s spread out in a cross shape. For example, in row 4, the 3s are in columns 3-8. In row 5, there's a 3 in column 2 and 7. Then row 6 has a 3 in column 3, and so on. It seems like the 3s are being spread out in a way that forms a cross, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell with a value, the output has that value in a cross shape around it. For example, if a cell has a value, then in the output, that value is placed in positions that form a cross. But how to determine which cells to change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input that is not zero, the output has that value in a cross shape. For example, for each non-zero cell, the output has that value in positions that form a cross. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in a certain way. For example, the input's 3s are in a vertical line, and the output's 3s are spread out in a way that they form a diamond. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal and vertical directions. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has those 3s spread out in a way that they form a cross. Maybe the 3s are being mirrored in the horizontal direction. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, in the input, the 3s are in a vertical line. The output has those 3s in positions that form a cross. For example, the 3s in the input are in positions (row, col) where row is between 4 and 10, and col is between 3 and 8. In the output, the 3s are spread out in a cross shape. For example, in the output, the 3s are in positions that form a cross, with the middle of the cross being the original vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in a certain way. For example, for each cell (i, j) that has a non-zero value, the output has that value in positions (i, j), (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1). But that would be a cross shape. However, looking at Example 1, the output for row 5 has 3s in column 2 and 7, which might be the result of expanding the original 3s in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal direction. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has those 3s spread out in a way that they form a cross. For example, the 3s in the input are in positions (row, col) where col is between 3 and 8. The output has 3s in positions that are mirrored in the horizontal direction. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, for each cell in the input that has a value, the output has that value in positions that form a cross. So for each cell (i, j) with value v, the output has v in (i, j), (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1). But that would be a cross shape. However, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. So if we expand each of those cells into a cross, the output would have a cross shape. But looking at the output for Example 1, the 3s are spread out in a way that forms a cross. For example, in row 4, the 3s are in columns 3-8. In row 5, there's 3s in columns 2 and 7. That seems like a cross shape.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's think. For each cell in the input grid that is not zero, we need to set the output grid's cells in a cross pattern. But maybe the cross is only in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal and vertical directions. For example, for each non-zero cell (i, j), the output has that value in (i, j), (i, 13 - j), (13 - i, j), (13 - i, 13 - j). But that would be a rotation. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal direction. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has those 3s spread out in a way that they form a cross. So for each cell in the input that is non-zero, the output has that value in positions that are mirrored in the horizontal direction.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero cell, the output has that value in positions that form a cross, but only in certain positions. For example, in the input, the 3s are in a vertical line. The output has those 3s in positions that form a cross. So for each cell in the input, the output has that value in positions that are adjacent in the cross.\n\nBut how to code this. Let's think about the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has those 3s spread out in a cross. So perhaps for each cell in the input that is non-zero, the output has that value in positions that form a cross. For example, the output for a cell (i, j) in the input would have the value in (i, j), (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1). But this would create a cross shape. However, this would also affect neighboring cells, leading to overlapping.\n\nBut looking at the output for Example 1, the 3s are spread out in a way that seems to form a cross. For example, in the output, row 5 has 3s in column 2 and 7. That would be the left and right of the original vertical line. So maybe the transformation is that each non-zero cell in the input is expanded into a cross shape. But how to handle overlapping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal direction. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has those 3s mirrored in the horizontal direction. So for each cell (i, j) in the input, the output has the value in (i, j) and (i, 13 - j - 1), assuming that the grid is 13x14. Wait, the output grid is 13x14. So for a 14-column grid, the mirror would be j and 13 - j. For example, if the input has a 3 in column 3, the output would have a 3 in column 3 and 13-3 = 10 (since 13 is the number of columns minus 1? Wait, the grid is 13 rows and 14 columns. So columns are 0 to 13. So for a column j, the mirrored column is 13 - j. For example, column 3 would be mirrored to 13 - 3 = 10. So in Example 1, the input has 3s in columns 3-8. The output has 3s in columns 3-8, and also mirrored in columns 10-5 (since 13-3=10, 13-8=5). But in the output for Example 1, the 3s are in columns 3-8, but also in columns 2 and 7. Wait, that doesn't match. Maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the vertical direction. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in rows 4-10. The output has those 3s in rows 4-10, but also mirrored in rows 3 and 11. But looking at the output for Example 1, the 3s are in rows 4-10, and in row 5, there's a 3 in column 2 and 7. So that doesn't seem to be a vertical mirror.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think of the examples in terms of patterns. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has those 3s spread out in a way that forms a cross. So perhaps the transformation is that the 3s are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, the vertical line becomes a cross shape, with the 3s in the middle and spread out in the horizontal and vertical directions.\n\nBut how to model this. Let's think of the cross as a plus sign. For example, the center of the cross is the original vertical line. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal and vertical directions. For example, for each non-zero cell (i, j), the output has that value in (i, j), (i, 13-j), (13-i, j), (13-i, 13-j). But this would be a rotation. However, looking at the examples, that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal direction. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s in columns 3-8. The output has those 3s in columns 3-8 and also mirrored in columns 10-5 (since 13-3=10, 13-8=5). But in the output, the 3s are in columns 3-8, but also in columns 2 and 7. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal direction and then expanded into a cross. For example, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has those 3s mirrored in the horizontal direction, and then expanded into a cross.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think about the examples in terms of their outputs.\n\nFor Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s in the middle. The output has those 3s spread out in a cross shape. For example, in row 4, the 3s are in columns 3-8. In row 5, the 3s are in columns 2 and 7. In row 6, the 3s are in column 3. In row 7, the 3s are in columns 3-8. In row 8, the 3s are in columns 2 and 7. And so on. So it seems like the 3s are forming a cross shape. The cross has the vertical line in the middle, and horizontal lines extending from it. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, for each cell (i, j) in the input, the output has that value in (i, j), (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1). But this would create a cross. However, in the output for Example 1, the 3s are not just in the cross around the original cells but also spread out in a way that suggests a diamond.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being expanded into a diamond shape. For example, the input has a vertical line of 3s, and the output has those 3s in a diamond shape. So the 3s are spread out in a diamond pattern, with the center being the original vertical line.\n\nBut how to code this. Let's think of the diamond shape. For example, the original vertical line of 3s is in the middle. The output has the 3s in positions that form a diamond. For example, in the output, the 3s are in positions that form a diamond around the original line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal direction. For example, for each non-zero cell (i, j), the output has that value in (i, j) and (i, 13 - j). But that would mirror the horizontal direction.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 3s in columns 3-8. The output has 3s in columns 3-8 and also in columns 13-3=10, 13-8=5. So columns 5-10. But in the output, the 3s are in columns 3-8, but also in columns 2 and 7. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the vertical direction. For example, for each non-zero cell (i, j), the output has that value in (i, j) and (13 - i, j). But that would mirror vertically.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 3s in rows 4-10. The output has 3s in those rows and also in rows 13-4=9, 13-10=3. But in the output, the 3s are in rows 4-10, but also in row 3 and 9. However, looking at the output for Example 1, row 3 has 3s in columns 3-8. So that would match.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero cell, the output has that value in the same cell and in the mirrored cell (i, j) and (13 - i, j). But that would mirror vertically. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a vertical line of 2s in the middle. The output has those 2s spread out in a cross shape. If we mirror vertically, the input's 2s would be mirrored in the vertical direction. But the output for Example 2 seems to have a cross shape, not just a vertical mirror.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a vertical line of 5s in the middle. The output has those 5s spread out in a cross shape. So maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero cell, the output has that value in the same cell and in the mirrored cell (i, j) and (13 - i, j). But that would mirror vertically. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero cell, the output has that value in the same cell and in the mirrored cell (i, j) and (13 - i, j), and also mirrored horizontally. But that would be a rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in both horizontal and vertical directions, creating a cross shape.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal direction. For example, for each non-zero cell (i, j), the output has that value in (i, j) and (i, 13 - j). This would mirror the horizontal direction.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 3s in columns 3-8. The output would have those 3s mirrored in columns 10-5 (since 13-3=10, 13-8=5). So columns 5-10. But in the output for Example 1, the 3s are in columns 3-8 and also in columns 2 and 7. That doesn't match. So this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being mirrored in the horizontal direction and then expanded into a cross. For example, the input has a vertical line of 3s. The output has those 3s mirrored in the horizontal direction, and then expanded into a cross.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe I need to think of the examples in terms of the output's pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 4, the input has a vertical line of 8s. The output has those 8s spread out in a cross shape. For example, in row 2, the 8s are in columns 4-8. In row 3, the 8s are in columns 4 and 7. In row 4, columns 4 and 7. In row 5, columns 4 and 7. And so on. This seems to form a cross shape, with the vertical line in the middle and horizontal lines extending from it.\n\nSo for the input's vertical line of 8s, the output has a cross shape. So the transformation is that the vertical line is being expanded into a cross shape.\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be that for each non-zero cell, the output has that value in a cross shape. So, for each cell (i, j) in the input, if it's non-zero, then in the output, the value is set in (i, j), (i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1). But this would create a cross shape around each cell. However, this might lead to overlapping, but in the examples, it seems to be the case.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. So for each of those cells, the output would have a cross around them. But that would create a cross shape. For example, in the input, the cell (4,3) is 3. So in the output, (4,3), (3,3), (5,3), (4,2), (4,4) are 3. But in the output for Example 1, row 4 has 3s in columns 3-8. Row 5 has 3s in columns 2 and 7. So this seems to fit. For example, the cell (4,3) would have a cross around it, but the other cells in the vertical line would also contribute to the cross.\n\nBut this would mean that for each non-zero cell, we set the output's cells in the cross pattern. However, this might not be the case, since in the output for Example 1, the 3s are in a cross shape, but the original vertical line is preserved.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the non-zero cells are being expanded into a cross shape, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's think about the code.\n\nThe code needs to take a grid and produce a new grid of 13x14. For each cell in the input grid, if it's non-zero, we need to set the output grid's cells in a cross pattern around it.\n\nBut how to do that. For example, for each cell (i, j) in the input grid:\n\nif grid[i][j] != 0:\n\n   for each direction in up, down, left, right, and the cell itself:\n\n       set the output grid's cell (i + di, j + dj) to the value of grid[i][j]\n\nBut this would create a cross shape around each cell. However, this might lead to overlapping. For example, if two cells are adjacent, their cross would overlap. But in the examples, this seems to be the case.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 3s. For each cell in that line, the code would set the output's cross around it. So for the cell (4,3), the output would have (4,3), (3,3), (5,3), (4,2), (4,4) as 3. For the cell (4,4), the output would have (4,4), (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5). So this would create a cross shape around each cell, which would overlap with the cross from the previous cell. This could lead to the 3s forming a cross shape.\n\nBut how would this work for the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output has the 3s in a cross shape. This seems to fit.\n\nSo the transformation is: for each non-zero cell in the input, set the output grid's cells in the cross pattern around it. But what about overlapping? For example, if two cells are adjacent, their cross would overlap. But in the output, it seems that the 3s are present in the cross.\n\nBut this would mean that the output grid is filled with 3s in all the cross positions of the input's non-zero cells. But in the examples, the output seems to have the 3s in a cross shape.\n\nBut how to implement this. The code would need to iterate over each cell in the input, and for each non-zero cell, set the output grid's cells in the cross pattern.\n\nBut wait, this would overwrite the output grid. For example, if a cell is part of multiple crosses, it would be set to the value of the input cell. But in the examples, the output seems to have the same value as the input's non-zero cells. So this approach might work.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1. The input has a vertical line of 3s. For each cell in that line, we set the output's cross. So for the cell (4,3), the output's (4,3), (3,3), (5,3), (4,2), (4,4) are set to 3. For the cell (4,4), the output's (4,4), (3,4), (5,4), (4,3), (4,5) are set to 3. This would create a cross shape. Similarly for other cells. So the output would have a cross shape of 3s.\n\nBut in the output for Example 1, the 3s are in a cross shape. So this seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly for Example 2, where the input has a vertical line of 2s. The output would have a cross shape of 2s. But in the output for Example 2, the 2s are in a cross shape. So this seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the input has a vertical line of 2s in the middle. The output has the 2s in a cross shape. So this approach would work.\n\nSo the transformation is that for each non-zero cell in the input, the output grid has that value in the cross pattern around it.\n\nBut how to implement this. The code would need to create a new grid, and for each cell in the input, if it is non-zero, then for each of the five positions (up, down, left, right, and itself), set the output grid's cell to the input's value.\n\nBut this would mean that the output grid is filled with the input's non-zero values in their cross patterns.\n\nHowever, this might not be the case for all examples. For example, in Example 3, the input has a vertical line of 5s. The output has the 5s in a cross shape. So this approach would work.\n\nBut what about the test input? The test input has a vertical line of 7s. The output would be a cross shape of 7s.\n\nBut let's check the test input. The test input has a vertical line of 7s in the middle. The output would be a cross shape of 7s. But the test input's output is not provided, but according to the problem, the code should generate the correct output based on the pattern.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new grid of 13x14 filled with 0s\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(13)]\n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Set the cross pattern around this cell\n                # Current cell\n                output[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n                # Up\n                if i - 1 >= 0:\n                    output[i-1][j] = grid[i][j]\n                # Down\n                if i + 1 < 13:\n                    output[i+1][j] = grid[i][j]\n                # Left\n                if j - 1 >= 0:\n                    output[i][j-1] = grid[i][j]\n                # Right\n                if j + 1 < 14:\n                    output[i][j+1] = grid[i][j]\n    return output\n\nWait, but this would set the output grid's cells to the input's value for the cross pattern. But in the examples, this would generate the cross shape.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1. The input has a vertical line of 3s. For each cell in that line, the code would set the cross around it. For example, the cell (4,3) would set (4,3), (3,3), (5,3), (4,2), (4,4) to 3. Similarly for other cells. This would create a cross shape.\n\nBut in the output for Example 1, the 3s are in a cross shape. So this seems to fit.\n\nBut what about overlapping? For example, if two cells are adjacent, their cross patterns would overlap. But the code would overwrite the output grid with the input's value. So in the output, the cells would be set to the input's value. So this would work.\n\nBut let's check Example 2. The input has a vertical line of 2s. The code would generate a cross shape of 2s. The output for Example 2 has a cross shape of 2s. So this would fit.\n\nBut what about the examples where the input has a horizontal line? For example, in Example 3, the input has a horizontal line of 5s. Wait, no, in Example 3, the input has a vertical line of 5s. The code would generate a cross shape of 5s. Which matches the output.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3, the input has a vertical line of 5s in the middle. The output has those 5s spread out in a cross shape. So this approach would work.\n\nBut what about the test input? The test input has a vertical line of 7s. The code would generate a cross shape of 7s. Which would be the correct output.\n\nBut according to the examples, this seems to be the correct pattern. So this is the transformation.\n\nBut wait, looking at Example 2's output, the 2s are spread out in a cross shape. Let's see:\n\nIn the input for Example 2, the 2s are in a vertical line. The code would generate a cross shape. The output for Example 2 has the 2s in a cross shape. So this seems correct.\n\nBut in the output for Example 2, the 2s are in positions that form a cross. For example, in row 3, the 2s are in columns 3-8. But in the output, row 3 has 2s in columns 3-8, but also in row 4, columns 4 and 7. This seems to fit the cross pattern.\n\nSo this approach seems to work for all the examples.\n\nThus, the code would be as above. However, I need to make sure that the output grid is 13x14, which it is.\n\nBut wait, the code initializes output as 13 rows and 14 columns, which is correct.\n\nBut in the code, for each cell in the input, if it's non-zero, the code sets the output's cross pattern. This would generate the correct output.\n\nSo this is the transformation.\n"
