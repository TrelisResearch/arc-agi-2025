          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 23x23. The input seems to have some sequences that are repeated. For instance, looking at the first few rows of the input and output:\n\nInput rows start with 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6... and the output starts with 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6... So maybe the first part is the same. But then in the output, there's a row that's 6 1 2 3 4 5 6... which seems to be a shift. Wait, maybe there's some kind of pattern where certain parts are shifted or modified.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the first row is the same as the input's first row. Then the second row is the same as the input's second row. Wait, but the third row of the input is 6 1 1 2 3 4 5 6... and the output's third row is 6 1 1 2 3 4 5 6... So maybe the first part of the input is the same as the output. But then there are some changes in the later parts.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being modified. Let me check more carefully. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row that starts with 6 1 2 3 4 5 6... and the output has the same. But in some rows, like the 8th row of the input, it's 6 1 0 0 0 0 6 6... and the output is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6... So maybe there's a transformation where certain positions are being replaced with a sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a shifted version of the input. For example, looking at the first few rows of input and output, the first row of input is 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0 0 4 5 6 1 2 3. The output's first row is the same. Then the second row is 6 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0 0 4 5 6 1 2 3, which is the same as the input's second row. Wait, but the third row of input is 6 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0 0 4 5 6 1 2 3. The output's third row is the same. Hmm, so maybe the first few rows are the same? But then there's a row in the input that's different. Like, in the 7th row of input, the first part is 6 1 2 3 4 5 5 6... and the output is 6 1 2 3 4 5 5 6... same as input. But in the 8th row of input, the input is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3. The output is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3. So the seventh element in the input is 6, but in the output it's 6 again. Wait, maybe I'm not seeing the pattern here.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input starts with 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3... and the output is the same. Then in the input, the fourth row is 4 5 6 7 1 2 3... and the output is the same. But then in the fifth row of input, the input is 4 5 6 7 1 2 3... and the output is the same. However, in the sixth row of input, the input is 4 5 6 7 1 1 2 3... and the output is 4 5 6 7 1 1 2 3... same as input. But then in the seventh row of input, the input is 4 5 6 7 1 2 2 3... and output is same. But then in the eighth row of input, the input is 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 3... and the output is same. Then in the ninth row of input, the input is 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 4... and the output is same. So maybe the first part of the input is the same as the output. But then there are some rows where the input and output differ. For example, in the 10th row of input for Example 2, the input is 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 7... and the output is 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 7... same as input. So maybe the output is the same as the input? But that can't be, because the examples have different outputs. Wait, but looking at the first example's output, the first row is same as input. But in the first example's input and output, some rows are same, others are different. Wait, but in the first example, the output for row 8 is different. Let me check again.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's 8th row is 6 1 0 0 0 0 6 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3. The output's 8th row is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3. So the first part of the input row is 6 1 0 0 0 0 6 6... and the output is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6... So the 0s are replaced by 2,3,4,5,6. Similarly, in the 9th row of input, the input is 6 1 0 0 0 0 6 1... and the output is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1... So maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the zeros are replaced with a sequence. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain parts of the grid are being shifted or replaced. Let's think about the third example. In Example 3, the input starts with 5 6 7 8 0 0 0 0 5 6 7 8... and the output is 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8... So the zeros in the input are replaced by 1,2,3,4. Then in the next rows, there are similar patterns. For example, the input's 8th row is 6 7 0 0 0 0 4 4... and the output is 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 4... So the zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. Wait, but that's not consistent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the values are being replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value. For example, in the first example, the first row has 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6... and the output is same. Then in the 8th row of the input, the first part is 6 1 0 0 0 0 6 6... and the output is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6... So the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. Then in the 9th row of input, the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. But in the third example, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. So maybe the pattern is that in certain regions, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain parts are replaced by a sequence. For example, in the first example, the first part of the row is a sequence that's preserved, but then in some parts, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from 1,2,3,4, etc.\n\nAnother approach: look for the transformation between the input and output of each example. Let's take Example 1. The input's first row is 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0 0 4 5 6 1 2 3. The output is the same except for the 0s. Wait, the output's first row is 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3. So the 0s in positions 14-16 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?) are replaced by 1,2,3. Then the 17th element is 4, etc. So maybe in the input, whenever there's a 0, it's replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input row 1: 5 6 7 8 0 0 0 0 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3. The output is 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3. So the first four zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. Then the next four zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4 again. But in the next rows, like row 8 of example 3, the input is 6 7 0 0 0 0 4 4... and the output is 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 4... So the four zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. So the replacement depends on the position. Maybe the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced by a sequence that increments based on their position. For example, in the first example, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. In the third example, the first four zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. Then in the next row, the four zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the grid is transformed by replacing certain sequences. For example, in the first example, the first part of the grid is a sequence that is preserved, but in some parts, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value. But how to determine which parts?\n\nLooking at the third example's input and output, the first row's zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. Then in the next row, the zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. But how does that relate to the position? Maybe the replacement is based on the row number. For example, in row 0 (assuming 0-based), the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. Then in row 1, the zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in certain regions of the grid, the values are shifted. For example, the first part of the grid is a sequence that is preserved, but in certain areas, the values are shifted. For example, in Example 1, the first part of the grid has a sequence that is preserved, but then in the middle, there's a block of zeros that are replaced by a sequence.\n\nAnother approach: look for the transformation in the test input. The test input is:\n\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 0 0 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 0 0 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 0 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 0 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 0 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 9 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 6\n\nLooking at the test input, the first few rows have sequences like 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6. The output for the test input is not given, but the task is to find the transformation. However, the test input is just for context.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, it seems that the transformation involves replacing certain sequences. For example, in Example 3, the input has zeros that are replaced by a sequence. Maybe the pattern is that whenever there are zeros in a certain region, they are replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value.\n\nAnother observation: in the first example, the output seems to have a pattern where certain positions are being filled with a sequence. For instance, in the first example's output, the first row is the same as the input, but in the 8th row, the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. Then in the 9th row, the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5 again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is being transformed by replacing certain parts with sequences. For example, in the first example, the first part of the grid is preserved, but in the middle, there's a block of zeros that are replaced by a sequence. The sequence could be a repeating pattern.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation might involve shifting values in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the first part of the grid is a sequence that is preserved, but in some parts, the values are shifted. For example, in the first example's 8th row, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from 2 and increases by 1.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the third example's output, the first row's zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. Then the next row's zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. This suggests that the replacement depends on the row. For example, row 0 (assuming 0-based) replaces zeros with 1,2,3,4. Then row 1 replaces with 8,1,2,3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the grid is being transformed by replacing certain positions with a sequence that is determined by the position. For example, in the first example, the first part of the grid is preserved, and then in the middle, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from the value of the first element after the zeros.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in each row, the first part is preserved, and then certain parts are replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value. For example, in the first example, the first row has a sequence of 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6... and then the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4,5,6. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output, the first row is the same as the input. Then in the 8th row of the input, the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. Then in the 9th row of the input, the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. So maybe the transformation is that in certain positions, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value, and the value depends on the row.\n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the pattern is that in each row, the first part is preserved, and then in the middle, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from the value of the first element in the row after the zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the first part is kept as is, and then the zeros are replaced by a sequence that is determined by the row's position. For example, in the first example, the first row's zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. Then the next row's zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: look for the transformation in the third example. The input has a row where the first part is 5 6 7 8 0 0 0 0 5 6 7 8... and the output is 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8... So the four zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. Then in another row, the input is 6 7 0 0 0 0 4 4... and the output is 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 4... So the four zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. This suggests that the replacement depends on the position of the zeros. For example, if the zeros are in a certain part of the row, they are replaced by a sequence starting from a certain value.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the pattern is that in each row, the first part of the row is preserved, and then the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from the value of the first element after the zeros. For example, in the third example's first row, the zeros are in positions 4-7. The first element after the zeros is 5 (the 9th element). So the sequence starts at 1, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the sequence is determined by the row's index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in each row, the first part of the row is a sequence that is preserved, and the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from the value of the first element in the row. For example, in the third example's first row, the first element is 5, but the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: in the first example, the output for the 8th row is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6... which suggests that the zeros in the input are replaced by 2,3,4,5. The input's 8th row is 6 1 0 0 0 0 6 6... So the zeros are in positions 2-5. The first element after the zeros is 6, which is the value of the 7th element. So the sequence starts from 2, which is the value of the first element after the zeros minus 4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the first part is preserved, and then the zeros are replaced by a sequence that increments from the value of the first element in the row. For example, in the third example's first row, the first element is 5, and the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. That doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can be implemented in code. Let's think about what the transformation might be.\n\nLooking at the third example, the input has a row with 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6. Wait, but the output for this row is the same as the input. Hmm, but in the third example's input, the 5th row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6. So no change. But in the third example's input, the 6th row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6. The output is the same. So maybe in some rows, the zeros are not replaced. But in other rows, they are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing certain sequences with a sequence that starts from a certain value. For example, in the first example, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from the value of the first element after the zeros.\n\nBut how to implement this in code? For each row, check for zeros, and replace them with a sequence that starts from a certain value. But what is that value?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each occurrence of 0 with a sequence that is determined by the position. For example, in the first example, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from 1 and increments by 1. But how to determine the starting value?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with a value that is determined by the row and column. For example, in the first example's 8th row, the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. This could be the value of the first element after the zeros minus 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with the value of the next element in the row. For example, if a zero is at position i, then it is replaced by the value at position i+1. But this may not hold for all examples.\n\nIn the first example's 8th row, the input is 6 1 0 0 0 0 6 6... So the first zero is at position 2. The next element is 0, then 0, then 0, then 0. The next element after the zeros is 6. So replacing the zeros with 6? But in the output, they are replaced with 2,3,4,5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think about the transformation as a sequence of steps that can be implemented.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the first row is the same as the input. The second row is the same as the input. The third row is the same as the input. But in the 8th row of the input, the zeros are replaced with 2,3,4,5. So maybe the transformation is that in certain positions, the zeros are replaced with a sequence that is determined by the row and column.\n\nAnother observation: in the first example, the first part of the grid is a sequence that is preserved. Then in certain parts, the values are shifted. For example, in the first example's 8th row, the first part is 6 1, then the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5, then 6,6. So the sequence is 2,3,4,5, which is a sequence of 4 elements.\n\nIn the third example's first row, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. So the sequence is 4 elements. This suggests that the number of elements replaced is 4.\n\nAnother observation: in the first example, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from 1 and increments by 1 for four elements. In the third example, the first row's zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. In the third example's 8th row, the zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. This suggests that the starting value depends on the position.\n\nBut how to determine the starting value? Maybe the starting value is the value of the element that comes after the zeros. For example, in the third example's first row, the zeros are in positions 4-7, and the first element after the zeros is 5. So the starting value is 1. But 5-4=1, which fits. In the third example's 8th row, the zeros are in positions 2-5, and the first element after the zeros is 4. So the starting value is 8, which is 4 + 4 = 8. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is the value of the first element after the zeros, and the sequence is a sequence of four elements starting from that value. For example, in the third example's first row, the first element after the zeros is 5, so the sequence is 5,6,7,8. But in the output, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is the value of the first element before the zeros. For example, in the third example's first row, the first element before the zeros is 8, and the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. But that's not clear.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the pattern is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with the value of the first element in the row. For example, in the third example's first row, the first element is 5, and the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with the value of the next non-zero element. For example, in the third example's first row, the first element after the zeros is 5, so the zeros are replaced by 5,6,7,8. But in the output, they are replaced by 1,2,3,4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a sequence of steps that can be implemented. For example, in each row, the first part is preserved, and then the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the first example's output, the first row is the same as the input. The second row is the same as the input. The third row is the same as the input. But in the 8th row, the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. This suggests that in certain rows, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from 2 and increments by 1 for four elements.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are affected and what the starting value is?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with a value that is determined by the row number. For example, in row i, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from i mod 9 or something like that.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, and then incrementing by 1 for each subsequent zero. For example, in the third example's first row, the first non-zero element after the zeros is 5. So the first zero is replaced by 5, then 6, then 7, then 8. But in the output, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with a value that is determined by the position in the row. For example, in the first example, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4, which are the first four values.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAnother observation: in the first example, the output for the 8th row is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6... which suggests that the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. This is a sequence of four elements starting from 2.\n\nIn the third example's first row, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. So the sequence is four elements starting from 1.\n\nIn the third example's 8th row, the zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. So the sequence starts from 8, then 1,2,3.\n\nThis suggests that the sequence depends on the row. Maybe the starting value is determined by the row's index. For example, in row 0, the starting value is 1, in row 1, it's 8, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is determined by the row's position. For example, in row 0, the starting value is 1; in row 1, it's 8; in row 2, it's 1; and so on. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is determined by the column where the zeros are located. For example, in the first example's 8th row, the zeros are in columns 2-5. The starting value is 2, which is the column index plus 0.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows: for each row, the first part is preserved, and the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from the value of the first element in the row, but this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, but this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is, but I need to make an educated guess. Let's try to find a pattern that fits the examples.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the first row is the same as the input. The 8th row has zeros replaced by 2,3,4,5. The 9th row has zeros replaced by 2,3,4,5. This suggests that in these rows, the zeros are replaced by a sequence of four elements starting from 2.\n\nIn the third example's first row, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. This suggests that in row 0, the sequence starts from 1. In the third example's 8th row, the zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. This suggests that in row 7, the sequence starts from 8.\n\nSo maybe the starting value is determined by the row number. For example, in row i, the starting value is (i % 9) + 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is determined by the row number. For example, in the first example, the 8th row (assuming 0-based, it's row 7) has zeros replaced by 2,3,4,5. So starting value is 2. If the row number is 7, then 7 mod 9 is 7, and 7 + 1 = 8, which doesn't fit. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is determined by the row number. For example, in the first example's 8th row (row 7), the starting value is 2, which is 7 - 5 = 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is determined by the position of the zeros in the row. For example, in the first example's 8th row, the zeros are in positions 2-5. The starting value is 2, which is the position of the first zero plus 0.\n\nBut this is not consistent.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with a value that is determined by the row and column. For example, in the first example's 8th row, the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. This could be the value of the first element in the row, which is 6, minus 4. 6-4=2. Then the next value is 3, and so on. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn the third example's first row, the first element is 5, and the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. 5-4=1. So this fits. In the third example's 8th row, the first element is 6, and the zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. 6 + 2 = 8. So this fits.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for a row, if there are zeros, replace them with a sequence that starts from (first non-zero element in the row - 4) or (first non-zero element + 2), depending on the row.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples. Let's try to implement this.\n\nSo, for each row in the grid:\n\n- Find the first non-zero element in the row.\n- If there are zeros, replace them with a sequence starting from (first_non_zero - 4), and increment by 1 for each subsequent zero.\n\nBut in the first example's 8th row, the first non-zero element after the zeros is 6. So 6-4=2, which matches the sequence 2,3,4,5.\n\nIn the third example's first row, the first non-zero element is 5. 5-4=1, which matches the sequence 1,2,3,4.\n\nIn the third example's 8th row, the first non-zero element is 4. 4 + 2 = 6, but the sequence starts at 8. So this doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is first_non_zero + 4. For the third example's 8th row, first_non_zero is 4. 4 +4=8, which matches the sequence 8,1,2,3. But this would mean that the sequence starts at 8, then 1,2,3. But why would the sequence start at 8 and then continue with 1,2,3? That doesn't make sense.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe the pattern is that the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from the value of the first non-zero element in the row, and then wraps around. For example, if the first non-zero is 5, then the sequence is 1,2,3,4. If the first non-zero is 6, the sequence is 2,3,4,5. If the first non-zero is 4, the sequence is 8,1,2,3. But how?\n\nThis seems to be a possible pattern. For example, if the first non-zero element is x, then the sequence is (x - 4) mod 9, (x-3) mod 9, (x-2) mod 9, (x-1) mod 9. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn the third example's first row, x is 5. 5-4=1, 5-3=2, 5-2=3, 5-1=4. So sequence is 1,2,3,4. This fits.\n\nIn the third example's 8th row, x is 4. 4-4=0, 4-3=1, 4-2=2, 4-1=3. But the sequence in the output is 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit. But if we take (x-4 +9) mod 9, then 0 +9=9, 1, 2, 3. But the sequence in the output is 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence starts from x-4 +9 if x-4 is negative. For example, in the third example's 8th row, x is 4. x-4=0. So the sequence is 0,1,2,3. But the output is 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very unclear. Maybe the pattern is that the sequence starts from x-4, but if x-4 is less than 1, it wraps around to 9. For example, x=4: 4-4=0 \u2192 9, then 1, 2, 3. But the output is 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's think about the transformation as a shift in the grid. For example, in the first example, the first part of the grid is preserved, but in certain parts, the values are shifted. For example, in the first example's 8th row, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that is a shift of the original values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, but this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to determine the exact pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to implement a transformation where, for each row, if there are zeros, they are replaced by a sequence that starts from 1 and increments by 1 for four elements. But this would not fit the third example's 8th row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, but this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each row, replace the zeros with a sequence that starts from 1 and increments by 1 for four elements. This would fit the first example's first row and the third example's first row. But it would not fit the third example's 8th row. However, this is a possible pattern.\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is that the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from the value of the first non-zero element in the row minus 4, but if that is less than 1, it wraps around.\n\nFor example, in the third example's first row, first non-zero is 5. 5-4=1. So sequence is 1,2,3,4.\n\nIn the third example's 8th row, first non-zero is 4. 4-4=0. So 0 + 9 = 9, then 1,2,3. But the output is 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence starts from the first non-zero element minus 4, but if it's less than 1, it wraps around to 9. For example, 0 becomes 9, 1 becomes 1, etc. But in the third example's 8th row, the sequence would be 9,1,2,3. But the output is 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that replaces the zeros in a certain way, even if it's not perfect. For example, in the first example, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from 1 and increments by 1 for four elements. In the third example, the first row's zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. The 8th row's zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. This suggests that the starting value is determined by the row index.\n\nLet me try to code this: for each row, if there are zeros, replace them with a sequence that starts from (row_index + 1) % 9, and increments by 1 for four elements. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is (row_index + 1). For example, in the first example's 8th row (row index 7), starting value is 8. So the sequence is 8,9,10,11. But since values are 0-9, this would wrap around. But this doesn't fit the example.\n\nThis is very challenging. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following code: for each row, replace the zeros with a sequence of four consecutive numbers starting from 1, but this might not fit all examples. However, given the examples, this is a possible approach.\n\nBut in the third example's 8th row, the zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. This suggests that the starting value is 8. So for row 7 (0-based), starting value is 8. This could be row_index + 1. For row 7, 7 + 1 = 8. So this fits.\n\nIn the third example's first row (row 0), starting value is 1, which is 0 + 1. This fits. In the third example's 8th row (row 7), starting value is 8. This fits. So the pattern could be: for each row, the starting value is row_index + 1. Then, the sequence is starting_value, starting_value + 1, starting_value + 2, starting_value + 3, modulo 10.\n\nBut let's test this:\n\nFor row 0, starting value is 1. Sequence is 1,2,3,4. This fits the third example's first row.\n\nFor row 7, starting value is 8. Sequence is 8,9,10,11. But since values are 0-9, 10 becomes 0, 11 becomes 1. So the sequence would be 8,9,0,1. But in the third example's 8th row, the sequence is 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in the third example's 8th row, the output is 8,1,2,3. So the sequence is 8,1,2,3. This suggests that the starting value is 8, and then the next values are 1,2,3. This could be a sequence that wraps around from 9 to 1.\n\nSo the sequence is starting_value, starting_value + 1, starting_value + 2, starting_value + 3, but with values modulo 10, except for the first value. Or maybe the sequence is starting_value, (starting_value + 1) % 10, (starting_value + 2) % 10, (starting_value + 3) % 10.\n\nFor row 7, starting value is 8. The sequence would be 8,9,0,1. But in the third example's 8th row, the sequence is 8,1,2,3. This doesn't fit.\n\nSo this approach is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Let's proceed with the following code: for each row, replace the zeros with a sequence that starts from 1 and increments by 1 for four elements. This would fit some examples, but not all. However, given the time, I'll proceed with this.\n\nBut in the third example's 8th row, the sequence is 8,1,2,3. This suggests that the starting value is 8, and then the sequence is 1,2,3. This is not consistent with the previous pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is 8, and the sequence is 8, 1, 2, 3. This could be a pattern where the sequence starts at 8, then wraps around to 1, 2, 3.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the sequence is determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the sequence is (i % 9) + 1, (i % 9) + 2, (i % 9) + 3, (i % 9) + 4. But this would give for row 7: 8,9,10,11 \u2192 8,9,0,1. But the example has 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that replaces the zeros in each row with a sequence that starts from the value of the first non-zero element in the row, and then increments by 1 for each subsequent zero. For example, in the third example's first row, the first non-zero element is 5. So the sequence is 5,6,7,8. But the output is 1,2,3,4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to determine the exact pattern, I'll proceed with the following code: for each row, if there are zeros, replace them with a sequence of four consecutive numbers starting from 1, incrementing by 1. This is a possible pattern, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nBut this is not correct for the third example's 8th row. However, given the time, I'll proceed with this.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for i, val in enumerate(row):\n            if val == 0:\n                # replace with 1,2,3,4\n                # but need to track how many zeros have been replaced\n                # this is not correct, but for the purpose of this example, assume that zeros are replaced with 1,2,3,4\n                # but this is not correct for all cases\n                # this is a placeholder\n                pass\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct. So, I need to think of a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: in the first example, the output for the 8th row is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6... which suggests that the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. This is a sequence of four elements starting from 2. In the third example's first row, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. So the starting value is 1 for the first row, 2 for the 8th row.\n\nThis suggests that the starting value is the row index + 1. For row 0, starting value is 1. For row 7, starting value is 8. But in the third example's 8th row, the starting value is 8, and the sequence is 8,1,2,3. This suggests that the sequence is 8,1,2,3, which is 8, then 1,2,3.\n\nThis could be a pattern where the starting value is row_index + 1, and the sequence is starting_value, (starting_value + 1) % 9, (starting_value + 2) % 9, (starting_value + 3) % 9. But for row 7, starting_value is 8, so the sequence would be 8,9,0,1. But the example has 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence is starting_value, starting_value + 1, starting_value + 2, starting_value + 3, but with values modulo 9, and if the value is 0, it is replaced by 9.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: for each row, replace the zeros with a sequence that starts from (row_index + 1) and increments by 1 for four elements, modulo 9, with 0 replaced by 9.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row_index, row in enumerate(grid):\n        new_row = []\n        for col_index, val in enumerate(row):\n            if val == 0:\n                # calculate the starting value\n                start = (row_index + 1) % 9\n                # replace with start, start+1, start+2, start+3\n                # but need to handle modulo\n                # for four elements\n                # but how to determine which zeros to replace?\n                # this is not clear\n                # this is a placeholder\n                pass\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nThis is not correct, but I'm out of ideas. Given the examples, I'll have to proceed with the best possible guess.\n\nFinal answer:\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 23x23. The input seems to have some sequences that are repeated. For instance, looking at the first few rows of the input and output:\n\nInput rows start with 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6... and the output starts with 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6... So maybe the first part is the same. But then in the output, there's a row that's 6 1 2 3 4 5 6... which seems to be a shift. Wait, maybe there's some kind of pattern where certain parts are shifted or modified.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the first row is the same as the input's first row. Then the second row is the same as the input's second row. Wait, but the third row of the input is 6 1 1 2 3 4 5 6... and the output's third row is 6 1 1 2 3 4 5 6... So maybe the first part of the input is the same as the output. But then there are some changes in the later parts.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being modified. Let me check more carefully. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row that starts with 6 1 2 3 4 5 6... and the output has the same. But in some rows, like the 8th row of the input, it's 6 1 0 0 0 0 6 6... and the output is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6... So maybe there's a transformation where certain positions are being replaced with a sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a shifted version of the input. For example, looking at the first few rows of input and output, the first row of input is 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0 0 4 5 6 1 2 3. The output's first row is the same. Then the second row is 6 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0 0 4 5 6 1 2 3, which is the same as the input's second row. Wait, but the third row of input is 6 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0 0 4 5 6 1 2 3. The output's third row is the same. Hmm, so maybe the first few rows are the same? But then there's a row in the input that's different. Like, in the 7th row of input, the first part is 6 1 2 3 4 5 5 6... and the output is 6 1 2 3 4 5 5 6... same as input. But in the 8th row of input, the input is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3. The output is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3. So the seventh element in the input is 6, but in the output it's 6 again. Wait, maybe I'm not seeing the pattern here.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input starts with 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3... and the output is the same. Then in the input, the fourth row is 4 5 6 7 1 2 3... and the output is the same. But then in the fifth row of input, the input is 4 5 6 7 1 2 3... and the output is the same. However, in the sixth row of input, the input is 4 5 6 7 1 1 2 3... and the output is 4 5 6 7 1 1 2 3... same as input. But then in the seventh row of input, the input is 4 5 6 7 1 2 2 3... and output is same. But then in the eighth row of input, the input is 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 3... and the output is same. Then in the ninth row of input, the input is 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 4... and the output is same. So maybe the first part of the input is the same as the output. But then there are some rows where the input and output differ. For example, in the 10th row of input for Example 2, the input is 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 7... and the output is 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 7... same as input. So maybe the output is the same as the input? But that can't be, because the examples have different outputs. Wait, but looking at the first example's output, the first row is same as input. But in the first example's input and output, some rows are same, others are different. Wait, but in the first example, the output for row 8 is different. Let me check again.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's 8th row is 6 1 0 0 0 0 6 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3. The output's 8th row is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3. So the first part of the input row is 6 1 0 0 0 0 6 6... and the output is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6... So the 0s are replaced by 2,3,4,5,6. Similarly, in the 9th row of input, the input is 6 1 0 0 0 0 6 1... and the output is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1... So maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the zeros are replaced with a sequence. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain parts of the grid are being shifted or replaced. Let's think about the third example. In Example 3, the input starts with 5 6 7 8 0 0 0 0 5 6 7 8... and the output is 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8... So the zeros in the input are replaced by 1,2,3,4. Then in the next rows, there are similar patterns. For example, the input's 8th row is 6 7 0 0 0 0 4 4... and the output is 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 4... So the zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. Wait, but that's not consistent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the values are being replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value. For example, in the first example, the first row has 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6... and the output is same. Then in the 8th row of the input, the first part is 6 1 0 0 0 0 6 6... and the output is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6... So the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. Then in the 9th row of input, the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. But in the third example, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. So maybe the pattern is that in certain regions, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain parts are replaced by a sequence. For example, in the first example, the first part of the row is a sequence that's preserved, but then in some parts, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from 1,2,3,4, etc.\n\nAnother approach: look for the transformation between the input and output of each example. Let's take Example 1. The input's first row is 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0 0 4 5 6 1 2 3. The output is the same except for the 0s. Wait, the output's first row is 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3. So the 0s in positions 14-16 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?) are replaced by 1,2,3. Then the 17th element is 4, etc. So maybe in the input, whenever there's a 0, it's replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input row 1: 5 6 7 8 0 0 0 0 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3. The output is 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3. So the first four zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. Then the next four zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4 again. But in the next rows, like row 8 of example 3, the input is 6 7 0 0 0 0 4 4... and the output is 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 4... So the four zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. So the replacement depends on the position. Maybe the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the zeros are replaced by a sequence that increments based on their position. For example, in the first example, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. In the third example, the first four zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. Then in the next row, the four zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the grid is transformed by replacing certain sequences. For example, in the first example, the first part of the grid is a sequence that is preserved, but in some parts, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value. But how to determine which parts?\n\nLooking at the third example's input and output, the first row's zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. Then in the next row, the zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. But how does that relate to the position? Maybe the replacement is based on the row number. For example, in row 0 (assuming 0-based), the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. Then in row 1, the zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in certain regions of the grid, the values are shifted. For example, the first part of the grid is a sequence that is preserved, but in certain areas, the values are shifted. For example, in Example 1, the first part of the grid has a sequence that is preserved, but then in the middle, there's a block of zeros that are replaced by a sequence.\n\nAnother approach: look for the transformation in the test input. The test input is:\n\n2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 0 0 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 0 0 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 0 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 0 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 5 6 7 8 9 1 0 0 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 9 9 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 1 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 2 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 3 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 4 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 5 6\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 6\n\nLooking at the test input, the first few rows have sequences like 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6. The output for the test input is not given, but the task is to find the transformation. However, the test input is just for context.\n\nBut looking at the training examples, it seems that the transformation involves replacing certain sequences. For example, in Example 3, the input has zeros that are replaced by a sequence. Maybe the pattern is that whenever there are zeros in a certain region, they are replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value.\n\nAnother observation: in the first example, the output seems to have a pattern where certain positions are being filled with a sequence. For instance, in the first example's output, the first row is the same as the input, but in the 8th row, the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. Then in the 9th row, the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5 again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is being transformed by replacing certain parts with sequences. For example, in the first example, the first part of the grid is preserved, but in the middle, there's a block of zeros that are replaced by a sequence. The sequence could be a repeating pattern.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation might involve shifting values in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the first part of the grid is a sequence that is preserved, but in some parts, the values are shifted. For example, in the first example's 8th row, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from 2 and increases by 1.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the third example's output, the first row's zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. Then the next row's zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. This suggests that the replacement depends on the row. For example, row 0 (assuming 0-based) replaces zeros with 1,2,3,4. Then row 1 replaces with 8,1,2,3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the grid is being transformed by replacing certain positions with a sequence that is determined by the position. For example, in the first example, the first part of the grid is preserved, and then in the middle, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from the value of the first element after the zeros.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in each row, the first part is preserved, and then certain parts are replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value. For example, in the first example, the first row has a sequence of 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6... and then the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4,5,6. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output, the first row is the same as the input. Then in the 8th row of the input, the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. Then in the 9th row of the input, the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. So maybe the transformation is that in certain positions, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value, and the value depends on the row.\n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the pattern is that in each row, the first part is preserved, and then in the middle, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from the value of the first element in the row after the zeros.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the first part is kept as is, and then the zeros are replaced by a sequence that is determined by the row's position. For example, in the first example, the first row's zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. Then the next row's zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: look for the transformation in the third example. The input has a row where the first part is 5 6 7 8 0 0 0 0 5 6 7 8... and the output is 5 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8... So the four zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. Then in another row, the input is 6 7 0 0 0 0 4 4... and the output is 6 7 8 1 2 3 4 4... So the four zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. This suggests that the replacement depends on the position of the zeros. For example, if the zeros are in a certain part of the row, they are replaced by a sequence starting from a certain value.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the pattern is that in each row, the first part of the row is preserved, and then the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from the value of the first element after the zeros. For example, in the third example's first row, the zeros are in positions 4-7. The first element after the zeros is 5 (the 9th element). So the sequence starts at 1, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, the sequence is determined by the row's index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in each row, the first part of the row is a sequence that is preserved, and the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from the value of the first element in the row. For example, in the third example's first row, the first element is 5, but the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: in the first example, the output for the 8th row is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6... which suggests that the zeros in the input are replaced by 2,3,4,5. The input's 8th row is 6 1 0 0 0 0 6 6... So the zeros are in positions 2-5. The first element after the zeros is 6, which is the value of the 7th element. So the sequence starts from 2, which is the value of the first element after the zeros minus 4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the first part is preserved, and then the zeros are replaced by a sequence that increments from the value of the first element in the row. For example, in the third example's first row, the first element is 5, and the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. That doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can be implemented in code. Let's think about what the transformation might be.\n\nLooking at the third example, the input has a row with 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6. Wait, but the output for this row is the same as the input. Hmm, but in the third example's input, the 5th row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6. So no change. But in the third example's input, the 6th row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5 6. The output is the same. So maybe in some rows, the zeros are not replaced. But in other rows, they are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing certain sequences with a sequence that starts from a certain value. For example, in the first example, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from the value of the first element after the zeros.\n\nBut how to implement this in code? For each row, check for zeros, and replace them with a sequence that starts from a certain value. But what is that value?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each occurrence of 0 with a sequence that is determined by the position. For example, in the first example, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from 1 and increments by 1. But how to determine the starting value?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with a value that is determined by the row and column. For example, in the first example's 8th row, the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. This could be the value of the first element after the zeros minus 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with the value of the next element in the row. For example, if a zero is at position i, then it is replaced by the value at position i+1. But this may not hold for all examples.\n\nIn the first example's 8th row, the input is 6 1 0 0 0 0 6 6... So the first zero is at position 2. The next element is 0, then 0, then 0, then 0. The next element after the zeros is 6. So replacing the zeros with 6? But in the output, they are replaced with 2,3,4,5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think about the transformation as a sequence of steps that can be implemented.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the first row is the same as the input. The second row is the same as the input. The third row is the same as the input. But in the 8th row of the input, the zeros are replaced with 2,3,4,5. So maybe the transformation is that in certain positions, the zeros are replaced with a sequence that is determined by the row and column.\n\nAnother observation: in the first example, the first part of the grid is a sequence that is preserved. Then in certain parts, the values are shifted. For example, in the first example's 8th row, the first part is 6 1, then the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5, then 6,6. So the sequence is 2,3,4,5, which is a sequence of 4 elements.\n\nIn the third example's first row, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. So the sequence is 4 elements. This suggests that the number of elements replaced is 4.\n\nAnother observation: in the first example, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from 1 and increments by 1 for four elements. In the third example, the first row's zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. In the third example's 8th row, the zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. This suggests that the starting value depends on the position.\n\nBut how to determine the starting value? Maybe the starting value is the value of the element that comes after the zeros. For example, in the third example's first row, the zeros are in positions 4-7, and the first element after the zeros is 5. So the starting value is 1. But 5-4=1, which fits. In the third example's 8th row, the zeros are in positions 2-5, and the first element after the zeros is 4. So the starting value is 8, which is 4 + 4 = 8. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is the value of the first element after the zeros, and the sequence is a sequence of four elements starting from that value. For example, in the third example's first row, the first element after the zeros is 5, so the sequence is 5,6,7,8. But in the output, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is the value of the first element before the zeros. For example, in the third example's first row, the first element before the zeros is 8, and the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. But that's not clear.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the pattern is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with the value of the first element in the row. For example, in the third example's first row, the first element is 5, and the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with the value of the next non-zero element. For example, in the third example's first row, the first element after the zeros is 5, so the zeros are replaced by 5,6,7,8. But in the output, they are replaced by 1,2,3,4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a sequence of steps that can be implemented. For example, in each row, the first part is preserved, and then the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from a certain value.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the first example's output, the first row is the same as the input. The second row is the same as the input. The third row is the same as the input. But in the 8th row, the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. This suggests that in certain rows, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from 2 and increments by 1 for four elements.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are affected and what the starting value is?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with a value that is determined by the row number. For example, in row i, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from i mod 9 or something like that.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, and then incrementing by 1 for each subsequent zero. For example, in the third example's first row, the first non-zero element after the zeros is 5. So the first zero is replaced by 5, then 6, then 7, then 8. But in the output, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with a value that is determined by the position in the row. For example, in the first example, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4, which are the first four values.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAnother observation: in the first example, the output for the 8th row is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6... which suggests that the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. This is a sequence of four elements starting from 2.\n\nIn the third example's first row, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. So the sequence is four elements starting from 1.\n\nIn the third example's 8th row, the zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. So the sequence starts from 8, then 1,2,3.\n\nThis suggests that the sequence depends on the row. Maybe the starting value is determined by the row's index. For example, in row 0, the starting value is 1, in row 1, it's 8, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is determined by the row's position. For example, in row 0, the starting value is 1; in row 1, it's 8; in row 2, it's 1; and so on. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is determined by the column where the zeros are located. For example, in the first example's 8th row, the zeros are in columns 2-5. The starting value is 2, which is the column index plus 0.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows: for each row, the first part is preserved, and the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from the value of the first element in the row, but this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, but this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is, but I need to make an educated guess. Let's try to find a pattern that fits the examples.\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the first row is the same as the input. The 8th row has zeros replaced by 2,3,4,5. The 9th row has zeros replaced by 2,3,4,5. This suggests that in these rows, the zeros are replaced by a sequence of four elements starting from 2.\n\nIn the third example's first row, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. This suggests that in row 0, the sequence starts from 1. In the third example's 8th row, the zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. This suggests that in row 7, the sequence starts from 8.\n\nSo maybe the starting value is determined by the row number. For example, in row i, the starting value is (i % 9) + 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is determined by the row number. For example, in the first example, the 8th row (assuming 0-based, it's row 7) has zeros replaced by 2,3,4,5. So starting value is 2. If the row number is 7, then 7 mod 9 is 7, and 7 + 1 = 8, which doesn't fit. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is determined by the row number. For example, in the first example's 8th row (row 7), the starting value is 2, which is 7 - 5 = 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is determined by the position of the zeros in the row. For example, in the first example's 8th row, the zeros are in positions 2-5. The starting value is 2, which is the position of the first zero plus 0.\n\nBut this is not consistent.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with a value that is determined by the row and column. For example, in the first example's 8th row, the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. This could be the value of the first element in the row, which is 6, minus 4. 6-4=2. Then the next value is 3, and so on. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn the third example's first row, the first element is 5, and the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. 5-4=1. So this fits. In the third example's 8th row, the first element is 6, and the zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. 6 + 2 = 8. So this fits.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for a row, if there are zeros, replace them with a sequence that starts from (first non-zero element in the row - 4) or (first non-zero element + 2), depending on the row.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples. Let's try to implement this.\n\nSo, for each row in the grid:\n\n- Find the first non-zero element in the row.\n- If there are zeros, replace them with a sequence starting from (first_non_zero - 4), and increment by 1 for each subsequent zero.\n\nBut in the first example's 8th row, the first non-zero element after the zeros is 6. So 6-4=2, which matches the sequence 2,3,4,5.\n\nIn the third example's first row, the first non-zero element is 5. 5-4=1, which matches the sequence 1,2,3,4.\n\nIn the third example's 8th row, the first non-zero element is 4. 4 + 2 = 6, but the sequence starts at 8. So this doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is first_non_zero + 4. For the third example's 8th row, first_non_zero is 4. 4 +4=8, which matches the sequence 8,1,2,3. But this would mean that the sequence starts at 8, then 1,2,3. But why would the sequence start at 8 and then continue with 1,2,3? That doesn't make sense.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe the pattern is that the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from the value of the first non-zero element in the row, and then wraps around. For example, if the first non-zero is 5, then the sequence is 1,2,3,4. If the first non-zero is 6, the sequence is 2,3,4,5. If the first non-zero is 4, the sequence is 8,1,2,3. But how?\n\nThis seems to be a possible pattern. For example, if the first non-zero element is x, then the sequence is (x - 4) mod 9, (x-3) mod 9, (x-2) mod 9, (x-1) mod 9. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn the third example's first row, x is 5. 5-4=1, 5-3=2, 5-2=3, 5-1=4. So sequence is 1,2,3,4. This fits.\n\nIn the third example's 8th row, x is 4. 4-4=0, 4-3=1, 4-2=2, 4-1=3. But the sequence in the output is 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit. But if we take (x-4 +9) mod 9, then 0 +9=9, 1, 2, 3. But the sequence in the output is 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence starts from x-4 +9 if x-4 is negative. For example, in the third example's 8th row, x is 4. x-4=0. So the sequence is 0,1,2,3. But the output is 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very unclear. Maybe the pattern is that the sequence starts from x-4, but if x-4 is less than 1, it wraps around to 9. For example, x=4: 4-4=0 \u2192 9, then 1, 2, 3. But the output is 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's think about the transformation as a shift in the grid. For example, in the first example, the first part of the grid is preserved, but in certain parts, the values are shifted. For example, in the first example's 8th row, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that is a shift of the original values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, but this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to determine the exact pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to implement a transformation where, for each row, if there are zeros, they are replaced by a sequence that starts from 1 and increments by 1 for four elements. But this would not fit the third example's 8th row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the grid is transformed by replacing each 0 with the value of the first non-zero element in the row, but this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each row, replace the zeros with a sequence that starts from 1 and increments by 1 for four elements. This would fit the first example's first row and the third example's first row. But it would not fit the third example's 8th row. However, this is a possible pattern.\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is that the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from the value of the first non-zero element in the row minus 4, but if that is less than 1, it wraps around.\n\nFor example, in the third example's first row, first non-zero is 5. 5-4=1. So sequence is 1,2,3,4.\n\nIn the third example's 8th row, first non-zero is 4. 4-4=0. So 0 + 9 = 9, then 1,2,3. But the output is 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence starts from the first non-zero element minus 4, but if it's less than 1, it wraps around to 9. For example, 0 becomes 9, 1 becomes 1, etc. But in the third example's 8th row, the sequence would be 9,1,2,3. But the output is 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that replaces the zeros in a certain way, even if it's not perfect. For example, in the first example, the zeros are replaced by a sequence that starts from 1 and increments by 1 for four elements. In the third example, the first row's zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. The 8th row's zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. This suggests that the starting value is determined by the row index.\n\nLet me try to code this: for each row, if there are zeros, replace them with a sequence that starts from (row_index + 1) % 9, and increments by 1 for four elements. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is (row_index + 1). For example, in the first example's 8th row (row index 7), starting value is 8. So the sequence is 8,9,10,11. But since values are 0-9, this would wrap around. But this doesn't fit the example.\n\nThis is very challenging. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following code: for each row, replace the zeros with a sequence of four consecutive numbers starting from 1, but this might not fit all examples. However, given the examples, this is a possible approach.\n\nBut in the third example's 8th row, the zeros are replaced by 8,1,2,3. This suggests that the starting value is 8. So for row 7 (0-based), starting value is 8. This could be row_index + 1. For row 7, 7 + 1 = 8. So this fits.\n\nIn the third example's first row (row 0), starting value is 1, which is 0 + 1. This fits. In the third example's 8th row (row 7), starting value is 8. This fits. So the pattern could be: for each row, the starting value is row_index + 1. Then, the sequence is starting_value, starting_value + 1, starting_value + 2, starting_value + 3, modulo 10.\n\nBut let's test this:\n\nFor row 0, starting value is 1. Sequence is 1,2,3,4. This fits the third example's first row.\n\nFor row 7, starting value is 8. Sequence is 8,9,10,11. But since values are 0-9, 10 becomes 0, 11 becomes 1. So the sequence would be 8,9,0,1. But in the third example's 8th row, the sequence is 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in the third example's 8th row, the output is 8,1,2,3. So the sequence is 8,1,2,3. This suggests that the starting value is 8, and then the next values are 1,2,3. This could be a sequence that wraps around from 9 to 1.\n\nSo the sequence is starting_value, starting_value + 1, starting_value + 2, starting_value + 3, but with values modulo 10, except for the first value. Or maybe the sequence is starting_value, (starting_value + 1) % 10, (starting_value + 2) % 10, (starting_value + 3) % 10.\n\nFor row 7, starting value is 8. The sequence would be 8,9,0,1. But in the third example's 8th row, the sequence is 8,1,2,3. This doesn't fit.\n\nSo this approach is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Let's proceed with the following code: for each row, replace the zeros with a sequence that starts from 1 and increments by 1 for four elements. This would fit some examples, but not all. However, given the time, I'll proceed with this.\n\nBut in the third example's 8th row, the sequence is 8,1,2,3. This suggests that the starting value is 8, and then the sequence is 1,2,3. This is not consistent with the previous pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the starting value is 8, and the sequence is 8, 1, 2, 3. This could be a pattern where the sequence starts at 8, then wraps around to 1, 2, 3.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the sequence is determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the sequence is (i % 9) + 1, (i % 9) + 2, (i % 9) + 3, (i % 9) + 4. But this would give for row 7: 8,9,10,11 \u2192 8,9,0,1. But the example has 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that replaces the zeros in each row with a sequence that starts from the value of the first non-zero element in the row, and then increments by 1 for each subsequent zero. For example, in the third example's first row, the first non-zero element is 5. So the sequence is 5,6,7,8. But the output is 1,2,3,4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to determine the exact pattern, I'll proceed with the following code: for each row, if there are zeros, replace them with a sequence of four consecutive numbers starting from 1, incrementing by 1. This is a possible pattern, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nBut this is not correct for the third example's 8th row. However, given the time, I'll proceed with this.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for i, val in enumerate(row):\n            if val == 0:\n                # replace with 1,2,3,4\n                # but need to track how many zeros have been replaced\n                # this is not correct, but for the purpose of this example, assume that zeros are replaced with 1,2,3,4\n                # but this is not correct for all cases\n                # this is a placeholder\n                pass\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct. So, I need to think of a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: in the first example, the output for the 8th row is 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 6... which suggests that the zeros are replaced by 2,3,4,5. This is a sequence of four elements starting from 2. In the third example's first row, the zeros are replaced by 1,2,3,4. So the starting value is 1 for the first row, 2 for the 8th row.\n\nThis suggests that the starting value is the row index + 1. For row 0, starting value is 1. For row 7, starting value is 8. But in the third example's 8th row, the starting value is 8, and the sequence is 8,1,2,3. This suggests that the sequence is 8,1,2,3, which is 8, then 1,2,3.\n\nThis could be a pattern where the starting value is row_index + 1, and the sequence is starting_value, (starting_value + 1) % 9, (starting_value + 2) % 9, (starting_value + 3) % 9. But for row 7, starting_value is 8, so the sequence would be 8,9,0,1. But the example has 8,1,2,3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the sequence is starting_value, starting_value + 1, starting_value + 2, starting_value + 3, but with values modulo 9, and if the value is 0, it is replaced by 9.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: for each row, replace the zeros with a sequence that starts from (row_index + 1) and increments by 1 for four elements, modulo 9, with 0 replaced by 9.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row_index, row in enumerate(grid):\n        new_row = []\n        for col_index, val in enumerate(row):\n            if val == 0:\n                # calculate the starting value\n                start = (row_index + 1) % 9\n                # replace with start, start+1, start+2, start+3\n                # but need to handle modulo\n                # for four elements\n                # but how to determine which zeros to replace?\n                # this is not clear\n                # this is a placeholder\n                pass\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nThis is not correct, but I'm out of ideas. Given the examples, I'll have to proceed with the best possible guess.\n\nFinal answer:\n"
