In Example 1, the output grid has some cells set to 0 where the input had values, suggesting a \"zeroing\" or \"masking\" pattern.\n2. In Example 2, there are similar patterns where certain cells are set to 0 based on their position or value.\n3. In Example 3, there are more complex patterns where cells are set to 0 in specific positions, especially in the middle of the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves setting certain cells to 0 based on their position or value. Specifically, it seems like the transformation is setting cells to 0 in a pattern that might be related to the position of the cell in the grid.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Set cells to 0 based on their position\n    for i in range(20):\n        for j in range(20):\n            # Set cells to 0 if they are in the middle of the grid\n            if 5 <= i <= 15 and 5 <= j <= 15:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Set cells to 0 based on their position\n    for i in range(20):\n        for j in range(20):\n            # Set cells to 0 if they are in the middle of the grid\n            if 5 <= i <= 15 and 5 <= j <= 15:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
