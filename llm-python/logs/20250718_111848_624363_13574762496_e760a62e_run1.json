There are blocks of 8s that are often transformed into sequences of 2s and 3s in certain positions.\n2. The 8s in the middle of the grid (in blocks of 8s) seem to be replaced with sequences of 2s and 3s in specific patterns.\n3. There are instances where the 8s are replaced with sequences of 2s and 3s in a diagonal or horizontal pattern.\n4. The 8s in the middle of the grid are often replaced with sequences of 2s and 3s in a way that creates a \"wave\" pattern.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain patterns of 8s with sequences of 2s and 3s in a way that matches the training examples.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the pattern to replace\n    # We'll replace sequences of 8s with sequences of 2s and 3s in a wave pattern\n    # This is a simplified pattern that matches the training examples\n    # We'll look for sequences of 8s and replace them with 2s and 3s in a wave pattern\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                # Check if the cell is part of a sequence of 8s\n                # This is a simplified check and may not capture all patterns\n                if (i % 4 == 0 or i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 1):\n                    # Replace with 2s and 3s in a wave pattern\n                    if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                    else:\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                if (i % 4 == 0 or i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 1):\n                    if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                    else:\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",

There are blocks of 8s that are often transformed into sequences of 2s and 3s in certain positions.\n2. The 8s in the middle of the grid (in blocks of 8s) seem to be replaced with sequences of 2s and 3s in specific patterns.\n3. There are instances where the 8s are replaced with sequences of 2s and 3s in a diagonal or horizontal pattern.\n4. The 8s in the middle of the grid are often replaced with sequences of 2s and 3s in a way that creates a \"wave\" pattern.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain patterns of 8s with sequences of 2s and 3s in a way that matches the training examples.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the pattern to replace\n    # We'll replace sequences of 8s with sequences of 2s and 3s in a wave pattern\n    # This is a simplified pattern that matches the training examples\n    # We'll look for sequences of 8s and replace them with 2s and 3s in a wave pattern\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                # Check if the cell is part of a sequence of 8s\n                # This is a simplified check and may not capture all patterns\n                if (i % 4 == 0 or i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 1):\n                    # Replace with 2s and 3s in a wave pattern\n                    if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                    else:\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                if (i % 4 == 0 or i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 0 or j % 4 == 1):\n                    if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                    else:\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
