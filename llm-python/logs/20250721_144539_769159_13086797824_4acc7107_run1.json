Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 10\u00d710 output grid.**\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0\n6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6 0 0\n6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n6 6 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 6 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\n6 6 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3\n0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 0 4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n3 3 3 0 0 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 0 4 4 4 0 0\n3 3 0 0 0 0 4 4 0 0\n3 3 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n8 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0 0\n8 8 8 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 8 8 0 4 4 4 4 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n8 8 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n8 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 0\n8 8 8 0 0 0 0 4 0 0\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 0 0 0 9 9 9 0\n7 7 7 7 0 0 9 9 9 0\n0 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 0 0\n0 7 7 0 0 9 9 9 0 0\n7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 7 0 0 9 9 9 9 9\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 2 0 0 3 3 3 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 0 2 2 2 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 2 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

              "reasoning_content": "**Observations and Analysis:**\n\nThe training examples show that the transformation involves moving and rotating certain elements while leaving others unchanged. Here are the patterns observed:\n\n1. **Element Movement and Rotation:**\n   - **Shape 0 (0s):** These are not moved or rotated. They remain static in their positions.\n   - **Shape 1 (6s):** These are rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The original position with the 6s is transformed.\n   - **Shape 2 (3s):** These are moved and rotated. The 3s in the input are moved to new positions, and their orientation changes.\n   - **Shape 3 (7s):** These are moved and rotated. They follow a specific pattern of movement and rotation.\n   - **Shape 4 (4s):** These are rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise. The 4s in the input are transformed.\n   - **Shape 5 (8s):** These are moved and rotated. The 8s are moved and rotated in a specific way.\n   - **Shape 6 (9s):** These are rotated 90 degrees clockwise. The 9s are transformed.\n\n2. **Rotation Rules:**\n   - **Clockwise Rotation (90\u00b0):** Elements are rotated clockwise. The original grid is rotated, and the new positions are calculated based on the original positions.\n   - **Counter-clockwise Rotation (90\u00b0):** Elements are rotated counter-clockwise. The original grid is rotated, and the new positions are calculated based on the original positions.\n\n3. **Element Movement:**\n   - **3s (Shape 2):** These are moved up and rotated. The original positions are adjusted, and the new positions are calculated based on the original grid.\n   - **7s (Shape 3):** These are moved down and rotated. The original positions are adjusted, and the new positions are calculated based on the original grid.\n   - **8s (Shape 5):** These are moved right and rotated. The original positions are adjusted, and the new positions are calculated based on the original grid.\n   - **9s (Shape 6):** These are rotated clockwise. The original positions are adjusted based on the rotation.\n\n4. **Special Cases:**\n   - **0s (Shape 0):** These remain in their original positions unless moved by other transformations.\n   - **4s (Shape 4):** These are rotated counter-clockwise. The original positions are adjusted based on the rotation.\n   - **6s (Shape 1):** These are rotated clockwise. The original positions are adjusted based on the rotation.\n\n5. **Transformation Strategy:**\n   - The transformation involves rotating and moving certain elements based on their original positions. The new positions are calculated by rotating the original grid and then moving the elements accordingly.\n   - For example, 6s are rotated clockwise, and the new positions are calculated based on the original positions.\n\n**Approach:**\n\nThe approach involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Identify Elements:**\n   - Different elements are identified based on their values (0-9) and their shapes.\n   - For each element, the original positions are recorded.\n\n2. **Rotation:**\n   - The original grid is rotated 90\u00b0 clockwise to determine the new positions for 6s and 9s.\n   - The original grid is rotated 90\u00b0 counter-clockwise to determine the new positions for 4s.\n\n3. **Element Movement:**\n   - Based on the element's type, the original positions are adjusted to new positions.\n   - For example, 6s are moved to new positions determined by the rotation.\n\n4. **Update Grid:**\n   - The new grid is created by updating the positions of the elements based on the transformation.\n\n**Python Implementation:**\n\nThe Python function performs the following steps:\n\n1. **Grid Rotation:**\n   - The original grid is rotated 90\u00b0 clockwise and counter-clockwise to determine new positions for the elements.\n\n2. **Element Identification:**\n   - Elements are identified based on their values and their positions.\n\n3. **Transformation:**\n   - The new positions are calculated based on the original positions and the rotation.\n   - The new grid is created by updating the positions of the elements.\n\n4. **Return Updated Grid:**\n   - The transformed grid is returned.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    grid = [row.copy() for row in grid]\n    rotated_90_clockwise = list(zip(*grid[::-1]))\n    rotated_90_counter_clockwise = list(zip(*grid))[::-1]\n    grid_90_clockwise = [list(row) for row in rotated_90_clockwise]\n    grid_90_counter_clockwise = [list(row) for row in rotated_90_counter_clockwise]\n    for r in range(10):\n        for c in range(10):\n            val = grid[r][c]\n            if val == 0:\n                continue\n            if val == 6:\n                new_r = c\n                new_c = 9 -
