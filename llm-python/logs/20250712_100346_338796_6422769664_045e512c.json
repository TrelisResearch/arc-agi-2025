          "Analysis:\nFrom the training examples, the pattern appears to be replicating colored shapes along axes aligned with their original positions, but extended outward to form lines or repeated shapes:\n\n- In Example 1:\n  - The cyan shape is left unchanged.\n  - The green vertical line at (6-8, 10) in input becomes a horizontal green line extended to the right from the same starting row in output.\n  - The red shape below the cyan in input becomes a vertical stack of that shape in output.\n  - The blue shape below in input becomes repeated vertically and horizontally in output.\n  \n- In Example 2:\n  - The yellow shape above a blue cross becomes duplicated downward, forming an extended vertical line.\n  - The red small shapes around blue are repeated horizontally to left and right.\n  - The blue cross stays as is but aligned in the middle.\n  \n- In Example 3:\n  - The shapes are repeated diagonally down-right from their original positions.\n  - The pink shape at top is replicated down diagonally right.\n  - The blue shape at bottom right is replicated diagonally similarly.\n  \n**Summary of observed patterns:**\n- Each distinct color shape (nonzero) is extended or repeated:\n  - Vertical shapes or vertical groups become horizontal lines or vertical lines extended.\n  - Some shapes are repeated diagonally down-right (Example 3).\n- The output grid size remains the same (21x21).\n- Background (zero) remains zero.\n- Extended shapes keep their original color.\n\nTo implement a hypothesis transformation that captures the main aspects:\n- For each distinct color group in input:\n  - Find connected components (groups of same color).\n  - For components that are stretched vertically: replicate horizontally extending that component to the right.\n  - For components that are small dots or less than 3x3, replicate diagonally down-right a few times.\n- Leave background zeros unchanged.\n- Repeat shapes consistently along detected directions:\n  - If shape height > width => extend horizontally.\n  - If shape is small and isolated => replicate diagonally 3 times.\n  \nThis approach attempts to generalize the transformations seen:\n- Horizontal extension for vertical shapes (example 1 and 2).\n- Diagonal replication for isolated small shapes (example 3).\n\nWe will use a connected components search to identify colored shapes, then process replication accordingly.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    H, W = grid.shape\n    assert H == 21 and W == 21\n    \n    # Output grid initialized as input grid copy\n    out = np.array(grid)\n    \n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    \n    def neighbors(r,c):\n        for nr,nc in [(r-1,c),(r+1,c),(r,c-1),(r,c+1)]:\n            if 0 <= nr < H and 0 <= nc < W:\n                yield nr,nc\n\n    # Find connected components by color (excluding 0)\n    components = []\n    for r in range(H):\n        for c in range(W):\n            if grid[r,c] != 0 and not visited[r,c]:\n                color = grid[r,c]\n                q = deque()\n                q.append((r,c))\n                comp = []\n                visited[r,c] = True\n                while q:\n                    rr,cc = q.popleft()\n                    comp.append((rr,cc))\n                    for nr,nc in neighbors(rr,cc):\n                        if not visited[nr,nc] and grid[nr,nc]==color:\n                            visited[nr,nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr,nc))\n                components.append((color, comp))\n\n    # Process each component\n    for color, comp in components:\n        comp = np.array(comp)\n        rows = comp[:,0]\n        cols = comp[:,1]\n        r_min, r_max = rows.min(), rows.max()\n        c_min, c_max = cols.min(), cols.max()\n        height = r_max -

              "Analysis:\nFrom the training examples, the pattern appears to be replicating colored shapes along axes aligned with their original positions, but extended outward to form lines or repeated shapes:\n\n- In Example 1:\n  - The cyan shape is left unchanged.\n  - The green vertical line at (6-8, 10) in input becomes a horizontal green line extended to the right from the same starting row in output.\n  - The red shape below the cyan in input becomes a vertical stack of that shape in output.\n  - The blue shape below in input becomes repeated vertically and horizontally in output.\n  \n- In Example 2:\n  - The yellow shape above a blue cross becomes duplicated downward, forming an extended vertical line.\n  - The red small shapes around blue are repeated horizontally to left and right.\n  - The blue cross stays as is but aligned in the middle.\n  \n- In Example 3:\n  - The shapes are repeated diagonally down-right from their original positions.\n  - The pink shape at top is replicated down diagonally right.\n  - The blue shape at bottom right is replicated diagonally similarly.\n  \n**Summary of observed patterns:**\n- Each distinct color shape (nonzero) is extended or repeated:\n  - Vertical shapes or vertical groups become horizontal lines or vertical lines extended.\n  - Some shapes are repeated diagonally down-right (Example 3).\n- The output grid size remains the same (21x21).\n- Background (zero) remains zero.\n- Extended shapes keep their original color.\n\nTo implement a hypothesis transformation that captures the main aspects:\n- For each distinct color group in input:\n  - Find connected components (groups of same color).\n  - For components that are stretched vertically: replicate horizontally extending that component to the right.\n  - For components that are small dots or less than 3x3, replicate diagonally down-right a few times.\n- Leave background zeros unchanged.\n- Repeat shapes consistently along detected directions:\n  - If shape height > width => extend horizontally.\n  - If shape is small and isolated => replicate diagonally 3 times.\n  \nThis approach attempts to generalize the transformations seen:\n- Horizontal extension for vertical shapes (example 1 and 2).\n- Diagonal replication for isolated small shapes (example 3).\n\nWe will use a connected components search to identify colored shapes, then process replication accordingly.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    H, W = grid.shape\n    assert H == 21 and W == 21\n    \n    # Output grid initialized as input grid copy\n    out = np.array(grid)\n    \n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid, dtype=bool)\n    \n    def neighbors(r,c):\n        for nr,nc in [(r-1,c),(r+1,c),(r,c-1),(r,c+1)]:\n            if 0 <= nr < H and 0 <= nc < W:\n                yield nr,nc\n\n    # Find connected components by color (excluding 0)\n    components = []\n    for r in range(H):\n        for c in range(W):\n            if grid[r,c] != 0 and not visited[r,c]:\n                color = grid[r,c]\n                q = deque()\n                q.append((r,c))\n                comp = []\n                visited[r,c] = True\n                while q:\n                    rr,cc = q.popleft()\n                    comp.append((rr,cc))\n                    for nr,nc in neighbors(rr,cc):\n                        if not visited[nr,nc] and grid[nr,nc]==color:\n                            visited[nr,nc] = True\n                            q.append((nr,nc))\n                components.append((color, comp))\n\n    # Process each component\n    for color, comp in components:\n        comp = np.array(comp)\n        rows = comp[:,0]\n        cols = comp[:,1]\n        r_min, r_max = rows.min(), rows.max()\n        c_min, c_max = cols.min(), cols.max()\n        height = r_max -
