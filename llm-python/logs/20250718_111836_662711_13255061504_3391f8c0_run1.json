The transformation seems to involve some kind of pattern recognition and replacement of certain values with others.\n2. There are instances where values like 8 are replaced with 1s and 0s.\n3. Values like 2 and 3 are replaced with 3s and 8s in some examples.\n4. There seems to be a pattern where certain values are replaced based on their position and value.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with others based on their position and value.

The transformation seems to involve some kind of pattern recognition and replacement of certain values with others.\n2. There are instances where values like 8 are replaced with 1s and 0s.\n3. Values like 2 and 3 are replaced with 3s and 8s in some examples.\n4. There seems to be a pattern where certain values are replaced based on their position and value.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with others based on their position and value.
