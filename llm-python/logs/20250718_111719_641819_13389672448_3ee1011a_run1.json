The output grid is always 5x5\n2. The transformation seems to involve creating a border of the same value as the center cell, with the center cell value being the \"core\" of the pattern\n3. In Example 1, the center cell is 2, and the output is a 5x5 grid with 2s on the border and 3s and 8 in the middle\n4. In Example 2, the center cell is 1, and the output is a 6x6 grid with 1s on the border and 3s and 6s in the middle\n5. In Example 3, the center cell is 7, and the output is an 8x8 grid with 7s on the border and 3s, 4s, and 7s in the middle\n\nFrom these examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Creating a border of the same value as the center cell\n- Filling the inner cells with values that are either the same as the center cell or values that appear in the input grid\n\nBased on this pattern, I'll implement a transformation that:\n1.
