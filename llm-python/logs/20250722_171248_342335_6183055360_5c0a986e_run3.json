The key observation is that the output seems to be a kind of \"spread\" or \"expansion\" of the input values, where certain values are spread out in a way that creates a diagonal or wave-like pattern.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n1. Values of 1 and 2 seem to be spread out in a diagonal pattern\n2. The spread seems to be in a way that creates a diagonal or wave-like pattern\n3. The transformation appears to be a kind of \"spread\" or \"expansion\" of the input values\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that spreads the values in a diagonal pattern.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is not 0, spread it diagonally\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value diagonally in all directions\n                for dx in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dy in range(-1, 2):\n                        if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the original cell\n                        ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                        if 0 <= ni < 10 and 0 <= nj < 10:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 1, the 1s and 2s in the input are spread out in a diagonal pattern in the output.\n3. In Example 2, the 2s are spread out in a diagonal pattern, and the 1s are spread out in a different pattern.\n4. In Example 3, the 2s are spread out in a diagonal pattern, and the 1s are spread out in a different pattern.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading out certain values in a diagonal pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is not 0, spread it out in a diagonal pattern\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value in a diagonal pattern\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 10 and 0 <= nj < 10:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is not 0, spread it out in a diagonal pattern\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value in a diagonal pattern\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 10 and 0 <= nj < 10:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
