          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let me start by analyzing Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has some rows with 0s and numbers. The output seems to have some patterns where certain numbers are repeated in specific positions. For instance, looking at the first few rows of the input and output:\n\nInput row 0: 0 0 0 0 8 0 5 5 0 8 0 0 0 0\nOutput row 0: 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0\n\nHmm, so in the input, there are 8s and 5s. The output has 2s in positions where the input had 5s or 8s? Wait, maybe not. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at the input row 0, the 5s are at positions 6 and 7. The output row 0 has 2s at positions 5,6,7,8? Wait, no. Let me look again. The output row 0 is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So the 2s are in positions 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,12. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced with 2s based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain cells are replaced based on their position relative to other cells. For example, in the input, there are some 8s and 5s. The output has 2s in certain positions. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the first row has 2s in positions 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,12. Wait, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the input has 8s or 5s? Or maybe it's based on some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values with others based on their position. For example, in the input, the 5s are in positions where the output has 2s. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output:\n\nIn the input, row 0 has 5s at positions 6 and 7. The output row 0 has 2s at positions 6 and 7. Also, there are 8s in positions 4 and 9. The output has 8s in those positions. So maybe the 8s are preserved, and the 5s are replaced with 2s? But then why are there 2s in other positions?\n\nLooking at the input row 0: 0 0 0 0 8 0 5 5 0 8 0 0 0 0. The output row 0 is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So the 2s are in positions 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,12. Wait, maybe the 2s are in positions where the input has 0s and certain other conditions. Or maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are adjacent to 8s or 5s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at the second example. Let's take the input and output for example 2. For example, the first input row is 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. So that row is the same as the input. But then in the next input row, which is 0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0, the output is 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4. So the 4s are in positions 0,1,3,5,7,9, etc. So maybe the output is replacing 0s with 4s in certain positions, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with numbers based on their position. For example, in the second example, the first row is the same as input. But the second row has 4s in certain positions. Maybe the output is replacing 0s with the value of the cell two rows above? Or some other pattern.\n\nLooking at the second example's input and output, perhaps the output is generated by replacing 0s with numbers based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in the second input row (row 1), the first cell is 0. The cell two rows above (row -1) is 0. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. Let me check.\n\nIn example 2, the input for row 1 is 0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. The output for row 1 is 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4. So the first cell is 0 in input, but in output it's 4. The cell two rows above (row -1) is 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. Let's check for row 1, column 0. The input row 1, column 0 is 0. The cell two rows above (row -1) is 0. So that doesn't help. Maybe another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 2, the second row has 4s in positions 0,1,3,5,7,9, etc. Maybe the 4s are placed in even columns? Not sure. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have 2s in certain positions. For instance, in the first row of the output, the 2s are in positions 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. The input for that row has 8s in positions 4 and 9. The 2s are in positions adjacent to the 8s? Or maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the input has 0s and the value is 8 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with numbers based on the value of the cell in the same row and column. For example, if the cell is in a certain position, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the third row of the input is 0 2 2 0 8 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. So the 2s are replacing the 0s and the 5s. So perhaps the 5s are replaced with 2s, and the 0s are replaced with 2s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with the value of the cell two rows above. Let me check. For example, in example 1, row 0 of input is 0 0 0 0 8 0 5 5 0 8 0 0 0 0. The output row 0 is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So the 2s are in positions 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,12. Maybe the 2s are in positions where the cell two rows above is 2. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by replacing 0s with numbers based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. Let's check for example 1. For row 0, column 1: input is 0. The cell two rows above (row -1) is 0. Not helpful. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the third row of the output is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. The input for that row is 0 2 2 0 8 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0 0. So the 0s are replaced with 2s, and the 5s are replaced with 2s. So maybe the rule is that if the input cell is 0 or 5, replace with 2. But why?\n\nBut then looking at the first row of the output, the input has 0s and 8s. The output has 2s in positions where the input is 0, and 8s where the input is 8. So maybe the rule is that 0s are replaced with 2s, and 8s are kept as 8s. But then why in the first example's output, the 5s are replaced with 2s. But in the input, the 5s are in positions 6 and 7. The output has 2s in those positions. So maybe 5s are replaced with 2s. But then why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s and 5s with 2s, but 8s are kept as 8s. But that seems to fit the first example. Let's check the second example. In example 2, the first input row is all 0s and 3s. The output is the same as input. But in the second input row, the output has 4s in certain positions. So that contradicts the previous idea.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is more complex. Let's think again.\n\nIn example 1, the output seems to have 2s in positions where the input has 0s and 5s. But in example 2, the output for the second row has 4s where the input had 0s. So maybe the value to replace depends on the row. For example, in even rows, 2s are replaced, in odd rows, 4s are replaced. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. Let's check example 1. For row 0, column 1: input is 0. The cell two rows above is row -1, which is 0. Not helpful. Maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions that form a pattern. For instance, in the first row, the 2s are in positions 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. These positions are every other position, except for the 4th and 9th. Wait, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the input has 8s. For example, the input has 8s at positions 4 and 9. The output has 8s at the same positions. The 2s are placed in positions adjacent to those 8s. For example, positions 1,2 are adjacent to position 4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where the input has 5s or 8s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the third row of the output is all 2s except for the 8s. The input for that row has 0s and 5s. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 2s and the 5s are replaced with 2s. Then the 8s are kept as 8s. But in example 2, the first input row is 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. The output is the same as the input. So that would suggest that in some cases, the 0s are not replaced. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the output for example 1. The output seems to have a pattern where certain cells are replaced with 2s. For instance, in the first row of the output, the 2s are in positions 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,12. These positions are in the same columns as the 8s in the input. For example, the 8 is at position 4, and the 2s are at positions 5 and 6 (which are next to it). Similarly, the 8 is at position 9, and the 2s are at positions 8 and 9 (but 9 is 8). So maybe the 2s are placed in positions adjacent to 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, rows 0, 2, 4, etc. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the third row has 2s in all positions except where there are 8s. The input for that row has 0s and 5s. So maybe the rule is that if the input cell is 0 or 5, replace with 2, and if it's 8, leave as 8. But in example 2, the first input row has 3s and 0s, and the output is the same as input. So that would suggest that this rule doesn't apply there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the cell is in a row where the value is 8, then replace 0s with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 2, the second row has 4s in certain positions. The input row is 0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. The output is 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4. So the 0s are replaced with 4s where the cell is in a certain pattern. For instance, the 0s are replaced with 4s in positions where the cell is in even columns. Or maybe it's based on the row number.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where certain cells are replaced with 2s, and others are 8s. In example 2, the output has 4s in certain positions. So perhaps the value to replace depends on the row. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 2s, in odd rows with 4s. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1, the output for row 0 is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. Row 0 is even. In example 2, row 1 (which is odd) has 4s in certain positions. So maybe that's the pattern. But how to determine which value to use based on the row.\n\nBut then in example 2, the first row (row 0) is the same as input. So that would suggest that the rule is not based on the row. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value to replace depends on the value in the input. For example, if the input is 0, replace with 2 if the cell is in a certain position, or 4 if in another. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output of example 1. The output seems to have 2s in positions where the input has 0s and 5s. But in example 2, the output has 4s in positions where the input has 0s. So maybe the value to replace depends on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in example 1, row 0, column 1: input is 0. The cell two rows above (row -1) is 0. Not helpful. But in example 2, row 1, column 0: input is 0. The cell two rows above is row -1, which is 0. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value to replace is based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, if the cell two rows above is 2, then replace with 2, and so on. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the output of example 1. The output for row 0 has 2s in positions 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,12. These positions are where the input has 0s and 8s. Wait, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain column. For example, columns 1, 2, 5, 6, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in example 1, row 0, column 1: input is 0. The cell two rows above is row -1, which is 0. So that would replace with 0. But the output is 2. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's think about the output for example 1. The output seems to have 2s in positions that are in certain columns. For example, columns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. These columns are even or odd? Let me see: columns 1 (odd), 2 (even), 5 (odd), 6 (even), 8 (even), 9 (odd), 11 (odd), 12 (even). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column index is even or odd. For example, in example 1's first row, columns 1 and 2 are odd and even. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output seems to have a pattern where the 2s are placed in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain row. For example, in even rows, 0s are replaced with 2s, and in odd rows, replaced with 4s. But in example 1, the first row is even, and the output has 2s. In example 2, the second row is odd, and the output has 4s. But in example 2, the first row is even, and the output is the same as input. So this might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in example 1, row 0, column 1: input is 0. The cell two rows above (row -1) is 0. So that's not helpful. But in example 2, row 1, column 0: input is 0. The cell two rows above is row -1, which is 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Let me look for other patterns. In example 1, the output for row 2 is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. The input for row 2 is 0 2 2 0 8 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0 0. So the 0s are replaced with 2s, and the 5s are replaced with 2s. The 8s are kept. So maybe the rule is to replace 0s and 5s with 2s, and 8s are kept. But in example 2, the first row has 3s and 0s, and the output is the same as input. So that would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain position, and 5s with 2s if in another. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for example 1, the 2s are placed in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain column. For example, in the first row, columns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. These columns are in positions where the input has 0s. But the input for those columns in row 0 are 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 5, 5, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the 0s are at columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. Wait, but the output has 2s in columns 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,12. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 2s in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is not in a certain pattern. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the cell is in a row that has 8s, replace 0s with 2s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where the input has 5s or 8s. For example, in the first row, the input has 8s and 5s. The output has 2s where the input has 0s and 5s. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's see:\n\nIn example 1, the output seems to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s. The 8s are kept. In example 2, the output replaces 0s with 4s in certain positions, and 3s with 3s. So maybe the replacement depends on the value of the cell in the input. For example, if the cell is 0, replace with 2 or 4 based on some condition. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value to replace is based on the row number. For example, even rows are replaced with 2, odd rows with 4. Let's check example 1. Row 0 is even, output has 2s. Row 1 is odd, output has 2s in some positions. Wait, no, in example 1's row 1, the output is 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 2 0. So there are 2s in some positions. But if the row is odd, maybe the 0s are replaced with 2s. But this is not consistent with example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in example 1, row 0, column 1: input is 0. The cell two rows above is row -1, which is 0. So that would replace with 0, but the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 2s are placed in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain column. For example, in the first row, columns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. These columns are positions where the input has 0s or 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in even columns, replace 0s with 2s. But in example 1, the first row has 0s in columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. The output has 2s in columns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. So columns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12 are even or odd? Column 1 is odd, 2 is even, 5 is odd, 6 is even, 8 is even, 9 is odd, 11 is odd, 12 is even. So it's a mix of even and odd columns. Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows: for each cell, if the cell is 0, replace it with 2 if it's in a certain position, or 4 if in another. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the third row has 2s in all positions except where there are 8s. The input for that row has 0s and 5s. So perhaps the rule is to replace 0s and 5s with 2s, and 8s with 8s. But in example 2, the first input row has 3s and 0s, and the output is the same as input. So that would suggest that this rule doesn't apply there. But maybe there's a different rule for different values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, rows 0, 2, 4, etc. Let's check example 1's row 0: replaced 0s with 2s. Row 2: replaced 0s with 2s. Row 4: replaced 0s with 2s. But in example 2, row 0 is not replaced, so this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the row has 8s, then 0s are replaced with 2s. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 2s in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in the first row, the 2s are placed in positions that are adjacent to 8s. Maybe the rule is to replace 0s with 2s if they are adjacent to 8s. But how to check that.\n\nIn the first row of example 1, the input has 8s at positions 4 and 9. The 2s are at positions 5, 6, 8, 9. So positions adjacent to 8s. For example, position 5 is adjacent to 4 (8), position 6 is adjacent to 4 (8), position 8 is adjacent to 9 (8), position 9 is 8. So maybe the rule is to replace 0s with 2s if they are adjacent to 8s. But then, in the input row 0, position 1 is 0 and adjacent to position 0 (0) and 2 (0). Not adjacent to 8. But in the output, it's replaced with 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's think about the test input and see if I can find any patterns.\n\nThe test input is a 14x14 grid. The input has 0s and 5s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 6s, 7s, etc. The output for the test input is not given, but the task is to write a transformation that maps the input to output.\n\nBut since I don't have the test output, I need to focus on the training examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions that form a pattern of horizontal lines. For example, in the first row, the 2s are in positions 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,12. This looks like a pattern where the 2s are placed in every other column, but with some exceptions. For example, columns 1 and 2 are filled, then columns 5 and 6, then 8 and 9, then 11 and 12. This could be a pattern where the 2s are placed in columns where the column index is 1 or 2, then 5 or 6, etc. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are even or odd. For example, columns 1 (odd), 2 (even), 5 (odd), 6 (even), 8 (even), 9 (odd), 11 (odd), 12 (even). This seems to be a mix of even and odd columns. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's say that the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s, and 8s are kept. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s if the cell is in a row where the row number is even. Let's check example 1: row 0 is even, and 0s are replaced with 2s. Row 1 is odd, but in the output, some 0s are replaced with 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possible pattern: in example 1, the output has 2s in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain column. For example, in the first row, the 2s are placed in columns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. These columns are where the input has 0s or 8s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s if the cell is in a column that is even or odd. For example, in even columns, replace 0s with 2s. But in example 1's first row, columns 1 (odd), 2 (even), 5 (odd), 6 (even), etc. So some even columns are replaced, others are not.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess. Based on the examples, it seems that 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions, and 5s are replaced with 2s. 8s are kept. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s where the cell is in a certain pattern, and 5s with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine that pattern. Maybe the pattern is that in even rows, 0s are replaced with 2s, and in odd rows, 4s are replaced. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value to replace is based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, if the cell two rows above is 2, replace with 2, if it's 4, replace with 4, etc. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, if the cell is in a row where the row number is even, replace 0s with 2s. Otherwise, replace with 4s. Let's test this.\n\nIn example 1, row 0 is even. So 0s are replaced with 2s. In row 1 (odd), the output has 2s in some positions. But according to this hypothesis, 0s would be replaced with 4s. But in example 1's row 1, the output has 2s, not 4s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain column. For example, columns where the column index is even or odd. But this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions, and 5s are replaced with 2s, and 8s are kept. But how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in example 1, row 0, column 1: input is 0. The cell two rows above is row -1, which is 0. So replace with 0. But the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the value to replace is based on the value of the cell in the same row but two columns to the left. For example, in row 0, column 1: the cell to the left is column 0 (0). Replace with 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to write a function that replaces 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s, and 8s are kept. But how to determine the positions.\n\nLooking back at example 1's output, the 2s are placed in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in row 0, columns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. These are columns where the input has 0s, and the column index is not a multiple of 4. Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are placed in positions where the column index is even or odd, but this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to write a function that replaces 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s. For example, in the first example, the 0s are replaced with 2s, and 5s are replaced with 2s. So the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 0 or val == 5:\n                new_row.append(2)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not work for example 2, where the first row has 3s and 0s, but the output is the same as input. So this suggests that the pattern is not as simple as replacing 0s and 5s with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check the cell two rows above\n                if i >= 2:\n                    transformed[i][j] = transformed[i-2][j]\n                else:\n                    # If not, leave as 0\n                    pass\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. In example 1, for row 0, column 1, the two rows above would be row -1, which is out of bounds. So it would leave as 0. But the output has 2. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by replacing 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above, but if that cell is 2, replace with 2, otherwise replace with 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s. But how to determine the positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in positions where the input has 8s or 5s. For example, in example 1, the 0s are replaced with 2s where the input has 8s or 5s. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think I need to make a decision. Based on the first example, it seems that 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions, and 5s are replaced with 2s. So the code would replace 0s and 5s with 2s. But this would not work for example 2. However, maybe in example 2, the 0s are replaced with 4s in certain positions. So perhaps the replacement depends on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's try to write code that replaces 0s with the value of the cell two rows above, but if that value is 2, replace with 2, if it's 4, replace with 4, etc.\n\nSo, for each cell (i, j), if it's 0, replace with the value from (i-2, j). But if i-2 is out of bounds, leave as 0.\n\nBut in example 1, for row 0, column 1, the value is 0. i-2 is -2, so it's out of bounds. So it would remain 0. But the output is 2. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is replaced with the value from the row two rows above, but if that is 0, replace with 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even, replace 0s with 2s, else replace with 4s. But this is just a guess.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(14):\n        new_row = []\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    new_row.append(2)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(4)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not work for example 1, where the first row is even, and 0s are replaced with 2s. In example 1, the output has 2s in the first row, which fits. For example 2, the first row is even, so 0s would be replaced with 2s, but in example 2, the first row is the same as input, which suggests that this is not the case.\n\nBut perhaps the example 2's first row has no 0s. Let me check example 2's input. The first input row is 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0. Wait, no, example 2's input is 19 columns? Wait, no. Wait, the training examples have 14x14 grids. The input for example 2 is 19 columns? No, the test input has 14 columns. Wait, the training examples have 14 columns. Let me check.\n\nIn example 1, the input is 14 columns. The first line is 0 0 0 0 8 0 5 5 0 8 0 0 0 0. That's 14 elements. So each row has 14 elements.\n\nSo, in example 2, the input is 14 columns. The first input row is 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0? No, that's 24 elements. Wait, no, the example 2 input is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\nWait, but that's 24 elements. But the grid is 14x14, so each row should have 14 elements. This suggests that the example might have a typo, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the input.\n\nWait, the training examples are for 14x14 grids. So each input and output grid has 14 columns and 14 rows. So the input for example 2 must have 14 columns. Let me recheck.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 3 6 6 0 6 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 3 0 6 6 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 6 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, each row has 24 elements? That can't be right. This suggests that there's a mistake in the example, but perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the example is for a 14x14 grid, but the input is written with some formatting issues.\n\nBut given that the test input has 14 columns, I'll proceed under the assumption that the training examples are 14x14 grids.\n\nAssuming that, perhaps the code is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s. But how.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0s with 2s if the cell is in even rows, and 5s with 2s. This is a guess, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(14):\n        new_row = []\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    new_row.append(2)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                new_row.append(2)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. In example 1, this would replace 0s in even rows with 2s. For example, row 0 is even, so 0s are replaced with 2s, which matches the output. For row 1, which is odd, 0s are left as 0, but in example 1's output, some 0s are replaced with 2s. So this may not be correct.\n\nBut given the time, this is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let me start by analyzing Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has some rows with 0s and numbers. The output seems to have some patterns where certain numbers are repeated in specific positions. For instance, looking at the first few rows of the input and output:\n\nInput row 0: 0 0 0 0 8 0 5 5 0 8 0 0 0 0\nOutput row 0: 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0\n\nHmm, so in the input, there are 8s and 5s. The output has 2s in positions where the input had 5s or 8s? Wait, maybe not. Let me check more carefully.\n\nLooking at the input row 0, the 5s are at positions 6 and 7. The output row 0 has 2s at positions 5,6,7,8? Wait, no. Let me look again. The output row 0 is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So the 2s are in positions 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,12. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced with 2s based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain cells are replaced based on their position relative to other cells. For example, in the input, there are some 8s and 5s. The output has 2s in certain positions. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the first row has 2s in positions 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,12. Wait, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the input has 8s or 5s? Or maybe it's based on some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values with others based on their position. For example, in the input, the 5s are in positions where the output has 2s. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output:\n\nIn the input, row 0 has 5s at positions 6 and 7. The output row 0 has 2s at positions 6 and 7. Also, there are 8s in positions 4 and 9. The output has 8s in those positions. So maybe the 8s are preserved, and the 5s are replaced with 2s? But then why are there 2s in other positions?\n\nLooking at the input row 0: 0 0 0 0 8 0 5 5 0 8 0 0 0 0. The output row 0 is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So the 2s are in positions 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,12. Wait, maybe the 2s are in positions where the input has 0s and certain other conditions. Or maybe the 2s are placed in positions that are adjacent to 8s or 5s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at the second example. Let's take the input and output for example 2. For example, the first input row is 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. So that row is the same as the input. But then in the next input row, which is 0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0, the output is 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4. So the 4s are in positions 0,1,3,5,7,9, etc. So maybe the output is replacing 0s with 4s in certain positions, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with numbers based on their position. For example, in the second example, the first row is the same as input. But the second row has 4s in certain positions. Maybe the output is replacing 0s with the value of the cell two rows above? Or some other pattern.\n\nLooking at the second example's input and output, perhaps the output is generated by replacing 0s with numbers based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in the second input row (row 1), the first cell is 0. The cell two rows above (row -1) is 0. But that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. Let me check.\n\nIn example 2, the input for row 1 is 0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. The output for row 1 is 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4. So the first cell is 0 in input, but in output it's 4. The cell two rows above (row -1) is 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. Let's check for row 1, column 0. The input row 1, column 0 is 0. The cell two rows above (row -1) is 0. So that doesn't help. Maybe another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 2, the second row has 4s in positions 0,1,3,5,7,9, etc. Maybe the 4s are placed in even columns? Not sure. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output seems to have 2s in certain positions. For instance, in the first row of the output, the 2s are in positions 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. The input for that row has 8s in positions 4 and 9. The 2s are in positions adjacent to the 8s? Or maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the input has 0s and the value is 8 or 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with numbers based on the value of the cell in the same row and column. For example, if the cell is in a certain position, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the third row of the input is 0 2 2 0 8 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. So the 2s are replacing the 0s and the 5s. So perhaps the 5s are replaced with 2s, and the 0s are replaced with 2s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with the value of the cell two rows above. Let me check. For example, in example 1, row 0 of input is 0 0 0 0 8 0 5 5 0 8 0 0 0 0. The output row 0 is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. So the 2s are in positions 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,12. Maybe the 2s are in positions where the cell two rows above is 2. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by replacing 0s with numbers based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. Let's check for example 1. For row 0, column 1: input is 0. The cell two rows above (row -1) is 0. Not helpful. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the third row of the output is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. The input for that row is 0 2 2 0 8 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0 0. So the 0s are replaced with 2s, and the 5s are replaced with 2s. So maybe the rule is that if the input cell is 0 or 5, replace with 2. But why?\n\nBut then looking at the first row of the output, the input has 0s and 8s. The output has 2s in positions where the input is 0, and 8s where the input is 8. So maybe the rule is that 0s are replaced with 2s, and 8s are kept as 8s. But then why in the first example's output, the 5s are replaced with 2s. But in the input, the 5s are in positions 6 and 7. The output has 2s in those positions. So maybe 5s are replaced with 2s. But then why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s and 5s with 2s, but 8s are kept as 8s. But that seems to fit the first example. Let's check the second example. In example 2, the first input row is all 0s and 3s. The output is the same as input. But in the second input row, the output has 4s in certain positions. So that contradicts the previous idea.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is more complex. Let's think again.\n\nIn example 1, the output seems to have 2s in positions where the input has 0s and 5s. But in example 2, the output for the second row has 4s where the input had 0s. So maybe the value to replace depends on the row. For example, in even rows, 2s are replaced, in odd rows, 4s are replaced. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. Let's check example 1. For row 0, column 1: input is 0. The cell two rows above is row -1, which is 0. Not helpful. Maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions that form a pattern. For instance, in the first row, the 2s are in positions 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. These positions are every other position, except for the 4th and 9th. Wait, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the input has 8s. For example, the input has 8s at positions 4 and 9. The output has 8s at the same positions. The 2s are placed in positions adjacent to those 8s. For example, positions 1,2 are adjacent to position 4? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where the input has 5s or 8s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the third row of the output is all 2s except for the 8s. The input for that row has 0s and 5s. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 2s and the 5s are replaced with 2s. Then the 8s are kept as 8s. But in example 2, the first input row is 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. The output is the same as the input. So that would suggest that in some cases, the 0s are not replaced. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the output for example 1. The output seems to have a pattern where certain cells are replaced with 2s. For instance, in the first row of the output, the 2s are in positions 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,12. These positions are in the same columns as the 8s in the input. For example, the 8 is at position 4, and the 2s are at positions 5 and 6 (which are next to it). Similarly, the 8 is at position 9, and the 2s are at positions 8 and 9 (but 9 is 8). So maybe the 2s are placed in positions adjacent to 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, rows 0, 2, 4, etc. But not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the third row has 2s in all positions except where there are 8s. The input for that row has 0s and 5s. So maybe the rule is that if the input cell is 0 or 5, replace with 2, and if it's 8, leave as 8. But in example 2, the first input row has 3s and 0s, and the output is the same as input. So that would suggest that this rule doesn't apply there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the cell is in a row where the value is 8, then replace 0s with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 2, the second row has 4s in certain positions. The input row is 0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0. The output is 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4 3 4 4 0 4. So the 0s are replaced with 4s where the cell is in a certain pattern. For instance, the 0s are replaced with 4s in positions where the cell is in even columns. Or maybe it's based on the row number.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where certain cells are replaced with 2s, and others are 8s. In example 2, the output has 4s in certain positions. So perhaps the value to replace depends on the row. For example, in even rows, replace 0s with 2s, in odd rows with 4s. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1, the output for row 0 is 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0 8 0 2 2 0. Row 0 is even. In example 2, row 1 (which is odd) has 4s in certain positions. So maybe that's the pattern. But how to determine which value to use based on the row.\n\nBut then in example 2, the first row (row 0) is the same as input. So that would suggest that the rule is not based on the row. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value to replace depends on the value in the input. For example, if the input is 0, replace with 2 if the cell is in a certain position, or 4 if in another. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output of example 1. The output seems to have 2s in positions where the input has 0s and 5s. But in example 2, the output has 4s in positions where the input has 0s. So maybe the value to replace depends on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in example 1, row 0, column 1: input is 0. The cell two rows above (row -1) is 0. Not helpful. But in example 2, row 1, column 0: input is 0. The cell two rows above is row -1, which is 0. Not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value to replace is based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, if the cell two rows above is 2, then replace with 2, and so on. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the output of example 1. The output for row 0 has 2s in positions 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,12. These positions are where the input has 0s and 8s. Wait, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain column. For example, columns 1, 2, 5, 6, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in example 1, row 0, column 1: input is 0. The cell two rows above is row -1, which is 0. So that would replace with 0. But the output is 2. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's think about the output for example 1. The output seems to have 2s in positions that are in certain columns. For example, columns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. These columns are even or odd? Let me see: columns 1 (odd), 2 (even), 5 (odd), 6 (even), 8 (even), 9 (odd), 11 (odd), 12 (even). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in positions where the column index is even or odd. For example, in example 1's first row, columns 1 and 2 are odd and even. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output seems to have a pattern where the 2s are placed in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain row. For example, in even rows, 0s are replaced with 2s, and in odd rows, replaced with 4s. But in example 1, the first row is even, and the output has 2s. In example 2, the second row is odd, and the output has 4s. But in example 2, the first row is even, and the output is the same as input. So this might not hold.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in example 1, row 0, column 1: input is 0. The cell two rows above (row -1) is 0. So that's not helpful. But in example 2, row 1, column 0: input is 0. The cell two rows above is row -1, which is 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nThis is getting me stuck. Let me look for other patterns. In example 1, the output for row 2 is 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 2. The input for row 2 is 0 2 2 0 8 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0 0. So the 0s are replaced with 2s, and the 5s are replaced with 2s. The 8s are kept. So maybe the rule is to replace 0s and 5s with 2s, and 8s are kept. But in example 2, the first row has 3s and 0s, and the output is the same as input. So that would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain position, and 5s with 2s if in another. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for example 1, the 2s are placed in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain column. For example, in the first row, columns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. These columns are in positions where the input has 0s. But the input for those columns in row 0 are 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 5, 5, 0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the 0s are at columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. Wait, but the output has 2s in columns 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,12. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 2s in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is not in a certain pattern. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the cell is in a row that has 8s, replace 0s with 2s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s where the input has 5s or 8s. For example, in the first row, the input has 8s and 5s. The output has 2s where the input has 0s and 5s. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's see:\n\nIn example 1, the output seems to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s. The 8s are kept. In example 2, the output replaces 0s with 4s in certain positions, and 3s with 3s. So maybe the replacement depends on the value of the cell in the input. For example, if the cell is 0, replace with 2 or 4 based on some condition. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value to replace is based on the row number. For example, even rows are replaced with 2, odd rows with 4. Let's check example 1. Row 0 is even, output has 2s. Row 1 is odd, output has 2s in some positions. Wait, no, in example 1's row 1, the output is 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 2 0. So there are 2s in some positions. But if the row is odd, maybe the 0s are replaced with 2s. But this is not consistent with example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in example 1, row 0, column 1: input is 0. The cell two rows above is row -1, which is 0. So that would replace with 0, but the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 2s are placed in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain column. For example, in the first row, columns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. These columns are positions where the input has 0s or 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in even columns, replace 0s with 2s. But in example 1, the first row has 0s in columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. The output has 2s in columns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. So columns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12 are even or odd? Column 1 is odd, 2 is even, 5 is odd, 6 is even, 8 is even, 9 is odd, 11 is odd, 12 is even. So it's a mix of even and odd columns. Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows: for each cell, if the cell is 0, replace it with 2 if it's in a certain position, or 4 if in another. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the third row has 2s in all positions except where there are 8s. The input for that row has 0s and 5s. So perhaps the rule is to replace 0s and 5s with 2s, and 8s with 8s. But in example 2, the first input row has 3s and 0s, and the output is the same as input. So that would suggest that this rule doesn't apply there. But maybe there's a different rule for different values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, rows 0, 2, 4, etc. Let's check example 1's row 0: replaced 0s with 2s. Row 2: replaced 0s with 2s. Row 4: replaced 0s with 2s. But in example 2, row 0 is not replaced, so this might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the row has 8s, then 0s are replaced with 2s. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 2s in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in the first row, the 2s are placed in positions that are adjacent to 8s. Maybe the rule is to replace 0s with 2s if they are adjacent to 8s. But how to check that.\n\nIn the first row of example 1, the input has 8s at positions 4 and 9. The 2s are at positions 5, 6, 8, 9. So positions adjacent to 8s. For example, position 5 is adjacent to 4 (8), position 6 is adjacent to 4 (8), position 8 is adjacent to 9 (8), position 9 is 8. So maybe the rule is to replace 0s with 2s if they are adjacent to 8s. But then, in the input row 0, position 1 is 0 and adjacent to position 0 (0) and 2 (0). Not adjacent to 8. But in the output, it's replaced with 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's think about the test input and see if I can find any patterns.\n\nThe test input is a 14x14 grid. The input has 0s and 5s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 6s, 7s, etc. The output for the test input is not given, but the task is to write a transformation that maps the input to output.\n\nBut since I don't have the test output, I need to focus on the training examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions that form a pattern of horizontal lines. For example, in the first row, the 2s are in positions 1,2,5,6,8,9,11,12. This looks like a pattern where the 2s are placed in every other column, but with some exceptions. For example, columns 1 and 2 are filled, then columns 5 and 6, then 8 and 9, then 11 and 12. This could be a pattern where the 2s are placed in columns where the column index is 1 or 2, then 5 or 6, etc. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are placed in columns that are even or odd. For example, columns 1 (odd), 2 (even), 5 (odd), 6 (even), 8 (even), 9 (odd), 11 (odd), 12 (even). This seems to be a mix of even and odd columns. Not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's say that the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s, and 8s are kept. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s if the cell is in a row where the row number is even. Let's check example 1: row 0 is even, and 0s are replaced with 2s. Row 1 is odd, but in the output, some 0s are replaced with 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possible pattern: in example 1, the output has 2s in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain column. For example, in the first row, the 2s are placed in columns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. These columns are where the input has 0s or 8s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s if the cell is in a column that is even or odd. For example, in even columns, replace 0s with 2s. But in example 1's first row, columns 1 (odd), 2 (even), 5 (odd), 6 (even), etc. So some even columns are replaced, others are not.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess. Based on the examples, it seems that 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions, and 5s are replaced with 2s. 8s are kept. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s where the cell is in a certain pattern, and 5s with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine that pattern. Maybe the pattern is that in even rows, 0s are replaced with 2s, and in odd rows, 4s are replaced. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value to replace is based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, if the cell two rows above is 2, replace with 2, if it's 4, replace with 4, etc. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s if the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, if the cell is in a row where the row number is even, replace 0s with 2s. Otherwise, replace with 4s. Let's test this.\n\nIn example 1, row 0 is even. So 0s are replaced with 2s. In row 1 (odd), the output has 2s in some positions. But according to this hypothesis, 0s would be replaced with 4s. But in example 1's row 1, the output has 2s, not 4s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain column. For example, columns where the column index is even or odd. But this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions, and 5s are replaced with 2s, and 8s are kept. But how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example, in example 1, row 0, column 1: input is 0. The cell two rows above is row -1, which is 0. So replace with 0. But the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the value to replace is based on the value of the cell in the same row but two columns to the left. For example, in row 0, column 1: the cell to the left is column 0 (0). Replace with 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to write a function that replaces 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s, and 8s are kept. But how to determine the positions.\n\nLooking back at example 1's output, the 2s are placed in positions where the input has 0s and the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, in row 0, columns 1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12. These are columns where the input has 0s, and the column index is not a multiple of 4. Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, the 2s are placed in positions where the column index is even or odd, but this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to write a function that replaces 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s. For example, in the first example, the 0s are replaced with 2s, and 5s are replaced with 2s. So the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 0 or val == 5:\n                new_row.append(2)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not work for example 2, where the first row has 3s and 0s, but the output is the same as input. So this suggests that the pattern is not as simple as replacing 0s and 5s with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above. For example:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check the cell two rows above\n                if i >= 2:\n                    transformed[i][j] = transformed[i-2][j]\n                else:\n                    # If not, leave as 0\n                    pass\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. In example 1, for row 0, column 1, the two rows above would be row -1, which is out of bounds. So it would leave as 0. But the output has 2. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by replacing 0s with the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above, but if that cell is 2, replace with 2, otherwise replace with 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s. But how to determine the positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s in positions where the input has 8s or 5s. For example, in example 1, the 0s are replaced with 2s where the input has 8s or 5s. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think I need to make a decision. Based on the first example, it seems that 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions, and 5s are replaced with 2s. So the code would replace 0s and 5s with 2s. But this would not work for example 2. However, maybe in example 2, the 0s are replaced with 4s in certain positions. So perhaps the replacement depends on the value of the cell in the same column but two rows above.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's try to write code that replaces 0s with the value of the cell two rows above, but if that value is 2, replace with 2, if it's 4, replace with 4, etc.\n\nSo, for each cell (i, j), if it's 0, replace with the value from (i-2, j). But if i-2 is out of bounds, leave as 0.\n\nBut in example 1, for row 0, column 1, the value is 0. i-2 is -2, so it's out of bounds. So it would remain 0. But the output is 2. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is replaced with the value from the row two rows above, but if that is 0, replace with 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even, replace 0s with 2s, else replace with 4s. But this is just a guess.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(14):\n        new_row = []\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    new_row.append(2)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(4)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not work for example 1, where the first row is even, and 0s are replaced with 2s. In example 1, the output has 2s in the first row, which fits. For example 2, the first row is even, so 0s would be replaced with 2s, but in example 2, the first row is the same as input, which suggests that this is not the case.\n\nBut perhaps the example 2's first row has no 0s. Let me check example 2's input. The first input row is 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0. Wait, no, example 2's input is 19 columns? Wait, no. Wait, the training examples have 14x14 grids. The input for example 2 is 19 columns? No, the test input has 14 columns. Wait, the training examples have 14 columns. Let me check.\n\nIn example 1, the input is 14 columns. The first line is 0 0 0 0 8 0 5 5 0 8 0 0 0 0. That's 14 elements. So each row has 14 elements.\n\nSo, in example 2, the input is 14 columns. The first input row is 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0? No, that's 24 elements. Wait, no, the example 2 input is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\nWait, but that's 24 elements. But the grid is 14x14, so each row should have 14 elements. This suggests that the example might have a typo, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the input.\n\nWait, the training examples are for 14x14 grids. So each input and output grid has 14 columns and 14 rows. So the input for example 2 must have 14 columns. Let me recheck.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 4 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 3 6 6 0 6 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 0 3 0 6 6 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0 6 0 3 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, each row has 24 elements? That can't be right. This suggests that there's a mistake in the example, but perhaps it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the example is for a 14x14 grid, but the input is written with some formatting issues.\n\nBut given that the test input has 14 columns, I'll proceed under the assumption that the training examples are 14x14 grids.\n\nAssuming that, perhaps the code is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions, and 5s with 2s. But how.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0s with 2s if the cell is in even rows, and 5s with 2s. This is a guess, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(14):\n        new_row = []\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    new_row.append(2)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                new_row.append(2)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. In example 1, this would replace 0s in even rows with 2s. For example, row 0 is even, so 0s are replaced with 2s, which matches the output. For row 1, which is odd, 0s are left as 0, but in example 1's output, some 0s are replaced with 2s. So this may not be correct.\n\nBut given the time, this is the best I can do.\n"
