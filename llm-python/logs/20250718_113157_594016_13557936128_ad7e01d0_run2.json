The output grid appears to be an extension of the input grid, with the input grid repeated in some fashion.\n2. In Example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid and the output is a 9x9 grid, which suggests that the input is repeated in a certain pattern.\n3. In Example 2, the input is a 3x3 grid and the output is a 9x9 grid, with the input pattern repeated in a specific way.\n4. In Example 3, the input is a 4x4 grid and the output is a 16x16 grid, suggesting a more complex pattern of repetition.\n5. In Example 4, the input is a 4x4 grid and the output is a 16x16 grid, with some pattern of repetition and modification.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves repeating the input grid in a specific pattern to create a larger grid. The exact pattern is not fully clear, but I will implement a transformation that extends the input grid in a way that matches the observed patterns.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the dimensions of the input grid\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Create a new 9x9 grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Fill the transformed grid based on the observed pattern\n    # This is a simplified pattern that extends the input grid in a specific way\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # Copy the input grid to the transformed grid\n            for x in range(rows):\n                for y in range(cols):\n                    transformed_grid[i*3 + x][j*3 + y] = grid[x][y]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid appears to be an extension of the input grid, with the input grid repeated in some fashion.\n2. In Example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid and the output is a 9x9 grid, which suggests that the input is repeated in a certain pattern.\n3. In Example 2, the input is a 3x3 grid and the output is a 9x9 grid, with the input pattern repeated in a specific way.\n4. In Example 3, the input is a 4x4 grid and the output is a 16x16 grid, suggesting a more complex pattern of repetition.\n5. In Example 4, the input is a 4x4 grid and the output is a 16x16 grid, with some pattern of repetition and modification.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves repeating the input grid in a specific pattern to create a larger grid. The exact pattern is not fully clear, but I will implement a transformation that extends the input grid in a way that matches the observed patterns.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the dimensions of the input grid\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Create a new 9x9 grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Fill the transformed grid based on the observed pattern\n    # This is a simplified pattern that extends the input grid in a specific way\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # Copy the input grid to the transformed grid\n            for x in range(rows):\n                for y in range(cols):\n                    transformed_grid[i*3 + x][j*3 + y] = grid[x][y]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
