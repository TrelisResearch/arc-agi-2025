          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, the input and output grids are given for two examples. Let me look at Example 1 first.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 3x4 grid (since each line has 3 numbers, and there are 3 lines). The output is a 6x6 grid. Wait, but the input is 3 rows, each with 3 numbers. The output is 6 rows, each with 6 numbers. Hmm. How does that transformation work?\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 0: 3 0 0\nRow 1: 3 4 0\nRow 2: 3 4 2\n\nOutput is 6 rows, each with 6 elements. Let me look at the output rows:\n\nFirst output row: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nSecond: 0 4 3 3 4 0\nThird: 0 0 3 3 0 0\nFourth: 0 0 3 3 0 0\nFifth: 0 4 3 3 4 0\nSixth: 2 4 3 3 4 2\n\nHmm. So the input is 3 rows, and the output is 6 rows. Maybe the output is generated by some kind of expansion or mirroring. Let me see if there's a pattern in how the input is transformed.\n\nLooking at the input rows, maybe each input row is used to generate two rows in the output? For example, the first input row (3 0 0) becomes the first two output rows? But the first output row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the input is used to generate a pattern that's mirrored or expanded.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The third and fourth rows are 0 0 3 3 0 0 and same again. Then fifth is same as second, and sixth same as first. So there's some symmetry here. Maybe the output is a combination of the input rows mirrored in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is being transformed into a grid that's a combination of the input rows and their mirrored versions. But how?\n\nLet me look at the input for Example 1 again. The input is 3 rows. The output is 6 rows. So maybe each input row is expanded into two rows in the output. For example, the first input row (3 0 0) becomes two rows. But how?\n\nLooking at the first input row, 3 0 0. The first output row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The second output row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The third and fourth rows are 0 0 3 3 0 0. Then fifth is same as second, sixth same as first. So maybe the first two output rows are derived from the first input row, then the third and fourth from the second, and fifth and sixth from the third? But that seems a bit arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 6x6 grid that's constructed by some pattern based on the input. For example, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is 6x6. Wait, but the input in Example 1 is 3 rows, each with 3 numbers. The output is 6 rows, each with 6 numbers. So maybe the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid that's generated by some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each input cell into a 2x2 block. For example, each cell in the input is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output. But that would make the output size (3x3) * 2x2 = 6x6, which matches. Let's check that idea.\n\nLet me take the first input cell (3,0,0). If each cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, then for the first input row (3,0,0), each cell would be transformed into a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nBut the output is 6x6. Let's think: if the input is 3x3 (3 rows, 3 columns), then expanding each cell into 2x2 would result in 6x6. So each cell in the input is replaced by a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nFor example, the first input cell (row 0, column 0) is 3. If that's replaced by a 2x2 block, maybe the block is filled with 3s? But looking at the output, the first output row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is used to generate a grid where each cell is part of a larger pattern. For example, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid that is constructed by some pattern involving the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of mirroring or rotation. For example, the input is transformed into a grid that's a combination of the input and its mirrored versions.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The sixth row is same as first. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The fifth row is same as second. The third and fourth rows are 0 0 3 3 0 0. So the output is symmetric in some way. Maybe the output is a symmetric grid that's built from the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying some transformation that creates a 6x6 grid. For example, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid that's constructed by some pattern. Let's think of the input as a 3x3 grid, and the output as a 6x6 grid where each cell in the input is expanded into a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 1. Let's see the first row of output: 2 4 3 3 4 2. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0. The fourth row is same as third. The fifth row is same as second, sixth same as first.\n\nSo the output seems to have a pattern where the middle rows are 0s and 3s, and the outer rows have 2s and 4s. Maybe the input is used to determine the values in the output. For example, the input is 3 rows, each with 3 numbers. Let's look at the input for Example 1 again:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 0: 3 0 0\nRow 1: 3 4 0\nRow 2: 3 4 2\n\nSo the input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 6x6 grid. How does this relate? Maybe the output is generated by some pattern that depends on the input's rows and columns.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid that is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a larger grid. For example, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell in the input is mapped to a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where the first three rows are generated from the input rows, and the next three rows are mirrored or transformed versions. For example, the first three rows of the output might be derived from the input's first three rows, and the next three are mirrored.\n\nBut looking at the output of Example 1, the first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nRow 1: 0 4 3 3 4 0\nRow 2: 0 0 3 3 0 0\n\nThen rows 3-6 are same as rows 2-0 (but reversed? Or mirrored?).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the input and creating a grid where each input cell is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output. For example, the input cell (i,j) is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output starting at position (2i, 2j). But how?\n\nLet's think about the input for Example 1. The input is a 3x3 grid. So for each cell (i,j) in the input, we generate a 2x2 block in the output. So the output would be 6x6. Let's try to see:\n\nFor example, the input cell (0,0) is 3. So in the output, the block starting at (0,0) would be 2x2. But what values? The first output row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. So the first two elements are 2 and 4. Maybe that's part of the block generated from (0,0). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is used to determine the values in the output in a way that depends on the position. For example, the output is a grid that is a combination of the input's values and their mirrored versions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that's based on the input's values. For example, the output is a grid that is filled with values based on the input's values in a certain way.\n\nLooking at Example 2, which has input of 4 rows, each with 4 numbers. The output is 8 rows, each with 8 numbers. So the input is 4x4, output is 8x8. That suggests that the output is generated by expanding each input cell into a 2x2 block. Because 4x4 input would become 8x8 output. So that's a possible pattern.\n\nSo, for each cell in the input, it's expanded into a 2x2 block in the output. How?\n\nLet's look at Example 1. The input is 3x3. The output is 6x6. So each input cell is expanded into 2x2. So for each input cell (i,j), the output has a block of 2x2 starting at (2i, 2j). But how to fill that block?\n\nLooking at the first input cell (0,0) which is 3. The output block starting at (0,0) would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 3 3\n\nBut the first two elements of the first output row are 2 and 4. So maybe that's the first block. Then the next block for (0,1) is 0, which would generate a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some pattern where each input cell is used to generate a 2x2 block. For example, the value of the input cell is used to fill the block in a certain way.\n\nBut how to determine the values in the block? Let's take the first input cell (0,0) which is 3. The first block in the output (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 3 3\n\nBut how does 3 relate to 2,4,3,3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and its neighbors. For example, the first block is filled with values that are based on the input cell and its adjacent cells.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Let's look at Example 2.\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 6 0 0\nRow 1: 4 6 0 3\nRow 2: 4 6 3 0\nRow 3: 4 3 3 0\n\nThe output is 8x8. The output's first row is 0 3 3 4 4 3 3 0. Let's see if this can be derived from the input.\n\nIf the input is 4x4, then each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block. So the first row of the output is the first two rows of the first two blocks in the first two columns.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each input cell and using it to generate a 2x2 block where the value is determined by some formula. For example, the block is filled with values that are based on the input cell's value and its position in the block.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's think of the output of Example 1. The first block (input cell 0,0) is 3. The block in output is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 3 3\n\nBut what's the pattern here? The first row is 2 and 4, which could be 3-1 and 3+1. The second row is 3 and 3. Maybe the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value. For example, the top-left cell is 3, and the block is filled with 2,4,3,3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid that's a combination of the input's values and their mirrored versions. For example, each input cell is mirrored in some way to form the output.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output of Example 1. The output is symmetric. The first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The sixth row is same as first. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The fifth row is same as second. The third and fourth rows are 0 0 3 3 0 0. So the output is symmetric along the vertical axis and horizontal axis.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1: the input is:\n\nRow 0: 3 0 0\nRow 1: 3 4 0\nRow 2: 3 4 2\n\nSo the input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 6x6 grid. Let's imagine that the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid that is a combination of the input and its mirrored versions. For example, each row in the input is mirrored and expanded into two rows in the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by creating a grid that is a combination of the input and its flipped versions. For example, the first three rows of the output are derived from the input, and the next three are the flipped versions.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid that is generated by taking the input and creating a pattern where each cell in the input is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output. For example, the value of the input cell determines the values in the block. For instance, if the input cell is 3, then the block is filled with 2, 4, 3, 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is replaced by a 2x2 block that depends on the input cell's value. For example, the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and its position in the block.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find a clear pattern. Let's think about the output for Example 1 again. The first block (input cell 0,0) is 3. The output block is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 3 3\n\nSo the first row of the block is 2 and 4. The second row is 3 and 3. The value 3 is the input cell's value. So maybe the block is filled with values that are based on the input cell's value and its neighbors. For example, the first row is 2 and 4, which are 3-1 and 3+1. The second row is 3 and 3.\n\nBut how does that fit with the other blocks?\n\nLooking at the input cell (0,1), which is 0. The block for this cell would be in the output starting at (0,2). The output row 0 has elements 3,3,4,2. Wait, the first output row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. So the first block (0,0) is 2,4, then next block (0,1) is 3,3, then next block (0,2) is 4, 2. But that doesn't fit with the input cell's value of 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled with values that are determined by the input cell's value and its position in the block. For example, the top-left cell of the block is determined by some formula, and the others are derived from that.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output. The first row of output is 0 3 3 4 4 3 3 0. The input for Example 2 is a 4x4 grid. The output is 8x8. So again, the output is generated by expanding each input cell into a 2x2 block. Let's see:\n\nThe first row of the output is 0 3 3 4 4 3 3 0. This could be the first two rows of the first two blocks in the first two columns.\n\nFor example, the first input cell is 0 (row 0, column 0). The first block (2x2) would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 3\nRow 1: 3 3\n\nBut the first two elements of the first output row are 0 and 3. Then the next block (input cell 0,1 which is 6) would be:\n\nRow 0: 3 4\nRow 1: 4 3\n\nBut the next elements in the first output row are 3, 3, 4, 4. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled with values that are determined by the input cell's value and its position. For example, the block is filled with the input cell's value in the middle, and other values around it. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each input cell is used to generate a 2x2 block, and the values in the block are based on the input cell's value and its neighbors.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe the pattern is that the output is generated by expanding the input into a larger grid, where each cell in the input is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output, and the values in the block are derived from the input cell and its neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid that is a combination of the input's values and their mirrored versions. For example, the output is a grid that is a combination of the input and its flipped version, expanded into a larger grid.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell in the output is determined by the input cell's value and its position. For example, the output is a grid where each cell (i,j) in the output is determined by the input cell (i//2, j//2), but with some transformation.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to think of the first example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is 3x3. The output is 6x6. So for each output cell (i,j), the corresponding input cell is (i//2, j//2). Let's see:\n\nFor output cell (0,0), input is (0,0) which is 3. But the output cell (0,0) is 2. So that doesn't fit. But maybe there's a transformation based on the input cell's value and its position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is replaced by a 2x2 block that is filled with values based on the input cell's value and its neighbors. For example, the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell and its adjacent cells.\n\nBut this is too vague. Another idea: perhaps the output is a grid where each input cell is used to generate a 2x2 block that is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value. For example, the block is filled with values that are based on the input cell's value and the position in the block.\n\nFor example, in the first example, the input cell (0,0) is 3. The block is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 3 3\n\nSo the top-left cell is 2, top-right is 4, bottom-left is 3, bottom-right is 3. Maybe this is derived from the input cell's value. For example, the top-left is input cell's value minus 1, top-right is input cell's value plus 1, and the bottom row is input cell's value. But that would make the block:\n\nFor input cell 3, the block is:\n\n2 4\n3 3\n\nWhich matches the first block. Then for input cell (0,1) which is 0, the block would be:\n\n0-1 = -1? But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the block is filled with values that are determined by the input cell's value and some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled with values that are based on the input cell's value and its position in the block. For example, the top-left is input cell's value minus 1, top-right is input cell's value plus 1, bottom-left is input cell's value, and bottom-right is input cell's value.\n\nBut for the input cell (0,0) which is 3, that would give 2,4,3,3 which matches the first block. For input cell (0,1) which is 0, the block would be -1, 1, 0, 0. But that's not possible since the output has 0s and 4s. So this seems incorrect.\n\nBut in the first example, the input cell (0,1) is 0. The block for this cell would be in the output starting at (0,2). The first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. So the block for (0,1) is 3,3. But according to the previous idea, it would be -1,1, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the previous idea is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output of Example 1. The first block (input cell 0,0) is 2 4 3 3. The second block (input cell 0,1) is 3 3 4 2. Wait, but the first output row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. So the first block is 2 4 (row 0), then next block is 3 3 (row 0, columns 2-3), then next block is 4 2 (columns 4-5). But how does that relate to the input cell values?\n\nThe input cell (0,0) is 3, (0,1) is 0, (0,2) is 0. So maybe the block for (0,0) is derived from the input cell's value and its neighbors. For example, the first block is derived from the input cell (0,0) and (0,1). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid that is a combination of the input and its mirrored versions. For example, the output is a grid that is created by taking the input and mirroring it horizontally and vertically, then expanding it into a larger grid.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Given that the test input is provided, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that can be generalized.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input cell's value and its position in the output grid. For example, the output is generated by some transformation that depends on the input cell's value and its position in the output.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is the sum of the input cell and its neighbors. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input cell's value and its position in the output. For example, if the output is 6x6, then each input cell is used to generate a 2x2 block, and the values in the block are determined by the input cell's value and its position in the block.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think of the first example's output. The first block (input cell 0,0) is 2 4 3 3. This could be derived from the input cell's value (3) and some transformation. For example, the top-left is 3-1=2, top-right is 3+1=4, bottom-left is 3, bottom-right is 3. This seems to fit.\n\nFor the next block (input cell 0,1) which is 0. The block would be 0-1=-1, 0+1=1, 0, 0. But that's not possible. However, in the output, the block for (0,1) is 3 3 4 2. Wait, but how does that fit with the input cell's value of 0?\n\nThis suggests that this pattern may not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and the input cell's neighboring cells. For example, the block is filled with the input cell's value and the values of adjacent cells.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time I have, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be implemented, even if it's not perfect.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output rows are symmetric. The first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2, which is symmetric. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0, also symmetric. The third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0, symmetric. So the output is symmetric along both axes.\n\nThis suggests that the output is a symmetric grid, which may be generated by some transformation of the input.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input cell's value and its position in the output grid. For example, the output is generated by some kind of transformation that takes the input and creates a symmetric grid.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid that is a combination of the input and its mirrored versions. For example, the output is created by taking the input and mirroring it horizontally and vertically, then expanding it into a larger grid.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that the output for Example 1 is symmetric, and the input is 3x3, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a larger grid, and the values are determined by some pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find the exact pattern.\n\nMaybe I should try to think of the output as a grid where each input cell is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output. For example, the input cell (i,j) is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output starting at (2i, 2j). The values in the block are determined by the input cell's value and some pattern.\n\nFor example, the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and its position in the block. For instance, the top-left cell is the input cell's value minus 1, the top-right is input cell's value plus 1, and the bottom row is input cell's value.\n\nBut this would work for the first block in Example 1. For input cell 3, the block is 2,4,3,3. For the input cell 0, the block would be -1,1,0,0, but that's not possible since the output has 0s and 4s.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the block for input cell (0,1) is 3,3,4,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and the input cell's position in the input grid. For example, the block is filled with values based on the input cell's value and its row and column.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is the same as the input cell's value, but expanded into a 2x2 block. But that would not match the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input cell (0,0) is 3. If the block is filled with 3s, then the first block would be 3 3 / 3 3, but the output is 2 4 3 3. So this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure of the exact pattern. But given that the output for Example 1 is symmetric and the input is 3x3, and the output is 6x6, I'll hypothesize that each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, and the values in the block are determined by some pattern based on the input cell's value and its position.\n\nFor example, the block for input cell (i,j) is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and its position in the block. For instance, the top-left cell is input value minus 1, top-right is input value plus 1, bottom-left is input value, and bottom-right is input value. This would work for the first block in Example 1.\n\nBut for input cell (0,1) which is 0, this would give -1, 1, 0, 0. But in the output, the block for (0,1) is 3,3,4,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and its neighboring cells. For example, the block is filled with values that are based on the input cell and its adjacent cells in the input grid.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of the output as a grid where each cell is determined by the input cell's value and its position in the output grid. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell (i,j) is determined by the input cell (i//2, j//2), but with some transformation.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1.\n\nFor output cell (0,0), input cell is (0,0) which is 3. The output cell (0,0) is 2. So maybe the output cell is input cell's value minus 1.\n\nFor output cell (0,1), input cell is (0,0) which is 3. The output cell (0,1) is 4, which is input cell's value plus 1.\n\nFor output cell (1,0), input cell is (0,0) which is 3. Output cell is 3, which is input cell's value.\n\nFor output cell (1,1), input cell is (0,0) which is 3. Output cell is 3.\n\nSo this suggests that the block for input cell (i,j) is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and its position in the block. For example:\n\n- Top-left: input value - 1\n- Top-right: input value + 1\n- Bottom-left: input value\n- Bottom-right: input value\n\nBut this would work for the first block. Let's check for the first block in Example 1.\n\nInput cell (0,0) is 3. Block is:\n\n2 4\n3 3\n\nWhich matches the first block. Now, for the next block, input cell (0,1) is 0. According to this pattern, the block would be:\n\n- Top-left: 0-1 = -1\n- Top-right: 0+1 = 1\n- Bottom-left: 0\n- Bottom-right: 0\n\nBut in the output, the block for (0,1) is 3,3,4,2. So this doesn't fit. But wait, perhaps this pattern is only for certain cells?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the block is filled with values based on the input cell's value and its neighbors in the input grid. For example, the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and the values of adjacent cells.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, and the values in the block are derived from the input cell's value and its position in the block. For example, the top-left is input value minus 1, top-right is input value plus 1, and the bottom row is input value.\n\nThis would generate the first block in Example 1 correctly. For other blocks, it might not fit, but perhaps it's the best guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\n- For each cell (i,j) in the input grid, create a 2x2 block in the output grid starting at (2i, 2j).\n- The block is filled with the following values:\n  - (2i, 2j) \u2192 input_val - 1\n  - (2i, 2j + 1) \u2192 input_val + 1\n  - (2i + 1, 2j) \u2192 input_val\n  - (2i + 1, 2j + 1) \u2192 input_val\n\nBut this would generate the first block correctly for Example 1, but for other cells, it may not fit.\n\nLet's test this for Example 1's input cell (0,1) which is 0. The block would be:\n\n- (0,2) \u2192 0-1 = -1\n- (0,3) \u2192 0+1 = 1\n- (1,2) \u2192 0\n- (1,3) \u2192 0\n\nBut in the output, the first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. So the first row of the output has elements 2,4,3,3,4,2. The block for (0,1) is columns 2-3, which would be 3 and 3. But according to this hypothesis, it would be -1 and 1. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the block is filled with the input cell's value in the bottom row and the top row is derived from the input cell's value and its neighbors.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. This could be the result of taking the input row and expanding it into a pattern. For example, the input row is [3, 0, 0]. The first output row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. This could be a pattern where the first two elements are derived from the first input cell, then the next two from the second input cell, and so on.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid that is a combination of the input and its mirrored versions, and then expanding it into a larger grid.\n\nFor example, the input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 6x6 grid where each row is a combination of the input's rows and their mirrored versions.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is a grid where each row is a combination of the input's rows and their mirrored versions, and each column is similarly processed.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm running out of time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output is generated by expanding each input cell into a 2x2 block, and the values in the block are derived from the input cell's value and its position in the block. Even if this doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the input dimensions\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    # Create a 6x6 output grid\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(6)] for _ in range(6)]\n    # For each cell in the input grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            # Calculate the starting position in the output\n            start_row = 2 * i\n            start_col = 2 * j\n            # Fill the 2x2 block\n            output[start_row][start_col] = val - 1\n            output[start_row][start_col + 1] = val + 1\n            output[start_row + 1][start_col] = val\n            output[start_row + 1][start_col + 1] = val\n    return output\n\nBut this would generate for Example 1's input cell (0,0) the block 2 4 3 3, which matches the first block. For input cell (0,1) which is 0, it would generate -1, 1, 0, 0. But the output for the first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps this is not the correct pattern. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not work for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and its position in the block, but with some other logic. For example, the top row is val-1 and val+1, and the bottom row is val and val.\n\nBut this is what I have already.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled with the input cell's value in the middle and some other values around it.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the third row of the output is 0 0 3 3 0 0. This suggests that the middle of the output is filled with 3s, which could be derived from the input cell (1,2) which is 2. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the code that expands each input cell into a 2x2 block, and fills it with the values as described, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, the input and output grids are given for two examples. Let me look at Example 1 first.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 3x4 grid (since each line has 3 numbers, and there are 3 lines). The output is a 6x6 grid. Wait, but the input is 3 rows, each with 3 numbers. The output is 6 rows, each with 6 numbers. Hmm. How does that transformation work?\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 0: 3 0 0\nRow 1: 3 4 0\nRow 2: 3 4 2\n\nOutput is 6 rows, each with 6 elements. Let me look at the output rows:\n\nFirst output row: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nSecond: 0 4 3 3 4 0\nThird: 0 0 3 3 0 0\nFourth: 0 0 3 3 0 0\nFifth: 0 4 3 3 4 0\nSixth: 2 4 3 3 4 2\n\nHmm. So the input is 3 rows, and the output is 6 rows. Maybe the output is generated by some kind of expansion or mirroring. Let me see if there's a pattern in how the input is transformed.\n\nLooking at the input rows, maybe each input row is used to generate two rows in the output? For example, the first input row (3 0 0) becomes the first two output rows? But the first output row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the input is used to generate a pattern that's mirrored or expanded.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The third and fourth rows are 0 0 3 3 0 0 and same again. Then fifth is same as second, and sixth same as first. So there's some symmetry here. Maybe the output is a combination of the input rows mirrored in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is being transformed into a grid that's a combination of the input rows and their mirrored versions. But how?\n\nLet me look at the input for Example 1 again. The input is 3 rows. The output is 6 rows. So maybe each input row is expanded into two rows in the output. For example, the first input row (3 0 0) becomes two rows. But how?\n\nLooking at the first input row, 3 0 0. The first output row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The second output row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The third and fourth rows are 0 0 3 3 0 0. Then fifth is same as second, sixth same as first. So maybe the first two output rows are derived from the first input row, then the third and fourth from the second, and fifth and sixth from the third? But that seems a bit arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 6x6 grid that's constructed by some pattern based on the input. For example, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is 6x6. Wait, but the input in Example 1 is 3 rows, each with 3 numbers. The output is 6 rows, each with 6 numbers. So maybe the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid that's generated by some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each input cell into a 2x2 block. For example, each cell in the input is expanded into a 2x2 block in the output. But that would make the output size (3x3) * 2x2 = 6x6, which matches. Let's check that idea.\n\nLet me take the first input cell (3,0,0). If each cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, then for the first input row (3,0,0), each cell would be transformed into a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nBut the output is 6x6. Let's think: if the input is 3x3 (3 rows, 3 columns), then expanding each cell into 2x2 would result in 6x6. So each cell in the input is replaced by a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nFor example, the first input cell (row 0, column 0) is 3. If that's replaced by a 2x2 block, maybe the block is filled with 3s? But looking at the output, the first output row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is used to generate a grid where each cell is part of a larger pattern. For example, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid that is constructed by some pattern involving the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of mirroring or rotation. For example, the input is transformed into a grid that's a combination of the input and its mirrored versions.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The sixth row is same as first. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The fifth row is same as second. The third and fourth rows are 0 0 3 3 0 0. So the output is symmetric in some way. Maybe the output is a symmetric grid that's built from the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying some transformation that creates a 6x6 grid. For example, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid that's constructed by some pattern. Let's think of the input as a 3x3 grid, and the output as a 6x6 grid where each cell in the input is expanded into a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 1. Let's see the first row of output: 2 4 3 3 4 2. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0. The fourth row is same as third. The fifth row is same as second, sixth same as first.\n\nSo the output seems to have a pattern where the middle rows are 0s and 3s, and the outer rows have 2s and 4s. Maybe the input is used to determine the values in the output. For example, the input is 3 rows, each with 3 numbers. Let's look at the input for Example 1 again:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 0: 3 0 0\nRow 1: 3 4 0\nRow 2: 3 4 2\n\nSo the input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 6x6 grid. How does this relate? Maybe the output is generated by some pattern that depends on the input's rows and columns.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid that is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a larger grid. For example, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell in the input is mapped to a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where the first three rows are generated from the input rows, and the next three rows are mirrored or transformed versions. For example, the first three rows of the output might be derived from the input's first three rows, and the next three are mirrored.\n\nBut looking at the output of Example 1, the first three rows are:\n\nRow 0: 2 4 3 3 4 2\nRow 1: 0 4 3 3 4 0\nRow 2: 0 0 3 3 0 0\n\nThen rows 3-6 are same as rows 2-0 (but reversed? Or mirrored?).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the input and creating a grid where each input cell is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output. For example, the input cell (i,j) is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output starting at position (2i, 2j). But how?\n\nLet's think about the input for Example 1. The input is a 3x3 grid. So for each cell (i,j) in the input, we generate a 2x2 block in the output. So the output would be 6x6. Let's try to see:\n\nFor example, the input cell (0,0) is 3. So in the output, the block starting at (0,0) would be 2x2. But what values? The first output row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. So the first two elements are 2 and 4. Maybe that's part of the block generated from (0,0). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is used to determine the values in the output in a way that depends on the position. For example, the output is a grid that is a combination of the input's values and their mirrored versions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern that's based on the input's values. For example, the output is a grid that is filled with values based on the input's values in a certain way.\n\nLooking at Example 2, which has input of 4 rows, each with 4 numbers. The output is 8 rows, each with 8 numbers. So the input is 4x4, output is 8x8. That suggests that the output is generated by expanding each input cell into a 2x2 block. Because 4x4 input would become 8x8 output. So that's a possible pattern.\n\nSo, for each cell in the input, it's expanded into a 2x2 block in the output. How?\n\nLet's look at Example 1. The input is 3x3. The output is 6x6. So each input cell is expanded into 2x2. So for each input cell (i,j), the output has a block of 2x2 starting at (2i, 2j). But how to fill that block?\n\nLooking at the first input cell (0,0) which is 3. The output block starting at (0,0) would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 3 3\n\nBut the first two elements of the first output row are 2 and 4. So maybe that's the first block. Then the next block for (0,1) is 0, which would generate a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some pattern where each input cell is used to generate a 2x2 block. For example, the value of the input cell is used to fill the block in a certain way.\n\nBut how to determine the values in the block? Let's take the first input cell (0,0) which is 3. The first block in the output (rows 0-1, columns 0-1) is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 3 3\n\nBut how does 3 relate to 2,4,3,3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and its neighbors. For example, the first block is filled with values that are based on the input cell and its adjacent cells.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Let's look at Example 2.\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 6 0 0\nRow 1: 4 6 0 3\nRow 2: 4 6 3 0\nRow 3: 4 3 3 0\n\nThe output is 8x8. The output's first row is 0 3 3 4 4 3 3 0. Let's see if this can be derived from the input.\n\nIf the input is 4x4, then each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block. So the first row of the output is the first two rows of the first two blocks in the first two columns.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each input cell and using it to generate a 2x2 block where the value is determined by some formula. For example, the block is filled with values that are based on the input cell's value and its position in the block.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's think of the output of Example 1. The first block (input cell 0,0) is 3. The block in output is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 3 3\n\nBut what's the pattern here? The first row is 2 and 4, which could be 3-1 and 3+1. The second row is 3 and 3. Maybe the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value. For example, the top-left cell is 3, and the block is filled with 2,4,3,3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid that's a combination of the input's values and their mirrored versions. For example, each input cell is mirrored in some way to form the output.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output of Example 1. The output is symmetric. The first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. The sixth row is same as first. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0. The fifth row is same as second. The third and fourth rows are 0 0 3 3 0 0. So the output is symmetric along the vertical axis and horizontal axis.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1: the input is:\n\nRow 0: 3 0 0\nRow 1: 3 4 0\nRow 2: 3 4 2\n\nSo the input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 6x6 grid. Let's imagine that the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid that is a combination of the input and its mirrored versions. For example, each row in the input is mirrored and expanded into two rows in the output.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by creating a grid that is a combination of the input and its flipped versions. For example, the first three rows of the output are derived from the input, and the next three are the flipped versions.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid that is generated by taking the input and creating a pattern where each cell in the input is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output. For example, the value of the input cell determines the values in the block. For instance, if the input cell is 3, then the block is filled with 2, 4, 3, 3. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is replaced by a 2x2 block that depends on the input cell's value. For example, the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and its position in the block.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find a clear pattern. Let's think about the output for Example 1 again. The first block (input cell 0,0) is 3. The output block is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 3 3\n\nSo the first row of the block is 2 and 4. The second row is 3 and 3. The value 3 is the input cell's value. So maybe the block is filled with values that are based on the input cell's value and its neighbors. For example, the first row is 2 and 4, which are 3-1 and 3+1. The second row is 3 and 3.\n\nBut how does that fit with the other blocks?\n\nLooking at the input cell (0,1), which is 0. The block for this cell would be in the output starting at (0,2). The output row 0 has elements 3,3,4,2. Wait, the first output row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. So the first block (0,0) is 2,4, then next block (0,1) is 3,3, then next block (0,2) is 4, 2. But that doesn't fit with the input cell's value of 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled with values that are determined by the input cell's value and its position in the block. For example, the top-left cell of the block is determined by some formula, and the others are derived from that.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Let's try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output. The first row of output is 0 3 3 4 4 3 3 0. The input for Example 2 is a 4x4 grid. The output is 8x8. So again, the output is generated by expanding each input cell into a 2x2 block. Let's see:\n\nThe first row of the output is 0 3 3 4 4 3 3 0. This could be the first two rows of the first two blocks in the first two columns.\n\nFor example, the first input cell is 0 (row 0, column 0). The first block (2x2) would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 3\nRow 1: 3 3\n\nBut the first two elements of the first output row are 0 and 3. Then the next block (input cell 0,1 which is 6) would be:\n\nRow 0: 3 4\nRow 1: 4 3\n\nBut the next elements in the first output row are 3, 3, 4, 4. Hmm, this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled with values that are determined by the input cell's value and its position. For example, the block is filled with the input cell's value in the middle, and other values around it. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each input cell is used to generate a 2x2 block, and the values in the block are based on the input cell's value and its neighbors.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe the pattern is that the output is generated by expanding the input into a larger grid, where each cell in the input is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output, and the values in the block are derived from the input cell and its neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid that is a combination of the input's values and their mirrored versions. For example, the output is a grid that is a combination of the input and its flipped version, expanded into a larger grid.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell in the output is determined by the input cell's value and its position. For example, the output is a grid where each cell (i,j) in the output is determined by the input cell (i//2, j//2), but with some transformation.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to think of the first example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is 3x3. The output is 6x6. So for each output cell (i,j), the corresponding input cell is (i//2, j//2). Let's see:\n\nFor output cell (0,0), input is (0,0) which is 3. But the output cell (0,0) is 2. So that doesn't fit. But maybe there's a transformation based on the input cell's value and its position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is replaced by a 2x2 block that is filled with values based on the input cell's value and its neighbors. For example, the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell and its adjacent cells.\n\nBut this is too vague. Another idea: perhaps the output is a grid where each input cell is used to generate a 2x2 block that is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value. For example, the block is filled with values that are based on the input cell's value and the position in the block.\n\nFor example, in the first example, the input cell (0,0) is 3. The block is:\n\nRow 0: 2 4\nRow 1: 3 3\n\nSo the top-left cell is 2, top-right is 4, bottom-left is 3, bottom-right is 3. Maybe this is derived from the input cell's value. For example, the top-left is input cell's value minus 1, top-right is input cell's value plus 1, and the bottom row is input cell's value. But that would make the block:\n\nFor input cell 3, the block is:\n\n2 4\n3 3\n\nWhich matches the first block. Then for input cell (0,1) which is 0, the block would be:\n\n0-1 = -1? But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the block is filled with values that are determined by the input cell's value and some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled with values that are based on the input cell's value and its position in the block. For example, the top-left is input cell's value minus 1, top-right is input cell's value plus 1, bottom-left is input cell's value, and bottom-right is input cell's value.\n\nBut for the input cell (0,0) which is 3, that would give 2,4,3,3 which matches the first block. For input cell (0,1) which is 0, the block would be -1, 1, 0, 0. But that's not possible since the output has 0s and 4s. So this seems incorrect.\n\nBut in the first example, the input cell (0,1) is 0. The block for this cell would be in the output starting at (0,2). The first row of the output is 2 4 3 3 4 2. So the block for (0,1) is 3,3. But according to the previous idea, it would be -1,1, which doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the previous idea is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output of Example 1. The first block (input cell 0,0) is 2 4 3 3. The second block (input cell 0,1) is 3 3 4 2. Wait, but the first output row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. So the first block is 2 4 (row 0), then next block is 3 3 (row 0, columns 2-3), then next block is 4 2 (columns 4-5). But how does that relate to the input cell values?\n\nThe input cell (0,0) is 3, (0,1) is 0, (0,2) is 0. So maybe the block for (0,0) is derived from the input cell's value and its neighbors. For example, the first block is derived from the input cell (0,0) and (0,1). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid that is a combination of the input and its mirrored versions. For example, the output is a grid that is created by taking the input and mirroring it horizontally and vertically, then expanding it into a larger grid.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Given that the test input is provided, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that can be generalized.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input cell's value and its position in the output grid. For example, the output is generated by some transformation that depends on the input cell's value and its position in the output.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is the sum of the input cell and its neighbors. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input cell's value and its position in the output. For example, if the output is 6x6, then each input cell is used to generate a 2x2 block, and the values in the block are determined by the input cell's value and its position in the block.\n\nBut how?\n\nLet's think of the first example's output. The first block (input cell 0,0) is 2 4 3 3. This could be derived from the input cell's value (3) and some transformation. For example, the top-left is 3-1=2, top-right is 3+1=4, bottom-left is 3, bottom-right is 3. This seems to fit.\n\nFor the next block (input cell 0,1) which is 0. The block would be 0-1=-1, 0+1=1, 0, 0. But that's not possible. However, in the output, the block for (0,1) is 3 3 4 2. Wait, but how does that fit with the input cell's value of 0?\n\nThis suggests that this pattern may not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and the input cell's neighboring cells. For example, the block is filled with the input cell's value and the values of adjacent cells.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time I have, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be implemented, even if it's not perfect.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output rows are symmetric. The first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2, which is symmetric. The second row is 0 4 3 3 4 0, also symmetric. The third row is 0 0 3 3 0 0, symmetric. So the output is symmetric along both axes.\n\nThis suggests that the output is a symmetric grid, which may be generated by some transformation of the input.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input cell's value and its position in the output grid. For example, the output is generated by some kind of transformation that takes the input and creates a symmetric grid.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid that is a combination of the input and its mirrored versions. For example, the output is created by taking the input and mirroring it horizontally and vertically, then expanding it into a larger grid.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that the output for Example 1 is symmetric, and the input is 3x3, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and expanding it into a larger grid, and the values are determined by some pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find the exact pattern.\n\nMaybe I should try to think of the output as a grid where each input cell is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output. For example, the input cell (i,j) is used to generate a 2x2 block in the output starting at (2i, 2j). The values in the block are determined by the input cell's value and some pattern.\n\nFor example, the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and its position in the block. For instance, the top-left cell is the input cell's value minus 1, the top-right is input cell's value plus 1, and the bottom row is input cell's value.\n\nBut this would work for the first block in Example 1. For input cell 3, the block is 2,4,3,3. For the input cell 0, the block would be -1,1,0,0, but that's not possible since the output has 0s and 4s.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the block for input cell (0,1) is 3,3,4,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and the input cell's position in the input grid. For example, the block is filled with values based on the input cell's value and its row and column.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is the same as the input cell's value, but expanded into a 2x2 block. But that would not match the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input cell (0,0) is 3. If the block is filled with 3s, then the first block would be 3 3 / 3 3, but the output is 2 4 3 3. So this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure of the exact pattern. But given that the output for Example 1 is symmetric and the input is 3x3, and the output is 6x6, I'll hypothesize that each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, and the values in the block are determined by some pattern based on the input cell's value and its position.\n\nFor example, the block for input cell (i,j) is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and its position in the block. For instance, the top-left cell is input value minus 1, top-right is input value plus 1, bottom-left is input value, and bottom-right is input value. This would work for the first block in Example 1.\n\nBut for input cell (0,1) which is 0, this would give -1, 1, 0, 0. But in the output, the block for (0,1) is 3,3,4,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is different. Maybe the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and its neighboring cells. For example, the block is filled with values that are based on the input cell and its adjacent cells in the input grid.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of the output as a grid where each cell is determined by the input cell's value and its position in the output grid. For example, the output is a 6x6 grid where each cell (i,j) is determined by the input cell (i//2, j//2), but with some transformation.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1.\n\nFor output cell (0,0), input cell is (0,0) which is 3. The output cell (0,0) is 2. So maybe the output cell is input cell's value minus 1.\n\nFor output cell (0,1), input cell is (0,0) which is 3. The output cell (0,1) is 4, which is input cell's value plus 1.\n\nFor output cell (1,0), input cell is (0,0) which is 3. Output cell is 3, which is input cell's value.\n\nFor output cell (1,1), input cell is (0,0) which is 3. Output cell is 3.\n\nSo this suggests that the block for input cell (i,j) is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and its position in the block. For example:\n\n- Top-left: input value - 1\n- Top-right: input value + 1\n- Bottom-left: input value\n- Bottom-right: input value\n\nBut this would work for the first block. Let's check for the first block in Example 1.\n\nInput cell (0,0) is 3. Block is:\n\n2 4\n3 3\n\nWhich matches the first block. Now, for the next block, input cell (0,1) is 0. According to this pattern, the block would be:\n\n- Top-left: 0-1 = -1\n- Top-right: 0+1 = 1\n- Bottom-left: 0\n- Bottom-right: 0\n\nBut in the output, the block for (0,1) is 3,3,4,2. So this doesn't fit. But wait, perhaps this pattern is only for certain cells?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the block is filled with values based on the input cell's value and its neighbors in the input grid. For example, the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and the values of adjacent cells.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, and the values in the block are derived from the input cell's value and its position in the block. For example, the top-left is input value minus 1, top-right is input value plus 1, and the bottom row is input value.\n\nThis would generate the first block in Example 1 correctly. For other blocks, it might not fit, but perhaps it's the best guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\n- For each cell (i,j) in the input grid, create a 2x2 block in the output grid starting at (2i, 2j).\n- The block is filled with the following values:\n  - (2i, 2j) \u2192 input_val - 1\n  - (2i, 2j + 1) \u2192 input_val + 1\n  - (2i + 1, 2j) \u2192 input_val\n  - (2i + 1, 2j + 1) \u2192 input_val\n\nBut this would generate the first block correctly for Example 1, but for other cells, it may not fit.\n\nLet's test this for Example 1's input cell (0,1) which is 0. The block would be:\n\n- (0,2) \u2192 0-1 = -1\n- (0,3) \u2192 0+1 = 1\n- (1,2) \u2192 0\n- (1,3) \u2192 0\n\nBut in the output, the first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. So the first row of the output has elements 2,4,3,3,4,2. The block for (0,1) is columns 2-3, which would be 3 and 3. But according to this hypothesis, it would be -1 and 1. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the block is filled with the input cell's value in the bottom row and the top row is derived from the input cell's value and its neighbors.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. This could be the result of taking the input row and expanding it into a pattern. For example, the input row is [3, 0, 0]. The first output row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. This could be a pattern where the first two elements are derived from the first input cell, then the next two from the second input cell, and so on.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid that is a combination of the input and its mirrored versions, and then expanding it into a larger grid.\n\nFor example, the input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 6x6 grid where each row is a combination of the input's rows and their mirrored versions.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is a grid where each row is a combination of the input's rows and their mirrored versions, and each column is similarly processed.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm running out of time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output is generated by expanding each input cell into a 2x2 block, and the values in the block are derived from the input cell's value and its position in the block. Even if this doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the input dimensions\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    # Create a 6x6 output grid\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(6)] for _ in range(6)]\n    # For each cell in the input grid\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            # Calculate the starting position in the output\n            start_row = 2 * i\n            start_col = 2 * j\n            # Fill the 2x2 block\n            output[start_row][start_col] = val - 1\n            output[start_row][start_col + 1] = val + 1\n            output[start_row + 1][start_col] = val\n            output[start_row + 1][start_col + 1] = val\n    return output\n\nBut this would generate for Example 1's input cell (0,0) the block 2 4 3 3, which matches the first block. For input cell (0,1) which is 0, it would generate -1, 1, 0, 0. But the output for the first row is 2 4 3 3 4 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps this is not the correct pattern. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not work for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled with values that are derived from the input cell's value and its position in the block, but with some other logic. For example, the top row is val-1 and val+1, and the bottom row is val and val.\n\nBut this is what I have already.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the block is filled with the input cell's value in the middle and some other values around it.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the third row of the output is 0 0 3 3 0 0. This suggests that the middle of the output is filled with 3s, which could be derived from the input cell (1,2) which is 2. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the code that expands each input cell into a 2x2 block, and fills it with the values as described, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n"
