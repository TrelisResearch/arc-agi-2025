    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nThe input is a 5x5 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. Wait, the input is 5 rows each with 5 elements? Wait, the input for example 1 is given as:\n\nInput:\n1 0 0 0 9\n0 5 0 8 0\n0 0 7 0 0\n0 8 0 5 0\n9 0 0 0 1\n\nSo that's 5 rows, each with 5 numbers. The output is a 3x3 grid. So the transformation is from 5x5 to 3x3. How does that happen?\n\nLooking at the output for example 1:\n1 5 9\n8 7 8\n9 5 1\n\nHmm. Let me think. Maybe each row in the output is derived from certain positions in the input. Let's see:\n\nFor the first row of the output: 1, 5, 9. Looking at the input, the first row is [1, 0, 0, 0, 9]. The first element is 1, then the second row's second element is 5, and the fifth element of the first row is 9. So maybe the first row of output is taking elements from positions (0,0), (1,1), (0,4)? Or maybe some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. Let's think about the output rows. For example, the first output row is 1,5,9. Looking at the input:\n\nRow 0: 1, 0, 0, 0, 9\nRow 1: 0,5,0,8,0\nRow 2: 0,0,7,0,0\nRow 3: 0,8,0,5,0\nRow 4: 9,0,0,0,1\n\nSo maybe the first output row is taking elements from positions (0,0), (1,1), (4,4)? Because 1 is at (0,0), 5 is at (1,1), and 9 is at (4,4). Then the first output row would be 1,5,9. That matches the first row of the output.\n\nThen the second output row is 8,7,8. Let's see. Where do these numbers come from?\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the second output row is taking elements from (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). Let's check:\n\nRow 1, column 3 is 8. Row 2, column 2 is 7. Row 3, column 1 is 8. So that gives 8,7,8. Which matches the second output row.\n\nThird output row is 9,5,1. Let's see: 9 is from row 4, column 0. 5 is from row 1, column 1 (but that's already used). Wait, maybe row 4, column 0 is 9. Then row 3, column 3 is 5? Wait, row 3, column 3 is 5. Then row 4, column 4 is 1. So 9,5,1. That would be (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). Hmm.\n\nSo the output rows are constructed by taking elements from specific positions in the input. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the positions.\n\nFor the first output row, positions (0,0), (1,1), (4,4). Second row: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). Third row: (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). Wait, but the third row is 9,5,1. 9 is at (4,0), 5 is at (3,3), and 1 is at (4,4). So the third row is (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). \n\nWait, but for the first row, the positions are (0,0), (1,1), (4,4). For the second row, (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). For the third row, (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). \n\nHmm, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the input in a diagonal or some symmetric pattern. Let me think about the positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the input's corners and some middle positions. Let me check the positions for each output row.\n\nAnother way to think: the output is 3x3. Let's think of the input as a 5x5 grid. The output rows might be taking elements from certain positions. For example, the first output row could be the first, second, and fifth elements of the first, second, and fifth rows? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the input's positions (i, j) where i and j are in certain positions. For example, for the first output row, maybe the positions are (0,0), (1,1), (4,4). For the second row, (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). For the third row, (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). \n\nWait, if I look at the positions for each output row:\n\nFirst row: (0,0), (1,1), (4,4)\nSecond row: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)\nThird row: (4,0), (3,3), (4,4)\n\nBut that seems a bit arbitrary. Let me check the second example to see if this pattern holds.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n6 0 0 0 7\n0 2 0 4 0\n0 0 3 0 0\n0 4 0 2 0\n7 0 0 0 6\n\nOutput:\n6 2 7\n4 3 4\n7 2 6\n\nLet's see the output rows.\n\nFirst output row: 6,2,7. Looking at the input:\n\nRow 0: 6, 0, 0, 0, 7. So 6 is (0,0), 2 is (1,1), 7 is (4,4). That matches the first example's pattern.\n\nSecond output row: 4,3,4. Let's see. For the second row of output, the positions would be (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). \n\nRow 1, column 3 is 4. Row 2, column 2 is 3. Row 3, column 1 is 4. So 4,3,4. Which matches the second row of the output.\n\nThird output row: 7,2,6. 7 is (4,0), 2 is (3,3), 6 is (4,4). Which is the same as the first example's third row. \n\nSo this seems to be a pattern. So the output is formed by taking three elements from the input in certain positions. For each output row, the three elements are taken from three positions in the input. Let me try to see what these positions are.\n\nFor the first output row, the positions are (0,0), (1,1), (4,4). For the second output row, (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). For the third output row, (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). \n\nSo the first output row is taking elements from the top-left corner (0,0), the center (1,1), and the bottom-right (4,4). The second row is taking elements from (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). The third row is (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). \n\nWait, but the third row's first element is (4,0), which is the bottom-left corner, then (3,3) is the center of the input's bottom part, and (4,4) is the bottom-right. \n\nSo the pattern for the output rows seems to be:\n\nRow 0: positions (0,0), (1,1), (4,4)\nRow 1: positions (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)\nRow 2: positions (4,0), (3,3), (4,4)\n\nBut how do these positions relate to each other? Let me think of the input as a 5x5 grid. The output is 3x3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain elements from the input's corners and middle positions. For example, the first output row is the top-left, center, and bottom-right. The second row is the top-right, center, and bottom-left? Or maybe not. \n\nBut in the first example, the second output row is (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). Let me think of (1,3) as the top-middle-right? Because row 1, column 3. The input is 5 columns, so columns 0-4. So column 3 is the fourth column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking elements from positions that are symmetric in some way. For example, for the first output row, the positions are (0,0), (1,1), (4,4). These are positions that are along the main diagonal. But (4,4) is the bottom-right. \n\nBut for the second row, (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). These are positions that are symmetric around the center. Let me think: the center of the input is at (2,2). So (1,3) is one step up and one step right from the center. (3,1) is one step down and one step left. (2,2) is the center. So this row is taking elements from positions that are symmetric with respect to the center. \n\nSimilarly, the third row is (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). (4,0) is bottom-left, (3,3) is one step up and one step right from the center, and (4,4) is bottom-right. \n\nSo perhaps the output is constructed by taking elements from three positions in the input, which are arranged in a certain way. \n\nSo for each output row, the three elements are taken from positions that are symmetric in some way. \n\nBut how to generalize this into a transformation function? \n\nLet me think about the positions for each output row. \n\nFirst output row: (0,0), (1,1), (4,4) \u2192 these are positions (row, column) where row and column are 0, 1, 4. \n\nSecond output row: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1) \u2192 row indices 1, 2, 3; column indices 3, 2, 1. \n\nThird output row: (4,0), (3,3), (4,4) \u2192 row indices 4, 3, 4; column indices 0, 3, 4. \n\nSo the first row is taking elements from the top-left, center, and bottom-right. \n\nThe second row is taking elements from the top-middle-right, center, and bottom-middle-left. \n\nThird row is taking elements from bottom-left, center, and bottom-right. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nThe output is a 3x3 grid. Each row in the output is built from three elements in the input. \n\nSo for the first output row, the elements are:\n\noutput[0][0] = input[0][0]\n\noutput[0][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[0][2] = input[4][4]\n\nFor the second output row:\n\noutput[1][0] = input[1][3]\n\noutput[1][1] = input[2][2]\n\noutput[1][2] = input[3][1]\n\nFor the third output row:\n\noutput[2][0] = input[4][0]\n\noutput[2][1] = input[3][3]\n\noutput[2][2] = input[4][4]\n\nSo the output is constructed by taking these positions. \n\nBut wait, in the first example, the third output row is 9,5,1. Which is input[4][0] (9), input[3][3] (5), input[4][4] (1). That's correct. \n\nIn example 2, the third output row is 7,2,6. Which is input[4][0] (7), input[3][3] (2), input[4][4] (6). Which matches. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output is built from these three positions per row. \n\nSo the code would need to take the input grid (5x5) and for each of the three output rows, take the three elements from the input as per the positions above. \n\nSo, the function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # grid is a 5x5 list of lists\n    # create a 3x3 output grid\n    output = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    # first row of output\n    output[0][0] = grid[0][0]\n    output[0][1] = grid[1][1]\n    output[0][2] = grid[4][4]\n    # second row of output\n    output[1][0] = grid[1][3]\n    output[1][1] = grid[2][2]\n    output[1][2] = grid[3][1]\n    # third row of output\n    output[2][0] = grid[4][0]\n    output[2][1] = grid[3][3]\n    output[2][2] = grid[4][4]\n    return output\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output is:\n\n1 5 9\n\n8 7 8\n\n9 5 1\n\nWhich matches the code. For the first row, grid[0][0] is 1, grid[1][1] is 5, grid[4][4] is 1. Wait, no. Wait in example 1, the input is:\n\nRow 4 is [9, 0, 0, 0, 1]. So grid[4][4] is 1. So output[0][2] is 1. But the first row of output is 1 5 9. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait no, in example 1, the first row of the output is 1 5 9. But according to the code, output[0][2] is grid[4][4] which is 1. But that would make the first row 1,5,1. But the actual output is 1,5,9. Oh, this is a problem. \n\nWait, this suggests that my previous assumption is wrong. Let me re-examine example 1. \n\nIn example 1, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 0 0 9 \u2192 so grid[0][4] is 9.\n\nSo for the first output row, according to the previous code, output[0][2] is grid[4][4] which is 1. But in the actual output, the first row is 1,5,9. So that would imply that the third element of the first row is grid[0][4], not grid[4][4]. \n\nAh, so my previous analysis was incorrect. So I need to re-examine the positions. \n\nLet me re-examine example 1's first row of output. \n\nFirst output row: 1,5,9. \n\nLooking at the input, where are these numbers?\n\n1 is at (0,0). \n\n5 is at (1,1). \n\n9 is at (0,4). \n\nSo the first output row is taking elements from (0,0), (1,1), (0,4). \n\nBut how does that fit into a pattern? \n\nSecond output row is 8,7,8. \n\nLooking at the input:\n\n8 is at (1,3). \n\n7 is at (2,2). \n\n8 is at (3,1). \n\nSo the second row is (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). \n\nThird output row is 9,5,1. \n\nLooking at the input:\n\n9 is at (4,0). \n\n5 is at (3,3). \n\n1 is at (4,4). \n\nSo third row is (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). \n\nSo the first row is (0,0), (1,1), (0,4). \n\nHmm. So the first row's third element is (0,4). \n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for the first output row, the elements are (0,0), (1,1), (0,4). \n\nBut how to find a general rule here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first row is taking elements from the first row's first, center, and last columns. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking elements from certain positions in the input's rows and columns. \n\nFor example, first output row is (0,0), (1,1), (0,4). \n\nSecond output row is (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). \n\nThird output row is (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). \n\nSo for the first row, the elements are from row 0, row 1, row 0. \n\nBut this seems arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking elements from the input in a way that forms a kind of cross or diagonal. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the elements from the input's positions that are in certain positions relative to the center of the input grid. \n\nBut how to find this. \n\nLet me think of the input as a 5x5 grid. The center is at (2,2). \n\nFor the first output row, the elements are (0,0) (top-left), (1,1) (top-middle), (0,4) (top-right). \n\nSo that's the first row of the input, taking the first, middle, and last elements. \n\nSecond output row is taking elements from (1,3) (top-middle-right), (2,2) (center), (3,1) (bottom-middle-left). \n\nThird output row is (4,0) (bottom-left), (3,3) (middle-right), (4,4) (bottom-right). \n\nSo the first row of the output is taking elements from the first row of the input, at positions 0, 1, 4. \n\nSecond row is taking elements from rows 1, 2, 3, columns 3, 2, 1. \n\nThird row is taking elements from row 4, columns 0, 3, 4. \n\nSo for the first output row, the three elements are from row 0, columns 0, 1, 4. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from the input in the following way:\n\nFor the first output row, the elements are from the first row of the input, columns 0, 1, 4. \n\nFor the second output row, elements are from rows 1, 2, 3, columns 3, 2, 1. \n\nFor the third output row, elements are from row 4, columns 0, 3, 4. \n\nBut this seems arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first output row is taking the first row's first, middle, and last elements. The second row is taking the middle row's elements in a certain way. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the input in a way that forms a kind of 'staircase' pattern. \n\nBut I need to find a pattern that works for all examples. \n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0 0 7 \u2192 columns 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nRow 1: 0 2 0 4 0 \u2192 columns 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 3 0 0 \u2192 columns 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nRow 3: 0 4 0 2 0 \u2192 columns 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nRow 4: 7 0 0 0 6 \u2192 columns 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nOutput:\n\n6 2 7\n\n4 3 4\n\n7 2 6\n\nSo for the first output row, the elements are 6 (row 0, col 0), 2 (row 1, col 1), 7 (row 4, col 4). \n\nWhich matches the first example's first row. \n\nSecond output row: 4 (row 1, col 3), 3 (row 2, col 2), 4 (row 3, col 1). \n\nThird output row: 7 (row 4, col 0), 2 (row 3, col 3), 6 (row 4, col 4). \n\nSo the third row is row 4, col 0, row 3, col 3, row 4, col 4. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the first output row is taking elements from row 0, col 0; row 1, col 1; row 4, col 4. \n\nWait, but in example 2, the first output row is 6,2,7. Which is row 0, col 0 (6), row 1, col 1 (2), row 4, col 4 (6). \n\nBut in the first example, the first output row is 1,5,9. Which is row 0, col 0 (1), row 1, col 1 (5), row 4, col 4 (1). But in the first example, the third element is 9, which is row 0, col 4. \n\nSo this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nWait, in example 1's first output row, the third element is 9, which is row 0, col 4. But in example 2's first output row, the third element is row 4, col 4. \n\nSo this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. \n\nSo perhaps the pattern is different for each row. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is taking the first row's first, middle, and last elements. \n\nFor example, first row of input is [1,0,0,0,9]. So first, middle (index 2?), but wait, the middle of 5 elements is index 2. But in the first example, the first output row is 1 (index 0), 5 (index 1), 9 (index 4). \n\nSo that's first, second, and fifth elements. \n\nWait, but the first row of the input has five elements. So indices 0-4. \n\nSo for the first output row, the elements are 0, 1, 4. \n\nFor the second output row, the elements are 1, 2, 3. But in example 1, the second output row is 8,7,8. Which are from row 1, col 3 (index 3), row 2, col 2 (index 2), row 3, col 1 (index 1). \n\nSo for the second row, the columns are 3, 2, 1. \n\nFor the third output row, the elements are row 4, col 0 (index 0), row 3, col 3 (index 3), row 4, col 4 (index 4). \n\nSo for the third row, the columns are 0, 3, 4. \n\nSo the pattern for each row of the output is:\n\nFirst row: columns 0, 1, 4 of row 0.\n\nSecond row: columns 3, 2, 1 of rows 1, 2, 3.\n\nThird row: columns 0, 3, 4 of rows 4, 3, 4.\n\nWait, but how to generalize this. \n\nSo the first output row is taking elements from row 0, columns 0, 1, 4. \n\nSecond output row is taking elements from rows 1, 2, 3, columns 3, 2, 1. \n\nThird output row is taking elements from rows 4, 3, 4, columns 0, 3, 4. \n\nSo for each output row, the elements are taken from certain rows and columns. \n\nSo the first output row is:\n\noutput[0][0] = grid[0][0]\n\noutput[0][1] = grid[1][1]\n\noutput[0][2] = grid[0][4]\n\nSecond output row:\n\noutput[1][0] = grid[1][3]\n\noutput[1][1] = grid[2][2]\n\noutput[1][2] = grid[3][1]\n\nThird output row:\n\noutput[2][0] = grid[4][0]\n\noutput[2][1] = grid[3][3]\n\noutput[2][2] = grid[4][4]\n\nThis seems to be the pattern. \n\nSo for example 1:\n\nFirst output row: grid[0][0] = 1, grid[1][1] = 5, grid[0][4] = 9 \u2192 1,5,9. \n\nSecond output row: grid[1][3] = 8, grid[2][2] =7, grid[3][1] =8 \u2192 8,7,8. \n\nThird output row: grid[4][0] =9, grid[3][3] =5, grid[4][4] =1 \u2192 9,5,1. \n\nWhich matches the example. \n\nIn example 2, first output row is grid[0][0] =6, grid[1][1] =2, grid[0][4] =7 \u2192 6,2,7. Which matches the output. \n\nSecond output row: grid[1][3] =4, grid[2][2] =3, grid[3][1] =4 \u2192 4,3,4. Which matches the output. \n\nThird output row: grid[4][0] =7, grid[3][3] =2, grid[4][4] =6 \u2192 7,2,6. Which matches the output. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    # first row\n    output[0][0] = grid[0][0]\n    output[0][1] = grid[1][1]\n    output[0][2] = grid[0][4]\n    # second row\n    output[1][0] = grid[1][3]\n    output[1][1] = grid[2][2]\n    output[1][2] = grid[3][1]\n    # third row\n    output[2][0] = grid[4][0]\n    output[2][1] = grid[3][3]\n    output[2][2] = grid[4][4]\n    return output\n\nBut wait, what about the third row in example 1? The third row of the output is 9,5,1. Which is grid[4][0] (9), grid[3][3] (5), grid[4][4] (1). \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. \n\nNow, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n7 0 0 0 5\n0 6 0 4 0\n0 0 2 0 0\n0 4 0 6 0\n5 0 0 0 7\n\nSo the input is a 5x5 grid. \n\nApplying the code:\n\nFirst row of output:\n\ngrid[0][0] =7, grid[1][1]=6, grid[0][4]=5 \u2192 7,6,5. \n\nSecond row:\n\ngrid[1][3] =4, grid[2][2]=2, grid[3][1]=4 \u2192 4,2,4. \n\nThird row:\n\ngrid[4][0]=5, grid[3][3]=6, grid[4][4]=7 \u2192 5,6,7. \n\nSo the output would be:\n\n7 6 5\n\n4 2 4\n\n5 6 7\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. However, based on the training examples, this seems to be the correct pattern. \n\nSo the code should be written as above. \n\nNow, I need to make sure that the code is correct. \n\nThe function takes a 5x5 grid and returns a 3x3 grid. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    output[0][0] = grid[0][0]\n    output[0][1] = grid[1][1]\n    output[0][2] = grid[0][4]\n    output[1][0] = grid[1][3]\n    output[1][1] = grid[2][2]\n    output[1][2] = grid[3][1]\n    output[2][0] = grid[4][0]\n    output[2][1] = grid[3][3]\n    output[2][2] = grid[4][4]\n    return output\n\nYes. \n\nBut wait, what if the input is not 5x5? But according to the problem statement, the input is a 5x5 grid. The training examples are 5x5, and the test input is also 5x5. So the code is correct. \n\nSo this should be the solution.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nThe input is a 5x5 grid, and the output is a 3x3 grid. Wait, the input is 5 rows each with 5 elements? Wait, the input for example 1 is given as:\n\nInput:\n1 0 0 0 9\n0 5 0 8 0\n0 0 7 0 0\n0 8 0 5 0\n9 0 0 0 1\n\nSo that's 5 rows, each with 5 numbers. The output is a 3x3 grid. So the transformation is from 5x5 to 3x3. How does that happen?\n\nLooking at the output for example 1:\n1 5 9\n8 7 8\n9 5 1\n\nHmm. Let me think. Maybe each row in the output is derived from certain positions in the input. Let's see:\n\nFor the first row of the output: 1, 5, 9. Looking at the input, the first row is [1, 0, 0, 0, 9]. The first element is 1, then the second row's second element is 5, and the fifth element of the first row is 9. So maybe the first row of output is taking elements from positions (0,0), (1,1), (0,4)? Or maybe some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. Let's think about the output rows. For example, the first output row is 1,5,9. Looking at the input:\n\nRow 0: 1, 0, 0, 0, 9\nRow 1: 0,5,0,8,0\nRow 2: 0,0,7,0,0\nRow 3: 0,8,0,5,0\nRow 4: 9,0,0,0,1\n\nSo maybe the first output row is taking elements from positions (0,0), (1,1), (4,4)? Because 1 is at (0,0), 5 is at (1,1), and 9 is at (4,4). Then the first output row would be 1,5,9. That matches the first row of the output.\n\nThen the second output row is 8,7,8. Let's see. Where do these numbers come from?\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the second output row is taking elements from (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). Let's check:\n\nRow 1, column 3 is 8. Row 2, column 2 is 7. Row 3, column 1 is 8. So that gives 8,7,8. Which matches the second output row.\n\nThird output row is 9,5,1. Let's see: 9 is from row 4, column 0. 5 is from row 1, column 1 (but that's already used). Wait, maybe row 4, column 0 is 9. Then row 3, column 3 is 5? Wait, row 3, column 3 is 5. Then row 4, column 4 is 1. So 9,5,1. That would be (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). Hmm.\n\nSo the output rows are constructed by taking elements from specific positions in the input. Let me try to see if there's a pattern in the positions.\n\nFor the first output row, positions (0,0), (1,1), (4,4). Second row: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). Third row: (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). Wait, but the third row is 9,5,1. 9 is at (4,0), 5 is at (3,3), and 1 is at (4,4). So the third row is (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). \n\nWait, but for the first row, the positions are (0,0), (1,1), (4,4). For the second row, (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). For the third row, (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). \n\nHmm, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the input in a diagonal or some symmetric pattern. Let me think about the positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the input's corners and some middle positions. Let me check the positions for each output row.\n\nAnother way to think: the output is 3x3. Let's think of the input as a 5x5 grid. The output rows might be taking elements from certain positions. For example, the first output row could be the first, second, and fifth elements of the first, second, and fifth rows? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the input's positions (i, j) where i and j are in certain positions. For example, for the first output row, maybe the positions are (0,0), (1,1), (4,4). For the second row, (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). For the third row, (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). \n\nWait, if I look at the positions for each output row:\n\nFirst row: (0,0), (1,1), (4,4)\nSecond row: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)\nThird row: (4,0), (3,3), (4,4)\n\nBut that seems a bit arbitrary. Let me check the second example to see if this pattern holds.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n6 0 0 0 7\n0 2 0 4 0\n0 0 3 0 0\n0 4 0 2 0\n7 0 0 0 6\n\nOutput:\n6 2 7\n4 3 4\n7 2 6\n\nLet's see the output rows.\n\nFirst output row: 6,2,7. Looking at the input:\n\nRow 0: 6, 0, 0, 0, 7. So 6 is (0,0), 2 is (1,1), 7 is (4,4). That matches the first example's pattern.\n\nSecond output row: 4,3,4. Let's see. For the second row of output, the positions would be (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). \n\nRow 1, column 3 is 4. Row 2, column 2 is 3. Row 3, column 1 is 4. So 4,3,4. Which matches the second row of the output.\n\nThird output row: 7,2,6. 7 is (4,0), 2 is (3,3), 6 is (4,4). Which is the same as the first example's third row. \n\nSo this seems to be a pattern. So the output is formed by taking three elements from the input in certain positions. For each output row, the three elements are taken from three positions in the input. Let me try to see what these positions are.\n\nFor the first output row, the positions are (0,0), (1,1), (4,4). For the second output row, (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). For the third output row, (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). \n\nSo the first output row is taking elements from the top-left corner (0,0), the center (1,1), and the bottom-right (4,4). The second row is taking elements from (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). The third row is (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). \n\nWait, but the third row's first element is (4,0), which is the bottom-left corner, then (3,3) is the center of the input's bottom part, and (4,4) is the bottom-right. \n\nSo the pattern for the output rows seems to be:\n\nRow 0: positions (0,0), (1,1), (4,4)\nRow 1: positions (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)\nRow 2: positions (4,0), (3,3), (4,4)\n\nBut how do these positions relate to each other? Let me think of the input as a 5x5 grid. The output is 3x3. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain elements from the input's corners and middle positions. For example, the first output row is the top-left, center, and bottom-right. The second row is the top-right, center, and bottom-left? Or maybe not. \n\nBut in the first example, the second output row is (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). Let me think of (1,3) as the top-middle-right? Because row 1, column 3. The input is 5 columns, so columns 0-4. So column 3 is the fourth column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking elements from positions that are symmetric in some way. For example, for the first output row, the positions are (0,0), (1,1), (4,4). These are positions that are along the main diagonal. But (4,4) is the bottom-right. \n\nBut for the second row, (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). These are positions that are symmetric around the center. Let me think: the center of the input is at (2,2). So (1,3) is one step up and one step right from the center. (3,1) is one step down and one step left. (2,2) is the center. So this row is taking elements from positions that are symmetric with respect to the center. \n\nSimilarly, the third row is (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). (4,0) is bottom-left, (3,3) is one step up and one step right from the center, and (4,4) is bottom-right. \n\nSo perhaps the output is constructed by taking elements from three positions in the input, which are arranged in a certain way. \n\nSo for each output row, the three elements are taken from positions that are symmetric in some way. \n\nBut how to generalize this into a transformation function? \n\nLet me think about the positions for each output row. \n\nFirst output row: (0,0), (1,1), (4,4) \u2192 these are positions (row, column) where row and column are 0, 1, 4. \n\nSecond output row: (1,3), (2,2), (3,1) \u2192 row indices 1, 2, 3; column indices 3, 2, 1. \n\nThird output row: (4,0), (3,3), (4,4) \u2192 row indices 4, 3, 4; column indices 0, 3, 4. \n\nSo the first row is taking elements from the top-left, center, and bottom-right. \n\nThe second row is taking elements from the top-middle-right, center, and bottom-middle-left. \n\nThird row is taking elements from bottom-left, center, and bottom-right. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nThe output is a 3x3 grid. Each row in the output is built from three elements in the input. \n\nSo for the first output row, the elements are:\n\noutput[0][0] = input[0][0]\n\noutput[0][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[0][2] = input[4][4]\n\nFor the second output row:\n\noutput[1][0] = input[1][3]\n\noutput[1][1] = input[2][2]\n\noutput[1][2] = input[3][1]\n\nFor the third output row:\n\noutput[2][0] = input[4][0]\n\noutput[2][1] = input[3][3]\n\noutput[2][2] = input[4][4]\n\nSo the output is constructed by taking these positions. \n\nBut wait, in the first example, the third output row is 9,5,1. Which is input[4][0] (9), input[3][3] (5), input[4][4] (1). That's correct. \n\nIn example 2, the third output row is 7,2,6. Which is input[4][0] (7), input[3][3] (2), input[4][4] (6). Which matches. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the output is built from these three positions per row. \n\nSo the code would need to take the input grid (5x5) and for each of the three output rows, take the three elements from the input as per the positions above. \n\nSo, the function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # grid is a 5x5 list of lists\n    # create a 3x3 output grid\n    output = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    # first row of output\n    output[0][0] = grid[0][0]\n    output[0][1] = grid[1][1]\n    output[0][2] = grid[4][4]\n    # second row of output\n    output[1][0] = grid[1][3]\n    output[1][1] = grid[2][2]\n    output[1][2] = grid[3][1]\n    # third row of output\n    output[2][0] = grid[4][0]\n    output[2][1] = grid[3][3]\n    output[2][2] = grid[4][4]\n    return output\n\nWait, but in the first example, the output is:\n\n1 5 9\n\n8 7 8\n\n9 5 1\n\nWhich matches the code. For the first row, grid[0][0] is 1, grid[1][1] is 5, grid[4][4] is 1. Wait, no. Wait in example 1, the input is:\n\nRow 4 is [9, 0, 0, 0, 1]. So grid[4][4] is 1. So output[0][2] is 1. But the first row of output is 1 5 9. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait no, in example 1, the first row of the output is 1 5 9. But according to the code, output[0][2] is grid[4][4] which is 1. But that would make the first row 1,5,1. But the actual output is 1,5,9. Oh, this is a problem. \n\nWait, this suggests that my previous assumption is wrong. Let me re-examine example 1. \n\nIn example 1, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 0 0 9 \u2192 so grid[0][4] is 9.\n\nSo for the first output row, according to the previous code, output[0][2] is grid[4][4] which is 1. But in the actual output, the first row is 1,5,9. So that would imply that the third element of the first row is grid[0][4], not grid[4][4]. \n\nAh, so my previous analysis was incorrect. So I need to re-examine the positions. \n\nLet me re-examine example 1's first row of output. \n\nFirst output row: 1,5,9. \n\nLooking at the input, where are these numbers?\n\n1 is at (0,0). \n\n5 is at (1,1). \n\n9 is at (0,4). \n\nSo the first output row is taking elements from (0,0), (1,1), (0,4). \n\nBut how does that fit into a pattern? \n\nSecond output row is 8,7,8. \n\nLooking at the input:\n\n8 is at (1,3). \n\n7 is at (2,2). \n\n8 is at (3,1). \n\nSo the second row is (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). \n\nThird output row is 9,5,1. \n\nLooking at the input:\n\n9 is at (4,0). \n\n5 is at (3,3). \n\n1 is at (4,4). \n\nSo third row is (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). \n\nSo the first row is (0,0), (1,1), (0,4). \n\nHmm. So the first row's third element is (0,4). \n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for the first output row, the elements are (0,0), (1,1), (0,4). \n\nBut how to find a general rule here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first row is taking elements from the first row's first, center, and last columns. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output rows are formed by taking elements from certain positions in the input's rows and columns. \n\nFor example, first output row is (0,0), (1,1), (0,4). \n\nSecond output row is (1,3), (2,2), (3,1). \n\nThird output row is (4,0), (3,3), (4,4). \n\nSo for the first row, the elements are from row 0, row 1, row 0. \n\nBut this seems arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking elements from the input in a way that forms a kind of cross or diagonal. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the elements from the input's positions that are in certain positions relative to the center of the input grid. \n\nBut how to find this. \n\nLet me think of the input as a 5x5 grid. The center is at (2,2). \n\nFor the first output row, the elements are (0,0) (top-left), (1,1) (top-middle), (0,4) (top-right). \n\nSo that's the first row of the input, taking the first, middle, and last elements. \n\nSecond output row is taking elements from (1,3) (top-middle-right), (2,2) (center), (3,1) (bottom-middle-left). \n\nThird output row is (4,0) (bottom-left), (3,3) (middle-right), (4,4) (bottom-right). \n\nSo the first row of the output is taking elements from the first row of the input, at positions 0, 1, 4. \n\nSecond row is taking elements from rows 1, 2, 3, columns 3, 2, 1. \n\nThird row is taking elements from row 4, columns 0, 3, 4. \n\nSo for the first output row, the three elements are from row 0, columns 0, 1, 4. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking elements from the input in the following way:\n\nFor the first output row, the elements are from the first row of the input, columns 0, 1, 4. \n\nFor the second output row, elements are from rows 1, 2, 3, columns 3, 2, 1. \n\nFor the third output row, elements are from row 4, columns 0, 3, 4. \n\nBut this seems arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first output row is taking the first row's first, middle, and last elements. The second row is taking the middle row's elements in a certain way. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from the input in a way that forms a kind of 'staircase' pattern. \n\nBut I need to find a pattern that works for all examples. \n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0 0 7 \u2192 columns 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nRow 1: 0 2 0 4 0 \u2192 columns 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 3 0 0 \u2192 columns 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nRow 3: 0 4 0 2 0 \u2192 columns 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nRow 4: 7 0 0 0 6 \u2192 columns 0,1,2,3,4.\n\nOutput:\n\n6 2 7\n\n4 3 4\n\n7 2 6\n\nSo for the first output row, the elements are 6 (row 0, col 0), 2 (row 1, col 1), 7 (row 4, col 4). \n\nWhich matches the first example's first row. \n\nSecond output row: 4 (row 1, col 3), 3 (row 2, col 2), 4 (row 3, col 1). \n\nThird output row: 7 (row 4, col 0), 2 (row 3, col 3), 6 (row 4, col 4). \n\nSo the third row is row 4, col 0, row 3, col 3, row 4, col 4. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the first output row is taking elements from row 0, col 0; row 1, col 1; row 4, col 4. \n\nWait, but in example 2, the first output row is 6,2,7. Which is row 0, col 0 (6), row 1, col 1 (2), row 4, col 4 (6). \n\nBut in the first example, the first output row is 1,5,9. Which is row 0, col 0 (1), row 1, col 1 (5), row 4, col 4 (1). But in the first example, the third element is 9, which is row 0, col 4. \n\nSo this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. \n\nThis is confusing. \n\nWait, in example 1's first output row, the third element is 9, which is row 0, col 4. But in example 2's first output row, the third element is row 4, col 4. \n\nSo this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. \n\nSo perhaps the pattern is different for each row. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is taking the first row's first, middle, and last elements. \n\nFor example, first row of input is [1,0,0,0,9]. So first, middle (index 2?), but wait, the middle of 5 elements is index 2. But in the first example, the first output row is 1 (index 0), 5 (index 1), 9 (index 4). \n\nSo that's first, second, and fifth elements. \n\nWait, but the first row of the input has five elements. So indices 0-4. \n\nSo for the first output row, the elements are 0, 1, 4. \n\nFor the second output row, the elements are 1, 2, 3. But in example 1, the second output row is 8,7,8. Which are from row 1, col 3 (index 3), row 2, col 2 (index 2), row 3, col 1 (index 1). \n\nSo for the second row, the columns are 3, 2, 1. \n\nFor the third output row, the elements are row 4, col 0 (index 0), row 3, col 3 (index 3), row 4, col 4 (index 4). \n\nSo for the third row, the columns are 0, 3, 4. \n\nSo the pattern for each row of the output is:\n\nFirst row: columns 0, 1, 4 of row 0.\n\nSecond row: columns 3, 2, 1 of rows 1, 2, 3.\n\nThird row: columns 0, 3, 4 of rows 4, 3, 4.\n\nWait, but how to generalize this. \n\nSo the first output row is taking elements from row 0, columns 0, 1, 4. \n\nSecond output row is taking elements from rows 1, 2, 3, columns 3, 2, 1. \n\nThird output row is taking elements from rows 4, 3, 4, columns 0, 3, 4. \n\nSo for each output row, the elements are taken from certain rows and columns. \n\nSo the first output row is:\n\noutput[0][0] = grid[0][0]\n\noutput[0][1] = grid[1][1]\n\noutput[0][2] = grid[0][4]\n\nSecond output row:\n\noutput[1][0] = grid[1][3]\n\noutput[1][1] = grid[2][2]\n\noutput[1][2] = grid[3][1]\n\nThird output row:\n\noutput[2][0] = grid[4][0]\n\noutput[2][1] = grid[3][3]\n\noutput[2][2] = grid[4][4]\n\nThis seems to be the pattern. \n\nSo for example 1:\n\nFirst output row: grid[0][0] = 1, grid[1][1] = 5, grid[0][4] = 9 \u2192 1,5,9. \n\nSecond output row: grid[1][3] = 8, grid[2][2] =7, grid[3][1] =8 \u2192 8,7,8. \n\nThird output row: grid[4][0] =9, grid[3][3] =5, grid[4][4] =1 \u2192 9,5,1. \n\nWhich matches the example. \n\nIn example 2, first output row is grid[0][0] =6, grid[1][1] =2, grid[0][4] =7 \u2192 6,2,7. Which matches the output. \n\nSecond output row: grid[1][3] =4, grid[2][2] =3, grid[3][1] =4 \u2192 4,3,4. Which matches the output. \n\nThird output row: grid[4][0] =7, grid[3][3] =2, grid[4][4] =6 \u2192 7,2,6. Which matches the output. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    # first row\n    output[0][0] = grid[0][0]\n    output[0][1] = grid[1][1]\n    output[0][2] = grid[0][4]\n    # second row\n    output[1][0] = grid[1][3]\n    output[1][1] = grid[2][2]\n    output[1][2] = grid[3][1]\n    # third row\n    output[2][0] = grid[4][0]\n    output[2][1] = grid[3][3]\n    output[2][2] = grid[4][4]\n    return output\n\nBut wait, what about the third row in example 1? The third row of the output is 9,5,1. Which is grid[4][0] (9), grid[3][3] (5), grid[4][4] (1). \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. \n\nNow, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n7 0 0 0 5\n0 6 0 4 0\n0 0 2 0 0\n0 4 0 6 0\n5 0 0 0 7\n\nSo the input is a 5x5 grid. \n\nApplying the code:\n\nFirst row of output:\n\ngrid[0][0] =7, grid[1][1]=6, grid[0][4]=5 \u2192 7,6,5. \n\nSecond row:\n\ngrid[1][3] =4, grid[2][2]=2, grid[3][1]=4 \u2192 4,2,4. \n\nThird row:\n\ngrid[4][0]=5, grid[3][3]=6, grid[4][4]=7 \u2192 5,6,7. \n\nSo the output would be:\n\n7 6 5\n\n4 2 4\n\n5 6 7\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct. However, based on the training examples, this seems to be the correct pattern. \n\nSo the code should be written as above. \n\nNow, I need to make sure that the code is correct. \n\nThe function takes a 5x5 grid and returns a 3x3 grid. \n\nSo the code should be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    output[0][0] = grid[0][0]\n    output[0][1] = grid[1][1]\n    output[0][2] = grid[0][4]\n    output[1][0] = grid[1][3]\n    output[1][1] = grid[2][2]\n    output[1][2] = grid[3][1]\n    output[2][0] = grid[4][0]\n    output[2][1] = grid[3][3]\n    output[2][2] = grid[4][4]\n    return output\n\nYes. \n\nBut wait, what if the input is not 5x5? But according to the problem statement, the input is a 5x5 grid. The training examples are 5x5, and the test input is also 5x5. So the code is correct. \n\nSo this should be the solution.\n"
