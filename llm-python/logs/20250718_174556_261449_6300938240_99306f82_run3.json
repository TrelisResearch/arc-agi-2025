The number 3 in Example 1 seems to be spreading out from its position, replacing 1s with 3s in a certain pattern.\n2. In Example 2, the number 6 is spreading out from its position, replacing 1s with 6s in a certain pattern.\n3. In Example 3, the number 8 is spreading out from its position, replacing 1s with 8s in a certain pattern.\n4. There's a pattern where numbers spread out from their original positions, replacing surrounding numbers in a specific way.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading out numbers from their original positions, replacing surrounding numbers in a specific pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation of this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value out from this cell\n                # Replace surrounding cells with the same value\n                # This is a simple spread pattern that works for the examples\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < 10 and 0 <= y < 10 and (x != i or y != j):\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                for x in range(i-1, i+2):\n                    for y in range(j-1, j+2):\n                        if 0 <= x < 10 and 0 <= y < 10 and (x != i or y != j):\n                            transformed_grid[x][y] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
