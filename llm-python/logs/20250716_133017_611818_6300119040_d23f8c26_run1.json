    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, the task is to transform an input grid into an output grid based on some rules. Let me look at the examples carefully.\n\nFirst, Example 1:\nInput is a 3x3 grid:\n6 4 0\n0 3 9\n1 0 0\nOutput is:\n0 4 0\n0 3 0\n0 0 0\n\nHmm. Looking at the input and output. The output seems to have some zeros in certain positions. Let me compare each cell. For instance, the first row of input is 6,4,0. The output first row is 0,4,0. So the 4 stays, but the 6 and 0 are replaced with 0 and 0. Wait, maybe the 0s in the input are being replaced with 0s in the output? But the original input's third column is 0,9,0. The output third column is 0,0,0. So maybe the output is replacing non-zero values with zero? But that doesn't fit. Let me check other cells.\n\nIn the input, the middle cell is 3, and in the output, it's still 3. So maybe not. Wait, maybe the output is taking the original grid and replacing certain positions. Let me think of other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\nInput is a 5x5 grid. The output is also 5x5. The input has some 0s and numbers. The output seems to have some cells set to 0. For example, the first row input is 8 0 3 0 0. The output first row is 0 0 3 0 0. So the 3 remains, but the 8 and 0s are replaced with 0s. But why?\n\nAnother example: in the input, the third row is 3 6 3 0 0. Output is 0 0 3 0 0. So the first two elements are 0s, but the third is 3. Maybe the pattern is that certain positions are set to zero based on some rule. Maybe the positions that are in the same row or column as a certain value?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some symmetry or transformation. For example, maybe the output grid is the input grid with some cells set to zero based on their position. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3:\nInput is a 5x5 grid again. The output is similar. For example, the first row input is 3 0 4 0 0. Output is 0 0 4 0 0. So the 4 remains, but the 3 and 0s are replaced with 0s. Again, maybe the non-zero values are kept, but others are set to zero? But that doesn't fit with the first example. Wait, in example 1, the output has 0 4 0. The input's first row is 6 4 0. So 4 is kept, but 6 and 0 are replaced with 0. But in the input's third row, the first element is 1, which becomes 0 in the output. So maybe the rule is that if the original cell is not zero, then it's kept, but if it's zero, it's replaced with zero? That doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the output is a grid where certain positions are set to zero based on their position relative to some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid with all cells set to zero except for certain positions. For example, in example 1, the output has 4 in the middle of the first row, and 3 in the middle of the second row, but the rest are zero. But how?\n\nWait, looking at example 1's output: the first row is 0 4 0. The second row is 0 3 0. The third row is 0 0 0. So maybe the output is taking the original grid and replacing all cells except those in the middle of the grid? Or maybe it's taking the original grid and replacing cells that are in certain positions. Like, for example, the middle cell of each row is kept, and others are zero. But in example 1, the middle cell of the first row is 4, which is kept. The middle cell of the second row is 3, which is kept. The third row's middle cell is 0, which becomes 0. So that would fit. But then, in example 2, the output's first row is 0 0 3 0 0. The original input's first row is 8 0 3 0 0. So the third element is 3, which is kept. But in the input's first row, the third element is 3, and in the output, it's kept. But the other elements are zero. So maybe the rule is that in each row, the third element is kept, and others are zero. But that would not fit with example 3. Let's check example 3's input and output.\n\nExample 3 input first row is 3 0 4 0 0. Output is 0 0 4 0 0. So the third element is 4, kept. The rest are zero. So again, same pattern. But in example 2, the first row of output is 0 0 3 0 0. The third element is 3. So maybe the third column is kept, others are zero. But in example 1, the third column of the input is 0,9,0. The output third column is 0,0,0. So that doesn't fit. Because the third column's third element is 0, which is kept. But the original third column has 0,9,0. The output third column is 0,0,0. So the 9 is replaced with 0. So that contradicts the idea that third column is kept. So that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the original grid and replacing all cells with zero except for the cells that are in the same row or column as a certain value. But that's unclear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the positions of non-zero elements. For example, in example 1, the output has non-zero elements in positions (0,1), (1,1), and (0,1) is the middle of the first row. Similarly, in example 2, the output's first row has 3 in position (0,2), which is the third column. But that's not consistent with example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where the non-zero elements are the same as in the input, but the rest are zero. But in example 1, the input has 6,4,0 in the first row. The output has 0,4,0. So the 6 is replaced with zero. But why? Maybe the original grid's non-zero elements are kept only if they are in certain positions. For example, maybe the output is the input grid with all elements set to zero except for the middle elements of each row and column. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid with all elements set to zero, except for the elements that are in the same row or column as a certain value. For example, in example 1, the middle cell (1,1) is 3. So maybe the output is zero except for cells that are in the same row or column as that cell. But that would mean that the middle cell's row and column are kept. But in example 1's output, the first row has 0,4,0. The middle cell is in row 1. So maybe the output is the input grid with all elements set to zero except for those that are in the same row or column as the middle cell of the input. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid with all elements set to zero, except for the elements that are in the same row or column as a non-zero value. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions based on their value. For example, if a cell is non-zero, it's kept, otherwise zero. But that would not change the input. But in example 1, the input's third row is 1,0,0. The output is 0,0,0. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is zero unless it's in a certain position. For example, in example 1, the output has non-zero elements in the middle of each row. For example, the first row's middle is 4, second row's middle is 3, third row's middle is 0. But the third row's middle is zero, so it's set to zero. So maybe the output is the input grid with all cells set to zero except for the middle cell of each row. But then, in example 2, the output has non-zero elements in the third column. Let's check example 2's input. The input is a 5x5 grid. The output's first row is 0 0 3 0 0. So the third column is 3. The input's first row is 8 0 3 0 0. So the third column is 3, which is kept. The second row of the output is 0 0 5 0 0. The input's second row is 8 6 5 6 0. So third column is 5. So maybe the third column is kept. But in example 1, the third column of the input is 0,9,0. The output's third column is 0,0,0. So the 9 is replaced with zero. So that contradicts the idea.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me try to look for other patterns. Maybe the output is generated by replacing all non-zero values with zero, but keeping the positions where the original value was zero. That doesn't make sense. Or maybe the output is the input grid with all non-zero values replaced with zero, but that would make the output all zeros. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid with some cells replaced based on their position. For example, if the cell is in the first row, then it's set to zero. But that's not the case in example 1, where the first row has 0,4,0. So the 4 is kept.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid with certain positions set to zero based on their row and column indices. For example, if the row index is even, set to zero. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, which is 0 4 0 in the first row. The original input's first row is 6 4 0. The output's first row is 0 4 0. So the 4 is kept, but the 6 and 0 are replaced with 0. But why? Maybe the 4 is in the middle of the row, so it's kept, others are zero. Similarly, in example 2, the output's first row has 0 0 3 0 0. So the third element is kept. Maybe the third column is kept. But in example 1's input, the third column is 0,9,0. The output's third column is 0,0,0. So the 9 is replaced with zero. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and for each row, the middle element is kept, and others are zero. Let's check example 1: first row's middle is 4, kept. Second row's middle is 3, kept. Third row's middle is 0, kept. So the output would be 0 4 0, 0 3 0, 0 0 0. Which matches example 1. For example 2, the input is a 5x5 grid. The output's first row is 0 0 3 0 0. The third element is 3. So maybe for each row, the third element is kept, others are zero. But in example 2's input, the third column is 3, 6, 3, 0, 5. The output's first row third element is 3. But in the second row of the output, the third element is 5. The input's second row is 8 6 5 6 0. So third element is 5. So that would fit. Then, for the third row of the input, the third element is 3, which is kept. So the output's third row is 0 0 3 0 0. Which matches the example 2's output. For example 3, the input's first row is 3 0 4 0 0. The output is 0 0 4 0 0. So third element is 4, kept. So that fits. So maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third element is kept, others are zero. But then, why in example 1's third row, the third element is 0, which is kept as 0. So the output is 0 0 0. But that's correct.\n\nWait, but example 2's output is 5x5, and the input is 5x5. So the third column of each row is kept. But in example 1's input, the third column is 0,9,0. The output's third column is 0,0,0. So the 9 is replaced with zero. But according to the pattern, the third element of each row should be kept. So why is the 9 in example 1's input's third column replaced with zero in the output?\n\nHmm, that's conflicting. So maybe the pattern is not that. Maybe it's something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and for each cell, if the cell is in the same row as a non-zero value, then it's set to zero. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero except for those that are in the same row or column as a certain value. For example, in example 1, the middle cell (1,1) is 3. So all cells in row 1 and column 1 are kept. But in the output, the first row has 0,4,0. The middle cell is 3, which is in row 1 and column 1. So the output's first row's middle cell is 4 (original input's first row middle is 4). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero except for the cells that are in the same row or column as a non-zero value. But that would mean that if a cell is in the same row or column as a non-zero value, it's kept. But in example 1, the input's first row has 6,4,0. So the 6 and 4 are non-zero. So all cells in row 1 are kept. But the output's first row is 0,4,0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero, but keeping the cells that are in certain positions. For example, in example 1, the output has the middle of each row. But in example 2, the output has the third element of each row. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero, except for the cells that are in the same row as a non-zero value. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero, but keeping the cells that are in the same column as a non-zero value. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero, but keeping the cells that are in the same row as a non-zero value. For example, in example 1's input, the first row has 6,4,0. So the first row's cells are kept. But the output's first row is 0,4,0. So why is the 6 replaced with zero?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in example 1, the output is a grid where the middle cell of each row is kept. So for each row, the middle element is kept, others are zero. But in example 1's input, the third row's middle element is 0, which is kept as zero. So the output is 0 0 0. Which fits.\n\nIn example 2, the output's first row is 0 0 3 0 0. The third element is 3. So maybe for each row, the third element is kept. But in example 2's input, the third column of the first row is 3, which is kept. The third column of the second row is 5, which is kept. The third column of the third row is 3, which is kept. The fourth row's third column is 0, which is kept as zero. The fifth row's third column is 9, which is kept. So the output's third column is kept. So for each row, the third element is kept, others are zero. That would fit example 2's output.\n\nBut in example 1's input, the third column of the first row is 0, which is kept as zero. The third column of the second row is 9, which is replaced with zero. So that contradicts the pattern. But maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third element is kept if it's non-zero, otherwise zero. But in example 1's second row, the third element is 9, which is non-zero, but the output's second row third element is zero. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third element is kept if it's non-zero, and others are zero. But in example 1's second row, the third element is 9, which is kept, but the output is 0 3 0. So that's not the case.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero, but keeping the cells that are in the same row or column as a certain value. For example, in example 1, the middle cell (1,1) is 3. So the output is the input grid with all cells set to zero except those in row 1 or column 1. But in the output of example 1, the first row is 0 4 0, which is row 1. The second row is 0 3 0, which is row 1's column 1. The third row is 0 0 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero, but keeping the cells that are in the same row as a non-zero value. For example, in example 1's first row, there are non-zero values (6 and 4), so all cells in that row are kept. But the output's first row is 0 4 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero, but keeping the cells that are in the same column as a non-zero value. For example, in example 1's third column has 0,9,0. The second row's third column is 9, which is non-zero. So the third column is kept. But the output's third column is 0,0,0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that the output is the input grid with all cells set to zero, except for the cells that are in the same row as a non-zero value in the input. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero, but keeping the cells that are in the same row or column as a cell with a non-zero value. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input grid and for each cell, if the cell is in the same row or column as a cell that is non-zero, then it is kept. Otherwise, it is set to zero. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input grid and for each cell, if the cell is in the same row or column as a non-zero cell, then it is set to zero. But that would mean that if there is at least one non-zero in the row or column, the cell is zero. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and for each cell, if the cell is in the same row or column as a non-zero cell, then it is set to zero. But that would mean that the output is all zeros. Which is not the case.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. Input's first row is 3 0 4 0 0. Output is 0 0 4 0 0. So the third element is kept. Input's second row is 3 0 4 7 0. Output is 0 0 4 0 0. So third element is kept. So again, the third element is kept. So maybe for each row, the third element is kept, others are zero. But why in example 1's second row, the third element is 9, but in the output, the second row is 0 3 0. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, example 1's input is a 3x3 grid. The output is 3x3. The output's second row is 0 3 0. The original input's second row is 0 3 9. So the middle element is 3, which is kept. So maybe for each row, the middle element is kept, others are zero. So in a 3x3 grid, the middle element of each row is kept. That would fit example 1. For example 2, the input is 5x5. The output's first row is 0 0 3 0 0. So the third element is kept. Which is the middle of the row. For a 5x5 grid, the middle element is at column 2 (0-based index 2). So in example 2's first row, the third element (index 2) is kept. So that fits. For example 3's input, which is 5x5, the output's first row is 0 0 4 0 0. The third element is kept. So that fits.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each row, the middle element is kept, others are set to zero. But why in example 1's second row, the original input is 0 3 9. The middle element is 3, which is kept. So the output is 0 3 0. Which fits. And in example 1's third row, the input is 1 0 0. The middle element is 0, which is kept as zero. So output is 0 0 0. Which fits.\n\nIn example 2, the input's second row is 8 6 5 6 0. The middle element is 5, which is kept. So the output's second row is 0 0 5 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nIn example 3, the input's second row is 3 0 4 7 0. The middle element is 4, which is kept. So the output is 0 0 4 0 0. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each row, the middle element is kept, others are set to zero. So the transformation is to take each row, keep the middle element, and set others to zero.\n\nBut wait, in example 2, the input's third row is 0 0 3 0 0. The middle element is 3, which is kept. So the output's third row is 0 0 3 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nBut in example 1's input, the third row is 1 0 0. The middle element is 0, so the output is 0 0 0. Which fits.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. So the transformation is: for each row, the middle element is kept, others are set to zero. So for a 3x3 grid, the middle element is at position (row, 1) (0-based). For a 5x5 grid, the middle element is at position (row, 2) (0-based).\n\nBut the test input is a 7x7 grid. Wait, the test input is given as:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 3 0 0 0 7\n8 1 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 8 0 3\n0 7 0 1 0 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 8 6 0 0 0\n0 8 0 6 0 1 0\n\nSo the test input is a 7x7 grid. So for each row, the middle element is at position 3 (since 7 columns, middle is index 3). So for each row, the 4th element (index 3) is kept, others are zero.\n\nSo the transformation would be: for each row, set all elements to zero except the middle element, which is kept as it is.\n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples?\n\nFor example 1's input is 3x3. So for each row, the middle element is at index 1. So for the first row, 6 4 0 \u2192 0 4 0. Second row 0 3 9 \u2192 0 3 0. Third row 1 0 0 \u2192 0 0 0.\n\nYes, which matches the example.\n\nExample 2's input is 5x5. Each row's middle element is at index 2. So for the first row 8 0 3 0 0 \u2192 0 0 3 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nExample 3's input is 5x5. Each row's middle element is at index 2. So for the first row 3 0 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 4 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. So the transformation is for each row, take the middle element, and set all other elements to zero.\n\nThus, the Python function should take each row, find the middle element, and set all other elements to zero.\n\nSo, for a grid with rows of varying lengths? Wait, but the training examples have different grid sizes. But the problem says that the input is a 2D list, and the output must be a 3x3 grid. Wait, no. The problem says that the function must return a 3x3 output grid. Wait, the test input is 7x7, but the output must be 3x3. Wait, this is confusing. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nBut in the training examples, the input is 3x3, 5x5, 5x5. But the output is 3x3, 5x5, 5x5. Wait, no. Let me check the training examples again.\n\nExample 1: input is 3x3, output is 3x3.\n\nExample 2: input is 5x5, output is 5x5.\n\nExample 3: input is 5x5, output is 5x5.\n\nBut the test input is 7x7. But according to the problem statement, the function must return a 3x3 output grid. Wait, that's conflicting. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nSo regardless of the input grid's size, the output is always 3x3. But that contradicts the training examples. For example, in example 2, the input is 5x5, and the output is 5x5. But according to the problem statement, the output must be 3x3. So this suggests that there's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect. Or perhaps the training examples are not in line with the problem statement. But the user provided the training examples, and the test input is 7x7. The problem says that the output must be 3x3. But that's not possible for the training examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is wrong, and the output is the same size as the input. But the user's instruction says:\n\n\"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nBut that's conflicting with the training examples. For example, in example 2, the input is 5x5, and the output is 5x5. So that's not possible. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect. Or perhaps the training examples are not correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the input and output grids are of the same size, but the user made a mistake in the problem statement. But according to the problem statement, the output must be 3x3. But that's not possible for the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is wrong, and the output is the same size as the input. But the user says that the output must be 3x3. This is confusing.\n\nBut the user says that the test input is shown for context. So perhaps the test input is 7x7, but the output must be 3x3. So how to reconcile this?\n\nThis suggests that the problem statement is incorrect. But given the training examples, perhaps the output is the same size as the input. So the problem statement's requirement to produce a 3x3 output is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the function must return a 3x3 output grid. So perhaps the training examples are not correct. But that's not possible. So I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input and output grids are of the same size, and the problem statement's requirement to produce a 3x3 output is a mistake. But the user says that the output must be 3x3.\n\nThis is a contradiction. However, the user provided the training examples, and the test input. So perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the output grid is the same size as the input. But the problem statement says that the output must be 3x3. This is confusing.\n\nBut given that the training examples have outputs of the same size as the input, I think that the problem statement's requirement is incorrect, and the output should be the same size as the input. So the function should return a grid of the same size as the input, not 3x3.\n\nBut the user's instruction says:\n\n\"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nThis is conflicting. However, looking at the test input, which is 7x7, but the output must be 3x3. But that's not possible. So I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the input and output grids are of the same size, but the test input is a 7x7 grid, and the output is also 7x7. But the problem statement says that the output must be 3x3. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement is correct, and the training examples are incorrect. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the training examples are not. For example, in example 1, the input is 3x3, and the output is 3x3. So that fits. But example 2's input is 5x5, and the output is 5x5. So that would not fit the requirement of producing a 3x3 output. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut the user says that the test input is shown for context, and the function must return a 3x3 output grid. So perhaps the training examples are not in line with the problem statement. But this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the output is always 3x3, regardless of the input. But that would mean that the training examples are not correct. But that's not possible.\n\nThis is a critical issue. To proceed, I must assume that the problem statement is correct, and the output must be 3x3. But how to reconcile that with the training examples?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the training examples are for different tasks, and the test input is for a different task. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the output is always 3x3. So for the training examples, the input and output are 3x3, 5x5, 5x5, but the output is 3x3. But that would mean that the training examples are incorrect. But that's impossible.\n\nThis is a major confusion. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement. But given the training examples, the pattern is that the output is the same size as the input, with each row's middle element kept and others set to zero.\n\nSo, given that, the function should return a grid of the same size as the input, where each row has the middle element kept and others set to zero.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the output must be 3x3. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement, and the output should be the same size as the input. Or perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the training examples are incorrect.\n\nBut given that the user provided the training examples, I must proceed under the assumption that the output is the same size as the input, and that the problem statement's requirement is incorrect.\n\nSo, the transformation is: for each row, keep the middle element, set others to zero.\n\nThus, the Python function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        n = len(row)\n        middle = n // 2\n        new_row = [0] * n\n        new_row[middle] = row[middle]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would work for the training examples. For example, in example 1, the input is 3x3. For each row, the middle element is at index 1. So the new row is [0, row[1], 0]. Which matches the output.\n\nIn example 2, input is 5x5. Middle index is 2. So each row is [0,0, row[2], 0, 0]. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 3's input is 5x5, same as example 2. So this would work.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the output must be 3x3. So this function would not work for the test input, which is 7x7. But the test input is just for context. The function is supposed to handle any input and return a 3x3 grid. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut the user says that the function must return a 3x3 output grid. So this suggests that the input is always 3x3, and the output is 3x3. But the training examples include inputs of different sizes. So this is confusing.\n\nBut given that the user provided the training examples, and the test input is 7x7, but the output must be 3x3, it's possible that the problem statement is wrong. But given that the user says the output must be 3x3, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the input is always 3x3, and the output is 3x3. But that's not the case for the training examples.\n\nThis is a major issue, but given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output is the same size as the input, and that the problem statement's requirement is incorrect. Because the training examples show that the output is the same size as the input.\n\nThus, the function would be as described above.\n\nBut the user says that the output must be 3x3. So perhaps the problem is that the input is always 3x3, and the output is 3x3. But the training examples have input of 3x3, 5x5, 5x5. This is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the training examples are for a different task. But this is unlikely.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the function that transforms each row to have the middle element kept and others zero, and return a grid of the same size as the input. This fits the training examples, and the test input would be transformed to a 7x7 grid, but the problem statement says that the output must be 3x3. So this is a contradiction. But given the training examples, this is the only pattern I can find.\n\nSo the final answer is the function that for each row, keeps the middle element and sets others to zero.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, the task is to transform an input grid into an output grid based on some rules. Let me look at the examples carefully.\n\nFirst, Example 1:\nInput is a 3x3 grid:\n6 4 0\n0 3 9\n1 0 0\nOutput is:\n0 4 0\n0 3 0\n0 0 0\n\nHmm. Looking at the input and output. The output seems to have some zeros in certain positions. Let me compare each cell. For instance, the first row of input is 6,4,0. The output first row is 0,4,0. So the 4 stays, but the 6 and 0 are replaced with 0 and 0. Wait, maybe the 0s in the input are being replaced with 0s in the output? But the original input's third column is 0,9,0. The output third column is 0,0,0. So maybe the output is replacing non-zero values with zero? But that doesn't fit. Let me check other cells.\n\nIn the input, the middle cell is 3, and in the output, it's still 3. So maybe not. Wait, maybe the output is taking the original grid and replacing certain positions. Let me think of other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\nInput is a 5x5 grid. The output is also 5x5. The input has some 0s and numbers. The output seems to have some cells set to 0. For example, the first row input is 8 0 3 0 0. The output first row is 0 0 3 0 0. So the 3 remains, but the 8 and 0s are replaced with 0s. But why?\n\nAnother example: in the input, the third row is 3 6 3 0 0. Output is 0 0 3 0 0. So the first two elements are 0s, but the third is 3. Maybe the pattern is that certain positions are set to zero based on some rule. Maybe the positions that are in the same row or column as a certain value?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some symmetry or transformation. For example, maybe the output grid is the input grid with some cells set to zero based on their position. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3:\nInput is a 5x5 grid again. The output is similar. For example, the first row input is 3 0 4 0 0. Output is 0 0 4 0 0. So the 4 remains, but the 3 and 0s are replaced with 0s. Again, maybe the non-zero values are kept, but others are set to zero? But that doesn't fit with the first example. Wait, in example 1, the output has 0 4 0. The input's first row is 6 4 0. So 4 is kept, but 6 and 0 are replaced with 0. But in the input's third row, the first element is 1, which becomes 0 in the output. So maybe the rule is that if the original cell is not zero, then it's kept, but if it's zero, it's replaced with zero? That doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the output is a grid where certain positions are set to zero based on their position relative to some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid with all cells set to zero except for certain positions. For example, in example 1, the output has 4 in the middle of the first row, and 3 in the middle of the second row, but the rest are zero. But how?\n\nWait, looking at example 1's output: the first row is 0 4 0. The second row is 0 3 0. The third row is 0 0 0. So maybe the output is taking the original grid and replacing all cells except those in the middle of the grid? Or maybe it's taking the original grid and replacing cells that are in certain positions. Like, for example, the middle cell of each row is kept, and others are zero. But in example 1, the middle cell of the first row is 4, which is kept. The middle cell of the second row is 3, which is kept. The third row's middle cell is 0, which becomes 0. So that would fit. But then, in example 2, the output's first row is 0 0 3 0 0. The original input's first row is 8 0 3 0 0. So the third element is 3, which is kept. But in the input's first row, the third element is 3, and in the output, it's kept. But the other elements are zero. So maybe the rule is that in each row, the third element is kept, and others are zero. But that would not fit with example 3. Let's check example 3's input and output.\n\nExample 3 input first row is 3 0 4 0 0. Output is 0 0 4 0 0. So the third element is 4, kept. The rest are zero. So again, same pattern. But in example 2, the first row of output is 0 0 3 0 0. The third element is 3. So maybe the third column is kept, others are zero. But in example 1, the third column of the input is 0,9,0. The output third column is 0,0,0. So that doesn't fit. Because the third column's third element is 0, which is kept. But the original third column has 0,9,0. The output third column is 0,0,0. So the 9 is replaced with 0. So that contradicts the idea that third column is kept. So that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the original grid and replacing all cells with zero except for the cells that are in the same row or column as a certain value. But that's unclear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the positions of non-zero elements. For example, in example 1, the output has non-zero elements in positions (0,1), (1,1), and (0,1) is the middle of the first row. Similarly, in example 2, the output's first row has 3 in position (0,2), which is the third column. But that's not consistent with example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where the non-zero elements are the same as in the input, but the rest are zero. But in example 1, the input has 6,4,0 in the first row. The output has 0,4,0. So the 6 is replaced with zero. But why? Maybe the original grid's non-zero elements are kept only if they are in certain positions. For example, maybe the output is the input grid with all elements set to zero except for the middle elements of each row and column. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid with all elements set to zero, except for the elements that are in the same row or column as a certain value. For example, in example 1, the middle cell (1,1) is 3. So maybe the output is zero except for cells that are in the same row or column as that cell. But that would mean that the middle cell's row and column are kept. But in example 1's output, the first row has 0,4,0. The middle cell is in row 1. So maybe the output is the input grid with all elements set to zero except for those that are in the same row or column as the middle cell of the input. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid with all elements set to zero, except for the elements that are in the same row or column as a non-zero value. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain positions based on their value. For example, if a cell is non-zero, it's kept, otherwise zero. But that would not change the input. But in example 1, the input's third row is 1,0,0. The output is 0,0,0. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is zero unless it's in a certain position. For example, in example 1, the output has non-zero elements in the middle of each row. For example, the first row's middle is 4, second row's middle is 3, third row's middle is 0. But the third row's middle is zero, so it's set to zero. So maybe the output is the input grid with all cells set to zero except for the middle cell of each row. But then, in example 2, the output has non-zero elements in the third column. Let's check example 2's input. The input is a 5x5 grid. The output's first row is 0 0 3 0 0. So the third column is 3. The input's first row is 8 0 3 0 0. So the third column is 3, which is kept. The second row of the output is 0 0 5 0 0. The input's second row is 8 6 5 6 0. So third column is 5. So maybe the third column is kept. But in example 1, the third column of the input is 0,9,0. The output's third column is 0,0,0. So the 9 is replaced with zero. So that contradicts the idea.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me try to look for other patterns. Maybe the output is generated by replacing all non-zero values with zero, but keeping the positions where the original value was zero. That doesn't make sense. Or maybe the output is the input grid with all non-zero values replaced with zero, but that would make the output all zeros. But that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid with some cells replaced based on their position. For example, if the cell is in the first row, then it's set to zero. But that's not the case in example 1, where the first row has 0,4,0. So the 4 is kept.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid with certain positions set to zero based on their row and column indices. For example, if the row index is even, set to zero. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, which is 0 4 0 in the first row. The original input's first row is 6 4 0. The output's first row is 0 4 0. So the 4 is kept, but the 6 and 0 are replaced with 0. But why? Maybe the 4 is in the middle of the row, so it's kept, others are zero. Similarly, in example 2, the output's first row has 0 0 3 0 0. So the third element is kept. Maybe the third column is kept. But in example 1's input, the third column is 0,9,0. The output's third column is 0,0,0. So the 9 is replaced with zero. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and for each row, the middle element is kept, and others are zero. Let's check example 1: first row's middle is 4, kept. Second row's middle is 3, kept. Third row's middle is 0, kept. So the output would be 0 4 0, 0 3 0, 0 0 0. Which matches example 1. For example 2, the input is a 5x5 grid. The output's first row is 0 0 3 0 0. The third element is 3. So maybe for each row, the third element is kept, others are zero. But in example 2's input, the third column is 3, 6, 3, 0, 5. The output's first row third element is 3. But in the second row of the output, the third element is 5. The input's second row is 8 6 5 6 0. So third element is 5. So that would fit. Then, for the third row of the input, the third element is 3, which is kept. So the output's third row is 0 0 3 0 0. Which matches the example 2's output. For example 3, the input's first row is 3 0 4 0 0. The output is 0 0 4 0 0. So third element is 4, kept. So that fits. So maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third element is kept, others are zero. But then, why in example 1's third row, the third element is 0, which is kept as 0. So the output is 0 0 0. But that's correct.\n\nWait, but example 2's output is 5x5, and the input is 5x5. So the third column of each row is kept. But in example 1's input, the third column is 0,9,0. The output's third column is 0,0,0. So the 9 is replaced with zero. But according to the pattern, the third element of each row should be kept. So why is the 9 in example 1's input's third column replaced with zero in the output?\n\nHmm, that's conflicting. So maybe the pattern is not that. Maybe it's something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and for each cell, if the cell is in the same row as a non-zero value, then it's set to zero. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero except for those that are in the same row or column as a certain value. For example, in example 1, the middle cell (1,1) is 3. So all cells in row 1 and column 1 are kept. But in the output, the first row has 0,4,0. The middle cell is 3, which is in row 1 and column 1. So the output's first row's middle cell is 4 (original input's first row middle is 4). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero except for the cells that are in the same row or column as a non-zero value. But that would mean that if a cell is in the same row or column as a non-zero value, it's kept. But in example 1, the input's first row has 6,4,0. So the 6 and 4 are non-zero. So all cells in row 1 are kept. But the output's first row is 0,4,0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero, but keeping the cells that are in certain positions. For example, in example 1, the output has the middle of each row. But in example 2, the output has the third element of each row. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero, except for the cells that are in the same row as a non-zero value. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero, but keeping the cells that are in the same column as a non-zero value. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero, but keeping the cells that are in the same row as a non-zero value. For example, in example 1's input, the first row has 6,4,0. So the first row's cells are kept. But the output's first row is 0,4,0. So why is the 6 replaced with zero?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in example 1, the output is a grid where the middle cell of each row is kept. So for each row, the middle element is kept, others are zero. But in example 1's input, the third row's middle element is 0, which is kept as zero. So the output is 0 0 0. Which fits.\n\nIn example 2, the output's first row is 0 0 3 0 0. The third element is 3. So maybe for each row, the third element is kept. But in example 2's input, the third column of the first row is 3, which is kept. The third column of the second row is 5, which is kept. The third column of the third row is 3, which is kept. The fourth row's third column is 0, which is kept as zero. The fifth row's third column is 9, which is kept. So the output's third column is kept. So for each row, the third element is kept, others are zero. That would fit example 2's output.\n\nBut in example 1's input, the third column of the first row is 0, which is kept as zero. The third column of the second row is 9, which is replaced with zero. So that contradicts the pattern. But maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third element is kept if it's non-zero, otherwise zero. But in example 1's second row, the third element is 9, which is non-zero, but the output's second row third element is zero. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the third element is kept if it's non-zero, and others are zero. But in example 1's second row, the third element is 9, which is kept, but the output is 0 3 0. So that's not the case.\n\nThis is really confusing. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero, but keeping the cells that are in the same row or column as a certain value. For example, in example 1, the middle cell (1,1) is 3. So the output is the input grid with all cells set to zero except those in row 1 or column 1. But in the output of example 1, the first row is 0 4 0, which is row 1. The second row is 0 3 0, which is row 1's column 1. The third row is 0 0 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero, but keeping the cells that are in the same row as a non-zero value. For example, in example 1's first row, there are non-zero values (6 and 4), so all cells in that row are kept. But the output's first row is 0 4 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero, but keeping the cells that are in the same column as a non-zero value. For example, in example 1's third column has 0,9,0. The second row's third column is 9, which is non-zero. So the third column is kept. But the output's third column is 0,0,0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that the output is the input grid with all cells set to zero, except for the cells that are in the same row as a non-zero value in the input. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and replacing all cells with zero, but keeping the cells that are in the same row or column as a cell with a non-zero value. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input grid and for each cell, if the cell is in the same row or column as a cell that is non-zero, then it is kept. Otherwise, it is set to zero. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input grid and for each cell, if the cell is in the same row or column as a non-zero cell, then it is set to zero. But that would mean that if there is at least one non-zero in the row or column, the cell is zero. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input grid and for each cell, if the cell is in the same row or column as a non-zero cell, then it is set to zero. But that would mean that the output is all zeros. Which is not the case.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. Input's first row is 3 0 4 0 0. Output is 0 0 4 0 0. So the third element is kept. Input's second row is 3 0 4 7 0. Output is 0 0 4 0 0. So third element is kept. So again, the third element is kept. So maybe for each row, the third element is kept, others are zero. But why in example 1's second row, the third element is 9, but in the output, the second row is 0 3 0. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, example 1's input is a 3x3 grid. The output is 3x3. The output's second row is 0 3 0. The original input's second row is 0 3 9. So the middle element is 3, which is kept. So maybe for each row, the middle element is kept, others are zero. So in a 3x3 grid, the middle element of each row is kept. That would fit example 1. For example 2, the input is 5x5. The output's first row is 0 0 3 0 0. So the third element is kept. Which is the middle of the row. For a 5x5 grid, the middle element is at column 2 (0-based index 2). So in example 2's first row, the third element (index 2) is kept. So that fits. For example 3's input, which is 5x5, the output's first row is 0 0 4 0 0. The third element is kept. So that fits.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each row, the middle element is kept, others are set to zero. But why in example 1's second row, the original input is 0 3 9. The middle element is 3, which is kept. So the output is 0 3 0. Which fits. And in example 1's third row, the input is 1 0 0. The middle element is 0, which is kept as zero. So output is 0 0 0. Which fits.\n\nIn example 2, the input's second row is 8 6 5 6 0. The middle element is 5, which is kept. So the output's second row is 0 0 5 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nIn example 3, the input's second row is 3 0 4 7 0. The middle element is 4, which is kept. So the output is 0 0 4 0 0. Which matches.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each row, the middle element is kept, others are set to zero. So the transformation is to take each row, keep the middle element, and set others to zero.\n\nBut wait, in example 2, the input's third row is 0 0 3 0 0. The middle element is 3, which is kept. So the output's third row is 0 0 3 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nBut in example 1's input, the third row is 1 0 0. The middle element is 0, so the output is 0 0 0. Which fits.\n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. So the transformation is: for each row, the middle element is kept, others are set to zero. So for a 3x3 grid, the middle element is at position (row, 1) (0-based). For a 5x5 grid, the middle element is at position (row, 2) (0-based).\n\nBut the test input is a 7x7 grid. Wait, the test input is given as:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 3 0 0 0 7\n8 1 0 8 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 8 0 3\n0 7 0 1 0 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 8 6 0 0 0\n0 8 0 6 0 1 0\n\nSo the test input is a 7x7 grid. So for each row, the middle element is at position 3 (since 7 columns, middle is index 3). So for each row, the 4th element (index 3) is kept, others are zero.\n\nSo the transformation would be: for each row, set all elements to zero except the middle element, which is kept as it is.\n\nBut how does this fit with the training examples?\n\nFor example 1's input is 3x3. So for each row, the middle element is at index 1. So for the first row, 6 4 0 \u2192 0 4 0. Second row 0 3 9 \u2192 0 3 0. Third row 1 0 0 \u2192 0 0 0.\n\nYes, which matches the example.\n\nExample 2's input is 5x5. Each row's middle element is at index 2. So for the first row 8 0 3 0 0 \u2192 0 0 3 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nExample 3's input is 5x5. Each row's middle element is at index 2. So for the first row 3 0 4 0 0 \u2192 0 0 4 0 0. Which matches the example's output.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. So the transformation is for each row, take the middle element, and set all other elements to zero.\n\nThus, the Python function should take each row, find the middle element, and set all other elements to zero.\n\nSo, for a grid with rows of varying lengths? Wait, but the training examples have different grid sizes. But the problem says that the input is a 2D list, and the output must be a 3x3 grid. Wait, no. The problem says that the function must return a 3x3 output grid. Wait, the test input is 7x7, but the output must be 3x3. Wait, this is confusing. Wait, the problem says:\n\n\"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nBut in the training examples, the input is 3x3, 5x5, 5x5. But the output is 3x3, 5x5, 5x5. Wait, no. Let me check the training examples again.\n\nExample 1: input is 3x3, output is 3x3.\n\nExample 2: input is 5x5, output is 5x5.\n\nExample 3: input is 5x5, output is 5x5.\n\nBut the test input is 7x7. But according to the problem statement, the function must return a 3x3 output grid. Wait, that's conflicting. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, the problem says:\n\n\"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nSo regardless of the input grid's size, the output is always 3x3. But that contradicts the training examples. For example, in example 2, the input is 5x5, and the output is 5x5. But according to the problem statement, the output must be 3x3. So this suggests that there's a misunderstanding.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect. Or perhaps the training examples are not in line with the problem statement. But the user provided the training examples, and the test input is 7x7. The problem says that the output must be 3x3. But that's not possible for the training examples.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is wrong, and the output is the same size as the input. But the user's instruction says:\n\n\"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nBut that's conflicting with the training examples. For example, in example 2, the input is 5x5, and the output is 5x5. So that's not possible. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect. Or perhaps the training examples are not correct. Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the input and output grids are of the same size, but the user made a mistake in the problem statement. But according to the problem statement, the output must be 3x3. But that's not possible for the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is wrong, and the output is the same size as the input. But the user says that the output must be 3x3. This is confusing.\n\nBut the user says that the test input is shown for context. So perhaps the test input is 7x7, but the output must be 3x3. So how to reconcile this?\n\nThis suggests that the problem statement is incorrect. But given the training examples, perhaps the output is the same size as the input. So the problem statement's requirement to produce a 3x3 output is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the user's instruction, the function must return a 3x3 output grid. So perhaps the training examples are not correct. But that's not possible. So I must have made a mistake in understanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input and output grids are of the same size, and the problem statement's requirement to produce a 3x3 output is a mistake. But the user says that the output must be 3x3.\n\nThis is a contradiction. However, the user provided the training examples, and the test input. So perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the output grid is the same size as the input. But the problem statement says that the output must be 3x3. This is confusing.\n\nBut given that the training examples have outputs of the same size as the input, I think that the problem statement's requirement is incorrect, and the output should be the same size as the input. So the function should return a grid of the same size as the input, not 3x3.\n\nBut the user's instruction says:\n\n\"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nThis is conflicting. However, looking at the test input, which is 7x7, but the output must be 3x3. But that's not possible. So I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that the input and output grids are of the same size, but the test input is a 7x7 grid, and the output is also 7x7. But the problem statement says that the output must be 3x3. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem statement is correct, and the training examples are incorrect. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the training examples are not. For example, in example 1, the input is 3x3, and the output is 3x3. So that fits. But example 2's input is 5x5, and the output is 5x5. So that would not fit the requirement of producing a 3x3 output. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut the user says that the test input is shown for context, and the function must return a 3x3 output grid. So perhaps the training examples are not in line with the problem statement. But this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the output is always 3x3, regardless of the input. But that would mean that the training examples are not correct. But that's not possible.\n\nThis is a critical issue. To proceed, I must assume that the problem statement is correct, and the output must be 3x3. But how to reconcile that with the training examples?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the training examples are for different tasks, and the test input is for a different task. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the output is always 3x3. So for the training examples, the input and output are 3x3, 5x5, 5x5, but the output is 3x3. But that would mean that the training examples are incorrect. But that's impossible.\n\nThis is a major confusion. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement. But given the training examples, the pattern is that the output is the same size as the input, with each row's middle element kept and others set to zero.\n\nSo, given that, the function should return a grid of the same size as the input, where each row has the middle element kept and others set to zero.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the output must be 3x3. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement, and the output should be the same size as the input. Or perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the training examples are incorrect.\n\nBut given that the user provided the training examples, I must proceed under the assumption that the output is the same size as the input, and that the problem statement's requirement is incorrect.\n\nSo, the transformation is: for each row, keep the middle element, set others to zero.\n\nThus, the Python function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        n = len(row)\n        middle = n // 2\n        new_row = [0] * n\n        new_row[middle] = row[middle]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would work for the training examples. For example, in example 1, the input is 3x3. For each row, the middle element is at index 1. So the new row is [0, row[1], 0]. Which matches the output.\n\nIn example 2, input is 5x5. Middle index is 2. So each row is [0,0, row[2], 0, 0]. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 3's input is 5x5, same as example 2. So this would work.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the output must be 3x3. So this function would not work for the test input, which is 7x7. But the test input is just for context. The function is supposed to handle any input and return a 3x3 grid. So this is a contradiction.\n\nBut the user says that the function must return a 3x3 output grid. So this suggests that the input is always 3x3, and the output is 3x3. But the training examples include inputs of different sizes. So this is confusing.\n\nBut given that the user provided the training examples, and the test input is 7x7, but the output must be 3x3, it's possible that the problem statement is wrong. But given that the user says the output must be 3x3, perhaps the correct approach is to assume that the input is always 3x3, and the output is 3x3. But that's not the case for the training examples.\n\nThis is a major issue, but given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the output is the same size as the input, and that the problem statement's requirement is incorrect. Because the training examples show that the output is the same size as the input.\n\nThus, the function would be as described above.\n\nBut the user says that the output must be 3x3. So perhaps the problem is that the input is always 3x3, and the output is 3x3. But the training examples have input of 3x3, 5x5, 5x5. This is a contradiction.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the training examples are for a different task. But this is unlikely.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll proceed with the function that transforms each row to have the middle element kept and others zero, and return a grid of the same size as the input. This fits the training examples, and the test input would be transformed to a 7x7 grid, but the problem statement says that the output must be 3x3. So this is a contradiction. But given the training examples, this is the only pattern I can find.\n\nSo the final answer is the function that for each row, keeps the middle element and sets others to zero.\n"
