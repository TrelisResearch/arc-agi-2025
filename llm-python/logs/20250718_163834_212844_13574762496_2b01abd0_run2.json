          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. In Example 1, the output seems to be replacing certain values with new values based on their position and value.\n2. In Example 2, some values are being replaced with other values in a pattern that seems to be related to their position.\n3. In Example 3, there's a transformation that seems to be related to the position of the values and their values.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with other values based on their position and value.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

The values in these positions are being replaced with 1 or 0 based on their position. However, this implementation is not perfect and may not capture all the patterns seen in the training examples.",
