          "Let's break down the transformation:\n\n## Observations\n\n### 1. The Instruction Row\n- The top rows of the input grid are \"legends\", not part of the shapes below.\n- These rows contain a sequence of different colored squares, always positioned before the main shapes.\n- In the output, this legend row is preserved unchanged at the top.\n\n### 2. Shapes and Their Coloring\n- All examples contain one or more shapes made of gray (value 5) squares, below the legend row.\n- In the output, these shapes are \"sliced\" into colored diagonal stripes, each colored according to the sequence in the legend row (left to right: 1,2,3,8 in example 1; 1,3,4 in example 2; 2,8,3 in example 3; etc).\n- The stripes are diagonal, running from the topleft to bottomright, with the color wrapping through the legend sequence repeatedly.\n- Each diagonal stripe corresponds to a color from the legend, cycling through for each new diagonal. All diagonals (i.e., all pixels with the same x-y difference) share one color.\n\n### 3. Multiple Shapes\n- Example 3/test show multiple shapes, but the same \"diagonal by color\" logic applies separately to each shape, always starting from the legend's first color for the highest/leftmost square for each shape.\n\n### 4. Grid Size/Placement\n- The output grid has the same size as the input grid (unless padding/cropping required, but all examples seem the same size).\n- The legend row is copied 1:1, then for each pixel in each shape, coloring is applied as described above.\n\n## Hypothesis (Transformation Algorithm)\n\n1. **Identify the legend row(s)** (first nonzero row, or first rows before shapes).\n2. **For each shape**, find its pixel coordinates.\n3. **For each shape**:\n    - For each diagonal (all pixels with the same (row - col)), assign a color from the legend in order, cycling through if necessary.\n    - All pixels on the same diagonal get the same color.\n4. Legend row(s) are preserved unchanged.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n- Find the number and content of the legend row: first nonempty row.\n- Find each gray (5) connected component (i.e., shape), below the legend.\n- For each component:\n    - For each pixel, compute its \"offset\" = row - col (common for diagonals).\n    - Map unique offsets for that shape to legend colors cyclically.\n    - Assign those colors to the gray pixels in output.\n- Other pixels remain unchanged.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    from collections import defaultdict, deque\n\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = grid.shape\n\n    # Always create a 23x19 output\n    H, W = 23, 19\n    output = np.zeros((H, W), dtype=int)\n    grid = grid[:H,:W]\n\n    # 1.

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 23\u00d719 output grid.**\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 2 3 8 0 0 0

the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

          "Let's break down the transformation:\n\n## Observations\n\n### 1. The Instruction Row\n- The top rows of the input grid are \"legends\", not part of the shapes below.\n- These rows contain a sequence of different colored squares, always positioned before the main shapes.\n- In the output, this legend row is preserved unchanged at the top.\n\n### 2. Shapes and Their Coloring\n- All examples contain one or more shapes made of gray (value 5) squares, below the legend row.\n- In the output, these shapes are \"sliced\" into colored diagonal stripes, each colored according to the sequence in the legend row (left to right: 1,2,3,8 in example 1; 1,3,4 in example 2; 2,8,3 in example 3; etc).\n- The stripes are diagonal, running from the topleft to bottomright, with the color wrapping through the legend sequence repeatedly.\n- Each diagonal stripe corresponds to a color from the legend, cycling through for each new diagonal. All diagonals (i.e., all pixels with the same x-y difference) share one color.\n\n### 3. Multiple Shapes\n- Example 3/test show multiple shapes, but the same \"diagonal by color\" logic applies separately to each shape, always starting from the legend's first color for the highest/leftmost square for each shape.\n\n### 4. Grid Size/Placement\n- The output grid has the same size as the input grid (unless padding/cropping required, but all examples seem the same size).\n- The legend row is copied 1:1, then for each pixel in each shape, coloring is applied as described above.\n\n## Hypothesis (Transformation Algorithm)\n\n1. **Identify the legend row(s)** (first nonzero row, or first rows before shapes).\n2. **For each shape**, find its pixel coordinates.\n3. **For each shape**:\n    - For each diagonal (all pixels with the same (row - col)), assign a color from the legend in order, cycling through if necessary.\n    - All pixels on the same diagonal get the same color.\n4. Legend row(s) are preserved unchanged.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n- Find the number and content of the legend row: first nonempty row.\n- Find each gray (5) connected component (i.e., shape), below the legend.\n- For each component:\n    - For each pixel, compute its \"offset\" = row - col (common for diagonals).\n    - Map unique offsets for that shape to legend colors cyclically.\n    - Assign those colors to the gray pixels in output.\n- Other pixels remain unchanged.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    from collections import defaultdict, deque\n\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = grid.shape\n\n    # Always create a 23x19 output\n    H, W = 23, 19\n    output = np.zeros((H, W), dtype=int)\n    grid = grid[:H,:W]\n\n    # 1.

Legend row(s) are preserved unchanged.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n- Find the number and content of the legend row: first nonempty row.\n- Find each gray (5) connected component (i.e., shape), below the legend.\n- For each component:\n    - For each pixel, compute its \"offset\" = row - col (common for diagonals).\n    - Map unique offsets for that shape to legend colors cyclically.\n    - Assign those colors to the gray pixels in output.\n- Other pixels remain unchanged.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    from collections import defaultdict, deque\n\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = grid.shape\n\n    # Always create a 23x19 output\n    H, W = 23, 19\n    output = np.zeros((H, W), dtype=int)\n    grid = grid[:H,:W]\n\n    # 1.
