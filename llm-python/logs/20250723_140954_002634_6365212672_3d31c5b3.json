We'll start by identifying the positions of the values in the input grid and then map them to new positions in the output grid.\n\nHere's a possible transformation:\n\n- Reflect the input grid horizontally.\n- Replace values in the reflected grid with their corresponding values from the output grid.\n\nLet's implement this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reflect the input grid horizontally\n    reflected_grid = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Create a dictionary to map input values to output values\n    value_map = {\n        0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 3, 4: 8,\n        5: 5, 6: 6, 7: 7, 8: 8, 9: 9\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the transformation\n    transformed_grid = [[value_map.get(val, val) for val in row] for row in reflected_grid]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis transformation reflects the input grid horizontally and then maps the values using a predefined dictionary. This should capture some of the patterns observed in the training examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reflect the input grid horizontally\n    reflected_grid = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Create a dictionary to map input values to output values\n    value_map = {\n        0: 2, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 3, 4: 8,\n        5: 5, 6: 6, 7: 7, 8: 8, 9: 9\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the transformation\n    transformed_grid = [[value_map.get(val, val) for val in row] for row in reflected_grid]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "Let's analyze the patterns in the training examples:\n\n1. **Identify the Input and Output Patterns:**\n   - In each example, the input grid contains numbers (0-9) and the output grid has a transformed version of the input.\n   - The transformation seems to involve some form of replacement or modification of the numbers.\n\n2. **Pattern Observations:**\n   - **Number 0:** In the output, it often appears as 2 or 4.\n   - **Number 4:** It often appears as 5 or 8.\n   - **Number 8:** It often appears as 4 or 2.\n   - **Number 5:** It often appears as 2 or 4.\n   - **Number 2:** It often appears as 5 or 8.\n   - **Number 1:** It often appears as 0 or 4.\n\n3. **General Transformation Rule:**\n   - The transformation seems to be a mapping of numbers to other numbers based on the patterns observed.\n   - We can create a dictionary to map each number to its corresponding transformed number.\n\n4. **Implementation:**\n   - We will create a dictionary for the transformation and apply it to each element in the input grid to produce the output grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Define the transformation mapping\n    transformation = {\n        0: 2,\n        4: 5,\n        8: 4,\n        5: 2,\n        2: 5,\n        1: 0\n    }\n    \n    # Create a new grid to store the transformed values\n    transformed_grid = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each row in the input grid\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        # Iterate through each element in the row\n        for element in row:\n            # Apply the transformation mapping\n            new_row.append(transformation.get(element, element))\n        # Append the transformed row to the new grid\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis function uses a dictionary to map numbers to their corresponding transformed numbers and applies this mapping to each element in the input grid to produce the output grid. The function handles the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly.",
