The output grid always has the same dimensions (9x17) as the input grid\n2. The transformation seems to involve:\n   - Replacing certain values with others (e.g., 8 \u2192 1, 2 \u2192 3)\n   - Creating new patterns based on the positions of certain values\n   - Creating new values based on the positions of existing values\n   - Creating new values based on the positions of existing values\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Replaces certain values with others (e.g., 8 \u2192 1, 2 \u2192 3)\n- Creates new values based on the positions of existing values\n- Creates new values based on the positions of existing values\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values with others\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(17):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n    \n    # Create new values based on positions\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(17):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Create new values based on neighboring cells\n                # This is a simple pattern that creates new values in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values with others\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(17):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n    \n    # Create new values based on positions\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(17):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Create new values based on neighboring cells\n                # This is a simple pattern that creates new values in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid has a specific structure with 9 rows and 17 columns.\n2. The transformation seems to involve some kind of pattern recognition and replacement, possibly based on the positions and values in the input grid.\n3. There are instances where values are replaced or transformed based on their position and value.\n4. Some patterns seem to be related to the positions of certain values (like 8 or 5) and how they are transformed.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that looks for certain patterns and applies transformations accordingly.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # We need to make sure the output is 9x17\n    # If the input is not 9x17, we'll pad it with zeros\n    if len(transformed_grid) != 9 or len(transformed_grid[0]) != 17:\n        # Pad with zeros to make it 9x17\n        for i in range(9):\n            if len(transformed_grid[i]) < 17:\n                transformed_grid[i] += [0] * (17 - len(transformed_grid[i]))\n    \n    # Apply transformation logic\n    for row in range(9):\n        for col in range(17):\n            #

The transformation seems to involve some kind of pattern recognition and replacement, where certain values are replaced based on their position and value.\n2. There are patterns where values like 8 are replaced with 1s or 0s in specific positions.\n3. Values like 2 and 3 are replaced with other values in a pattern that seems to involve symmetry or spatial relationships.\n4. Values like 5 and 7 are replaced in a way that seems to involve spatial patterns or symmetry.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values based on their position and value, with some pattern-based logic.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid always has the same dimensions (9x17) as the input grid\n2. The transformation seems to involve:\n   - Replacing certain values with others (e.g., 8 \u2192 1, 2 \u2192 3)\n   - Creating new patterns based on the positions of certain values\n   - Creating new values based on the positions of existing values\n   - Creating new values based on the positions of existing values\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Replaces certain values with others (e.g., 8 \u2192 1, 2 \u2192 3)\n- Creates new values based on the positions of existing values\n- Creates new values based on the positions of existing values\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values with others\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(17):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n    \n    # Create new values based on positions\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(17):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Create new values based on neighboring cells\n                # This is a simple pattern that creates new values in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values with others\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(17):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n    \n    # Create new values based on positions\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(17):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Create new values based on neighboring cells\n                # This is a simple pattern that creates new values in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
