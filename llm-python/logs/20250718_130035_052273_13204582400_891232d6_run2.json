          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids to the output grids in the training examples. Let's look at the examples and see if I can spot any common transformations.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a lot of 7s and 0s. The output seems to replace some 7s with other numbers. For instance, in the first row of input, there's a 7 in position 3 and 8, and in the output, those positions are 7, but there's a 6 in position 17. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their neighbors or some other rule.\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has a line of 7s in the middle, and the output has those 7s replaced with other numbers. For example, in the input, the 5th row has 7s in positions 10-13, and the output has 7s in positions 10-13 but with some numbers replacing them. Wait, no, in the output of example 3, the 5th row (input row 5) is transformed into 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 7 7 7 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0. So the original 7s are being replaced with other numbers. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their neighbors, like if there's a 7 in a certain position, it's replaced with a specific number.\n\nAnother thing to note: The output grids have numbers like 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, etc. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their position or surrounding cells. For example, in example 3, the input has a 6 in the 24th row (row 23?), and the output has a 6 in the same position. But in other places, like the 23rd row of example 3's input, there's a 6 in position 5, and the output has a 6 in the same position. Wait, maybe the 6s are kept as is, but other numbers are replaced.\n\nLooking at example 4's input and output: The input has a 7 in position (5,6) and (6,5), and the output has 7s in those positions. But in the output, there's a 6 in position (17,5), which was 0 in the input. Hmm, maybe the transformation is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their value and position. For example, in example 3, the input has a line of 7s in the middle, and the output has those 7s replaced with other numbers. But in the output, there's a 7 in the same position. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nIn example 3's input, the 5th row (row index 4?) has 7s in positions 10-13. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 7 7 7 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0. So the 7s are in positions 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, etc. Wait, maybe the 7s are being replaced with other numbers, but some are kept. Maybe the pattern is that cells that are part of a certain shape are modified, but others are left as is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid-based rule. For example, replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For instance, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value.\n\nLooking at example 4's input and output: The input has a 7 in position (5,6) (assuming rows are 0-indexed), and the output has 7 in the same position. But in the output, there's a 6 in position (17,5), which was 0 in the input. So maybe the transformation is not just replacing numbers but based on some other criteria.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the transformation involves replacing numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, cells in certain positions are replaced with a specific value. For instance, in example 3, the output has a 6 in the bottom row (row 23?), which was 0 in the input. But in example 4, the input has a 6 in position (17,5), and the output has a 6 there. So maybe the 6s are kept, but other numbers are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 7 and has certain neighbors, it's replaced with a different number.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output: The first row of input is 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0. So the 6 is in position (0,16), which was 0 in the input. How does that relate to the input? Maybe that's a specific position that's being modified.\n\nLooking at example 3's output: The first row is all 0s, but in the input, it's all 0s. So maybe that's not the case. But in example 3's input, there's a line of 7s in the middle, and the output has those 7s replaced with other numbers. For example, in the input's row 5 (assuming 0-indexed), there's 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 8 7 7 7 2 0 2 0. So the 7s in positions 10-13 are replaced with 8 and 7s. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific number. But how to determine that?\n\nAnother idea: Looking at example 4's output. The input has a 7 in position (5,6) (row 5, column 6?), and the output has 7 there. But in the output, there's a 6 in position (17,5). So maybe the 6 is being added in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their position in the grid. For example, cells in certain rows or columns are replaced with specific values. For instance, in example 3, the output has 2s in certain positions. Maybe the 2s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 3's output, the first row is all 0s, but in the input, it's all 0s. So maybe that's not a pattern. But in example 3's output, the 2s are in certain positions. For example, in row 0, the output has 2s in positions 17 and 18. Wait, no, the first row of example 3's output is all 0s except for 6 and 2s? Wait, example 3's output first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0. So there are 6s in positions 16 and 19 (assuming 0-indexed). Maybe those positions are being modified based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding 7s. For example, if a cell has a certain number of 7s around it, it's replaced with a different number.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern where certain cells are being replaced with a specific value based on their position. For example, in example 3's output, the 6s are in positions that were previously 0s. Maybe the 6s are being added in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. For example, in example 3's output, the 6 is in the last row of the input, which was 0. But in example 4's output, the 6 is in the same position as the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid-based pattern, such as replacing numbers in certain positions with others. For example, in example 3, the output has 2s in certain positions. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the most common transformations between the examples. For example, in example 1, the output has a 6 in position (0,16). In example 3's output, there are 6s in positions that were previously 0. In example 4's output, there's a 6 in the same position as the input. So maybe the 6 is a fixed value that is added in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell. For example, if a cell is 7, it's replaced with another number, but if it's 0, it's replaced with another number. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd, then the cell is replaced with a certain value.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output: The input has a line of 7s in the middle, and the output has those 7s replaced with other numbers. For example, the input row 5 (assuming 0-indexed) has 7s in positions 10-13. The output for that row has 7s in positions 10-12 and 14, but some other numbers. Maybe this is a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is 7 and has certain neighbors, it's replaced with a different number.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find a clear pattern. However, given the examples, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the 6 is in position (0,16), which is the 17th column. Maybe that's a specific position that's being modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is 7 and is in a certain row, it's replaced with 8. Or if the cell is 0 and is in a certain row, it's replaced with 2.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at example 3's output, the 2s are in certain positions. For example, in the first row of the output, there are 2s in positions 17 and 18. But in the input, those positions were 0. Maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are part of certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and its position in the grid. For example, if a cell is 0 and is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is 7 and is in a certain row, it's replaced with 8, and if it's 0 and in a certain row, it's replaced with 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid pattern. For example, in example 3, the output has 2s in certain positions that form a line. Maybe the 2s are added in positions that are part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut given that the problem is to write a Python function that transforms the input to output, I need to find a pattern that can be implemented.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the most common transformations. For example, in example 1, the output has a 6 in position (0,16). In example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions. In example 4, the output has a 6 in the same position as the input. So maybe the 6 is a fixed value that is added in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's input, the output has a 6 in the last row (row 23?), which was 0 in the input. But in example 4's input, the 6 is in the same position as the input. So maybe the 6 is kept in some positions and modified in others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 7s in the cell's vicinity. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 7s, it's replaced with a different number.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. However, given the examples, I need to find a pattern that can be implemented.\n\nAnother observation: In example 3, the input has a line of 7s in the middle, and the output has those 7s replaced with other numbers. For example, in the input row 5 (assuming 0-indexed), there are 7s in positions 10-13. In the output, those positions are 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 2, etc. So maybe the 7s are being replaced with 8 in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if the cell is 7 and is in a certain column, it's replaced with 8.\n\nBut I need to find a way to code this.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at example 1's output, there's a 6 in position (0,16). In the input, that position was 0. Maybe that's a specific position that is being replaced with 6. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in row 0, column 16, it's replaced with 6. But that would be too specific and not generalizable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and its position. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine the exact pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in a row that has a certain number of 7s, it's replaced with a specific value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in row 0, it's replaced with 0. If it's in row 1, it's replaced with 0. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is 7 and is in a certain position, it's replaced with 8. If the cell is 0 and is in a certain position, it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven that I need to write a Python function that transforms the input grid to the output grid, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's output, there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 2s and 6s. For example, in the first row, positions 16 and 19 are 6. In the second row, positions 17 and 18 are 2. Maybe these positions are being modified based on their row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's row and column. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd, then the cell is replaced with a certain value.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAnother observation: In example 3's input, there's a line of 7s in the middle, and the output has those 7s replaced with other numbers. For example, the input's row 5 has 7s in positions 10-13, and the output has 7s in positions 10-12 and 14, but some other numbers. So maybe the 7s are being replaced with other numbers in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is 7 and is in a certain position, it's replaced with 8. If the cell is 0 and is in a certain position, it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is 7 and is in a certain row, it's replaced with 8. If the cell is 0 and is in a certain column, it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell has a 7 in its left or right, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of example 3. The input has a 6 in position (23,5), and the output has a 6 there. So maybe the 6s are kept. But in other examples, like example 1, there's a 6 in the output. So maybe the 6 is a fixed value that is added in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and its position in the grid. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nGiven that I need to write a function, perhaps the best approach is to look for patterns in the examples and try to code them.\n\nLooking at example 3's output, the first row has 6 in positions 16 and 19. The input for that row is all 0s. So maybe those positions are being replaced with 6. Similarly, in example 4's input, the 6 is in the same position as the output.\n\nIn example 1's output, the 6 is in position (0,16). So maybe that's a specific position that is being replaced with 6.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. For example, if the row is even, replace with 2, if the column is even, replace with 6, etc.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in a certain position, it's replaced with 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAnother observation: In example 3's output, the 2s appear in certain positions. For example, in the second row, there are 2s in positions 17 and 18. In the third row, there are 2s in positions 17 and 18. This suggests that certain positions are being replaced with 2s.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that cells in certain positions are replaced with specific values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, and (i + j) is even, then replace with 2, or something like that.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the first row, replace with 0. If it's in the second row, replace with 0, etc. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position and the value of the cell. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in a certain row or column, replace with 2. If the cell is 7 and is in a certain row or column, replace with 8.\n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's output, there are 2s in certain positions. For example, in the first row, positions 17 and 18 are 2. In the second row, positions 17 and 18 are 2. In the third row, positions 17 and 18 are 2. This suggests that cells in column 17 and 18 are being replaced with 2s. But in example 3's input, those positions were 0.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is based on the column number. For example, if the column is 17 or 18, replace with 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn example 1's output, there's a 6 in column 16. In example 3's output, there are 6s in column 16 and 19. So maybe columns 16, 17, 18, 19 are being replaced with certain values.\n\nBut this is getting too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, I need to code something that fits the examples.\n\nAnother idea: In example 3, the output has 2s in certain positions, which might be part of a pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, and i is even, replace with 2. Or if j is even, replace with 2.\n\nBut in example 3's input, the first row is all 0s, and the output has 2s in columns 17 and 18. So if the column is even, replace with 2. But 17 is odd, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in row 0, column 16, replace with 6. But this is too specific.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to find a pattern that can be coded.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output:\n\nInput row 5 (assuming 0-indexed) has 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 8 7 7 7 2 0 2 0. So the 7s in positions 10-13 are replaced with 8, 7, 7, 7. Then, in position 16, it's 2. So maybe this is a pattern where certain positions are replaced based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is 7 and is in a certain position, replace with 8. If the cell is 0 and is in a certain position, replace with 2.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is 7 and is in a certain row, replace with 8. If the cell is 0 and is in a certain column, replace with 2.\n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven that I need to write code, I'll try to implement a pattern that replaces certain values based on their position.\n\nFor example, in example 3, the output has 2s in certain positions. Let's say that if the cell is in column 17 or 18, replace with 2. And if the cell is in column 16, replace with 6.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in row 0 and column 16, replace with 6. If the cell is in row 0 and column 17, replace with 2. If the cell is in row 0 and column 18, replace with 2. If the cell is in row 0 and column 19, replace with 6.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and its position. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in a certain position, replace with 2. If the cell is 0 and is in another position, replace with 6.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess and implement a transformation that replaces certain cells with specific values based on their position.\n\nFor example, in example 3's output, the 2s are in positions where the column is 17 or 18. So perhaps, in the code, for each cell, if the column is 17 or 18, replace with 2. Similarly, for column 16, replace with 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's row and column. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, then replace with a certain value based on i and j.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at example 3's output, the 2s are in certain positions that form a line. For example, in the first row, positions 17 and 18 are 2. In the second row, positions 17 and 18 are 2. This suggests that cells in columns 17 and 18 are being replaced with 2. Similarly, in the third row, positions 17 and 18 are 2. So perhaps, in the code, for any cell in columns 17 or 18, replace with 2.\n\nBut this would not explain the 6 in example 3's output. However, in example 3's output, the last row has 6 in position 5 and 19. So maybe that's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in column 16, replace with 6. If the cell is in column 17 or 18, replace with 2. If the cell is in column 19, replace with 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain positions with specific values based on their column.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Replace certain positions with specific values\n    for i in range(28):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if j == 16:\n                transformed[i][j] = 6\n            elif j == 17 or j == 18:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n            elif j == 19:\n                transformed[i][j] = 6\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess and may not fit all examples.\n\nHowever, looking at example 3's input and output, this would replace the 0s in column 16 with 6, and columns 17 and 18 with 2, and column 19 with 6. But in example 3's input, the first row has 0s in column 16, and the output has 6 there. This fits.\n\nBut this is just for example 3. How about example 1?\n\nIn example 1's input, the first row has 0 in column 16. The output has 6 in that position. So this would fit.\n\nIn example 4's input, the 6 is in column 5, row 17. The output has 6 there, so this code would not replace it, but that's okay.\n\nBut this code would not handle other examples, like example 3's other positions. For example, in example 3's output, there are 2s in columns 17 and 18, which this code would handle. But what about other positions?\n\nThis is a possible approach, but I'm not sure if it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in column 16, replace with 6. If it's in column 17 or 18, replace with 2. If it's in column 19, replace with 6. This would explain some of the examples.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: In example 3's output, the 2s are in columns 17 and 18 for all rows. So this might be a pattern.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with this code and see if it fits the examples.\n\nBut this is just a guess. I'm not sure if this is the correct pattern, but it's the best I can come up with based on the examples.\n\nAnother possibility: The transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, and (i + j) is even, replace with 2. Or something like that.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the examples, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain positions with specific values based on their column. For example, columns 16, 17, 18, 19 are replaced with 6, 2, 2, 6 respectively. This may not be correct, but it's the best I can do given the time.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids to the output grids in the training examples. Let's look at the examples and see if I can spot any common transformations.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a lot of 7s and 0s. The output seems to replace some 7s with other numbers. For instance, in the first row of input, there's a 7 in position 3 and 8, and in the output, those positions are 7, but there's a 6 in position 17. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their neighbors or some other rule.\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has a line of 7s in the middle, and the output has those 7s replaced with other numbers. For example, in the input, the 5th row has 7s in positions 10-13, and the output has 7s in positions 10-13 but with some numbers replacing them. Wait, no, in the output of example 3, the 5th row (input row 5) is transformed into 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 7 7 7 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0. So the original 7s are being replaced with other numbers. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their neighbors, like if there's a 7 in a certain position, it's replaced with a specific number.\n\nAnother thing to note: The output grids have numbers like 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, etc. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their position or surrounding cells. For example, in example 3, the input has a 6 in the 24th row (row 23?), and the output has a 6 in the same position. But in other places, like the 23rd row of example 3's input, there's a 6 in position 5, and the output has a 6 in the same position. Wait, maybe the 6s are kept as is, but other numbers are replaced.\n\nLooking at example 4's input and output: The input has a 7 in position (5,6) and (6,5), and the output has 7s in those positions. But in the output, there's a 6 in position (17,5), which was 0 in the input. Hmm, maybe the transformation is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their value and position. For example, in example 3, the input has a line of 7s in the middle, and the output has those 7s replaced with other numbers. But in the output, there's a 7 in the same position. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nIn example 3's input, the 5th row (row index 4?) has 7s in positions 10-13. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 7 7 7 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0. So the 7s are in positions 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, etc. Wait, maybe the 7s are being replaced with other numbers, but some are kept. Maybe the pattern is that cells that are part of a certain shape are modified, but others are left as is.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid-based rule. For example, replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For instance, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value.\n\nLooking at example 4's input and output: The input has a 7 in position (5,6) (assuming rows are 0-indexed), and the output has 7 in the same position. But in the output, there's a 6 in position (17,5), which was 0 in the input. So maybe the transformation is not just replacing numbers but based on some other criteria.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the transformation involves replacing numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, cells in certain positions are replaced with a specific value. For instance, in example 3, the output has a 6 in the bottom row (row 23?), which was 0 in the input. But in example 4, the input has a 6 in position (17,5), and the output has a 6 there. So maybe the 6s are kept, but other numbers are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 7 and has certain neighbors, it's replaced with a different number.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output: The first row of input is 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0. So the 6 is in position (0,16), which was 0 in the input. How does that relate to the input? Maybe that's a specific position that's being modified.\n\nLooking at example 3's output: The first row is all 0s, but in the input, it's all 0s. So maybe that's not the case. But in example 3's input, there's a line of 7s in the middle, and the output has those 7s replaced with other numbers. For example, in the input's row 5 (assuming 0-indexed), there's 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 8 7 7 7 2 0 2 0. So the 7s in positions 10-13 are replaced with 8 and 7s. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific number. But how to determine that?\n\nAnother idea: Looking at example 4's output. The input has a 7 in position (5,6) (row 5, column 6?), and the output has 7 there. But in the output, there's a 6 in position (17,5). So maybe the 6 is being added in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their position in the grid. For example, cells in certain rows or columns are replaced with specific values. For instance, in example 3, the output has 2s in certain positions. Maybe the 2s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 3's output, the first row is all 0s, but in the input, it's all 0s. So maybe that's not a pattern. But in example 3's output, the 2s are in certain positions. For example, in row 0, the output has 2s in positions 17 and 18. Wait, no, the first row of example 3's output is all 0s except for 6 and 2s? Wait, example 3's output first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 6 0. So there are 6s in positions 16 and 19 (assuming 0-indexed). Maybe those positions are being modified based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding 7s. For example, if a cell has a certain number of 7s around it, it's replaced with a different number.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern where certain cells are being replaced with a specific value based on their position. For example, in example 3's output, the 6s are in positions that were previously 0s. Maybe the 6s are being added in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. For example, in example 3's output, the 6 is in the last row of the input, which was 0. But in example 4's output, the 6 is in the same position as the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid-based pattern, such as replacing numbers in certain positions with others. For example, in example 3, the output has 2s in certain positions. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the most common transformations between the examples. For example, in example 1, the output has a 6 in position (0,16). In example 3's output, there are 6s in positions that were previously 0. In example 4's output, there's a 6 in the same position as the input. So maybe the 6 is a fixed value that is added in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell. For example, if a cell is 7, it's replaced with another number, but if it's 0, it's replaced with another number. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd, then the cell is replaced with a certain value.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output: The input has a line of 7s in the middle, and the output has those 7s replaced with other numbers. For example, the input row 5 (assuming 0-indexed) has 7s in positions 10-13. The output for that row has 7s in positions 10-12 and 14, but some other numbers. Maybe this is a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is 7 and has certain neighbors, it's replaced with a different number.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find a clear pattern. However, given the examples, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the 6 is in position (0,16), which is the 17th column. Maybe that's a specific position that's being modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is 7 and is in a certain row, it's replaced with 8. Or if the cell is 0 and is in a certain row, it's replaced with 2.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at example 3's output, the 2s are in certain positions. For example, in the first row of the output, there are 2s in positions 17 and 18. But in the input, those positions were 0. Maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are part of certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and its position in the grid. For example, if a cell is 0 and is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is 7 and is in a certain row, it's replaced with 8, and if it's 0 and in a certain row, it's replaced with 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid pattern. For example, in example 3, the output has 2s in certain positions that form a line. Maybe the 2s are added in positions that are part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut given that the problem is to write a Python function that transforms the input to output, I need to find a pattern that can be implemented.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the most common transformations. For example, in example 1, the output has a 6 in position (0,16). In example 3, the output has 6s in certain positions. In example 4, the output has a 6 in the same position as the input. So maybe the 6 is a fixed value that is added in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's input, the output has a 6 in the last row (row 23?), which was 0 in the input. But in example 4's input, the 6 is in the same position as the input. So maybe the 6 is kept in some positions and modified in others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 7s in the cell's vicinity. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 7s, it's replaced with a different number.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. However, given the examples, I need to find a pattern that can be implemented.\n\nAnother observation: In example 3, the input has a line of 7s in the middle, and the output has those 7s replaced with other numbers. For example, in the input row 5 (assuming 0-indexed), there are 7s in positions 10-13. In the output, those positions are 7, 7, 8, 7, 7, 7, 2, etc. So maybe the 7s are being replaced with 8 in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if the cell is 7 and is in a certain column, it's replaced with 8.\n\nBut I need to find a way to code this.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at example 1's output, there's a 6 in position (0,16). In the input, that position was 0. Maybe that's a specific position that is being replaced with 6. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in row 0, column 16, it's replaced with 6. But that would be too specific and not generalizable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and its position. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine the exact pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in a row that has a certain number of 7s, it's replaced with a specific value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in row 0, it's replaced with 0. If it's in row 1, it's replaced with 0. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is 7 and is in a certain position, it's replaced with 8. If the cell is 0 and is in a certain position, it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven that I need to write a Python function that transforms the input grid to the output grid, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's output, there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 2s and 6s. For example, in the first row, positions 16 and 19 are 6. In the second row, positions 17 and 18 are 2. Maybe these positions are being modified based on their row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's row and column. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd, then the cell is replaced with a certain value.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAnother observation: In example 3's input, there's a line of 7s in the middle, and the output has those 7s replaced with other numbers. For example, the input's row 5 has 7s in positions 10-13, and the output has 7s in positions 10-12 and 14, but some other numbers. So maybe the 7s are being replaced with other numbers in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is 7 and is in a certain position, it's replaced with 8. If the cell is 0 and is in a certain position, it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is 7 and is in a certain row, it's replaced with 8. If the cell is 0 and is in a certain column, it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell has a 7 in its left or right, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of example 3. The input has a 6 in position (23,5), and the output has a 6 there. So maybe the 6s are kept. But in other examples, like example 1, there's a 6 in the output. So maybe the 6 is a fixed value that is added in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and its position in the grid. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nGiven that I need to write a function, perhaps the best approach is to look for patterns in the examples and try to code them.\n\nLooking at example 3's output, the first row has 6 in positions 16 and 19. The input for that row is all 0s. So maybe those positions are being replaced with 6. Similarly, in example 4's input, the 6 is in the same position as the output.\n\nIn example 1's output, the 6 is in position (0,16). So maybe that's a specific position that is being replaced with 6.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. For example, if the row is even, replace with 2, if the column is even, replace with 6, etc.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in a certain position, it's replaced with 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAnother observation: In example 3's output, the 2s appear in certain positions. For example, in the second row, there are 2s in positions 17 and 18. In the third row, there are 2s in positions 17 and 18. This suggests that certain positions are being replaced with 2s.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that cells in certain positions are replaced with specific values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, and (i + j) is even, then replace with 2, or something like that.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the first row, replace with 0. If it's in the second row, replace with 0, etc. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position and the value of the cell. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in a certain row or column, replace with 2. If the cell is 7 and is in a certain row or column, replace with 8.\n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's output, there are 2s in certain positions. For example, in the first row, positions 17 and 18 are 2. In the second row, positions 17 and 18 are 2. In the third row, positions 17 and 18 are 2. This suggests that cells in column 17 and 18 are being replaced with 2s. But in example 3's input, those positions were 0.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is based on the column number. For example, if the column is 17 or 18, replace with 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn example 1's output, there's a 6 in column 16. In example 3's output, there are 6s in column 16 and 19. So maybe columns 16, 17, 18, 19 are being replaced with certain values.\n\nBut this is getting too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, I need to code something that fits the examples.\n\nAnother idea: In example 3, the output has 2s in certain positions, which might be part of a pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, and i is even, replace with 2. Or if j is even, replace with 2.\n\nBut in example 3's input, the first row is all 0s, and the output has 2s in columns 17 and 18. So if the column is even, replace with 2. But 17 is odd, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in row 0, column 16, replace with 6. But this is too specific.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to find a pattern that can be coded.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output:\n\nInput row 5 (assuming 0-indexed) has 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 7 8 7 7 7 2 0 2 0. So the 7s in positions 10-13 are replaced with 8, 7, 7, 7. Then, in position 16, it's 2. So maybe this is a pattern where certain positions are replaced based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is 7 and is in a certain position, replace with 8. If the cell is 0 and is in a certain position, replace with 2.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is 7 and is in a certain row, replace with 8. If the cell is 0 and is in a certain column, replace with 2.\n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven that I need to write code, I'll try to implement a pattern that replaces certain values based on their position.\n\nFor example, in example 3, the output has 2s in certain positions. Let's say that if the cell is in column 17 or 18, replace with 2. And if the cell is in column 16, replace with 6.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in row 0 and column 16, replace with 6. If the cell is in row 0 and column 17, replace with 2. If the cell is in row 0 and column 18, replace with 2. If the cell is in row 0 and column 19, replace with 6.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and its position. For example, if the cell is 0 and is in a certain position, replace with 2. If the cell is 0 and is in another position, replace with 6.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll have to make an educated guess and implement a transformation that replaces certain cells with specific values based on their position.\n\nFor example, in example 3's output, the 2s are in positions where the column is 17 or 18. So perhaps, in the code, for each cell, if the column is 17 or 18, replace with 2. Similarly, for column 16, replace with 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's row and column. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, then replace with a certain value based on i and j.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at example 3's output, the 2s are in certain positions that form a line. For example, in the first row, positions 17 and 18 are 2. In the second row, positions 17 and 18 are 2. This suggests that cells in columns 17 and 18 are being replaced with 2. Similarly, in the third row, positions 17 and 18 are 2. So perhaps, in the code, for any cell in columns 17 or 18, replace with 2.\n\nBut this would not explain the 6 in example 3's output. However, in example 3's output, the last row has 6 in position 5 and 19. So maybe that's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in column 16, replace with 6. If the cell is in column 17 or 18, replace with 2. If the cell is in column 19, replace with 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain positions with specific values based on their column.\n\nFor example:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Replace certain positions with specific values\n    for i in range(28):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if j == 16:\n                transformed[i][j] = 6\n            elif j == 17 or j == 18:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n            elif j == 19:\n                transformed[i][j] = 6\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess and may not fit all examples.\n\nHowever, looking at example 3's input and output, this would replace the 0s in column 16 with 6, and columns 17 and 18 with 2, and column 19 with 6. But in example 3's input, the first row has 0s in column 16, and the output has 6 there. This fits.\n\nBut this is just for example 3. How about example 1?\n\nIn example 1's input, the first row has 0 in column 16. The output has 6 in that position. So this would fit.\n\nIn example 4's input, the 6 is in column 5, row 17. The output has 6 there, so this code would not replace it, but that's okay.\n\nBut this code would not handle other examples, like example 3's other positions. For example, in example 3's output, there are 2s in columns 17 and 18, which this code would handle. But what about other positions?\n\nThis is a possible approach, but I'm not sure if it's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in column 16, replace with 6. If it's in column 17 or 18, replace with 2. If it's in column 19, replace with 6. This would explain some of the examples.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: In example 3's output, the 2s are in columns 17 and 18 for all rows. So this might be a pattern.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with this code and see if it fits the examples.\n\nBut this is just a guess. I'm not sure if this is the correct pattern, but it's the best I can come up with based on the examples.\n\nAnother possibility: The transformation is based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, and (i + j) is even, replace with 2. Or something like that.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nIn conclusion, based on the examples, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain positions with specific values based on their column. For example, columns 16, 17, 18, 19 are replaced with 6, 2, 2, 6 respectively. This may not be correct, but it's the best I can do given the time.\n"
