          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids are transformed into the output grids. Let's start by analyzing each example.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput is a 11x11 grid. The output is a 5x5 grid. Wait, the input is 11 rows each with 11 elements? Wait, the input for example 1 is given as 11 lines, each with 11 numbers. But the output is 5x5. So the transformation is reducing the input grid to a 5x5 output. How?\n\nLooking at the output for example 1, the output rows are:\n\n0 8 0 6 0\n3 8 3 6 3\n0 8 0 6 0\n5 8 5 6 5\n0 8 0 6 0\n\nSo each row in the output has 5 elements. Let me think about how the input is being transformed. Let's look at the input rows. For example, the first input row is 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0. The output first row is 0 8 0 6 0. So maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input.\n\nLooking at the input rows for example 1, the 4th element (index 3) is 8, and the 9th element (index 8) is 6. So the output row is [0, 8, 0, 6, 0]. So maybe the output is taking elements from positions 3, 8, etc. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking every third element? Or maybe it's selecting specific positions. Let me check the input for example 1. The input rows are 11 rows. The output is 5 rows. So maybe the output is taking every 2nd row? Let's see:\n\nIn example 1, the output has 5 rows. The input has 11 rows. Let's see the output rows:\n\nRow 0: input rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4? No. Wait, the output has 5 rows. Let's check the input rows. The input for example 1 has 11 rows. The output is 5 rows. Maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input. For example, the first output row is from the first input row. But the output rows are 5, so maybe the output is taking every other row? Or perhaps the output is selecting rows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8? Let's check:\n\nIn example 1, the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: input row 0?\n\nRow 1: input row 1?\n\nRow 2: input row 2?\n\nRow 3: input row 6?\n\nRow 4: input row 8?\n\nWait, the output has 5 rows. The input has 11 rows. Let me check the input rows for example 1. The first 5 input rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 1: 3 3 3 8 3 3 3 3 6 3 3\nRow 2: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 6: 5 5 5 8 5 5 5 5 6 5 5\nRow 7: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\n\nThe output has 5 rows. The output rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0 6 0\nRow 1: 3 8 3 6 3\nRow 2: 0 8 0 6 0\nRow 3: 5 8 5 6 5\nRow 4: 0 8 0 6 0\n\nLooking at the input rows, the output rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 correspond to input rows 0, 1, 2, 6, 8? Or maybe rows 0, 1, 2, 6, 8? Let's see:\n\nRow 0 of output is from input row 0. The output row is [0, 8, 0, 6, 0]. Looking at input row 0: the 4th element (index 3) is 8, and the 9th element (index 8) is 6. So the output row is taking elements from positions 3, 8, but how?\n\nWait, the output row has 5 elements. Let me think about how the input is being transformed. For example, the input row is 11 elements. The output row is 5 elements. So maybe the output is taking every third element? Let's check:\n\nIn input row 0: elements are 0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,6,0,0. So positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n\nIf we take every third element starting from index 3: index 3 (8), then index 6 (0?), index 9 (0?), but that's not matching the output row. Wait the output row is 0,8,0,6,0. So maybe the output is taking elements at positions 3, 8, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input row. For example, in the first output row, the first element is 0 (from input row 0, position 0?), then 8 (position 3), then 0 (position 0?), then 6 (position 8), then 0 (position 0?).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 4th element (index 3) and the 9th element (index 8) from each input row, and then some other elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking every other element, but that doesn't fit. Let me think about the output for example 1. The output row is 0 8 0 6 0. So the first element is 0, then 8, then 0, then 6, then 0. So the pattern is 0, 8, 0, 6, 0. So maybe the output is taking elements from positions 0, 3, 6, 8, 10? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 4th element (index 3) and the 9th element (index 8) from the input row, and then inserting 0s in between. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput is 11 rows again. The output is 5x5. The output for example 2 is:\n\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n2 1 2 8 2 3 2\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n5 1 5 8 5 3 5\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n\nSo each output row is 7 elements. Wait, but the output is supposed to be 5x5. Wait, no. Wait the output for example 2 is 5 rows, each with 7 elements? Wait, the output given is:\n\nFor example 2, the output is:\n\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n2 1 2 8 2 3 2\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n5 1 5 8 5 3 5\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n\nBut that's 5 rows, each with 7 elements. But the problem says that the output must be a 5x5 grid. Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait the original problem says that the output must be a 5x5 grid. So for example 1, the output is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Let me check the example 1 output again. The output is:\n\n0 8 0 6 0\n3 8 3 6 3\n0 8 0 6 0\n5 8 5 6 5\n0 8 0 6 0\n\nYes, each row is 5 elements. So the example 2's output must be 5 rows of 5 elements each. But the example 2's output as written seems to have 7 elements per row. Wait, that can't be right. Wait maybe there's a mistake in the way the examples are presented. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn example 2, the output is given as:\n\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n2 1 2 8 2 3 2\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n5 1 5 8 5 3 5\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n\nBut this is 5 rows, each with 7 elements. But the output must be 5x5. That's a problem. Wait maybe there's a mistake in how the examples are presented. Alternatively, perhaps the output is not 5x5, but the problem says that the output must be 5x5. So perhaps the examples are presented in a way that the output is 5x5, but the way they are written is different. For example, maybe the output is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, but the way it's presented is split into parts. Wait, maybe the example 2's output is actually:\n\nEach output row is 5 elements. For example, the first line of example 2's output is \"0 1 0 8 0 3 0\" but that's 7 elements. That can't be. So perhaps there's a mistake in the way the examples are presented. Alternatively, maybe the output is 5x5, but the examples are written with some formatting that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are presented with the output as a 5x5 grid, but the way they are written is that each row is split into parts. For example, maybe in example 2, the output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0 8 0\nRow 1: 3 2 1 2 8\nWait, but that's not matching the given output. This is confusing. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn example 2, the output is given as:\n\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n2 1 2 8 2 3 2\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n5 1 5 8 5 3 5\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n\nBut that's 5 rows, each with 7 elements. But the output must be 5x5. This suggests that perhaps the examples are presented in a different way. Maybe the output is not 5x5 but the problem says that the output must be 5x5. So perhaps the examples are written in a way that the output is 5x5, but the way they are presented is that each row is split into parts. For example, maybe the output is 5 rows of 5 elements each, but in the example, it's written as 7 elements per row. That's impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, but given that the problem says that the output must be 5x5, I must assume that the examples are correct, but I'm misunderstanding their formatting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for example 2 is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Let me check again. For example, the output for example 2 is:\n\nThe first line is \"0 1 0 8 0 3 0\" \u2014 that's 7 elements. But that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the examples are not correctly formatted. Alternatively, maybe the output is 5x5, and the way the examples are presented is that each row is split into parts. For example, in example 2, the output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0 8 0 3 0 \u2192 but that's 7 elements. Wait, but the output must be 5x5. So maybe the output is 5x5, but in the examples, the output is written as a 7-element row. This is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the examples are presented with some formatting errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for example 2 is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, and the way they are written is that each row is split into parts. For example, maybe the first line is \"0 1 0 8 0\" and \"3 0\" \u2014 but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0 8 0\nRow 1: 3 2 1 2 8\nRow 2: 0 1 0 8 0\nRow 3: 5 1 5 8 5\nRow 4: 0 1 0 8 0\n\nBut that's not matching the given output. This is very confusing. However, given that the problem says that the output must be 5x5, I need to find a pattern that can explain the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input and output grids are 11x11, but the output is 5x5. How?\n\nLooking back at example 1:\n\nThe input is 11 rows, each with 11 elements. The output is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. So the transformation is from 11x11 to 5x5.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is [0, 8, 0, 6, 0]. Let's see how that is derived from the input row. The input row is 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0. The output is 0 8 0 6 0. So the output is taking the 4th element (index 3), then the 9th element (index 8), but how to get the 5 elements?\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking elements from certain positions in the input row. For example, the first element of the output is 0 (from input row's first element?), then the second element is 8 (from index 3), third is 0 (from index 0?), fourth is 6 (index 8), fifth is 0 (index 0 again). But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking every third element from the input row. For example, input row 0 has elements at positions 0, 3, 6, 9. But that would be 0, 8, 0, 6. But the output has 5 elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the elements at positions 0, 3, 6, 8, 10. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the elements at positions 3 and 8, and inserting 0s in between. For example, in the first output row, the elements are 0 (from position 0?), 8 (position 3), 0 (position 0?), 6 (position 8), 0 (position 0 again). That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the elements from the input row at positions 3 and 8, and then using those values to create a pattern. For example, the output row is [0, 8, 0, 6, 0], which is 0, 8, 0, 6, 0. So maybe the first and third elements are 0, the second is 8, the fourth is 6, and the fifth is 0. So the pattern is that the output row is constructed by taking the 4th element (index 3) and the 9th element (index 8) of the input row, and then inserting zeros in between. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 4th element (index 3) and the 9th element (index 8), and then for each output row, those two elements are placed in positions 1 and 3 of the output row, with zeros in the other positions. For example, the first output row would be [0, 8, 0, 6, 0], which is 0, 8, 0, 6, 0. So the 8 is at position 1, the 6 at position 3. But how to get that from the input row.\n\nBut then, how to get the other rows? For example, in example 1, the second output row is [3, 8, 3, 6, 3]. The input row is 3 3 3 8 3 3 3 3 6 3 3. So the 4th element is 8, the 9th is 6. So the output row is 3, 8, 3, 6, 3. So the first and third elements are 3, which are from the input row's first element (3), and the fifth element is 3. So maybe the output row is constructed by taking the first element of the input row, then the 4th element (8), then the first element again, then the 9th element (6), then the first element again. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the elements at positions 3 and 8 of the input row, and then for the output row, those are placed in positions 1 and 3, with zeros in between. But how to get the other elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the elements from the input row at positions 3 and 8, and then for the output row, those are the middle elements, with zeros in the other positions. But how to determine the other positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking every other element from the input row. For example, in example 1, the first input row is 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0. Taking every other element (positions 0, 2, 4, 6, 8) gives 0, 0, 0, 0, 6. But the output row is 0, 8, 0, 6, 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 4th element (index 3) and the 9th element (index 8) of the input row, and then for the output row, those are the second and fourth elements, with zeros in the other positions. So the output row would be [0, 8, 0, 6, 0]. That seems to fit the first output row. For the second output row, the input row is 3 3 3 8 3 3 3 3 6 3 3. So the 4th element is 8, 9th is 6. So the output row would be [3, 8, 3, 6, 3]. Which fits the second output row. Similarly for the third output row, which is the same as the first input row, so the output would be [0, 8, 0, 6, 0]. The fourth output row is from the input row 5 5 5 8 5 5 5 5 6 5 5. So the 4th element is 8, 9th is 6. So the output row is [5, 8, 5, 6, 5]. Which fits. And the fifth output row is the same as the first input row, so the same as the first output row.\n\nSo this suggests that the output row is constructed by taking the first element of the input row, then the 4th element (index 3), then the first element again, then the 9th element (index 8), then the first element again. But how to determine the first element. For example, in the second output row, the first element is 3 (from the input row's first element), then 8, then 3, then 6, then 3.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each input row, the output row is [first_element, 4th_element, first_element, 9th_element, first_element]. But why?\n\nBut how to determine which input rows are used to generate the output rows. For example, in example 1, the output has 5 rows. The input has 11 rows. So which input rows are being used for the output rows? The first output row is from input row 0, the second from row 1, third from row 2, fourth from row 6, fifth from row 8. Or maybe rows 0, 1, 2, 6, 8?\n\nLooking at the input rows, the first 5 rows are 0,1,2,3,4. Then rows 5,6,7,8,9,10. The output rows are 0,1,2,6,8. So maybe the output rows are selected from every other row, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first, second, third, sixth, and eighth rows of the input. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first, second, third, sixth, and eighth rows of the input, and then for each of these rows, the output is generated as described earlier.\n\nBut how to determine which input rows are being used for the output. For example, in example 1, the output has 5 rows. The input has 11 rows. So perhaps the output is taking the first three rows (0,1,2), then the sixth row (6), then the eighth row (8). So 0,1,2,6,8. That's 5 rows.\n\nBut why those rows? Maybe the output is taking the first three rows, then the sixth row, then the eighth row. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking every other row starting from row 0, but for some reason, the fourth output row is row 6, and the fifth is row 8. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the first three rows, then the sixth row, then the eighth row. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows at positions 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, which are the first three rows, then the sixth row (index 6), then the eighth row (index 8). That's 5 rows. So the pattern is that the output is taking every other row starting from row 0, but skipping some rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking rows 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, which are the first three rows, then the sixth row (which is row 6), then the eighth row (row 8). But how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first three rows, then the sixth row, then the eighth row. But why those rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first three rows, then the sixth row (which is row 6), then the eighth row (row 8), because those are the rows where the value at position 3 is 8 and position 8 is 6. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the first three rows, then the sixth row (which has a 5 in the first position), and then the eighth row (which has 0 in the first position). But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nBut given that the output for example 1 is 5 rows, and the input has 11 rows, perhaps the output is taking every other row starting from row 0, but for some reason, the fourth and fifth output rows are from row 6 and 8. But how to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first three rows (0,1,2), then the sixth row (6), then the eighth row (8). That's five rows. So the pattern is that the output is taking rows 0,1,2,6,8. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows where the fourth element is 8 and the ninth element is 6. For example, in example 1, the first three rows have 8 in the fourth element and 6 in the ninth. The sixth row has 8 in fourth element and 6 in ninth. The eighth row also has 8 in fourth and 6 in ninth. So those rows are selected.\n\nSo the output is taking the rows that have 8 at position 3 and 6 at position 8. Then, for each of those rows, the output row is constructed by taking the first element, then the fourth element (8), then the first element again, then the ninth element (6), then the first element again. So the output row is [first_element, 8, first_element, 6, first_element].\n\nBut how to determine which rows are selected. For example, in example 1, the first three rows (0,1,2) have 8 in position 3 and 6 in position 8. Then row 6 and row 8 also have 8 in position 3 and 6 in position 8. So the output is taking these five rows.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- For each row in the input, if the 4th element (index 3) is 8 and the 9th element (index 8) is 6, then include this row in the output.\n\nBut why are there five such rows in example 1?\n\nLooking at example 1's input rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 \u2192 yes, 8 at 3, 6 at 8.\n\nRow 1: 3 3 3 8 3 3 3 3 6 3 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 4: same as row 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 5: same as row 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 6: 5 5 5 8 5 5 5 5 6 5 5 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 7: same as row 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 8: same as row 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 9: same as row 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 10: same as row 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo rows 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 have 8 at position 3 and 6 at position 8. So why are the output rows only 5 rows? Because in example 1's output, there are 5 rows. So perhaps the output is taking the first three rows (0,1,2), then the sixth row (6), then the eighth row (8). But why those specific rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the first three rows (0,1,2), then the sixth row (6), then the eighth row (8), which are the first three rows, then the sixth, then the eighth. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking every other row starting from row 0, but skipping some rows. For example, rows 0,1,2,6,8. But why those rows?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look at example 2.\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 1 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: same as row 0.\n\nRow 3: 2 2 1 2 2 8 2 3 2 2 2\n\nRow 4: same as row 0.\n\nRow 5: same as row 0.\n\nRow 6: same as row 0.\n\nRow 7: same as row 0.\n\nRow 8: same as row 0.\n\nRow 9: 5 5 1 5 5 8 5 3 5 5 5\n\nRow 10: same as row 0.\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0 \u2192 but this is 7 elements. But the output should be 5x5. So maybe the output is 5 rows of 5 elements each. Let's assume that the output for example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0 8 0\n\nRow 1: 2 1 2 8 2\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 8 0\n\nRow 3: 5 1 5 8 5\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 8 0\n\nWhich would make sense. So the output rows are constructed by taking the first element, then the third element (index 2), then the first element again, then the sixth element (index 5), then the first element again. For example, row 0 of input is 0 0 1 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 0. The first element is 0, third element is 1, sixth element is 8, first element again is 0. So the output row is [0, 1, 0, 8, 0]. Which matches the first output row.\n\nSimilarly, row 3 of input is 2 2 1 2 2 8 2 3 2 2 2. The first element is 2, third is 1, sixth is 8, first is 2. So output row is [2, 1, 2, 8, 2]. Which matches the second output row.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each input row that has certain conditions, the output row is constructed by taking the first element, then the third element, then the first element, then the sixth element, then the first element. But why?\n\nBut how to determine which rows are selected for the output. In example 2, the output has 5 rows. The input has 11 rows. Let's see which rows are being used.\n\nThe output rows are:\n\nRow 0: from input row 0.\n\nRow 1: from input row 3.\n\nRow 2: from input row 0.\n\nRow 3: from input row 9.\n\nRow 4: from input row 0.\n\nSo the selected rows are 0, 3, 9. But that's three rows. But the output has 5 rows. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first three rows (0,1,2), then the fourth row (3), then the ninth row (9), and then the tenth row (10)? But that's five rows. But in example 2, the output is:\n\nRow 0: input row 0.\n\nRow 1: input row 3.\n\nRow 2: input row 0.\n\nRow 3: input row 9.\n\nRow 4: input row 0.\n\nBut this doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows where the third element (index 2) is 1 and the sixth element (index 5) is 8. For example, in input row 0: third element is 1, sixth is 8. So it is selected. Input row 3: third element is 1, sixth is 8. Input row 9: third element is 1, sixth is 8. Input rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 also have third element 1 and sixth 8? Let's check.\n\nRow 0: third element is 1 (index 2), sixth is 8 (index 5). Yes.\n\nRow 1: same as row 0. Yes.\n\nRow 2: same as row 0. Yes.\n\nRow 3: third element is 1, sixth is 8. Yes.\n\nRow 4: same as row 0. Yes.\n\nRow 5: same as row 0. Yes.\n\nRow 6: same as row 0. Yes.\n\nRow 7: same as row 0. Yes.\n\nRow 8: same as row 0. Yes.\n\nRow 9: third element is 1, sixth is 8. Yes.\n\nRow 10: same as row 0. Yes.\n\nSo there are 10 rows that meet the condition. But the output is 5 rows. So why are only five of them selected?\n\nPerhaps the output is taking the first three rows (0,1,2), then the fourth row (3), then the ninth row (9). But why those?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking every other row starting from row 0, but skipping some rows. For example, rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 9. But that's five rows.\n\nBut this is not clear. However, looking at example 2's output, the first three output rows are from input rows 0, 0, 0. Then row 1 is from input row 3, row 3 is from input row 9. This suggests that the output is taking rows that meet certain conditions, and the selection is based on their position in the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the first three rows (0,1,2), then the fourth row (3), then the ninth row (9). But why these specific rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows where the third element is 1 and the sixth element is 8, and then selecting every other row starting from row 0. For example, rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 9. But this is arbitrary.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's look at example 3.\n\nExample 3's input is 11 rows. The output is 5 rows of 3 elements each. Wait, the output for example 3 is:\n\n0 4 0\n\n3 4 3\n\n0 4 0\n\n8 8 8\n\n0 4 0\n\nSo each output row has 3 elements. But the output must be 5x5. Wait, this is impossible. So there must be a mistake in how I'm interpreting the examples. Maybe the output is 5 rows of 3 elements each, but the problem says that the output must be 5x5. This is very confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for example 3 is 5 rows of 3 elements each, but the problem statement says that the output must be 5x5. This suggests that there's a mistake in the examples, but given that the problem says the output must be 5x5, I need to find a pattern that fits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, but the examples are written in a way that the output rows are split into parts. For example, in example 3's output, the first row is 0 4 0, which could be part of a larger row. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for example 3 is 5 rows of 3 elements each, and the problem statement is wrong. But that's unlikely.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking back at example 1's output: for each selected input row, the output row is [first_element, 8, first_element, 6, first_element].\n\nIn example 2's output, for each selected input row, the output row is [first_element, third_element, first_element, sixth_element, first_element].\n\nIn example 3's output, the output rows are [0,4,0], [3,4,3], [0,4,0], [8,8,8], [0,4,0]. So for example, the first row is 0 4 0, which could be derived from the input row's first element (0), then the fourth element (4), then the first element (0). But how?\n\nIn example 3's input:\n\nThe first input row is 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output row is 0 4 0. So the first element is 0, then the fourth element (index 3) is 0, but the output is 0 4 0. Wait, this doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the fourth element (index 3), then the fourth element again, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions based on the input row's values.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the confusion with the examples, I need to find a general pattern that can explain the examples.\n\nAnother approach: the output is a 5x5 grid. Each output row is derived from the input rows. For example, in example 1, the output has 5 rows. The input has 11 rows. So perhaps the output is taking every other row starting from row 0, but for some reason, the fourth and fifth output rows are from row 6 and 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the first three rows, then the sixth row, then the eighth row. So rows 0,1,2,6,8. For example 1, this gives 5 rows.\n\nIn example 2, the output has 5 rows. The input has 11 rows. So perhaps the output is taking rows 0,3,9, and others. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the rows where the fourth element is 8 and the ninth element is 6 (example 1), or the third element is 1 and the sixth element is 8 (example 2), or the fourth element is 4 and the ninth element is 0 (example 3). But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have certain values at certain positions, and then for each such row, the output is constructed by taking the first element, then the element at position 3, then the first element again, then the element at position 8, then the first element again. This seems to fit example 1 and 2.\n\nBut in example 3, the input rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: same as row 0.\n\nRow 3: same as row 0.\n\nRow 4: 3 3 4 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nRow 5: same as row 0.\n\nRow 6: same as row 0.\n\nRow 7: same as row 0.\n\nRow 8: same as row 0.\n\nRow 9: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nRow 10: same as row 0.\n\nThe output for example 3 is:\n\n0 4 0\n\n3 4 3\n\n0 4 0\n\n8 8 8\n\n0 4 0\n\nSo for row 4 of input, the first element is 3, and the fourth element is 3 (index 3), but the output is 3 4 3. Wait, the fourth element is 3, but the output is 3 4 3. So this doesn't fit the pattern.\n\nBut in the output, the fourth row is 8 8 8, which comes from row 9 of input, which is 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8. So the first element is 8, the fourth element is 8, the ninth element is 8. But the output is 8 8 8. So perhaps the pattern is that for the output row, the elements are [first_element, fourth_element, first_element, ninth_element, first_element]. But in this case, for row 9 of input, the first element is 8, fourth is 8, ninth is 8. So the output row would be [8,8,8,8,8]. But the output for example 3 is [8,8,8], which is three elements. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut the output for example 3 is 5 rows of 3 elements each, which contradicts the requirement of 5x5. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the examples, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a pattern that can be applied to all examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLooking at all examples, it seems that the output is derived from certain positions in the input rows. For example, in example 1, the output row is [first_element, 8, first_element, 6, first_element]. In example 2, the output row is [first_element, third_element, first_element, sixth_element, first_element]. In example 3, the output row is [first_element, fourth_element, first_element, ...]. But this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the elements at positions 3 and 8 from the input row, and then using those values to create a pattern. For example, in example 1, the output row is [0, 8, 0, 6, 0], which is 0 (first element), 8 (position 3), 0 (first element), 6 (position 8), 0 (first element). Similarly, in example 2, the output row is [0, 1, 0, 8, 0], which is first element 0, third element 1, first element 0, sixth element 8, first element 0. But why third and sixth elements?\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is based on the positions of certain elements in the input row. For example, in example 1, the positions are 3 and 8. In example 2, the positions are 2 and 5. In example 3, the positions are 3 and 8.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are used.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the elements at positions 3 and 8, and for each output row, those are placed at positions 1 and 3 of the output row, with zeros in the other positions. For example, in example 1, the output row is [0, 8, 0, 6, 0], which has 8 at position 1 and 6 at position 3. So the other positions are zeros.\n\nBut how to determine the other positions. For example, in example 2, the output row is [0, 1, 0, 8, 0], which has 1 at position 1 and 8 at position 3. So this suggests that the positions are 1 and 3, but the input row's positions are 2 and 5.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should try to find a general pattern that can be applied to all examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nThe common thread seems to be that the output is derived from certain positions in the input row, and the output row is constructed by taking those values and inserting zeros in between.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the output row is [first_element, 8, first_element, 6, first_element]. In example 2, it's [first_element, third_element, first_element, sixth_element, first_element]. In example 3, it's [first_element, fourth_element, first_element, ...].\n\nBut how to determine which positions to use.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the elements at positions 3 and 8, and for the output row, those are placed at positions 1 and 3, with zeros in the other positions. But how to determine which input rows are selected.\n\nGiven that the output is 5x5, and the input is 11x11, perhaps the output is taking certain rows from the input, and for each of those rows, the output row is constructed as described.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Select certain rows from the input to form the output rows.\n\n2. For each selected input row, construct the output row by taking the first element, then the element at position 3, then the first element, then the element at position 8, then the first element.\n\nBut how to select the rows.\n\nLooking at example 1, the selected rows are 0,1,2,6,8.\n\nIn example 2, the selected rows are 0,3,9, and possibly others.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the selected rows are those where the fourth element is 8 and the ninth element is 6 (example 1), or where the third element is 1 and the sixth element is 8 (example 2), or where the fourth element is 4 and the ninth element is 0 (example 3).\n\nSo, the pattern is:\n\nFor each input row, if certain conditions are met (like the value at position 3 is 8 and position 8 is 6), then it is included in the output. Then, the output row is constructed by taking the first element, then the value at position 3, then the first element again, then the value at position 8, then the first element again.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are selected.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the selected rows are those where position 3 is 8 and position 8 is 6. In example 2, the selected rows are those where position 2 is 1 and position 5 is 8. In example 3, the selected rows are those where position 3 is 4 and position 8 is 0.\n\nBut this is inconsistent. However, this might be the pattern.\n\nSo, the general approach would be:\n\n- For each input row, check if certain conditions are met (like specific values at specific positions).\n\n- If so, include this row in the output.\n\n- For each such row, construct the output row by taking the first element, then the value at position 3, then the first element, then the value at position 8, then the first element.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to check and which values to look for.\n\nLooking at example 1, the condition is position 3 is 8 and position 8 is 6.\n\nIn example 2, the condition is position 2 is 1 and position 5 is 8.\n\nIn example 3, the condition is position 3 is 4 and position 8 is 0.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. However, this might be the pattern.\n\nSo, the code would need to:\n\n1. For each input row, check if certain conditions are met (like position 3 is 8 and position 8 is 6, or other conditions based on the example).\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is that the fourth element is 8 and the ninth element is 6, and the first element is 0, 3, or 5, etc. But this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis:\n\nThe output is derived from certain input rows, and for each such row, the output row is constructed by taking the first element, then the element at position 3, then the first element, then the element at position 8, then the first element.\n\nThe selected input rows are those where the fourth element is 8 and the ninth element is 6 (example 1), or where the third element is 1 and the sixth element is 8 (example 2), or where the fourth element is 4 and the ninth element is 0 (example 3).\n\nBut this is not general enough. However, for the purpose of writing code, I'll assume that the selected rows are those where the fourth element is 8 and the ninth element is 6, and then construct the output row as described.\n\nBut this would not explain example 2 and 3. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- Iterate over each row in the input grid.\n\n- For each row, check if the fourth element (index 3) is 8 and the ninth element (index 8) is 6.\n\n- If so, include this row in the output.\n\n- For each such row, construct the output row as [row[0], row[3], row[0], row[8], row[0]].\n\nBut this would generate the output for example 1, but not for example 2.\n\nBut given that the problem requires a solution, I'll proceed with this approach, even if it's not perfect.\n\nNow, looking at the test input:\n\nTest input is:\n\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n6 6 6 6 6 2 6 7 6 6 4 6 6\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 2 1 7 1 1 4 1 1\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 7 8 8 4 8 8\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n\nSo each row has 13 elements. Wait, the input for the test is 12 rows, each with 13 elements. The output must be 5x5.\n\nSo, according to the previous hypothesis, the code would select rows where the fourth element (index 3) is 8 and the ninth element (index 8) is 6. Let's check:\n\nFor example, the fourth row of the test input is 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 7 6 6 4 6 6. The fourth element is 6, so it would not be selected.\n\nThe seventh row is 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 7 1 1 4 1 1. The fourth element is 1, so not selected.\n\nThe tenth row is 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 7 8 8 4 8 8. The fourth element is 8, the ninth element is 8. So it would not be selected (since the ninth element is 8, not 6).\n\nSo this approach would not select any rows for the test input, which is not correct.\n\nThis suggests that my hypothesis is wrong.\n\nGiven this, I need to think of a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: the output for example 1 is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. The input has 11 rows. The output rows are derived from certain rows of the input.\n\nLooking at example 1, the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: input row 0.\n\nRow 1: input row 1.\n\nRow 2: input row 2.\n\nRow 3: input row 6.\n\nRow 4: input row 8.\n\nSo the selected rows are 0,1,2,6,8.\n\nThese rows are at indices 0, 1, 2, 6, 8.\n\nSo the pattern is to select rows 0,1,2,6,8.\n\nSimilarly, in example 2, the output rows are 0,3,9, and others. But how?\n\nIn example 2, the output has 5 rows. The input has 11 rows. The selected rows are 0,3,9, and possibly others.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are selected.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the selected rows are the first three rows, then the sixth row, then the eighth row.\n\nIn example 2, the selected rows are the first row, the fourth row, the ninth row, and others.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the selected rows are those where the row index is even or odd.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the selected rows are the first three rows, then the sixth row, then the eighth row.\n\nIn example 1, this gives 5 rows.\n\nIn example 2, perhaps the selected rows are 0,3,9, and others.\n\nBut how to determine.\n\nAnother approach: the output is a 5x5 grid. Each row of the output is derived from a single row of the input. So, the number of rows in the output is 5, so the input must have at least 5 rows that are selected.\n\nIn example 1, the selected rows are 0,1,2,6,8.\n\nIn example 2, the selected rows are 0,3,9, and possibly others.\n\nBut how to determine.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the selected rows are 0,1,2,6,8. These are rows 0-2, then 6, then 8.\n\nIn example 2, the selected rows are 0,3,9, and others. For example, the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: input row 0.\n\nRow 1: input row 3.\n\nRow 2: input row 0.\n\nRow 3: input row 9.\n\nRow 4: input row 0.\n\nSo this suggests that the selected rows are 0,3,9, and possibly others.\n\nBut this is not consistent.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide a solution, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis:\n\nThe output is derived from the first three rows of the input, then the sixth row, then the eighth row. For each of these rows, the output row is constructed by taking the first element, then the fourth element, then the first element, then the ninth element, then the first element.\n\nThis would explain example 1.\n\nFor example 2, the selected rows are 0,3,9, and possibly others. But this is not clear.\n\nBut for the test input, let's see:\n\nThe test input has 12 rows. The selected rows would be 0,1,2,6,8.\n\nLet's check:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0 \u2192 fourth element is 0, ninth is 2. So not selected.\n\nRow 1: same as row 0. Not selected.\n\nRow 2: same as row 0. Not selected.\n\nRow 6: 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 7 1 1 4 1 1 \u2192 fourth element is 1, ninth is 1. Not selected.\n\nRow 8: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 7 8 8 4 8 8 \u2192 fourth element is 8, ninth is 8. Not selected.\n\nSo this would not work.\n\nThis suggests that my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time, I'll have to make a best guess based on the examples.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output rows are derived from rows where the fourth element is 8 and the ninth is 6. In example 2, the output rows are derived from rows where the third element is 1 and the sixth is 8. In example 3, the output rows are derived from rows where the fourth element is 4 and the ninth is 0.\n\nSo, the pattern is that the output is derived from rows where certain positions have specific values. For example, in example 1, it's position 3 and 8, in example 2, position 2 and 5, in example 3, position 3 and 8.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to use.\n\nAnother approach: the output is a 5x5 grid, and each row in the output is derived from a single row in the input. For each input row, the output row is constructed by taking certain positions.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the output row is [0, 8, 0, 6, 0], which is derived from the input row's positions 0, 3, 0, 8, 0.\n\nIn example 2, the output row is [0, 1, 0, 8, 0], derived from positions 0, 2, 0, 5, 0.\n\nIn example 3, the output row is [0, 4, 0], derived from positions 0, 3, 0.\n\nBut the output must be 5x5. So perhaps the output rows are derived from certain positions in the input rows, and the output is a 5x5 grid where each row is derived from a single input row.\n\nBut how to determine which input rows are selected.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nFor each input row, if the fourth element is 8 and the ninth element is 6, then include this row in the output, and construct the output row as [row[0], row[3], row[0], row[8], row[0]].\n\nThis would work for example 1, but not for example 2 and 3.\n\nBut since the problem requires a solution, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = []\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        if i % 2 == 0:  # this is a guess\n            row = grid[i]\n            if row[3] == 8 and row[8] == 6:\n                output_row = [row[0], row[3], row[0], row[8], row[0]]\n                output.append(output_row)\n    return output\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, this would not work for example 2.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this approach, even though it may not be correct for all examples.\n\nBut the test input may not fit this pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the selected rows are those where the fourth element is 8 and the ninth is 6, and the first element is 0, 3, or 5, etc.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code, which selects rows where the fourth element is 8 and the ninth is 6, and constructs the output row as described.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, this is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids are transformed into the output grids. Let's start by analyzing each example.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput is a 11x11 grid. The output is a 5x5 grid. Wait, the input is 11 rows each with 11 elements? Wait, the input for example 1 is given as 11 lines, each with 11 numbers. But the output is 5x5. So the transformation is reducing the input grid to a 5x5 output. How?\n\nLooking at the output for example 1, the output rows are:\n\n0 8 0 6 0\n3 8 3 6 3\n0 8 0 6 0\n5 8 5 6 5\n0 8 0 6 0\n\nSo each row in the output has 5 elements. Let me think about how the input is being transformed. Let's look at the input rows. For example, the first input row is 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0. The output first row is 0 8 0 6 0. So maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input.\n\nLooking at the input rows for example 1, the 4th element (index 3) is 8, and the 9th element (index 8) is 6. So the output row is [0, 8, 0, 6, 0]. So maybe the output is taking elements from positions 3, 8, etc. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking every third element? Or maybe it's selecting specific positions. Let me check the input for example 1. The input rows are 11 rows. The output is 5 rows. So maybe the output is taking every 2nd row? Let's see:\n\nIn example 1, the output has 5 rows. The input has 11 rows. Let's see the output rows:\n\nRow 0: input rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4? No. Wait, the output has 5 rows. Let's check the input rows. The input for example 1 has 11 rows. The output is 5 rows. Maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input. For example, the first output row is from the first input row. But the output rows are 5, so maybe the output is taking every other row? Or perhaps the output is selecting rows 0, 2, 4, 6, 8? Let's check:\n\nIn example 1, the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: input row 0?\n\nRow 1: input row 1?\n\nRow 2: input row 2?\n\nRow 3: input row 6?\n\nRow 4: input row 8?\n\nWait, the output has 5 rows. The input has 11 rows. Let me check the input rows for example 1. The first 5 input rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 1: 3 3 3 8 3 3 3 3 6 3 3\nRow 2: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 6: 5 5 5 8 5 5 5 5 6 5 5\nRow 7: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0\n\nThe output has 5 rows. The output rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0 6 0\nRow 1: 3 8 3 6 3\nRow 2: 0 8 0 6 0\nRow 3: 5 8 5 6 5\nRow 4: 0 8 0 6 0\n\nLooking at the input rows, the output rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 correspond to input rows 0, 1, 2, 6, 8? Or maybe rows 0, 1, 2, 6, 8? Let's see:\n\nRow 0 of output is from input row 0. The output row is [0, 8, 0, 6, 0]. Looking at input row 0: the 4th element (index 3) is 8, and the 9th element (index 8) is 6. So the output row is taking elements from positions 3, 8, but how?\n\nWait, the output row has 5 elements. Let me think about how the input is being transformed. For example, the input row is 11 elements. The output row is 5 elements. So maybe the output is taking every third element? Let's check:\n\nIn input row 0: elements are 0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,6,0,0. So positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.\n\nIf we take every third element starting from index 3: index 3 (8), then index 6 (0?), index 9 (0?), but that's not matching the output row. Wait the output row is 0,8,0,6,0. So maybe the output is taking elements at positions 3, 8, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input row. For example, in the first output row, the first element is 0 (from input row 0, position 0?), then 8 (position 3), then 0 (position 0?), then 6 (position 8), then 0 (position 0?).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 4th element (index 3) and the 9th element (index 8) from each input row, and then some other elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking every other element, but that doesn't fit. Let me think about the output for example 1. The output row is 0 8 0 6 0. So the first element is 0, then 8, then 0, then 6, then 0. So the pattern is 0, 8, 0, 6, 0. So maybe the output is taking elements from positions 0, 3, 6, 8, 10? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 4th element (index 3) and the 9th element (index 8) from the input row, and then inserting 0s in between. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput is 11 rows again. The output is 5x5. The output for example 2 is:\n\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n2 1 2 8 2 3 2\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n5 1 5 8 5 3 5\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n\nSo each output row is 7 elements. Wait, but the output is supposed to be 5x5. Wait, no. Wait the output for example 2 is 5 rows, each with 7 elements? Wait, the output given is:\n\nFor example 2, the output is:\n\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n2 1 2 8 2 3 2\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n5 1 5 8 5 3 5\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n\nBut that's 5 rows, each with 7 elements. But the problem says that the output must be a 5x5 grid. Wait, that's a contradiction. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait the original problem says that the output must be a 5x5 grid. So for example 1, the output is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Let me check the example 1 output again. The output is:\n\n0 8 0 6 0\n3 8 3 6 3\n0 8 0 6 0\n5 8 5 6 5\n0 8 0 6 0\n\nYes, each row is 5 elements. So the example 2's output must be 5 rows of 5 elements each. But the example 2's output as written seems to have 7 elements per row. Wait, that can't be right. Wait maybe there's a mistake in the way the examples are presented. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn example 2, the output is given as:\n\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n2 1 2 8 2 3 2\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n5 1 5 8 5 3 5\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n\nBut this is 5 rows, each with 7 elements. But the output must be 5x5. That's a problem. Wait maybe there's a mistake in how the examples are presented. Alternatively, perhaps the output is not 5x5, but the problem says that the output must be 5x5. So perhaps the examples are presented in a way that the output is 5x5, but the way they are written is different. For example, maybe the output is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, but the way it's presented is split into parts. Wait, maybe the example 2's output is actually:\n\nEach output row is 5 elements. For example, the first line of example 2's output is \"0 1 0 8 0 3 0\" but that's 7 elements. That can't be. So perhaps there's a mistake in the way the examples are presented. Alternatively, maybe the output is 5x5, but the examples are written with some formatting that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are presented with the output as a 5x5 grid, but the way they are written is that each row is split into parts. For example, maybe in example 2, the output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0 8 0\nRow 1: 3 2 1 2 8\nWait, but that's not matching the given output. This is confusing. Let me re-examine the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nIn example 2, the output is given as:\n\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n2 1 2 8 2 3 2\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n5 1 5 8 5 3 5\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0\n\nBut that's 5 rows, each with 7 elements. But the output must be 5x5. This suggests that perhaps the examples are presented in a different way. Maybe the output is not 5x5 but the problem says that the output must be 5x5. So perhaps the examples are written in a way that the output is 5x5, but the way they are presented is that each row is split into parts. For example, maybe the output is 5 rows of 5 elements each, but in the example, it's written as 7 elements per row. That's impossible. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, but given that the problem says that the output must be 5x5, I must assume that the examples are correct, but I'm misunderstanding their formatting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for example 2 is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Let me check again. For example, the output for example 2 is:\n\nThe first line is \"0 1 0 8 0 3 0\" \u2014 that's 7 elements. But that's impossible. Therefore, perhaps the examples are not correctly formatted. Alternatively, maybe the output is 5x5, and the way the examples are presented is that each row is split into parts. For example, in example 2, the output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0 8 0 3 0 \u2192 but that's 7 elements. Wait, but the output must be 5x5. So maybe the output is 5x5, but in the examples, the output is written as a 7-element row. This is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the examples are presented with some formatting errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for example 2 is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, and the way they are written is that each row is split into parts. For example, maybe the first line is \"0 1 0 8 0\" and \"3 0\" \u2014 but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0 8 0\nRow 1: 3 2 1 2 8\nRow 2: 0 1 0 8 0\nRow 3: 5 1 5 8 5\nRow 4: 0 1 0 8 0\n\nBut that's not matching the given output. This is very confusing. However, given that the problem says that the output must be 5x5, I need to find a pattern that can explain the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input and output grids are 11x11, but the output is 5x5. How?\n\nLooking back at example 1:\n\nThe input is 11 rows, each with 11 elements. The output is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. So the transformation is from 11x11 to 5x5.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is [0, 8, 0, 6, 0]. Let's see how that is derived from the input row. The input row is 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0. The output is 0 8 0 6 0. So the output is taking the 4th element (index 3), then the 9th element (index 8), but how to get the 5 elements?\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking elements from certain positions in the input row. For example, the first element of the output is 0 (from input row's first element?), then the second element is 8 (from index 3), third is 0 (from index 0?), fourth is 6 (index 8), fifth is 0 (index 0 again). But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking every third element from the input row. For example, input row 0 has elements at positions 0, 3, 6, 9. But that would be 0, 8, 0, 6. But the output has 5 elements. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the elements at positions 0, 3, 6, 8, 10. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the elements at positions 3 and 8, and inserting 0s in between. For example, in the first output row, the elements are 0 (from position 0?), 8 (position 3), 0 (position 0?), 6 (position 8), 0 (position 0 again). That seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the elements from the input row at positions 3 and 8, and then using those values to create a pattern. For example, the output row is [0, 8, 0, 6, 0], which is 0, 8, 0, 6, 0. So maybe the first and third elements are 0, the second is 8, the fourth is 6, and the fifth is 0. So the pattern is that the output row is constructed by taking the 4th element (index 3) and the 9th element (index 8) of the input row, and then inserting zeros in between. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 4th element (index 3) and the 9th element (index 8), and then for each output row, those two elements are placed in positions 1 and 3 of the output row, with zeros in the other positions. For example, the first output row would be [0, 8, 0, 6, 0], which is 0, 8, 0, 6, 0. So the 8 is at position 1, the 6 at position 3. But how to get that from the input row.\n\nBut then, how to get the other rows? For example, in example 1, the second output row is [3, 8, 3, 6, 3]. The input row is 3 3 3 8 3 3 3 3 6 3 3. So the 4th element is 8, the 9th is 6. So the output row is 3, 8, 3, 6, 3. So the first and third elements are 3, which are from the input row's first element (3), and the fifth element is 3. So maybe the output row is constructed by taking the first element of the input row, then the 4th element (8), then the first element again, then the 9th element (6), then the first element again. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the elements at positions 3 and 8 of the input row, and then for the output row, those are placed in positions 1 and 3, with zeros in between. But how to get the other elements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the elements from the input row at positions 3 and 8, and then for the output row, those are the middle elements, with zeros in the other positions. But how to determine the other positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking every other element from the input row. For example, in example 1, the first input row is 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0. Taking every other element (positions 0, 2, 4, 6, 8) gives 0, 0, 0, 0, 6. But the output row is 0, 8, 0, 6, 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the 4th element (index 3) and the 9th element (index 8) of the input row, and then for the output row, those are the second and fourth elements, with zeros in the other positions. So the output row would be [0, 8, 0, 6, 0]. That seems to fit the first output row. For the second output row, the input row is 3 3 3 8 3 3 3 3 6 3 3. So the 4th element is 8, 9th is 6. So the output row would be [3, 8, 3, 6, 3]. Which fits the second output row. Similarly for the third output row, which is the same as the first input row, so the output would be [0, 8, 0, 6, 0]. The fourth output row is from the input row 5 5 5 8 5 5 5 5 6 5 5. So the 4th element is 8, 9th is 6. So the output row is [5, 8, 5, 6, 5]. Which fits. And the fifth output row is the same as the first input row, so the same as the first output row.\n\nSo this suggests that the output row is constructed by taking the first element of the input row, then the 4th element (index 3), then the first element again, then the 9th element (index 8), then the first element again. But how to determine the first element. For example, in the second output row, the first element is 3 (from the input row's first element), then 8, then 3, then 6, then 3.\n\nSo the pattern is: for each input row, the output row is [first_element, 4th_element, first_element, 9th_element, first_element]. But why?\n\nBut how to determine which input rows are used to generate the output rows. For example, in example 1, the output has 5 rows. The input has 11 rows. So which input rows are being used for the output rows? The first output row is from input row 0, the second from row 1, third from row 2, fourth from row 6, fifth from row 8. Or maybe rows 0, 1, 2, 6, 8?\n\nLooking at the input rows, the first 5 rows are 0,1,2,3,4. Then rows 5,6,7,8,9,10. The output rows are 0,1,2,6,8. So maybe the output rows are selected from every other row, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first, second, third, sixth, and eighth rows of the input. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first, second, third, sixth, and eighth rows of the input, and then for each of these rows, the output is generated as described earlier.\n\nBut how to determine which input rows are being used for the output. For example, in example 1, the output has 5 rows. The input has 11 rows. So perhaps the output is taking the first three rows (0,1,2), then the sixth row (6), then the eighth row (8). So 0,1,2,6,8. That's 5 rows.\n\nBut why those rows? Maybe the output is taking the first three rows, then the sixth row, then the eighth row. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking every other row starting from row 0, but for some reason, the fourth output row is row 6, and the fifth is row 8. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the first three rows, then the sixth row, then the eighth row. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows at positions 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, which are the first three rows, then the sixth row (index 6), then the eighth row (index 8). That's 5 rows. So the pattern is that the output is taking every other row starting from row 0, but skipping some rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking rows 0, 1, 2, 6, 8, which are the first three rows, then the sixth row (which is row 6), then the eighth row (row 8). But how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first three rows, then the sixth row, then the eighth row. But why those rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first three rows, then the sixth row (which is row 6), then the eighth row (row 8), because those are the rows where the value at position 3 is 8 and position 8 is 6. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the first three rows, then the sixth row (which has a 5 in the first position), and then the eighth row (which has 0 in the first position). But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nBut given that the output for example 1 is 5 rows, and the input has 11 rows, perhaps the output is taking every other row starting from row 0, but for some reason, the fourth and fifth output rows are from row 6 and 8. But how to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first three rows (0,1,2), then the sixth row (6), then the eighth row (8). That's five rows. So the pattern is that the output is taking rows 0,1,2,6,8. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows where the fourth element is 8 and the ninth element is 6. For example, in example 1, the first three rows have 8 in the fourth element and 6 in the ninth. The sixth row has 8 in fourth element and 6 in ninth. The eighth row also has 8 in fourth and 6 in ninth. So those rows are selected.\n\nSo the output is taking the rows that have 8 at position 3 and 6 at position 8. Then, for each of those rows, the output row is constructed by taking the first element, then the fourth element (8), then the first element again, then the ninth element (6), then the first element again. So the output row is [first_element, 8, first_element, 6, first_element].\n\nBut how to determine which rows are selected. For example, in example 1, the first three rows (0,1,2) have 8 in position 3 and 6 in position 8. Then row 6 and row 8 also have 8 in position 3 and 6 in position 8. So the output is taking these five rows.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- For each row in the input, if the 4th element (index 3) is 8 and the 9th element (index 8) is 6, then include this row in the output.\n\nBut why are there five such rows in example 1?\n\nLooking at example 1's input rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 \u2192 yes, 8 at 3, 6 at 8.\n\nRow 1: 3 3 3 8 3 3 3 3 6 3 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 4: same as row 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 5: same as row 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 6: 5 5 5 8 5 5 5 5 6 5 5 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 7: same as row 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 8: same as row 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 9: same as row 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nRow 10: same as row 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo rows 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 have 8 at position 3 and 6 at position 8. So why are the output rows only 5 rows? Because in example 1's output, there are 5 rows. So perhaps the output is taking the first three rows (0,1,2), then the sixth row (6), then the eighth row (8). But why those specific rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the first three rows (0,1,2), then the sixth row (6), then the eighth row (8), which are the first three rows, then the sixth, then the eighth. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking every other row starting from row 0, but skipping some rows. For example, rows 0,1,2,6,8. But why those rows?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look at example 2.\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 1 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: same as row 0.\n\nRow 3: 2 2 1 2 2 8 2 3 2 2 2\n\nRow 4: same as row 0.\n\nRow 5: same as row 0.\n\nRow 6: same as row 0.\n\nRow 7: same as row 0.\n\nRow 8: same as row 0.\n\nRow 9: 5 5 1 5 5 8 5 3 5 5 5\n\nRow 10: same as row 0.\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 1 0 8 0 3 0 \u2192 but this is 7 elements. But the output should be 5x5. So maybe the output is 5 rows of 5 elements each. Let's assume that the output for example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 0 8 0\n\nRow 1: 2 1 2 8 2\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 8 0\n\nRow 3: 5 1 5 8 5\n\nRow 4: 0 1 0 8 0\n\nWhich would make sense. So the output rows are constructed by taking the first element, then the third element (index 2), then the first element again, then the sixth element (index 5), then the first element again. For example, row 0 of input is 0 0 1 0 0 8 0 3 0 0 0. The first element is 0, third element is 1, sixth element is 8, first element again is 0. So the output row is [0, 1, 0, 8, 0]. Which matches the first output row.\n\nSimilarly, row 3 of input is 2 2 1 2 2 8 2 3 2 2 2. The first element is 2, third is 1, sixth is 8, first is 2. So output row is [2, 1, 2, 8, 2]. Which matches the second output row.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: for each input row that has certain conditions, the output row is constructed by taking the first element, then the third element, then the first element, then the sixth element, then the first element. But why?\n\nBut how to determine which rows are selected for the output. In example 2, the output has 5 rows. The input has 11 rows. Let's see which rows are being used.\n\nThe output rows are:\n\nRow 0: from input row 0.\n\nRow 1: from input row 3.\n\nRow 2: from input row 0.\n\nRow 3: from input row 9.\n\nRow 4: from input row 0.\n\nSo the selected rows are 0, 3, 9. But that's three rows. But the output has 5 rows. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first three rows (0,1,2), then the fourth row (3), then the ninth row (9), and then the tenth row (10)? But that's five rows. But in example 2, the output is:\n\nRow 0: input row 0.\n\nRow 1: input row 3.\n\nRow 2: input row 0.\n\nRow 3: input row 9.\n\nRow 4: input row 0.\n\nBut this doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows where the third element (index 2) is 1 and the sixth element (index 5) is 8. For example, in input row 0: third element is 1, sixth is 8. So it is selected. Input row 3: third element is 1, sixth is 8. Input row 9: third element is 1, sixth is 8. Input rows 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 also have third element 1 and sixth 8? Let's check.\n\nRow 0: third element is 1 (index 2), sixth is 8 (index 5). Yes.\n\nRow 1: same as row 0. Yes.\n\nRow 2: same as row 0. Yes.\n\nRow 3: third element is 1, sixth is 8. Yes.\n\nRow 4: same as row 0. Yes.\n\nRow 5: same as row 0. Yes.\n\nRow 6: same as row 0. Yes.\n\nRow 7: same as row 0. Yes.\n\nRow 8: same as row 0. Yes.\n\nRow 9: third element is 1, sixth is 8. Yes.\n\nRow 10: same as row 0. Yes.\n\nSo there are 10 rows that meet the condition. But the output is 5 rows. So why are only five of them selected?\n\nPerhaps the output is taking the first three rows (0,1,2), then the fourth row (3), then the ninth row (9). But why those?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking every other row starting from row 0, but skipping some rows. For example, rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 9. But that's five rows.\n\nBut this is not clear. However, looking at example 2's output, the first three output rows are from input rows 0, 0, 0. Then row 1 is from input row 3, row 3 is from input row 9. This suggests that the output is taking rows that meet certain conditions, and the selection is based on their position in the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the first three rows (0,1,2), then the fourth row (3), then the ninth row (9). But why these specific rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows where the third element is 1 and the sixth element is 8, and then selecting every other row starting from row 0. For example, rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 9. But this is arbitrary.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Let's look at example 3.\n\nExample 3's input is 11 rows. The output is 5 rows of 3 elements each. Wait, the output for example 3 is:\n\n0 4 0\n\n3 4 3\n\n0 4 0\n\n8 8 8\n\n0 4 0\n\nSo each output row has 3 elements. But the output must be 5x5. Wait, this is impossible. So there must be a mistake in how I'm interpreting the examples. Maybe the output is 5 rows of 3 elements each, but the problem says that the output must be 5x5. This is very confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for example 3 is 5 rows of 3 elements each, but the problem statement says that the output must be 5x5. This suggests that there's a mistake in the examples, but given that the problem says the output must be 5x5, I need to find a pattern that fits.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, but the examples are written in a way that the output rows are split into parts. For example, in example 3's output, the first row is 0 4 0, which could be part of a larger row. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for example 3 is 5 rows of 3 elements each, and the problem statement is wrong. But that's unlikely.\n\nThis is very confusing. Let me try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking back at example 1's output: for each selected input row, the output row is [first_element, 8, first_element, 6, first_element].\n\nIn example 2's output, for each selected input row, the output row is [first_element, third_element, first_element, sixth_element, first_element].\n\nIn example 3's output, the output rows are [0,4,0], [3,4,3], [0,4,0], [8,8,8], [0,4,0]. So for example, the first row is 0 4 0, which could be derived from the input row's first element (0), then the fourth element (4), then the first element (0). But how?\n\nIn example 3's input:\n\nThe first input row is 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output row is 0 4 0. So the first element is 0, then the fourth element (index 3) is 0, but the output is 0 4 0. Wait, this doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the fourth element (index 3), then the fourth element again, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions based on the input row's values.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the confusion with the examples, I need to find a general pattern that can explain the examples.\n\nAnother approach: the output is a 5x5 grid. Each output row is derived from the input rows. For example, in example 1, the output has 5 rows. The input has 11 rows. So perhaps the output is taking every other row starting from row 0, but for some reason, the fourth and fifth output rows are from row 6 and 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the first three rows, then the sixth row, then the eighth row. So rows 0,1,2,6,8. For example 1, this gives 5 rows.\n\nIn example 2, the output has 5 rows. The input has 11 rows. So perhaps the output is taking rows 0,3,9, and others. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the rows where the fourth element is 8 and the ninth element is 6 (example 1), or the third element is 1 and the sixth element is 8 (example 2), or the fourth element is 4 and the ninth element is 0 (example 3). But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the rows that have certain values at certain positions, and then for each such row, the output is constructed by taking the first element, then the element at position 3, then the first element again, then the element at position 8, then the first element again. This seems to fit example 1 and 2.\n\nBut in example 3, the input rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: same as row 0.\n\nRow 3: same as row 0.\n\nRow 4: 3 3 4 3 3 3 3 3 3\n\nRow 5: same as row 0.\n\nRow 6: same as row 0.\n\nRow 7: same as row 0.\n\nRow 8: same as row 0.\n\nRow 9: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nRow 10: same as row 0.\n\nThe output for example 3 is:\n\n0 4 0\n\n3 4 3\n\n0 4 0\n\n8 8 8\n\n0 4 0\n\nSo for row 4 of input, the first element is 3, and the fourth element is 3 (index 3), but the output is 3 4 3. Wait, the fourth element is 3, but the output is 3 4 3. So this doesn't fit the pattern.\n\nBut in the output, the fourth row is 8 8 8, which comes from row 9 of input, which is 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8. So the first element is 8, the fourth element is 8, the ninth element is 8. But the output is 8 8 8. So perhaps the pattern is that for the output row, the elements are [first_element, fourth_element, first_element, ninth_element, first_element]. But in this case, for row 9 of input, the first element is 8, fourth is 8, ninth is 8. So the output row would be [8,8,8,8,8]. But the output for example 3 is [8,8,8], which is three elements. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut the output for example 3 is 5 rows of 3 elements each, which contradicts the requirement of 5x5. So this suggests that there's a mistake in the examples, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to look for a pattern that can be applied to all examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLooking at all examples, it seems that the output is derived from certain positions in the input rows. For example, in example 1, the output row is [first_element, 8, first_element, 6, first_element]. In example 2, the output row is [first_element, third_element, first_element, sixth_element, first_element]. In example 3, the output row is [first_element, fourth_element, first_element, ...]. But this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the elements at positions 3 and 8 from the input row, and then using those values to create a pattern. For example, in example 1, the output row is [0, 8, 0, 6, 0], which is 0 (first element), 8 (position 3), 0 (first element), 6 (position 8), 0 (first element). Similarly, in example 2, the output row is [0, 1, 0, 8, 0], which is first element 0, third element 1, first element 0, sixth element 8, first element 0. But why third and sixth elements?\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is based on the positions of certain elements in the input row. For example, in example 1, the positions are 3 and 8. In example 2, the positions are 2 and 5. In example 3, the positions are 3 and 8.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are used.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the elements at positions 3 and 8, and for each output row, those are placed at positions 1 and 3 of the output row, with zeros in the other positions. For example, in example 1, the output row is [0, 8, 0, 6, 0], which has 8 at position 1 and 6 at position 3. So the other positions are zeros.\n\nBut how to determine the other positions. For example, in example 2, the output row is [0, 1, 0, 8, 0], which has 1 at position 1 and 8 at position 3. So this suggests that the positions are 1 and 3, but the input row's positions are 2 and 5.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent, perhaps I should try to find a general pattern that can be applied to all examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nThe common thread seems to be that the output is derived from certain positions in the input row, and the output row is constructed by taking those values and inserting zeros in between.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the output row is [first_element, 8, first_element, 6, first_element]. In example 2, it's [first_element, third_element, first_element, sixth_element, first_element]. In example 3, it's [first_element, fourth_element, first_element, ...].\n\nBut how to determine which positions to use.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the elements at positions 3 and 8, and for the output row, those are placed at positions 1 and 3, with zeros in the other positions. But how to determine which input rows are selected.\n\nGiven that the output is 5x5, and the input is 11x11, perhaps the output is taking certain rows from the input, and for each of those rows, the output row is constructed as described.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Select certain rows from the input to form the output rows.\n\n2. For each selected input row, construct the output row by taking the first element, then the element at position 3, then the first element, then the element at position 8, then the first element.\n\nBut how to select the rows.\n\nLooking at example 1, the selected rows are 0,1,2,6,8.\n\nIn example 2, the selected rows are 0,3,9, and possibly others.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the selected rows are those where the fourth element is 8 and the ninth element is 6 (example 1), or where the third element is 1 and the sixth element is 8 (example 2), or where the fourth element is 4 and the ninth element is 0 (example 3).\n\nSo, the pattern is:\n\nFor each input row, if certain conditions are met (like the value at position 3 is 8 and position 8 is 6), then it is included in the output. Then, the output row is constructed by taking the first element, then the value at position 3, then the first element again, then the value at position 8, then the first element again.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are selected.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the selected rows are those where position 3 is 8 and position 8 is 6. In example 2, the selected rows are those where position 2 is 1 and position 5 is 8. In example 3, the selected rows are those where position 3 is 4 and position 8 is 0.\n\nBut this is inconsistent. However, this might be the pattern.\n\nSo, the general approach would be:\n\n- For each input row, check if certain conditions are met (like specific values at specific positions).\n\n- If so, include this row in the output.\n\n- For each such row, construct the output row by taking the first element, then the value at position 3, then the first element, then the value at position 8, then the first element.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to check and which values to look for.\n\nLooking at example 1, the condition is position 3 is 8 and position 8 is 6.\n\nIn example 2, the condition is position 2 is 1 and position 5 is 8.\n\nIn example 3, the condition is position 3 is 4 and position 8 is 0.\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. However, this might be the pattern.\n\nSo, the code would need to:\n\n1. For each input row, check if certain conditions are met (like position 3 is 8 and position 8 is 6, or other conditions based on the example).\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the condition is that the fourth element is 8 and the ninth element is 6, and the first element is 0, 3, or 5, etc. But this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis:\n\nThe output is derived from certain input rows, and for each such row, the output row is constructed by taking the first element, then the element at position 3, then the first element, then the element at position 8, then the first element.\n\nThe selected input rows are those where the fourth element is 8 and the ninth element is 6 (example 1), or where the third element is 1 and the sixth element is 8 (example 2), or where the fourth element is 4 and the ninth element is 0 (example 3).\n\nBut this is not general enough. However, for the purpose of writing code, I'll assume that the selected rows are those where the fourth element is 8 and the ninth element is 6, and then construct the output row as described.\n\nBut this would not explain example 2 and 3. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- Iterate over each row in the input grid.\n\n- For each row, check if the fourth element (index 3) is 8 and the ninth element (index 8) is 6.\n\n- If so, include this row in the output.\n\n- For each such row, construct the output row as [row[0], row[3], row[0], row[8], row[0]].\n\nBut this would generate the output for example 1, but not for example 2.\n\nBut given that the problem requires a solution, I'll proceed with this approach, even if it's not perfect.\n\nNow, looking at the test input:\n\nTest input is:\n\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n6 6 6 6 6 2 6 7 6 6 4 6 6\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 2 1 7 1 1 4 1 1\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 7 8 8 4 8 8\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0\n\nSo each row has 13 elements. Wait, the input for the test is 12 rows, each with 13 elements. The output must be 5x5.\n\nSo, according to the previous hypothesis, the code would select rows where the fourth element (index 3) is 8 and the ninth element (index 8) is 6. Let's check:\n\nFor example, the fourth row of the test input is 6 6 6 6 6 2 6 7 6 6 4 6 6. The fourth element is 6, so it would not be selected.\n\nThe seventh row is 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 7 1 1 4 1 1. The fourth element is 1, so not selected.\n\nThe tenth row is 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 7 8 8 4 8 8. The fourth element is 8, the ninth element is 8. So it would not be selected (since the ninth element is 8, not 6).\n\nSo this approach would not select any rows for the test input, which is not correct.\n\nThis suggests that my hypothesis is wrong.\n\nGiven this, I need to think of a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: the output for example 1 is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. The input has 11 rows. The output rows are derived from certain rows of the input.\n\nLooking at example 1, the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: input row 0.\n\nRow 1: input row 1.\n\nRow 2: input row 2.\n\nRow 3: input row 6.\n\nRow 4: input row 8.\n\nSo the selected rows are 0,1,2,6,8.\n\nThese rows are at indices 0, 1, 2, 6, 8.\n\nSo the pattern is to select rows 0,1,2,6,8.\n\nSimilarly, in example 2, the output rows are 0,3,9, and others. But how?\n\nIn example 2, the output has 5 rows. The input has 11 rows. The selected rows are 0,3,9, and possibly others.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are selected.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the selected rows are the first three rows, then the sixth row, then the eighth row.\n\nIn example 2, the selected rows are the first row, the fourth row, the ninth row, and others.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the selected rows are those where the row index is even or odd.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the selected rows are the first three rows, then the sixth row, then the eighth row.\n\nIn example 1, this gives 5 rows.\n\nIn example 2, perhaps the selected rows are 0,3,9, and others.\n\nBut how to determine.\n\nAnother approach: the output is a 5x5 grid. Each row of the output is derived from a single row of the input. So, the number of rows in the output is 5, so the input must have at least 5 rows that are selected.\n\nIn example 1, the selected rows are 0,1,2,6,8.\n\nIn example 2, the selected rows are 0,3,9, and possibly others.\n\nBut how to determine.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the selected rows are 0,1,2,6,8. These are rows 0-2, then 6, then 8.\n\nIn example 2, the selected rows are 0,3,9, and others. For example, the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: input row 0.\n\nRow 1: input row 3.\n\nRow 2: input row 0.\n\nRow 3: input row 9.\n\nRow 4: input row 0.\n\nSo this suggests that the selected rows are 0,3,9, and possibly others.\n\nBut this is not consistent.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide a solution, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis:\n\nThe output is derived from the first three rows of the input, then the sixth row, then the eighth row. For each of these rows, the output row is constructed by taking the first element, then the fourth element, then the first element, then the ninth element, then the first element.\n\nThis would explain example 1.\n\nFor example 2, the selected rows are 0,3,9, and possibly others. But this is not clear.\n\nBut for the test input, let's see:\n\nThe test input has 12 rows. The selected rows would be 0,1,2,6,8.\n\nLet's check:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 3 0 0 2 0 7 0 0 4 0 0 \u2192 fourth element is 0, ninth is 2. So not selected.\n\nRow 1: same as row 0. Not selected.\n\nRow 2: same as row 0. Not selected.\n\nRow 6: 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 7 1 1 4 1 1 \u2192 fourth element is 1, ninth is 1. Not selected.\n\nRow 8: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 7 8 8 4 8 8 \u2192 fourth element is 8, ninth is 8. Not selected.\n\nSo this would not work.\n\nThis suggests that my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time, I'll have to make a best guess based on the examples.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output rows are derived from rows where the fourth element is 8 and the ninth is 6. In example 2, the output rows are derived from rows where the third element is 1 and the sixth is 8. In example 3, the output rows are derived from rows where the fourth element is 4 and the ninth is 0.\n\nSo, the pattern is that the output is derived from rows where certain positions have specific values. For example, in example 1, it's position 3 and 8, in example 2, position 2 and 5, in example 3, position 3 and 8.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to use.\n\nAnother approach: the output is a 5x5 grid, and each row in the output is derived from a single row in the input. For each input row, the output row is constructed by taking certain positions.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the output row is [0, 8, 0, 6, 0], which is derived from the input row's positions 0, 3, 0, 8, 0.\n\nIn example 2, the output row is [0, 1, 0, 8, 0], derived from positions 0, 2, 0, 5, 0.\n\nIn example 3, the output row is [0, 4, 0], derived from positions 0, 3, 0.\n\nBut the output must be 5x5. So perhaps the output rows are derived from certain positions in the input rows, and the output is a 5x5 grid where each row is derived from a single input row.\n\nBut how to determine which input rows are selected.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nFor each input row, if the fourth element is 8 and the ninth element is 6, then include this row in the output, and construct the output row as [row[0], row[3], row[0], row[8], row[0]].\n\nThis would work for example 1, but not for example 2 and 3.\n\nBut since the problem requires a solution, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = []\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        if i % 2 == 0:  # this is a guess\n            row = grid[i]\n            if row[3] == 8 and row[8] == 6:\n                output_row = [row[0], row[3], row[0], row[8], row[0]]\n                output.append(output_row)\n    return output\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, this would not work for example 2.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this approach, even though it may not be correct for all examples.\n\nBut the test input may not fit this pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the selected rows are those where the fourth element is 8 and the ninth is 6, and the first element is 0, 3, or 5, etc.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code, which selects rows where the fourth element is 8 and the ninth is 6, and constructs the output row as described.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, this is the best I can do.\n"
