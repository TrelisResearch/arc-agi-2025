          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nFirst, Example 1's input is a 24x24 grid (since each line has 24 numbers, and there are 24 rows). The output is a 4x4 grid. So the transformation reduces the size from 24x24 to 4x4. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nThe output is 4 rows. Let's see the input. The input has 24 rows, but maybe the output is derived by some kind of selection or processing of specific regions. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input grid.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1:\nRow 0: 0 0 1 1\nRow 1: 0 1 1 1\nRow 2: 1 1 1 0\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the output is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are selected. For instance, maybe the output is determined by the positions of 1s in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is determined by some calculation based on the input grid's cells. For example, maybe each cell in the output is the sum of certain cells in the input, or some other operation.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has some 2s and 3s, and the output is a 5x5 grid (since the output is 5 rows). Wait, the output for Example 2 is 5 rows. Wait, the output for Example 2 is:\n\n0 0 0 2 0\n0 2 2 2 0\n2 0 2 0 2\n0 2 2 0 0\n\nSo that's 4 rows? Wait, no, the output is written as 4 lines, each with 5 elements. Wait, the output for Example 2 is 4 rows of 5 elements each. So the output is 4x5? But the problem says the output must be 4x4. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 4x4. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: \"Your transformation must always produce a 4\u00d74 output grid.\"\n\nWait, the first example's output is 4x4. The second example's output is written as 4 lines, each with 5 elements. Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output:\n\nThe output is written as:\n\n0 0 0 2 0\n0 2 2 2 0\n2 0 2 0 2\n0 2 2 0 0\n\nBut that's 4 rows, each with 5 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 4x4. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe the output is 4x4, but the way it's presented here is a mistake. Or maybe the example is wrong. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 4x4. So maybe the example is presented with a typo, but the actual output is 4x4. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Your transformation must always produce a 4\u00d74 output grid.\" So the output must be 4x4. But in Example 2's output, the output is written as 4 rows of 5 elements. That seems conflicting. Maybe that's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the output is 4x5, but the problem says 4x4. That's confusing. But perhaps the examples are correct, and the output is 4x4. Let me check the actual examples again.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n\nWhich is 4 rows, each with 4 elements. So 4x4. That's correct. For Example 2, the output is:\n\n0 0 0 2 0\n0 2 2 2 0\n2 0 2 0 2\n0 2 2 0 0\n\nBut that's 4 rows with 5 elements each. That would be 4x5. But the problem says output must be 4x4. That's a contradiction. Wait, maybe the output for Example 2 is actually 4x4. Maybe the output is written with a typo. Let me check the problem's example again.\n\nLooking at the problem's Example 2's output:\n\nThe output is written as:\n\n0 0 0 2 0\n0 2 2 2 0\n2 0 2 0 2\n0 2 2 0 0\n\nBut that's 4 rows of 5 elements. But according to the problem, the output must be 4x4. So this seems like a mistake. However, the problem says that the test input is given for context. Maybe the examples are correct, and the output is 4x4. But in Example 2, the output is 4x5. That's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are presented with a mistake. Maybe the output for Example 2 is actually 4x4. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the output must be 4x4. So the examples must be correct. So perhaps the output for Example 2 is 4x4. Let me re-examine the output. Maybe the output is written with a typo. For example, maybe the output for Example 2 is:\n\n0 0 0 2\n0 2 2 2\n2 0 2 0\n0 2 2 0\n\nWhich would be 4x4. But the problem says that the output is written as 5 elements per row. That's confusing. But since the problem says that the output must be 4x4, perhaps the examples are correct and there's a mistake in the way the output is presented. But this is a problem for me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are correct, but the output is 4x4. For example, in Example 2, maybe the output is 4x4, and the 5 elements per row is a mistake. For example, maybe the output for Example 2 is:\n\n0 0 0 2\n0 2 2 2\n2 0 2 0\n0 2 2 0\n\nWhich is 4x4. Then the output would be correct. But the problem's example shows 5 elements per row. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 4x4, but the examples are presented in a way that's not correct. But given that the problem says the output must be 4x4, I have to proceed under that assumption.\n\nNow, looking back at the examples, perhaps the transformation is based on some pattern. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input grid. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x4. The input is 24x24. So perhaps the output is formed by taking a subset of the input grid. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking every 6th row and column. Because 24 divided by 6 is 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where certain values are present. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x4. Let's look at the input and output.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first few rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 13: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 14: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 15: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 16: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 17: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 18: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 19: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 20: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 21: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 22: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 23: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is 4x4. Let's see what the output is. The output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 1 1\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 1\n\nRow 2: 1 1 1 0\n\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions. For example, perhaps the output is formed by taking every 6th row and column. Let's see:\n\nThe input is 24x24. 24 divided by 6 is 4. So if we take rows 0, 6, 12, 18 (every 6th row) and columns 0, 6, 12, 18 (every 6th column), then the output would be 4x4. Let's check:\n\nFor row 0 of the output, it would be the values at (0,0), (0,6), (0,12), (0,18). But looking at the input row 0, the values at positions 0, 6, 12, 18 are:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo positions 0, 6, 12, 18: 0, 0, 0, 0. But the output row 0 is 0 0 1 1. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values. For example, the output might be based on the positions of 1s in the input. Let's look at the output of Example 1.\n\nThe output is 4x4. Let's see the positions of 1s in the input. For example, in the input, there are some regions where 1s are arranged in certain patterns. Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of these 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if the corresponding input cell is 1, and 0 otherwise. But that would not explain the output of Example 1. For example, the output row 0 is 0 0 1 1. So in the input, the cells at positions (row, col) that are 1 in the output would be those in the input's 1s.\n\nBut how to map the input to the output? For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's 1s in certain regions and then creating a 4x4 grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a grid that represents the positions of these 1s in a certain way. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input in a certain area, and 0 otherwise.\n\nBut this is getting a bit vague. Let's look at the output of Example 1 again. The output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 1 1\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 1\n\nRow 2: 1 1 1 0\n\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in certain regions. For example, the output is a 4x4 grid, where each cell represents whether there is a 1 in the input in a certain area. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's 1s in the regions that are in the middle of the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell corresponds to a certain region in the input. For example, the output is formed by grouping the input into 4x4 blocks and taking the sum or some other statistic.\n\nBut the input is 24x24. If we divide it into 4x4 blocks, each block would be 6x6. So 24/6=4. So maybe each output cell is the sum of a 6x6 block in the input. Let's check that.\n\nFor example, the first output cell (0,0) would be the sum of the 6x6 block starting at (0,0). But in the input, the first row is all 0s except for the 4th element (index 3) which is 1. So the sum would be 1. But the output cell (0,0) is 0. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the maximum value in each 6x6 block. For example, the first block would have a maximum of 1, but the output cell (0,0) is 0. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a grid that represents the positions of these 1s in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there is at least one 1 in the corresponding 6x6 block of the input. For example, the output cell (0,0) would be 1 if there's a 1 in the top-left 6x6 block. But in the input, the top-left 6x6 block has some 1s. For example, row 1 has 1s from columns 1-5. So the sum would be 1. But the output cell (0,0) is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look at Example 3's input and output.\n\nExample 3's input is a 24x24 grid, and the output is 4x4. The output is:\n\n3 0 0 0 0 0 3\n0 3 0 3 0 3 0\n0 0 3 3 3 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n\nWait, but the output is supposed to be 4x4. Wait, the output is written as 5 rows? Or maybe the output is 4x4. Let me check the problem statement again. The problem says that the output must be 4x4. So the example 3's output is written as 4 rows, each with 7 elements. That's conflicting. But perhaps there's a mistake in the way the output is presented.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 4x4, and the example's output is written with a mistake. For example, maybe the output is:\n\n3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 3\n0 0 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\nWhich would be 4x4. That would make sense. But the problem's example shows more elements. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 4x4, and the examples are written with some typos. Let's proceed under the assumption that the output is 4x4.\n\nNow, looking at the outputs of the examples, perhaps the transformation involves taking certain positions from the input grid. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x4. The input is 24x24. So maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 1, and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input in a certain area.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the output seems to have a pattern of 1s forming a sort of diamond shape. Maybe the output is based on the positions of the input's 1s in certain areas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding region. For example, the output cell (i,j) is 1 if the input has a 1 in a certain region.\n\nBut how to determine which regions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then mapping them to a 4x4 grid based on their positions. For example, if the input has a 1 in row i and column j, then the output cell (i//6, j//6) is set to 1. But this would be for a 24x24 input divided into 6x6 blocks. Let's check for Example 1.\n\nFor example, the input's row 1 has 1s from columns 1-5. So for row 1, columns 1-5, the output cell (1//6, 1//6) is (0,0). But the output's (0,0) is 0. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is the count of 1s in a certain 6x6 block. But in Example 1's output, the first row is 0 0 1 1. So perhaps the first two cells are 0, the next two are 1. That would suggest that the first two 6x6 blocks have 0 1s, and the next two have 1.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block. For example, the output cell (i,j) is 1 if the input's 6x6 block starting at (i*6, j*6) has at least one 1. But in Example 1, let's see:\n\nThe output is 4x4. So for each output cell (i,j), we check if the input's 6x6 block starting at (i*6, j*6) has any 1s.\n\nFor example, output cell (0,0) corresponds to the block from (0,0) to (5,5). Looking at the input, in row 1, columns 1-5 are 1s. So this block has 1s. So output cell (0,0) should be 1, but the output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of the 1s in the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block. But this doesn't fit the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if the input has a 1 in a certain diagonal or pattern.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the output seems to have a pattern where the 1s form a sort of diamond shape. Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a grid where each cell is 1 if the input has a 1 in a certain area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input in a certain row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a grid where each cell is 1 if the input has a 1 in a certain area. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then mapping them to the output grid based on their positions.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's 1s and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if the input has a 1 in the corresponding row and column of the output. For example, the output cell (i,j) is 1 if the input has a 1 in row i*6 + something and column j*6 + something.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the output is 4x4. The input is 24x24. So perhaps the output is formed by taking every 6th row and every 6th column, and then taking the values at those positions. For example, the output is formed by taking the values at rows 0, 6, 12, 18 and columns 0, 6, 12, 18. But in the input, those positions are all 0s, but the output has 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the values at rows 1, 7, 13, 19 and columns 1, 7, 13, 19. Let's check:\n\nRow 1, column 1: 1 (from input row 1, column 1 is 1). Row 1, column 7: 0. Row 1, column 13: 0. Row 1, column 19: 0. So the first row of the output would be 1, 0, 0, 0. But the output is 0 0 1 1. So that doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Perhaps I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, which is 4x4 (assuming that the example is correct), and the input has 2s and 3s. The output seems to have a pattern where certain regions are filled with 2s and 3s. For example, the output for Example 2 is:\n\n0 0 0 2 0\n0 2 2 2 0\n2 0 2 0 2\n0 2 2 0 0\n\nBut assuming that it's 4x4, maybe it's:\n\n0 0 0 2\n0 2 2 2\n2 0 2 0\n0 2 2 0\n\nThis would make sense. The output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 2s and 3s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 2 if there's a 2 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input in a certain area. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input in a certain 6x6 block.\n\nBut how to determine which block corresponds to which output cell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if the input has a 1 in the corresponding row and column of the output.\n\nFor example, the output cell (i,j) is 1 if the input has a 1 at (i*6 + something, j*6 + something).\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding row and column.\n\nBut again, this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the output is:\n\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n\nThis looks like a pattern where the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s in certain regions. For example, the output is a 4x4 grid where the 1s form a sort of diamond shape.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's input, the 1s are in certain regions. For example, rows 1-3 have 1s in certain columns. The output seems to represent these 1s in a way that is compressed into a 4x4 grid.\n\nPerhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if the input has a 1 in the corresponding 6x6 block.\n\nLet me try this for Example 1.\n\nFor output cell (i,j), it's 1 if the input's 6x6 block starting at (i*6, j*6) has at least one 1.\n\nFor example:\n\nOutput cell (0,0) corresponds to the block from (0,0) to (5,5). In this block, there are 1s (like in row 1, columns 1-5). So this block has 1s, so output cell (0,0) would be 1. But the output cell (0,0) is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block, but only if the block is in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if the input has a 1 in the corresponding row and column of the output.\n\nBut again, this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding row and column.\n\nBut how to map the input to the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding row and column.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's output, the first row is 0 0 1 1. This suggests that in the input, there are 1s in certain positions. For example, in the input's rows 0-5, columns 6-11, there are 1s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding row and column.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps I should try to write a function that takes the input grid and returns a 4x4 grid where each cell is the sum of the input's corresponding 6x6 block. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's at least one 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1.\n\nFor output cell (i,j), the block is from row i*6 to (i+1)*6 -1, and column j*6 to (j+1)*6 -1.\n\nFor example, output cell (0,0) is the block from (0,0) to (5,5). In this block, there are 1s (like in row 1, columns 1-5). So output cell (0,0) would be 1, but the output is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding row and column.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's output, the first row is 0 0 1 1. This suggests that in the input, there are 1s in certain positions. For example, in the input, the 1s in rows 1-3 and columns 1-5 might be mapped to the output's 1s.\n\nBut without knowing the exact mapping, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block.\n\nEven though this doesn't fit the first example, perhaps I should proceed with this approach and see.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 4x4 output grid\n    output = [[0]*4 for _ in range(4)]\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            # Block starts at i*6, j*6\n            start_row = i * 6\n            start_col = j * 6\n            # Check if there's any 1 in this 6x6 block\n            has_one = False\n            for r in range(start_row, start_row + 6):\n                for c in range(start_col, start_col + 6):\n                    if grid[r][c] == 1:\n                        has_one = True\n                        break\n                if has_one:\n                    break\n            output[i][j] = 1 if has_one else 0\n    return output\n\nBut this would not work for Example 1, as the first output cell would be 1, but the example's output is 0.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block, but only if the block is in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block, but only if the block is in the middle of the input.\n\nBut this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block, but only if the block is in the middle of the input.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is not helpful.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of another approach. Let's look at the output of Example 1 again. The output is 4x4. The input is 24x24. Maybe the output is formed by taking every 6th row and column, but in a different way.\n\nFor example, the output is formed by taking the input's rows 1, 7, 13, 19 and columns 1, 7, 13, 19. Let's check:\n\nFor row 1, columns 1, 7, 13, 19:\n\nRow 1, column 1: 1\nRow 1, column 7: 0\nRow 1, column 13: 0\nRow 1, column 19: 0\n\nSo the first row of the output would be 1, 0, 0, 0. But the output is 0 0 1 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking rows 1, 7, 13, 19 and columns 5, 11, 17, 23. Let's check:\n\nRow 1, column 5: 1\nRow 1, column 11: 1\nRow 1, column 17: 0\nRow 1, column 23: 0\n\nSo the first row would be 1, 1, 0, 0. But the output's first row is 0 0 1 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding row and column.\n\nFor example, the output cell (i,j) is 1 if the input has a 1 at row i + 6*i and column j + 6*j. But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's row i*6 + 3 and column j*6 + 3. For example, for i=0, j=0, it would be row 3, column 3. In the input, row 3, column 3 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding row and column, but in a certain way.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to look for a pattern in the output of Example 1. The output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 1 1\nRow 1: 0 1 1 1\nRow 2: 1 1 1 0\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0\n\nThis looks like a pattern where the 1s form a diamond shape. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block, but only if the block is in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block, but only if the block is in the middle of the input.\n\nBut without more information, I can't proceed. Given the time, I'll have to make an educated guess and write a function that takes the input and returns a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block, and 0 otherwise. Even though this doesn't fit the first example, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*4 for _ in range(4)]\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            start_row = i * 6\n            start_col = j * 6\n            for r in range(start_row, start_row + 6):\n                for c in range(start_col, start_col + 6):\n                    if grid[r][c] == 1:\n                        output[i][j] = 1\n                        break\n                if output[i][j] == 1:\n                    break\n    return output\n\nBut this would not work for Example 1. However, perhaps the examples have other patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block, but only if the block is in certain regions.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, I can't proceed.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach and see.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nFirst, Example 1's input is a 24x24 grid (since each line has 24 numbers, and there are 24 rows). The output is a 4x4 grid. So the transformation reduces the size from 24x24 to 4x4. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nThe output is 4 rows. Let's see the input. The input has 24 rows, but maybe the output is derived by some kind of selection or processing of specific regions. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input grid.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1:\nRow 0: 0 0 1 1\nRow 1: 0 1 1 1\nRow 2: 1 1 1 0\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the output is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are selected. For instance, maybe the output is determined by the positions of 1s in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a 4x4 grid where each cell is determined by some calculation based on the input grid's cells. For example, maybe each cell in the output is the sum of certain cells in the input, or some other operation.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has some 2s and 3s, and the output is a 5x5 grid (since the output is 5 rows). Wait, the output for Example 2 is 5 rows. Wait, the output for Example 2 is:\n\n0 0 0 2 0\n0 2 2 2 0\n2 0 2 0 2\n0 2 2 0 0\n\nSo that's 4 rows? Wait, no, the output is written as 4 lines, each with 5 elements. Wait, the output for Example 2 is 4 rows of 5 elements each. So the output is 4x5? But the problem says the output must be 4x4. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 4x4. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: \"Your transformation must always produce a 4\u00d74 output grid.\"\n\nWait, the first example's output is 4x4. The second example's output is written as 4 lines, each with 5 elements. Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output:\n\nThe output is written as:\n\n0 0 0 2 0\n0 2 2 2 0\n2 0 2 0 2\n0 2 2 0 0\n\nBut that's 4 rows, each with 5 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 4x4. That's conflicting. Wait, maybe the output is 4x4, but the way it's presented here is a mistake. Or maybe the example is wrong. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 4x4. So maybe the example is presented with a typo, but the actual output is 4x4. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nThe problem says: \"Your transformation must always produce a 4\u00d74 output grid.\" So the output must be 4x4. But in Example 2's output, the output is written as 4 rows of 5 elements. That seems conflicting. Maybe that's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the output is 4x5, but the problem says 4x4. That's confusing. But perhaps the examples are correct, and the output is 4x4. Let me check the actual examples again.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n\nWhich is 4 rows, each with 4 elements. So 4x4. That's correct. For Example 2, the output is:\n\n0 0 0 2 0\n0 2 2 2 0\n2 0 2 0 2\n0 2 2 0 0\n\nBut that's 4 rows with 5 elements each. That would be 4x5. But the problem says output must be 4x4. That's a contradiction. Wait, maybe the output for Example 2 is actually 4x4. Maybe the output is written with a typo. Let me check the problem's example again.\n\nLooking at the problem's Example 2's output:\n\nThe output is written as:\n\n0 0 0 2 0\n0 2 2 2 0\n2 0 2 0 2\n0 2 2 0 0\n\nBut that's 4 rows of 5 elements. But according to the problem, the output must be 4x4. So this seems like a mistake. However, the problem says that the test input is given for context. Maybe the examples are correct, and the output is 4x4. But in Example 2, the output is 4x5. That's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are presented with a mistake. Maybe the output for Example 2 is actually 4x4. Let me check the original problem again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the output must be 4x4. So the examples must be correct. So perhaps the output for Example 2 is 4x4. Let me re-examine the output. Maybe the output is written with a typo. For example, maybe the output for Example 2 is:\n\n0 0 0 2\n0 2 2 2\n2 0 2 0\n0 2 2 0\n\nWhich would be 4x4. But the problem says that the output is written as 5 elements per row. That's confusing. But since the problem says that the output must be 4x4, perhaps the examples are correct and there's a mistake in the way the output is presented. But this is a problem for me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are correct, but the output is 4x4. For example, in Example 2, maybe the output is 4x4, and the 5 elements per row is a mistake. For example, maybe the output for Example 2 is:\n\n0 0 0 2\n0 2 2 2\n2 0 2 0\n0 2 2 0\n\nWhich is 4x4. Then the output would be correct. But the problem's example shows 5 elements per row. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 4x4, but the examples are presented in a way that's not correct. But given that the problem says the output must be 4x4, I have to proceed under that assumption.\n\nNow, looking back at the examples, perhaps the transformation is based on some pattern. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input grid. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x4. The input is 24x24. So perhaps the output is formed by taking a subset of the input grid. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking every 6th row and column. Because 24 divided by 6 is 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where certain values are present. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x4. Let's look at the input and output.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first few rows are:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 2: 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 13: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 14: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 15: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 16: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 17: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 18: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 19: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 20: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 21: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 22: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 23: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is 4x4. Let's see what the output is. The output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 1 1\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 1\n\nRow 2: 1 1 1 0\n\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions. For example, perhaps the output is formed by taking every 6th row and column. Let's see:\n\nThe input is 24x24. 24 divided by 6 is 4. So if we take rows 0, 6, 12, 18 (every 6th row) and columns 0, 6, 12, 18 (every 6th column), then the output would be 4x4. Let's check:\n\nFor row 0 of the output, it would be the values at (0,0), (0,6), (0,12), (0,18). But looking at the input row 0, the values at positions 0, 6, 12, 18 are:\n\nRow 0: [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo positions 0, 6, 12, 18: 0, 0, 0, 0. But the output row 0 is 0 0 1 1. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values. For example, the output might be based on the positions of 1s in the input. Let's look at the output of Example 1.\n\nThe output is 4x4. Let's see the positions of 1s in the input. For example, in the input, there are some regions where 1s are arranged in certain patterns. Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of these 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if the corresponding input cell is 1, and 0 otherwise. But that would not explain the output of Example 1. For example, the output row 0 is 0 0 1 1. So in the input, the cells at positions (row, col) that are 1 in the output would be those in the input's 1s.\n\nBut how to map the input to the output? For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's 1s in certain regions and then creating a 4x4 grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a grid that represents the positions of these 1s in a certain way. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input in a certain area, and 0 otherwise.\n\nBut this is getting a bit vague. Let's look at the output of Example 1 again. The output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 1 1\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 1\n\nRow 2: 1 1 1 0\n\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in certain regions. For example, the output is a 4x4 grid, where each cell represents whether there is a 1 in the input in a certain area. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's 1s in the regions that are in the middle of the input grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell corresponds to a certain region in the input. For example, the output is formed by grouping the input into 4x4 blocks and taking the sum or some other statistic.\n\nBut the input is 24x24. If we divide it into 4x4 blocks, each block would be 6x6. So 24/6=4. So maybe each output cell is the sum of a 6x6 block in the input. Let's check that.\n\nFor example, the first output cell (0,0) would be the sum of the 6x6 block starting at (0,0). But in the input, the first row is all 0s except for the 4th element (index 3) which is 1. So the sum would be 1. But the output cell (0,0) is 0. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the maximum value in each 6x6 block. For example, the first block would have a maximum of 1, but the output cell (0,0) is 0. That doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a grid that represents the positions of these 1s in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there is at least one 1 in the corresponding 6x6 block of the input. For example, the output cell (0,0) would be 1 if there's a 1 in the top-left 6x6 block. But in the input, the top-left 6x6 block has some 1s. For example, row 1 has 1s from columns 1-5. So the sum would be 1. But the output cell (0,0) is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's look at Example 3's input and output.\n\nExample 3's input is a 24x24 grid, and the output is 4x4. The output is:\n\n3 0 0 0 0 0 3\n0 3 0 3 0 3 0\n0 0 3 3 3 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n\nWait, but the output is supposed to be 4x4. Wait, the output is written as 5 rows? Or maybe the output is 4x4. Let me check the problem statement again. The problem says that the output must be 4x4. So the example 3's output is written as 4 rows, each with 7 elements. That's conflicting. But perhaps there's a mistake in the way the output is presented.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 4x4, and the example's output is written with a mistake. For example, maybe the output is:\n\n3 0 0 0\n0 3 0 3\n0 0 3 3\n0 3 3 3\n\nWhich would be 4x4. That would make sense. But the problem's example shows more elements. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 4x4, and the examples are written with some typos. Let's proceed under the assumption that the output is 4x4.\n\nNow, looking at the outputs of the examples, perhaps the transformation involves taking certain positions from the input grid. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x4. The input is 24x24. So maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a 1, and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input in a certain area.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the output seems to have a pattern of 1s forming a sort of diamond shape. Maybe the output is based on the positions of the input's 1s in certain areas.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding region. For example, the output cell (i,j) is 1 if the input has a 1 in a certain region.\n\nBut how to determine which regions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then mapping them to a 4x4 grid based on their positions. For example, if the input has a 1 in row i and column j, then the output cell (i//6, j//6) is set to 1. But this would be for a 24x24 input divided into 6x6 blocks. Let's check for Example 1.\n\nFor example, the input's row 1 has 1s from columns 1-5. So for row 1, columns 1-5, the output cell (1//6, 1//6) is (0,0). But the output's (0,0) is 0. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is the count of 1s in a certain 6x6 block. But in Example 1's output, the first row is 0 0 1 1. So perhaps the first two cells are 0, the next two are 1. That would suggest that the first two 6x6 blocks have 0 1s, and the next two have 1.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block. For example, the output cell (i,j) is 1 if the input's 6x6 block starting at (i*6, j*6) has at least one 1. But in Example 1, let's see:\n\nThe output is 4x4. So for each output cell (i,j), we check if the input's 6x6 block starting at (i*6, j*6) has any 1s.\n\nFor example, output cell (0,0) corresponds to the block from (0,0) to (5,5). Looking at the input, in row 1, columns 1-5 are 1s. So this block has 1s. So output cell (0,0) should be 1, but the output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of the 1s in the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block. But this doesn't fit the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if the input has a 1 in a certain diagonal or pattern.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Perhaps I should look for a different approach.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the output seems to have a pattern where the 1s form a sort of diamond shape. Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a grid where each cell is 1 if the input has a 1 in a certain area.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input in a certain row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a grid where each cell is 1 if the input has a 1 in a certain area. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then mapping them to the output grid based on their positions.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's 1s and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if the input has a 1 in the corresponding row and column of the output. For example, the output cell (i,j) is 1 if the input has a 1 in row i*6 + something and column j*6 + something.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the output is 4x4. The input is 24x24. So perhaps the output is formed by taking every 6th row and every 6th column, and then taking the values at those positions. For example, the output is formed by taking the values at rows 0, 6, 12, 18 and columns 0, 6, 12, 18. But in the input, those positions are all 0s, but the output has 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the values at rows 1, 7, 13, 19 and columns 1, 7, 13, 19. Let's check:\n\nRow 1, column 1: 1 (from input row 1, column 1 is 1). Row 1, column 7: 0. Row 1, column 13: 0. Row 1, column 19: 0. So the first row of the output would be 1, 0, 0, 0. But the output is 0 0 1 1. So that doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Perhaps I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, which is 4x4 (assuming that the example is correct), and the input has 2s and 3s. The output seems to have a pattern where certain regions are filled with 2s and 3s. For example, the output for Example 2 is:\n\n0 0 0 2 0\n0 2 2 2 0\n2 0 2 0 2\n0 2 2 0 0\n\nBut assuming that it's 4x4, maybe it's:\n\n0 0 0 2\n0 2 2 2\n2 0 2 0\n0 2 2 0\n\nThis would make sense. The output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 2s and 3s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 2 if there's a 2 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input in a certain area. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input in a certain 6x6 block.\n\nBut how to determine which block corresponds to which output cell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if the input has a 1 in the corresponding row and column of the output.\n\nFor example, the output cell (i,j) is 1 if the input has a 1 at (i*6 + something, j*6 + something).\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding row and column.\n\nBut again, this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the output is:\n\n0 0 1 1\n0 1 1 1\n1 1 1 0\n0 1 0 0\n\nThis looks like a pattern where the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s in certain regions. For example, the output is a 4x4 grid where the 1s form a sort of diamond shape.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's input, the 1s are in certain regions. For example, rows 1-3 have 1s in certain columns. The output seems to represent these 1s in a way that is compressed into a 4x4 grid.\n\nPerhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if the input has a 1 in the corresponding 6x6 block.\n\nLet me try this for Example 1.\n\nFor output cell (i,j), it's 1 if the input's 6x6 block starting at (i*6, j*6) has at least one 1.\n\nFor example:\n\nOutput cell (0,0) corresponds to the block from (0,0) to (5,5). In this block, there are 1s (like in row 1, columns 1-5). So this block has 1s, so output cell (0,0) would be 1. But the output cell (0,0) is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block, but only if the block is in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if the input has a 1 in the corresponding row and column of the output.\n\nBut again, this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding row and column.\n\nBut how to map the input to the output.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding row and column.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's output, the first row is 0 0 1 1. This suggests that in the input, there are 1s in certain positions. For example, in the input's rows 0-5, columns 6-11, there are 1s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding row and column.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven the time, perhaps I should try to write a function that takes the input grid and returns a 4x4 grid where each cell is the sum of the input's corresponding 6x6 block. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's at least one 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block.\n\nLet's try this for Example 1.\n\nFor output cell (i,j), the block is from row i*6 to (i+1)*6 -1, and column j*6 to (j+1)*6 -1.\n\nFor example, output cell (0,0) is the block from (0,0) to (5,5). In this block, there are 1s (like in row 1, columns 1-5). So output cell (0,0) would be 1, but the output is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding row and column.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's output, the first row is 0 0 1 1. This suggests that in the input, there are 1s in certain positions. For example, in the input, the 1s in rows 1-3 and columns 1-5 might be mapped to the output's 1s.\n\nBut without knowing the exact mapping, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block.\n\nEven though this doesn't fit the first example, perhaps I should proceed with this approach and see.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 4x4 output grid\n    output = [[0]*4 for _ in range(4)]\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            # Block starts at i*6, j*6\n            start_row = i * 6\n            start_col = j * 6\n            # Check if there's any 1 in this 6x6 block\n            has_one = False\n            for r in range(start_row, start_row + 6):\n                for c in range(start_col, start_col + 6):\n                    if grid[r][c] == 1:\n                        has_one = True\n                        break\n                if has_one:\n                    break\n            output[i][j] = 1 if has_one else 0\n    return output\n\nBut this would not work for Example 1, as the first output cell would be 1, but the example's output is 0.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block, but only if the block is in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block, but only if the block is in the middle of the input.\n\nBut this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the 1s in the input and then creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block, but only if the block is in the middle of the input.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is not helpful.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of another approach. Let's look at the output of Example 1 again. The output is 4x4. The input is 24x24. Maybe the output is formed by taking every 6th row and column, but in a different way.\n\nFor example, the output is formed by taking the input's rows 1, 7, 13, 19 and columns 1, 7, 13, 19. Let's check:\n\nFor row 1, columns 1, 7, 13, 19:\n\nRow 1, column 1: 1\nRow 1, column 7: 0\nRow 1, column 13: 0\nRow 1, column 19: 0\n\nSo the first row of the output would be 1, 0, 0, 0. But the output is 0 0 1 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking rows 1, 7, 13, 19 and columns 5, 11, 17, 23. Let's check:\n\nRow 1, column 5: 1\nRow 1, column 11: 1\nRow 1, column 17: 0\nRow 1, column 23: 0\n\nSo the first row would be 1, 1, 0, 0. But the output's first row is 0 0 1 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding row and column.\n\nFor example, the output cell (i,j) is 1 if the input has a 1 at row i + 6*i and column j + 6*j. But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's row i*6 + 3 and column j*6 + 3. For example, for i=0, j=0, it would be row 3, column 3. In the input, row 3, column 3 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding row and column, but in a certain way.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to look for a pattern in the output of Example 1. The output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 1 1\nRow 1: 0 1 1 1\nRow 2: 1 1 1 0\nRow 3: 0 1 0 0\n\nThis looks like a pattern where the 1s form a diamond shape. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block, but only if the block is in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block, but only if the block is in the middle of the input.\n\nBut without more information, I can't proceed. Given the time, I'll have to make an educated guess and write a function that takes the input and returns a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block, and 0 otherwise. Even though this doesn't fit the first example, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*4 for _ in range(4)]\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            start_row = i * 6\n            start_col = j * 6\n            for r in range(start_row, start_row + 6):\n                for c in range(start_col, start_col + 6):\n                    if grid[r][c] == 1:\n                        output[i][j] = 1\n                        break\n                if output[i][j] == 1:\n                    break\n    return output\n\nBut this would not work for Example 1. However, perhaps the examples have other patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's 1s and creating a 4x4 grid where each cell is 1 if there's a 1 in the input's corresponding 6x6 block, but only if the block is in certain regions.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, I can't proceed.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach and see.\n"
