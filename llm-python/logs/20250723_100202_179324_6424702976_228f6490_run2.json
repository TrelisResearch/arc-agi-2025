Values of 5 and 7 seem to be preserved in some cases, but modified in others.\n2. Values of 0 are often transformed into other values, especially in the middle of the grid.\n3. Values of 8 and 9 seem to be replaced with other values in certain positions.\n4. There's a pattern of transformation that seems to involve replacing certain values with others in specific regions of the grid.\n5. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"spread\" or \"propagation\" of values from one region to another.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Replaces 0s with other values in certain patterns\n- Preserves 5s and 7s in some cases\n- Replaces 8s and 9s with other values\n- Applies these transformations in a way that seems to spread values from one region to another\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simple pattern that replaces 0s with 5s in certain positions\n    # and replaces 8s with 5s in certain positions\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Replace 0s with 5s in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8s with 5s in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                # Replace 9s with 5s in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simple pattern that replaces 0s with 5s in certain positions\n    # and replaces 8s with 5s in certain positions\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Replace 0s with 5s in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8s with 5s in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                # Replace 9s with 5s in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

There seems to be a pattern of \"expanding\" certain values to fill in gaps or replace other values.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Replaces certain values with others based on their position and value\n- Expands certain values to fill in gaps\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values based on their position and value\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with 8 in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                elif i > 5 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                elif i > 5 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 0 in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                elif i > 5 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                elif i > 5 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8 with 0 in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                elif i > 5 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                elif i > 5 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values based on their position and value\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with 8 in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                elif i > 5 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                elif i > 5 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 0 in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                elif i > 5 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                elif i > 5 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8 with 0 in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                elif i > 5 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                elif i > 5 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. Values of 5 and 7 seem to be preserved in some cases, but modified in others.\n2. Values of 0 are often transformed into other values, especially in the middle of the grid.\n3. Values of 8 and 9 seem to be replaced with other values in certain positions.\n4. There's a pattern of transformation that seems to involve replacing certain values with others in specific regions of the grid.\n5. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"spread\" or \"propagation\" of values from one region to another.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Replaces 0s with other values in certain patterns\n- Preserves 5s and 7s in some cases\n- Replaces 8s and 9s with other values\n- Applies these transformations in a way that seems to spread values from one region to another\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simple pattern that replaces 0s with 5s in certain positions\n    # and replaces 8s with 5s in certain positions\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Replace 0s with 5s in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8s with 5s in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                # Replace 9s with 5s in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simple pattern that replaces 0s with 5s in certain positions\n    # and replaces 8s with 5s in certain positions\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Replace 0s with 5s in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8s with 5s in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                # Replace 9s with 5s in certain positions\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i < 3 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif i > 6 and j > 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
