          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 7x9 grid. The output is also 7x9. The input has some numbers, like in the fourth row, there's 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. Wait, so the numbers 5, 2, 3 are in positions 4,5,6 of the input row, but in the output they are moved to positions 4,5,6? Or maybe they are rotated? Let me check the output row for that. The output row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the original numbers 3,2,5 in the input row (positions 2,3,4) are now in positions 4,5,6 of the output. Wait, maybe they are reversed? Let me check. The input row for that row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. So the numbers 3,2,5 are in positions 2,3,4. The output row has 5,2,3 in positions 4,5,6. So maybe they are reversed? Because 3,2,5 becomes 5,2,3. Wait, that's not exactly reversed. Wait, the original numbers are 3,2,5. The output has 5,2,3. So the first number (3) is moved to the third position, the second (2) stays in the middle, and the third (5) is first. So maybe they are reversed? But that would be 5,2,3. Oh right, that's exactly the case. So the numbers 3,2,5 in the input row are reversed to 5,2,3 in the output. But why? Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are reversed in their positions.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1's third row: input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, but the output is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. Wait, that's not clear. Wait, the input for the third row is all zeros. But the output has 3s in positions 5 and 6? Wait, no. Let me check again. The output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0\n\nRow 4: all zeros.\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nSo in row 2 of the output, there are 3s in positions 5 and 6. The input for row 2 is all zeros. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe the input for row 2 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, but the output has 3s in positions 5 and 6. How does that happen? Maybe that's not related to the previous example. Let me check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n\nInput is a 3x3 grid:\n\n6 0 0\n\n2 5 0\n\n2 1 0\n\nOutput is:\n\n0 1 2\n\n0 5 2\n\n0 0 6\n\nSo the input is:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0\n\nRow 1: 2 5 0\n\nRow 2: 2 1 0\n\nOutput is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 2\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6\n\nSo the output seems to be taking the numbers from the input and rearranging them. For example, the first row of input has 6, then the output's first row is 0 1 2. Wait, but where do those numbers come from? The input's third column is 0, but the output's first row has 0,1,2. Maybe the numbers are being rotated or shifted. Let me think.\n\nIn the output, the first row is 0 1 2. The input's third row is 2 1 0. So the output's third row is 0 0 6. The input's first row is 6 0 0. So maybe the numbers are being reversed in some way. For example, in the output's first row, the numbers are 0,1,2. But in the input's third row, the numbers are 2,1,0. So maybe the output's first row is the third row's numbers reversed? But that would be 0,1,2. Which matches. Similarly, the output's third row is 0,0,6. Which is the input's first row (6,0,0) reversed? No, because reversed would be 0,0,6. Yes. So that's matching. Then the middle row of output is 0 5 2. The input's middle row is 2 5 0. So reversed, that would be 0 5 2. Which matches. So this suggests that for Example 2, the output is the input's rows reversed. So each row is reversed. But wait, the input's third row is 2 1 0, which reversed is 0 1 2. Which is the first row of the output. So the output is the input's rows reversed. But the output's first row is the third row of the input reversed. The output's third row is the first row of the input reversed. The middle row is the middle row of the input reversed. So the output is the input's rows reversed. But then the output's first row is the third row of input reversed. So that's a possible pattern.\n\nBut then in Example 1, the input's fourth row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the numbers 3,2,5 in the input's fourth row are reversed to 5,2,3. So that's the same as reversing the row. But the input's fourth row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. So the row is 0,0,3,2,5,0,0,0,0. Reversed, it would be 0,0,0,0,5,2,3,0,0. Which is exactly the output's fourth row. So that's matching. So in Example 1, the output rows are the input rows reversed. But then why in the third row of the output for Example 1, the row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0? The input's third row is all zeros. So reversing that would still be all zeros. But the output's third row has 3s in positions 5 and 6. That's conflicting. Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps that's not the case. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the third row of Example 1's output. The input for that row is all zeros. But the output has 3s in positions 5 and 6. How is that possible? That suggests that maybe there's another pattern. Let me check the other examples.\n\nIn Example 3, the input is a 9x9 grid. The output is also 9x9. Let's look at the input and output for that example.\n\nInput:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nOther rows are all zeros.\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: all zeros.\n\nRow 4: all zeros.\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nSo, for example, in the input's row 2, the numbers are 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's row 2 is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 3s and 5 are moved. The 5 is now in position 3, and the 3s are in positions 4 and 5. But in the input, they were in positions 1,2,3 (values 3,3,5). Wait, in the input row 2, the numbers are 0,3,3,5,0,0,0,0,0. So the 3s are in positions 1 and 2, and the 5 is in position 3. The output row is 0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0,0. So the 5 is moved to position 3, and the 3s are moved to positions 4 and 5. So the 3s and 5 are shifted to the right. But how?\n\nLooking at the output row 1: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. The input's row 3 is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 1s are in positions 0 and 1. The output row 1 has 1s in positions 5 and 6. So that's a shift. The input row 3 is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output row 1 is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. So the 1s are moved from positions 0 and 1 to positions 5 and 6. That's a shift of 5 positions to the right. But why?\n\nSimilarly, in the output row 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. The input row 4 is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is in position 0. The output row 0 has 2 in position 6. So that's a shift of 6 positions to the right. Hmm, that's inconsistent. So maybe there's a pattern where numbers are moved based on their position?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being rotated in some way. For example, in Example 2, the rows are reversed. In Example 1, some rows are reversed, but others are not. But the third row of Example 1's input is all zeros, but the output has 3s in positions 5 and 6. That's confusing. Maybe that's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell (i,j) in the input, the output cell (i,j) is determined by some function. Let's think about the examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the output is the input's rows reversed. So for each row, the elements are reversed. But in Example 1, the fourth row is reversed. The third row of the output is not the same as the input's third row reversed. So that suggests that maybe the pattern isn't just reversing rows. But then, what's the pattern?\n\nLooking at Example 3's output. The input row 2 is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output row 2 is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 3s and 5 are moved. The 5 is at position 3, and the 3s are at positions 4 and 5. So the 5 is moved to the left, and the 3s are moved to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved based on their value. For example, in Example 2, the numbers are moved to the end of the row. For example, in the input's first row, the 6 is at position 0, and in the output's third row, it's at position 2. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3's row 2: the 5 is moved to the left, and the 3s are moved to the right. Maybe the numbers are being rotated in some way. For example, the 5 is at position 3 in the input, and in the output it's at position 3. Wait, no. The input row 2 has 0,3,3,5,0,0,0,0,0. The output row 2 is 0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0,0. So the 5 is at position 3, same as before. The 3s are now at positions 4 and 5. So maybe the 3s are moved to the right, and the 5 is kept in place. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved based on their value. For example, in Example 3, the 5 is moved to the left, but the 3s are moved to the right. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are shifted in a certain way. For example, in Example 2, the rows are reversed. In Example 3, the output rows have some numbers shifted. But how?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are rotated in a certain way. For example, in Example 2, each row is reversed. In Example 1, the fourth row is reversed, but the third row of output has 3s in positions 5 and 6. That's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), the value is determined by some function of the input cell's position. For example, maybe the output is a rotation of the input grid. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 3's output row 1: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. The input row 3 is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 1s are in positions 0 and 1. The output row 1 has the 1s in positions 5 and 6. That's a shift of 5 positions to the right. Similarly, in Example 3's output row 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. The input row 4 is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The 2 is in position 0, and in the output it's at position 6. So that's a shift of 6 positions to the right. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the shift is based on the row index. For example, in Example 3, the input row 2 (row index 2) is transformed into output row 2. But the 5 is at position 3, and the 3s are at positions 4 and 5. Maybe the numbers are being moved to the right by a certain amount. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the right by a certain number of positions based on their value. For example, 5 is moved to the left, 3s to the right. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 3's row 2: the 5 is at position 3, and the 3s are at positions 4 and 5. The input row 2's 5 is at position 3. So maybe the 5 is kept in the same position, and the 3s are moved to the right. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are moved to the right by a certain amount. For example, in Example 2, the rows are reversed. In Example 3, the 5 is moved to the same position, but the 3s are moved to the right. But that's not consistent.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can explain multiple examples.\n\nAnother approach: look for transformations that involve reversing rows, or rotating the grid, or shifting numbers in certain ways.\n\nIn Example 2, the output is the input's rows reversed. So for each row in the input, the output row is the reversed version. But in Example 1, the fourth row is reversed, but the third row of the output is not the same as the input's third row reversed. So that suggests that maybe that's not the case for all examples.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1's third row, the input is all zeros. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. How does that happen? That's not a reversed row. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved based on their position. For example, in Example 3, the output row 1 is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. The input row 3 is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 1s are moved from positions 0 and 1 to positions 5 and 6. That's a shift of 5 positions to the right. Similarly, in the output row 0, the 2 is moved from position 0 to position 6. That's a shift of 6 positions to the right. Maybe the shift amount depends on the row index. For example, in row i, each number is shifted by (some function of i) positions.\n\nBut how to find that function?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the right by a certain number of positions based on their row. For example, in Example 3, the input row 2 is transformed into output row 2, but the numbers are shifted. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3's row 2, the 3s and 5 are moved. The 5 is in position 3, which is the same as before. The 3s are moved to positions 4 and 5. So perhaps the 3s are moved to the right by 1 position. But why?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nMaybe the transformation involves some kind of rotation or reflection of the grid. For example, rotating the grid 90 degrees, but that would change the dimensions. But the output is always 7x9, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be that each cell's value is determined by some function of its position. For example, maybe the value in the output is the value from the input in a different position. For example, in Example 2, the output is the reversed rows. So for each row, the value at position j in the output is the value at position (length-1-j) in the input.\n\nIn Example 1, for the fourth row, the input is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the values at positions 4,5,6 are 5,2,3. Which are the values from positions 4,5,6 of the input row reversed. Wait, the input row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. So the values at positions 2,3,4 are 3,2,5. The output has 5,2,3 at positions 4,5,6. So that's the reversed of the input's values at positions 2,3,4. So maybe the transformation is that for certain positions, the values are reversed.\n\nBut why would that be the case for some rows and not others?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are reversed, but some values are replaced with others. For example, in Example 1's third row of output, the 3s are introduced. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of permutation of the values in the grid. For example, for each row, the values are shifted in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3's row 2, the 5 is in the same position as in the input, but the 3s are shifted to the right. Maybe the 5 is moved to the left, and the 3s are moved to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), the value in the output is determined by some rule based on the input's cell (i,j) and its position. For example, if the input cell is non-zero, it's moved to a certain position in the output.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: in Example 2, the output is the input's rows reversed. In Example 3, the output seems to be that the numbers are moved to the right by certain positions. For example, in row 3 of input, the 1s are moved to positions 5 and 6. In row 4 of input, the 2 is moved to position 6. So maybe for each row, the numbers are shifted to the right by a certain number of positions based on their row index.\n\nLet me check:\n\nIn Example 3, the input row 3 is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output row 1 is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. So the 1s are shifted to the right by 5 positions. The row index for input row 3 is 3, and the output row is 1. So maybe the shift is based on the row index.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are reversed, but then some values are replaced with others. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the input's rows reversed, except for certain rows where the values are replaced with others. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the values are reversed, and then some values are replaced with others. For example, in Example 1's third row of output, the 3s are introduced. But why?\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to think of a general pattern that can explain multiple examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2: the output is the input's rows reversed. Let's assume that's the case. Then, for the third row of Example 1, the input is all zeros, but the output has 3s. That suggests that this pattern doesn't hold for all examples. So perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are reversed, and then the non-zero values are moved to certain positions. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the input's rows reversed, but with some additional processing. For example, in Example 1's third row, the input is all zeros, but the output has 3s. That suggests that maybe the 3s are coming from other rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is the input's rows reversed, and then some values are added or modified based on certain rules. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are reversed, and then the values are replaced with their position in the reversed row. But that's not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is that the output grid is the input grid with certain values moved to specific positions. For example, in Example 2, the output is the input's rows reversed. In Example 1, the fourth row is reversed. In Example 3, the output rows have some values shifted.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are reversed, and then the values are moved to certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is the input's rows reversed, and then for each row, the values are replaced with their position in the reversed row. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the input's rows reversed, and then for each row, the values are moved to the right by a certain number of positions. For example, in Example 3's row 2, the 5 is in position 3, and the 3s are in positions 4 and 5. So that's a shift of 1 position to the right for the 3s.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: look for patterns in the output of Example 3. The output row 2 is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. The input row 2 is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5 is in position 3, and the 3s are in positions 4 and 5. So the 5 is moved to the left, and the 3s are moved to the right. But why?\n\nMaybe the 5 is moved to the left by one position, and the 3s are moved to the right by one position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5 is moved to the left, and the 3s are moved to the right, but this is not a general rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are reversed, and then the values are moved to the right by a certain amount. For example, in Example 3's row 2, the input is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed, it becomes 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. Which matches the output row 2. So that would be the case. But in Example 1's third row, the input is all zeros, so the reversed row is also all zeros. But the output has 3s in positions 5 and 6. So this suggests that this pattern doesn't hold for all rows.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1's third row of the output, the row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. Which is not the reversed input row. So why is that?\n\nMaybe there's a different pattern for certain rows. For example, in Example 1, the third row of the input is all zeros, but the output has 3s in positions 5 and 6. Maybe those 3s are coming from other rows. For example, in Example 1's input, the fourth row has 3,2,5. Maybe those are moved to the output's third row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are being added to the output grid based on some other rule. But this is unclear.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time I have, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see.\n\nLooking back at Example 2, the output is the input's rows reversed. Example 1's fourth row is reversed. Example 3's row 2 is reversed. So maybe the transformation is to reverse each row. But why in Example 1's third row, the output is not the reversed input row? Maybe that's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, let me recheck Example 1's third row. The input is:\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output row 2 is: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0.\n\nSo the input row is all zeros, and the output row has 3s in positions 5 and 6. How is that possible? That suggests that the transformation is not simply reversing the rows. So there must be another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are coming from other rows. For example, in Example 1's input, there's a 3 in row 3, column 2 (input row 3 is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0). Maybe that 3 is moved to the output row 2, column 5. But how?\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for the examples I can see.\n\nIn Example 2, reversing each row works. In Example 3, reversing each row also works for some rows. But not all.\n\nLet me try to assume that the transformation is to reverse each row. Let's see what happens with the examples.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\nRow 0: all zeros. Output is all zeros. That matches.\n\nRow 1: input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0. Wait, no. That doesn't match. So this suggests that reversing the rows is not the pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the output row 1 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0. The input row 1 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So reversing this row would still be all zeros. But the output has 4 and 1 in positions 6 and 7. So that's not possible. So reversing rows is not the pattern.\n\nThis suggests that there's a different pattern. Maybe the transformation involves some kind of rotation or shifting of values.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), the value in the output is the value from the input cell (i, j) if it's in a certain position, or some other value otherwise. For example, in Example 2, the output is the input's rows reversed. But how to explain the other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are reversed, and then some values are replaced with others. For example, in Example 1's output row 1, the 4 and 1 are coming from other parts of the input.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: look for the position of the numbers in the output. For example, in Example 1's output row 1, the 4 is at position 6, and 1 at position 7. In the input, the 4 is in row 5, column 1 (input row 5 is 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0). So the 4 is at (5,2). In the output row 1, position (1,6) is 4. So maybe the 4 is moved to a new position. But how?\n\nThis is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I have, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I can see. For example, in Example 2, the output is the input's rows reversed. In Example 3, the output rows are reversed. In Example 1, some rows are reversed, but others are not. So maybe the transformation is to reverse each row, and for rows that have zeros, replace them with certain values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to reverse each row, and then for each row, the values are replaced with certain values based on their position. For example, in Example 1's third row of the output, the 3s are added because they are in the input's other rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to write a function that reverses each row, and see if it passes some of the examples. Let's try that.\n\nFor Example 2, reversing each row would give:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 6\n\nRow 1: 2 5 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 2 1 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 1 2\n\nBut the output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 2\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6\n\nSo this is not matching. Wait, the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are in a different order. Wait, the input rows are:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0\n\nRow 1: 2 5 0\n\nRow 2: 2 1 0\n\nReversing each row gives:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 6\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 0 1 2\n\nBut the output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 2\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6\n\nSo the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are in the order of the original input's rows. So the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are in the same order as the input. But the example's output has the rows in the order of the input's rows reversed. Wait, no. The input's rows are 0, 1, 2. The output's rows are 0, 1, 2. So the output is not the reversed rows. But the output is the input's rows reversed. Wait, no. The output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 2 \u2192 which is the input's row 2 reversed.\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2 \u2192 which is the input's row 1 reversed.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6 \u2192 which is the input's row 0 reversed.\n\nSo the output is the input's rows reversed in order. So the output is the input's rows reversed in the order of the rows. So for example, the output's row 0 is the input's row 2 reversed, output's row 1 is input's row 1 reversed, and output's row 2 is input's row 0 reversed.\n\nSo the transformation for Example 2 is to reverse the rows of the input and then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nWait, that would make sense. So for each row in the input, reverse it, then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nSo for Example 2:\n\nInput rows are [row0, row1, row2].\n\nReversed rows are [row0_reversed, row1_reversed, row2_reversed].\n\nThen, reverse the order of the rows, so the output is [row2_reversed, row1_reversed, row0_reversed].\n\nBut in the example, the output is [row2_reversed, row1_reversed, row0_reversed]. So that would explain Example 2.\n\nLet's check Example 1:\n\nInput rows are 7 rows. Let's take the fourth row (row 3) of input: 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. Reversed, it becomes 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. Which is the output's fourth row. So that matches.\n\nNow, what about the third row of output in Example 1? The input's third row is all zeros. Reversed, it's all zeros. But the output's third row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. So that doesn't match. So this suggests that this pattern is not correct.\n\nBut maybe there's a different transformation for certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to reverse each row, and then reverse the order of the rows. Let's try that for Example 1.\n\nInput has 7 rows. Let's reverse each row, then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nFor example, the input's first row is all zeros, reversed is all zeros. The output's first row is all zeros, which matches.\n\nThe input's second row is all zeros, output's second row is all zeros. But in the example, the output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0. So this doesn't match. So this suggests that this pattern is not correct.\n\nThis is very confusing. I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to reverse each row and reverse the order of the rows, and see if it works for some examples.\n\nBut in Example 2, this would work. Let's check:\n\nInput rows are:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 6\n\nRow 1: 2 5 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 2 1 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 1 2\n\nThen, reverse the order of the rows: [row2_reversed, row1_reversed, row0_reversed] = [0 1 2, 0 5 2, 0 0 6], which matches the example's output.\n\nSo this works for Example 2.\n\nNow, for Example 1, let's see:\n\nInput has 7 rows. Let's reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nFor example, the input's fourth row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. Reversed is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0, which matches the output's fourth row.\n\nThe input's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed is all zeros. The output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0. So this doesn't match. So this suggests that this pattern is not correct for all examples.\n\nBut maybe there's another part to the transformation. Perhaps the rows are reversed, and then some values are replaced with others. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows. Even though it doesn't explain all examples, it explains some of them, and I'll implement that.\n\nBut how to handle the other examples? For example, in Example 3, let's see:\n\nInput rows are:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0 \u2192 which matches the output's row 2.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 \u2192 which would be the output row 3 if reversed, but in the example, the output row 1 is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. So this suggests that the rows are reversed, and then the order of the rows is changed.\n\nBut in the example, the input's row 3 is reversed to become 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1. Then, if the rows are reversed in order, the output row 1 would be this reversed row. But how?\n\nThis is getting too complex. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows. Even if it doesn't explain all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input, reverse it. Then, reverse the list of rows.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse each row\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    # Reverse the list of rows\n    reversed_rows = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return reversed_rows\n\nBut let's test this against the examples.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput grid is:\n\n[[6,0,0], [2,5,0], [2,1,0]]\n\nReversed rows: [[0,0,6], [0,5,2], [0,1,2]]\n\nReversed rows list: [[0,1,2], [0,5,2], [0,0,6]] \u2192 which matches the output.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput grid is 7 rows. Let's take the fourth row (index 3) of input: [0,0,3,2,5,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0,0,5,2,3,0,0], which matches the output's fourth row.\n\nBut the output's second row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0]. The input's second row is all zeros. Reversed is all zeros. Then, after reversing the order of the rows, the second row would be the input's sixth row reversed. But I'm not sure.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code and see.\n\nNow, for the test input, which is:\n\nInput:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n8 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n\n0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nReversed rows would be:\n\nEach row is reversed, then the list of rows is reversed.\n\nSo the first row is all zeros, reversed is all zeros. The sixth row is [8,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8]. Then, after reversing the order of the rows, this would be the first row of the output.\n\nBut the output would have this row as the first row, but the test input's output is not known. But the code is supposed to transform the input according to the pattern.\n\nBut according to this code, the output would be the reversed rows of the input, then the rows are reversed in order.\n\nBut this is the best I can do given the time.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 7x9 grid. The output is also 7x9. The input has some numbers, like in the fourth row, there's 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. Wait, so the numbers 5, 2, 3 are in positions 4,5,6 of the input row, but in the output they are moved to positions 4,5,6? Or maybe they are rotated? Let me check the output row for that. The output row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the original numbers 3,2,5 in the input row (positions 2,3,4) are now in positions 4,5,6 of the output. Wait, maybe they are reversed? Let me check. The input row for that row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. So the numbers 3,2,5 are in positions 2,3,4. The output row has 5,2,3 in positions 4,5,6. So maybe they are reversed? Because 3,2,5 becomes 5,2,3. Wait, that's not exactly reversed. Wait, the original numbers are 3,2,5. The output has 5,2,3. So the first number (3) is moved to the third position, the second (2) stays in the middle, and the third (5) is first. So maybe they are reversed? But that would be 5,2,3. Oh right, that's exactly the case. So the numbers 3,2,5 in the input row are reversed to 5,2,3 in the output. But why? Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are reversed in their positions.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1's third row: input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, but the output is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. Wait, that's not clear. Wait, the input for the third row is all zeros. But the output has 3s in positions 5 and 6? Wait, no. Let me check again. The output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0\n\nRow 4: all zeros.\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nRow 6: all zeros.\n\nSo in row 2 of the output, there are 3s in positions 5 and 6. The input for row 2 is all zeros. Hmm, that's confusing. Wait, maybe the input for row 2 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, but the output has 3s in positions 5 and 6. How does that happen? Maybe that's not related to the previous example. Let me check other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n\nInput is a 3x3 grid:\n\n6 0 0\n\n2 5 0\n\n2 1 0\n\nOutput is:\n\n0 1 2\n\n0 5 2\n\n0 0 6\n\nSo the input is:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0\n\nRow 1: 2 5 0\n\nRow 2: 2 1 0\n\nOutput is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 2\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6\n\nSo the output seems to be taking the numbers from the input and rearranging them. For example, the first row of input has 6, then the output's first row is 0 1 2. Wait, but where do those numbers come from? The input's third column is 0, but the output's first row has 0,1,2. Maybe the numbers are being rotated or shifted. Let me think.\n\nIn the output, the first row is 0 1 2. The input's third row is 2 1 0. So the output's third row is 0 0 6. The input's first row is 6 0 0. So maybe the numbers are being reversed in some way. For example, in the output's first row, the numbers are 0,1,2. But in the input's third row, the numbers are 2,1,0. So maybe the output's first row is the third row's numbers reversed? But that would be 0,1,2. Which matches. Similarly, the output's third row is 0,0,6. Which is the input's first row (6,0,0) reversed? No, because reversed would be 0,0,6. Yes. So that's matching. Then the middle row of output is 0 5 2. The input's middle row is 2 5 0. So reversed, that would be 0 5 2. Which matches. So this suggests that for Example 2, the output is the input's rows reversed. So each row is reversed. But wait, the input's third row is 2 1 0, which reversed is 0 1 2. Which is the first row of the output. So the output is the input's rows reversed. But the output's first row is the third row of the input reversed. The output's third row is the first row of the input reversed. The middle row is the middle row of the input reversed. So the output is the input's rows reversed. But then the output's first row is the third row of input reversed. So that's a possible pattern.\n\nBut then in Example 1, the input's fourth row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the numbers 3,2,5 in the input's fourth row are reversed to 5,2,3. So that's the same as reversing the row. But the input's fourth row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. So the row is 0,0,3,2,5,0,0,0,0. Reversed, it would be 0,0,0,0,5,2,3,0,0. Which is exactly the output's fourth row. So that's matching. So in Example 1, the output rows are the input rows reversed. But then why in the third row of the output for Example 1, the row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0? The input's third row is all zeros. So reversing that would still be all zeros. But the output's third row has 3s in positions 5 and 6. That's conflicting. Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps that's not the case. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nWait, looking at the third row of Example 1's output. The input for that row is all zeros. But the output has 3s in positions 5 and 6. How is that possible? That suggests that maybe there's another pattern. Let me check the other examples.\n\nIn Example 3, the input is a 9x9 grid. The output is also 9x9. Let's look at the input and output for that example.\n\nInput:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nOther rows are all zeros.\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: all zeros.\n\nRow 4: all zeros.\n\nRow 5: all zeros.\n\nSo, for example, in the input's row 2, the numbers are 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output's row 2 is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 3s and 5 are moved. The 5 is now in position 3, and the 3s are in positions 4 and 5. But in the input, they were in positions 1,2,3 (values 3,3,5). Wait, in the input row 2, the numbers are 0,3,3,5,0,0,0,0,0. So the 3s are in positions 1 and 2, and the 5 is in position 3. The output row is 0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0,0. So the 5 is moved to position 3, and the 3s are moved to positions 4 and 5. So the 3s and 5 are shifted to the right. But how?\n\nLooking at the output row 1: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. The input's row 3 is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 1s are in positions 0 and 1. The output row 1 has 1s in positions 5 and 6. So that's a shift. The input row 3 is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output row 1 is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. So the 1s are moved from positions 0 and 1 to positions 5 and 6. That's a shift of 5 positions to the right. But why?\n\nSimilarly, in the output row 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. The input row 4 is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is in position 0. The output row 0 has 2 in position 6. So that's a shift of 6 positions to the right. Hmm, that's inconsistent. So maybe there's a pattern where numbers are moved based on their position?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being rotated in some way. For example, in Example 2, the rows are reversed. In Example 1, some rows are reversed, but others are not. But the third row of Example 1's input is all zeros, but the output has 3s in positions 5 and 6. That's confusing. Maybe that's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell (i,j) in the input, the output cell (i,j) is determined by some function. Let's think about the examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the output is the input's rows reversed. So for each row, the elements are reversed. But in Example 1, the fourth row is reversed. The third row of the output is not the same as the input's third row reversed. So that suggests that maybe the pattern isn't just reversing rows. But then, what's the pattern?\n\nLooking at Example 3's output. The input row 2 is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output row 2 is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. So the 3s and 5 are moved. The 5 is at position 3, and the 3s are at positions 4 and 5. So the 5 is moved to the left, and the 3s are moved to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved based on their value. For example, in Example 2, the numbers are moved to the end of the row. For example, in the input's first row, the 6 is at position 0, and in the output's third row, it's at position 2. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3's row 2: the 5 is moved to the left, and the 3s are moved to the right. Maybe the numbers are being rotated in some way. For example, the 5 is at position 3 in the input, and in the output it's at position 3. Wait, no. The input row 2 has 0,3,3,5,0,0,0,0,0. The output row 2 is 0,0,0,5,3,3,0,0,0. So the 5 is at position 3, same as before. The 3s are now at positions 4 and 5. So maybe the 3s are moved to the right, and the 5 is kept in place. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved based on their value. For example, in Example 3, the 5 is moved to the left, but the 3s are moved to the right. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are shifted in a certain way. For example, in Example 2, the rows are reversed. In Example 3, the output rows have some numbers shifted. But how?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are rotated in a certain way. For example, in Example 2, each row is reversed. In Example 1, the fourth row is reversed, but the third row of output has 3s in positions 5 and 6. That's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), the value is determined by some function of the input cell's position. For example, maybe the output is a rotation of the input grid. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 3's output row 1: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. The input row 3 is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 1s are in positions 0 and 1. The output row 1 has the 1s in positions 5 and 6. That's a shift of 5 positions to the right. Similarly, in Example 3's output row 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. The input row 4 is 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The 2 is in position 0, and in the output it's at position 6. So that's a shift of 6 positions to the right. But why?\n\nWait, maybe the shift is based on the row index. For example, in Example 3, the input row 2 (row index 2) is transformed into output row 2. But the 5 is at position 3, and the 3s are at positions 4 and 5. Maybe the numbers are being moved to the right by a certain amount. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the right by a certain number of positions based on their value. For example, 5 is moved to the left, 3s to the right. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 3's row 2: the 5 is at position 3, and the 3s are at positions 4 and 5. The input row 2's 5 is at position 3. So maybe the 5 is kept in the same position, and the 3s are moved to the right. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are moved to the right by a certain amount. For example, in Example 2, the rows are reversed. In Example 3, the 5 is moved to the same position, but the 3s are moved to the right. But that's not consistent.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can explain multiple examples.\n\nAnother approach: look for transformations that involve reversing rows, or rotating the grid, or shifting numbers in certain ways.\n\nIn Example 2, the output is the input's rows reversed. So for each row in the input, the output row is the reversed version. But in Example 1, the fourth row is reversed, but the third row of the output is not the same as the input's third row reversed. So that suggests that maybe that's not the case for all examples.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1's third row, the input is all zeros. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. How does that happen? That's not a reversed row. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved based on their position. For example, in Example 3, the output row 1 is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. The input row 3 is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 1s are moved from positions 0 and 1 to positions 5 and 6. That's a shift of 5 positions to the right. Similarly, in the output row 0, the 2 is moved from position 0 to position 6. That's a shift of 6 positions to the right. Maybe the shift amount depends on the row index. For example, in row i, each number is shifted by (some function of i) positions.\n\nBut how to find that function?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the right by a certain number of positions based on their row. For example, in Example 3, the input row 2 is transformed into output row 2, but the numbers are shifted. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3's row 2, the 3s and 5 are moved. The 5 is in position 3, which is the same as before. The 3s are moved to positions 4 and 5. So perhaps the 3s are moved to the right by 1 position. But why?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Let me try to think of another approach.\n\nMaybe the transformation involves some kind of rotation or reflection of the grid. For example, rotating the grid 90 degrees, but that would change the dimensions. But the output is always 7x9, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be that each cell's value is determined by some function of its position. For example, maybe the value in the output is the value from the input in a different position. For example, in Example 2, the output is the reversed rows. So for each row, the value at position j in the output is the value at position (length-1-j) in the input.\n\nIn Example 1, for the fourth row, the input is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. So the values at positions 4,5,6 are 5,2,3. Which are the values from positions 4,5,6 of the input row reversed. Wait, the input row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. So the values at positions 2,3,4 are 3,2,5. The output has 5,2,3 at positions 4,5,6. So that's the reversed of the input's values at positions 2,3,4. So maybe the transformation is that for certain positions, the values are reversed.\n\nBut why would that be the case for some rows and not others?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are reversed, but some values are replaced with others. For example, in Example 1's third row of output, the 3s are introduced. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of permutation of the values in the grid. For example, for each row, the values are shifted in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3's row 2, the 5 is in the same position as in the input, but the 3s are shifted to the right. Maybe the 5 is moved to the left, and the 3s are moved to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), the value in the output is determined by some rule based on the input's cell (i,j) and its position. For example, if the input cell is non-zero, it's moved to a certain position in the output.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: in Example 2, the output is the input's rows reversed. In Example 3, the output seems to be that the numbers are moved to the right by certain positions. For example, in row 3 of input, the 1s are moved to positions 5 and 6. In row 4 of input, the 2 is moved to position 6. So maybe for each row, the numbers are shifted to the right by a certain number of positions based on their row index.\n\nLet me check:\n\nIn Example 3, the input row 3 is 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output row 1 is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. So the 1s are shifted to the right by 5 positions. The row index for input row 3 is 3, and the output row is 1. So maybe the shift is based on the row index.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are reversed, but then some values are replaced with others. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the input's rows reversed, except for certain rows where the values are replaced with others. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the values are reversed, and then some values are replaced with others. For example, in Example 1's third row of output, the 3s are introduced. But why?\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to think of a general pattern that can explain multiple examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2: the output is the input's rows reversed. Let's assume that's the case. Then, for the third row of Example 1, the input is all zeros, but the output has 3s. That suggests that this pattern doesn't hold for all examples. So perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are reversed, and then the non-zero values are moved to certain positions. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the input's rows reversed, but with some additional processing. For example, in Example 1's third row, the input is all zeros, but the output has 3s. That suggests that maybe the 3s are coming from other rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is the input's rows reversed, and then some values are added or modified based on certain rules. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are reversed, and then the values are replaced with their position in the reversed row. But that's not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is that the output grid is the input grid with certain values moved to specific positions. For example, in Example 2, the output is the input's rows reversed. In Example 1, the fourth row is reversed. In Example 3, the output rows have some values shifted.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are reversed, and then the values are moved to certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is the input's rows reversed, and then for each row, the values are replaced with their position in the reversed row. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the input's rows reversed, and then for each row, the values are moved to the right by a certain number of positions. For example, in Example 3's row 2, the 5 is in position 3, and the 3s are in positions 4 and 5. So that's a shift of 1 position to the right for the 3s.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: look for patterns in the output of Example 3. The output row 2 is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. The input row 2 is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5 is in position 3, and the 3s are in positions 4 and 5. So the 5 is moved to the left, and the 3s are moved to the right. But why?\n\nMaybe the 5 is moved to the left by one position, and the 3s are moved to the right by one position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5 is moved to the left, and the 3s are moved to the right, but this is not a general rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are reversed, and then the values are moved to the right by a certain amount. For example, in Example 3's row 2, the input is 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed, it becomes 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0. Which matches the output row 2. So that would be the case. But in Example 1's third row, the input is all zeros, so the reversed row is also all zeros. But the output has 3s in positions 5 and 6. So this suggests that this pattern doesn't hold for all rows.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1's third row of the output, the row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. Which is not the reversed input row. So why is that?\n\nMaybe there's a different pattern for certain rows. For example, in Example 1, the third row of the input is all zeros, but the output has 3s in positions 5 and 6. Maybe those 3s are coming from other rows. For example, in Example 1's input, the fourth row has 3,2,5. Maybe those are moved to the output's third row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are being added to the output grid based on some other rule. But this is unclear.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time I have, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see.\n\nLooking back at Example 2, the output is the input's rows reversed. Example 1's fourth row is reversed. Example 3's row 2 is reversed. So maybe the transformation is to reverse each row. But why in Example 1's third row, the output is not the reversed input row? Maybe that's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, let me recheck Example 1's third row. The input is:\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output row 2 is: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0.\n\nSo the input row is all zeros, and the output row has 3s in positions 5 and 6. How is that possible? That suggests that the transformation is not simply reversing the rows. So there must be another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are coming from other rows. For example, in Example 1's input, there's a 3 in row 3, column 2 (input row 3 is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0). Maybe that 3 is moved to the output row 2, column 5. But how?\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for the examples I can see.\n\nIn Example 2, reversing each row works. In Example 3, reversing each row also works for some rows. But not all.\n\nLet me try to assume that the transformation is to reverse each row. Let's see what happens with the examples.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\nRow 0: all zeros. Output is all zeros. That matches.\n\nRow 1: input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0. Wait, no. That doesn't match. So this suggests that reversing the rows is not the pattern.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the output row 1 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0. The input row 1 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So reversing this row would still be all zeros. But the output has 4 and 1 in positions 6 and 7. So that's not possible. So reversing rows is not the pattern.\n\nThis suggests that there's a different pattern. Maybe the transformation involves some kind of rotation or shifting of values.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), the value in the output is the value from the input cell (i, j) if it's in a certain position, or some other value otherwise. For example, in Example 2, the output is the input's rows reversed. But how to explain the other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are reversed, and then some values are replaced with others. For example, in Example 1's output row 1, the 4 and 1 are coming from other parts of the input.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: look for the position of the numbers in the output. For example, in Example 1's output row 1, the 4 is at position 6, and 1 at position 7. In the input, the 4 is in row 5, column 1 (input row 5 is 0 1 4 0 0 0 0 0 0). So the 4 is at (5,2). In the output row 1, position (1,6) is 4. So maybe the 4 is moved to a new position. But how?\n\nThis is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I have, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I can see. For example, in Example 2, the output is the input's rows reversed. In Example 3, the output rows are reversed. In Example 1, some rows are reversed, but others are not. So maybe the transformation is to reverse each row, and for rows that have zeros, replace them with certain values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to reverse each row, and then for each row, the values are replaced with certain values based on their position. For example, in Example 1's third row of the output, the 3s are added because they are in the input's other rows. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should try to write a function that reverses each row, and see if it passes some of the examples. Let's try that.\n\nFor Example 2, reversing each row would give:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 6\n\nRow 1: 2 5 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 2 1 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 1 2\n\nBut the output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 2\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6\n\nSo this is not matching. Wait, the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are in a different order. Wait, the input rows are:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0\n\nRow 1: 2 5 0\n\nRow 2: 2 1 0\n\nReversing each row gives:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 6\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 0 1 2\n\nBut the output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 2\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6\n\nSo the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are in the order of the original input's rows. So the output is the reversed rows of the input, but the rows are in the same order as the input. But the example's output has the rows in the order of the input's rows reversed. Wait, no. The input's rows are 0, 1, 2. The output's rows are 0, 1, 2. So the output is not the reversed rows. But the output is the input's rows reversed. Wait, no. The output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 2 \u2192 which is the input's row 2 reversed.\n\nRow 1: 0 5 2 \u2192 which is the input's row 1 reversed.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 6 \u2192 which is the input's row 0 reversed.\n\nSo the output is the input's rows reversed in order. So the output is the input's rows reversed in the order of the rows. So for example, the output's row 0 is the input's row 2 reversed, output's row 1 is input's row 1 reversed, and output's row 2 is input's row 0 reversed.\n\nSo the transformation for Example 2 is to reverse the rows of the input and then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nWait, that would make sense. So for each row in the input, reverse it, then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nSo for Example 2:\n\nInput rows are [row0, row1, row2].\n\nReversed rows are [row0_reversed, row1_reversed, row2_reversed].\n\nThen, reverse the order of the rows, so the output is [row2_reversed, row1_reversed, row0_reversed].\n\nBut in the example, the output is [row2_reversed, row1_reversed, row0_reversed]. So that would explain Example 2.\n\nLet's check Example 1:\n\nInput rows are 7 rows. Let's take the fourth row (row 3) of input: 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. Reversed, it becomes 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0. Which is the output's fourth row. So that matches.\n\nNow, what about the third row of output in Example 1? The input's third row is all zeros. Reversed, it's all zeros. But the output's third row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. So that doesn't match. So this suggests that this pattern is not correct.\n\nBut maybe there's a different transformation for certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to reverse each row, and then reverse the order of the rows. Let's try that for Example 1.\n\nInput has 7 rows. Let's reverse each row, then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nFor example, the input's first row is all zeros, reversed is all zeros. The output's first row is all zeros, which matches.\n\nThe input's second row is all zeros, output's second row is all zeros. But in the example, the output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0. So this doesn't match. So this suggests that this pattern is not correct.\n\nThis is very confusing. I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to reverse each row and reverse the order of the rows, and see if it works for some examples.\n\nBut in Example 2, this would work. Let's check:\n\nInput rows are:\n\nRow 0: 6 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 6\n\nRow 1: 2 5 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 5 2\n\nRow 2: 2 1 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 1 2\n\nThen, reverse the order of the rows: [row2_reversed, row1_reversed, row0_reversed] = [0 1 2, 0 5 2, 0 0 6], which matches the example's output.\n\nSo this works for Example 2.\n\nNow, for Example 1, let's see:\n\nInput has 7 rows. Let's reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nFor example, the input's fourth row is 0 0 3 2 5 0 0 0 0. Reversed is 0 0 0 0 5 2 3 0 0, which matches the output's fourth row.\n\nThe input's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Reversed is all zeros. The output's second row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 1 0. So this doesn't match. So this suggests that this pattern is not correct for all examples.\n\nBut maybe there's another part to the transformation. Perhaps the rows are reversed, and then some values are replaced with others. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows. Even though it doesn't explain all examples, it explains some of them, and I'll implement that.\n\nBut how to handle the other examples? For example, in Example 3, let's see:\n\nInput rows are:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\nRow 2: 0 3 3 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 5 3 3 0 0 0 \u2192 which matches the output's row 2.\n\nRow 3: 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 \u2192 which would be the output row 3 if reversed, but in the example, the output row 1 is 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. So this suggests that the rows are reversed, and then the order of the rows is changed.\n\nBut in the example, the input's row 3 is reversed to become 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1. Then, if the rows are reversed in order, the output row 1 would be this reversed row. But how?\n\nThis is getting too complex. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows. Even if it doesn't explain all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input, reverse it. Then, reverse the list of rows.\n\nSo in code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse each row\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    # Reverse the list of rows\n    reversed_rows = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return reversed_rows\n\nBut let's test this against the examples.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput grid is:\n\n[[6,0,0], [2,5,0], [2,1,0]]\n\nReversed rows: [[0,0,6], [0,5,2], [0,1,2]]\n\nReversed rows list: [[0,1,2], [0,5,2], [0,0,6]] \u2192 which matches the output.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput grid is 7 rows. Let's take the fourth row (index 3) of input: [0,0,3,2,5,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0,0,5,2,3,0,0], which matches the output's fourth row.\n\nBut the output's second row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,4,1,0]. The input's second row is all zeros. Reversed is all zeros. Then, after reversing the order of the rows, the second row would be the input's sixth row reversed. But I'm not sure.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code and see.\n\nNow, for the test input, which is:\n\nInput:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n8 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n\n0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n0 3 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nReversed rows would be:\n\nEach row is reversed, then the list of rows is reversed.\n\nSo the first row is all zeros, reversed is all zeros. The sixth row is [8,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,0]. Reversed is [0,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,8]. Then, after reversing the order of the rows, this would be the first row of the output.\n\nBut the output would have this row as the first row, but the test input's output is not known. But the code is supposed to transform the input according to the pattern.\n\nBut according to this code, the output would be the reversed rows of the input, then the rows are reversed in order.\n\nBut this is the best I can do given the time.\n"
