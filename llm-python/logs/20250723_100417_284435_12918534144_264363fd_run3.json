There appears to be a pattern where certain values (like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8) are replaced with other values in a specific pattern.\n3. There are regions where values are replaced in a way that seems to follow a grid-based pattern, possibly with some kind of \"spread\" or \"fill\" operation.\n4. Values like 7 and 9 seem to be unchanged in the examples.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with others in a structured way, possibly based on their position in the grid.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex patterns would require more detailed analysis\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex patterns would require more detailed analysis\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

There are patterns where values are replaced in a way that creates a \"wave\" or \"gradient\" effect from the edges towards the center.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that propagates values from the edges inward, replacing certain values with others in a structured way.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert the grid to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Propagate values from the edges inward\n    # This is a simplified version of the transformation pattern observed\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            # If the cell is on the edge, propagate the value inward\n            if i == 0 or i == 29 or j == 0 or j == 29:\n                # Propagate the value from the edge to the center\n                # This is a simplified version of the pattern observed\n                if i == 0 or i == 29:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = grid_np[29-i][j]\n                elif j == 0 or j == 29:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = grid_np[i][29-j]\n            # Replace certain values with others based on the pattern\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if i == 0 or i == 29 or j == 0 or j == 29:\n                if i == 0 or i == 29:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = grid_np[29-i][j]\n                elif j == 0 or j == 29:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = grid_np[i][29-j]\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",

There's also a pattern where certain values are replaced with other values in a specific pattern, such as replacing 1 with 2 in certain positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with others based on their position and value.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex rules could be added if needed\n    \n    # Replace 1 with 2 in certain positions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Replace 1 with 2 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n                if i % 3 == 0 and j % 3 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    # Replace 3 with 4 in certain positions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace 3 with 4 in certain positions\n                if i % 4 == 0 and j % 4 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n    \n    # Replace 4 with 5 in certain positions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 5 in certain positions\n                if i % 5 == 0 and j % 5 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex rules could be added if needed\n    \n    # Replace 1 with 2 in certain positions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Replace 1 with 2 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n                if i % 3 == 0 and j % 3 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    # Replace 3 with 4 in certain positions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace 3 with 4 in certain positions\n                if i % 4 == 0 and j % 4 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n    \n    # Replace 4 with 5 in certain positions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 5 in certain positions\n                if i % 5 == 0 and j % 5 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
