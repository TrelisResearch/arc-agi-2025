          "content": "Looking at the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid always has the same dimensions as the input grid (12x13)\n2. The first row of the output grid is always the same as the first row of the input grid\n3. The last row of the output grid is always the same as the last row of the input grid\n4. The transformation seems to involve some kind of pattern propagation or replacement based on the values in the grid\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that certain values (like 8, 2, 3, etc.) seem to be replaced or modified in specific patterns. It appears that the transformation involves some kind of pattern propagation or replacement based on the values in the grid.\n\nHere's my hypothesis for the transformation:\n\n- For each cell in the grid, if the value is 0, it remains 0\n- For other values, we look at the surrounding cells and apply some kind of pattern propagation or replacement\n- The transformation seems to involve some kind of pattern propagation or replacement based on the values in the grid\n\nBased on this, I'll write a Python function that implements this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # The first and last rows remain unchanged\n    for i in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[i][0] = grid[i][0]\n        transformed_grid[i][12] = grid[i][12]\n    \n    # Apply transformation to the middle rows\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        for j in range(1, 12):\n            # If the value is 0, leave it as is\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # If the value is 8, replace with 8\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            \n            # If the value is 2, replace with 2\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            \n            # If the value is 3, replace with 3\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            \n            # If the value is 1, replace with 1\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # The first and last rows remain unchanged\n    for i in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[i][0] = grid[i][0]\n        transformed_grid[i][12] = grid[i][12]\n    \n    # Apply transformation to the middle rows\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        for j in range(1, 12):\n            # If the value is 0, leave it as is\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # If the value is 8, replace with 8\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            \n            # If the value is 2, replace with 2\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            \n            # If the value is 3, replace with 3\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            \n            # If the value is 1, replace with 1\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The first row of the output grid is always the same as the first row of the input grid\n3. The last row of the output grid is always the same as the last row of the input grid\n4. The transformation seems to involve some kind of pattern propagation or replacement based on the values in the grid\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that certain values (like 8, 2, 3, etc.) seem to be replaced or modified in specific patterns. It appears that the transformation involves some kind of pattern propagation or replacement based on the values in the grid.\n\nHere's my hypothesis for the transformation:\n\n- For each cell in the grid, if the value is 0, it remains 0\n- For other values, we look at the surrounding cells and apply some kind of pattern propagation or replacement\n- The transformation seems to involve some kind of pattern propagation or replacement based on the values in the grid\n\nBased on this, I'll write a Python function that implements this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # The first and last rows remain unchanged\n    for i in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[i][0] = grid[i][0]\n        transformed_grid[i][12] = grid[i][12]\n    \n    # Apply transformation to the middle rows\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        for j in range(1, 12):\n            # If the value is 0, leave it as is\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # If the value is 8, replace with 8\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            \n            # If the value is 2, replace with 2\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            \n            # If the value is 3, replace with 3\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            \n            # If the value is 1, replace with 1\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # The first and last rows remain unchanged\n    for i in range(12):\n        transformed_grid[i][0] = grid[i][0]\n        transformed_grid[i][12] = grid[i][12]\n    \n    # Apply transformation to the middle rows\n    for i in range(1, 11):\n        for j in range(1, 12):\n            # If the value is 0, leave it as is\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # If the value is 8, replace with 8\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            \n            # If the value is 2, replace with 2\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            \n            # If the value is 3, replace with 3\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            \n            # If the value is 1, replace with 1\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
