          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation appears to involve expanding or spreading certain values (like 2, 3, 4, 8) in specific patterns.\n2. Values in the input grid that are not 0 seem to be \"spread out\" or \"expanded\" in the output grid.\n3. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"influence\" or \"spread\" from the original values to their neighboring cells.\n4. The output grid always has dimensions 18\u00d717, which is consistent with the examples.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading non-zero values to their neighboring cells in a specific pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(18):\n        for j in range(17):\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            # If the value is not zero, spread it to neighboring cells\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread to adjacent cells\n                if i > 0 and transformed_grid[i-1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j] = value\n                if i < 17 and transformed_grid[i+1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = value\n                if j > 0 and transformed_grid[i][j-1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j-1] = value\n                if j < 16 and transformed_grid[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = value\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(18):\n        for j in range(17):\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            # If the value is not zero, spread it to neighboring cells\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread to adjacent cells\n                if i > 0 and transformed_grid[i-1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j] = value\n                if i < 17 and transformed_grid[i+1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = value\n                if j > 0 and transformed_grid[i][j-1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j-1] = value\n                if j < 16 and transformed_grid[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = value\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation appears to involve expanding or spreading certain values (like 2, 3, 4, 8) in specific patterns.\n2. Values in the input grid that are not 0 seem to be \"spread out\" or \"expanded\" in the output grid.\n3. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"influence\" or \"spread\" from the original values to their neighboring cells.\n4. The output grid always has dimensions 18\u00d717, which is consistent with the examples.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading non-zero values to their neighboring cells in a specific pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(18):\n        for j in range(17):\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            # If the value is not zero, spread it to neighboring cells\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread to adjacent cells\n                if i > 0 and transformed_grid[i-1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j] = value\n                if i < 17 and transformed_grid[i+1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = value\n                if j > 0 and transformed_grid[i][j-1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j-1] = value\n                if j < 16 and transformed_grid[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = value\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(18):\n        for j in range(17):\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            # If the value is not zero, spread it to neighboring cells\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread to adjacent cells\n                if i > 0 and transformed_grid[i-1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j] = value\n                if i < 17 and transformed_grid[i+1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = value\n                if j > 0 and transformed_grid[i][j-1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j-1] = value\n                if j < 16 and transformed_grid[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = value\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
