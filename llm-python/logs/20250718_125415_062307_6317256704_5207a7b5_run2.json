          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids are transformed into the output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a lot of 0s except for the 5s in the fourth column. The output has 8s and 5s and some 6s and 0s. Hmm. Let me check the positions. The input has 5s in the fourth column for the first 5 rows. The output for those rows has 8s in the first three columns, then 5, then 6s in the next two columns. Then after that, the 8s start to decrease. Wait, maybe the 5s are being transformed into 5s, but the surrounding areas are being modified. Also, the 6s and 8s might be related to the position of the 5s.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 5s in the third column for the first four rows. The output has 8s in the first two columns, then 5, then 6s in the next columns. Then the 8s decrease. So maybe there's a pattern where the 5s are in a certain column and the surrounding cells are transformed based on their position relative to the 5s.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has 5s in the fifth column for the first 8 rows. The output has 8s in the first four columns, then 5, then 6s in the next columns. Then the 8s decrease. So maybe the 5s are in a column, and the cells to the left are 8s, and the cells to the right are 6s, but with some variation based on the row.\n\nWait, maybe the 5s are in a column, and the transformation is that the cells to the left of the 5 are 8s, and the cells to the right are 6s. But how does that work with the rows? For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in column 4 (0-based?), but the output has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 5 and 6. But in the first few rows, the 6s are in columns 5 and 6, but in later rows, they might be fewer. Also, the 8s start to decrease as the rows go down. Maybe the number of 8s decreases as you move down the rows.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has 8s in the first few columns, then 5s, then 6s, then 0s. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being transformed into 5s in the output, but the surrounding cells are transformed based on their position. For example, cells to the left of the 5 are 8s, and cells to the right are 6s. But the 8s might be in a certain number of columns, and the 6s in others. Also, the 8s might be present only up to a certain row.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1, the input has 5s in column 3 (if 0-based, maybe). The output for those rows has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 5 and 6. But in the first 5 rows, the 6s are in columns 5 and 6, but in the next rows, they are only in column 5. Then in the next rows, even fewer. So perhaps the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5, but the number of columns decreases as we go down the rows. Also, the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5, but the number of 8s decreases as we go down the rows.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the 5s in the input are in a certain column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and 6s in the columns to the right. But the number of 8s and 6s depends on the row. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. The first 5 rows have 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 5 and 6. But in the next rows, the 6s are in column 5 only, then in the next rows, even less. So maybe the number of 8s and 6s is determined by how far the row is from the top.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are in a column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and the 6s in the columns to the right. But the 8s and 6s are only present in certain rows. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows have 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 5 and 6. Then, in the next rows, the 8s start to decrease. Maybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index. Like, for rows 0-4, there are 3 8s (columns 0-2), then for rows 5-7, there are 2 8s (columns 0-1?), then for rows 8-9, 1 8 (column 0?), and so on.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output:\n\nFirst 5 rows: columns 0-2 are 8, then 5, then columns 5 and 6 are 6. Then rows 5-7 have columns 0-2 as 8, then 5, then column 5 as 6. Then rows 8-9: columns 0-1 as 8, then 5, then 0. Then rows 10-13: 8s in columns 0-1, then 5, then 0. Wait, no, looking at the output for Example 1:\n\nThe output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 8 5 6 6 0\n\nRow 1: 8 8 8 5 6 0 0\n\nRow 2: 8 8 8 5 6 0 0\n\nRow 3: 8 8 8 5 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 8 8 8 5 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 6: 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 9: 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 10: 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 13: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo for the first 5 rows (rows 0-4), the 5 is in column 3, then columns 4 and 5 are 6 and 6. Then in rows 5-6, columns 4 and 5 are 0. Then rows 7-8, columns 4 is 0. Then rows 9-10, columns 3 is 0. Hmm, not sure. Maybe the 5s in the input are in a certain column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of the 5, and 6s in the columns to the right. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are in a column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and the 6s in the columns to the right. But the number of 8s and 6s depends on the row. For example, in the first few rows, there are more 8s and 6s, but as the rows go down, the number decreases.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3 (since the input has 5 in column 3 for the first 5 rows). The output for those rows has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4 and 5. Then in rows 5-6, the 6s are in column 4 only. Then in rows 7-8, column 4 is 0. So maybe the 6s are in columns to the right of the 5, but the number of columns decreases as the row index increases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s in the input are in a certain column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of the 5, and 6s in the columns to the right. The 8s and 6s are only present in the rows where the input has a 5 in that column. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the test input. The test input has 5s in column 3 (assuming 0-based) for the first 7 rows. The output for the test input would be similar to the examples. So maybe the transformation is that the 5s in the input are in a column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and 6s in the columns to the right. The number of 8s and 6s depends on the row.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of the input grid as having a certain column where the 5s are. For each row, the 5 is in that column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left, and 6s in the columns to the right. But the 8s and 6s might be limited to certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are in a certain column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and 6s in the columns to the right, but only up to a certain number of rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. The first 5 rows have 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4 and 5. Then, as the rows go down, the 6s and 8s decrease.\n\nAnother idea: The 5s in the input are in a column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and the 6s in the columns to the right. The number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, the first few rows have more 8s, and as the row index increases, the number of 8s decreases. Similarly, the number of 6s to the right of the 5 may decrease.\n\nBut how to translate that into code? Maybe for each cell in the input grid, if the cell is a 5, then in the output, the cells to the left are 8s, and the cells to the right are 6s. But that might not be the case. Wait, looking at Example 1's input, the 5 is in column 3. The output for that row has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4 and 5. So the 5 is in column 3, and the 8s are in columns 0-2, which are to the left of the 5. The 6s are in columns 4 and 5, which are to the right. But in the next rows, the 6s are only in column 4. Then, in later rows, they are 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are in a column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and 6s in the columns to the right, but only up to a certain row. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. The first 5 rows have 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4 and 5. Then, in rows 5-6, the 6s are in column 4. Then, in rows 7-8, the 6s are in column 4, but the 8s are in columns 0-1. Then, in rows 9-10, the 8s are in column 0. Then, in rows 11-13, they are 0.\n\nSo perhaps the number of 8s and 6s depends on the row. For example, the 8s in the left columns are determined by the row index. Maybe the 8s are present in the first (some number) of rows. For example, the first 5 rows have 3 8s (columns 0-2), then 2 8s (columns 0-1), then 1 8 (column 0), then 0.\n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the number of 8s is determined by how far the row is from the top. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows (rows 0-4) have 3 8s. Then rows 5-6 have 2 8s. Rows 7-8 have 1 8. Rows 9-10 have 1 8. Then rows 11-13 have 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 8s is determined by the number of rows where the input has a 5 in that column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output for each example and see what's happening. For Example 1, the output has 8s in the first three columns for the first 5 rows. Then, in rows 5-6, the 8s are in the first three columns. Then in rows 7-8, the 8s are in the first two columns. Then rows 9-10, first column. Then rows 11-13, zero.\n\nSo maybe the number of 8s is decreasing as the row index increases. For example, the first 5 rows have 3 8s, then 3, then 2, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the number of 8s is (some function of i). But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are present in the first (some number) of rows. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are present in the first 5 rows, then in rows 5-6, they are still present. Then in rows 7-8, they are present. Then in rows 9-10, they are present. Then in rows 11-13, not. So maybe the number of 8s is determined by how many rows are above the 5s in the input. Or perhaps the number of 8s is determined by the distance from the 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are present in the first (some number) of rows where the input has a 5 in the column. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first 5 rows. So the 8s are present in the first 5 rows, but then as the rows go further, they decrease.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are present in the first (some number) of rows, and the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, the first row has 3 8s, then the next row has 3, then 3, then 2, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.\n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the number of 8s is (some function of i). For example, the first 5 rows have 3 8s, then 3, then 2, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 8s is determined by the number of rows where the 5s are in the input. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first 5 rows. So for rows 0-4, there are 3 8s. Then for rows 5-6, there are 3 8s. Then for rows 7-8, 2 8s. Then for rows 9-10, 1 8. Then 0.\n\nThis seems arbitrary. Maybe there's a pattern where the 8s are present in the first (some number) of rows, and the number of 8s decreases as the row index increases.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Maybe the key is that the 5s in the input are in a certain column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and 6s in the columns to the right. The number of 8s and 6s depends on the row index. For example, for each row, the 8s are in the first (some number) columns, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of the 5s in the input as being in a column. Let's call that column 'c'. Then, for each row, the output has 8s in columns 0 to (c-1), and 6s in columns (c+1) to (c+something). But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are in a column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and 6s in the columns to the right. However, the 8s and 6s are only present in the first few rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. The output for rows 0-4 has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4 and 5. Then in rows 5-6, the 6s are in column 4, and the 8s are in columns 0-2. Then in rows 7-8, the 8s are in columns 0-1, and the 6s are in column 4. Then in rows 9-10, the 8s are in column 0. Then in rows 11-13, all zeros.\n\nSo the number of 8s is decreasing as the row index increases. The 6s are also decreasing. But how to model this?\n\nMaybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the number of 8s is (some value based on i). For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows (i=0-4) have 3 8s. Then for i=5-6, 3 8s. Then i=7-8, 2 8s. Then i=9-10, 1 8. Then i=11-13, 0.\n\nBut how to compute that? Maybe the number of 8s is the minimum between (some value) and (some function of i). Alternatively, the number of 8s is determined by the row index, but this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are present in the first (some number) of rows, and the number of 8s decreases as the row index increases. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows have 3 8s, then the next 2 rows have 3, then 2, then 1, then 0.\n\nBut this is not helpful for coding.\n\nAnother observation: Looking at the outputs, the 8s and 6s are present in the output only where the input has a 5 in that column. For example, in Example 1, the input has 5s in column 3 for the first 5 rows. The output has 8s in columns 0-2 for those rows, and 6s in columns 4-5. Then, in rows 5-6, the 5s are not in the input (they are 0s), so the output has 8s and 0s. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 6s are only present in the rows where the input has a 5 in that column. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows have 5s in column 3. So for those rows, the output has 8s to the left of the 5, and 6s to the right. For the other rows, where the input has 0s, the output has 0s.\n\nBut then, in Example 1, the output for rows 5-6 has 8s in columns 0-2, but the input has 0s in those rows. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 6s are present in the output for all rows, but their values depend on the input's 5s. For example, if the input has a 5 in column c, then the output has 8s in columns 0 to c-1, and 6s in columns c+1 to some value.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAnother idea: Let's think of the output as having 8s in the columns to the left of the 5, and 6s in the columns to the right. The 8s and 6s are only present in the first few rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. The first 5 rows have 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4-5. Then, in rows 5-6, the 6s are in column 4, and the 8s are in columns 0-2. Then, in rows 7-8, the 8s are in columns 0-1, and the 6s are in column 4. Then in rows 9-10, the 8s are in column 0, and the 6s are in column 4. Then in rows 11-13, all zeros.\n\nThis suggests that the number of 8s decreases as the row index increases, but how to model this? Maybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the number of 8s is (some function of i). For example, the first 5 rows have 3 8s. Then, for rows 5-6, 3 8s. Then for rows 7-8, 2 8s. Then for rows 9-10, 1 8. Then for rows 11-13, 0.\n\nThis seems to be a pattern where the number of 8s decreases as the row index increases. But how to translate that into code?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 8s is determined by the distance from the top. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows have 3 8s. Then, as the rows go down, the number of 8s decreases by 1 every certain rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of 8s is determined by the number of rows where the input has a 5 in that column. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first 5 rows. So the number of 8s is 3 for those rows, then decreases.\n\nBut this is not helpful for coding.\n\nMaybe the key is to find that for each row, the 8s are in the first (some number) columns, and the 6s are in the columns after the 5. The number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, in the first few rows, the number of 8s is 3, then decreases.\n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the number of 8s is (some value) minus the row index. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows have 3 8s. Then, for row i, the number of 8s is 3 - (i // 5). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, in the first 5 rows, the number of 8s is 3. Then for rows 5-6, 3. Then for rows 7-8, 2. Then for rows 9-10, 1. Then for rows 11-13, 0. So the number of 8s decreases by 1 every 3 rows. But this is not a clear pattern.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows:\n\nFor each cell in the output grid, if the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 5. Otherwise, if the cell is to the left of the 5s in the input, it's 8. If to the right, it's 6. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has 5s in column 3 for the first 5 rows. The output for those rows has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4 and 5. So for those rows, the cells to the left of the 5 are 8s, and to the right are 6s. But for rows 5-6, the input has 0s, but the output has 8s in columns 0-2, and 0s elsewhere. So this suggests that the 8s are present in the output for all rows, but only for the columns to the left of the 5s in the input.\n\nBut how to determine which columns are to the left of the 5s in the input. Maybe the 5s in the input are in a certain column, and for each row, the cells to the left of that column are 8s, and to the right are 6s.\n\nBut in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. So for rows where the input has 5 in column 3, the output has 8s in columns 0-2, and 6s in columns 4-5. For rows where the input has 0 in column 3, the output has 8s in columns 0-2, and 0s elsewhere. But this doesn't fit the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 6s are determined by the position of the 5 in the input. For example, if the input has a 5 in column c, then the output has 8s in columns 0 to c-1, and 6s in columns c+1 to some value.\n\nBut how to determine that. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. The output has 8s in columns 0-2, and 6s in columns 4-5. Then, in rows where the input has 0 in column 3, the output has 8s in columns 0-2, and 0s elsewhere.\n\nBut this seems to fit the examples. So the idea is that for each cell in the output, if the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 5. Otherwise, if the cell is to the left of the 5 in the input, it's 8. If to the right, it's 6. But this doesn't fit the examples, because in Example 1, the output for rows 5-6 has 8s in columns 0-2, but the input for those rows has 0 in column 3.\n\nWait, but in the output for rows 5-6, the input has 0 in column 3. So according to this logic, the output would have 8s in columns 0-2, and 0s elsewhere. But in the output for Example 1, rows 5-6 have 8s in columns 0-2, then 0 in column 3, and then 0 in columns 4-6. So that fits.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is: for each cell in the output grid, if the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 5. Otherwise, if the cell is to the left of the 5 in the input, it's 8. If to the right, it's 6. But how to determine the column where the 5 is in the input.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. So for each row, the cells to the left of column 3 are 8, and to the right are 6. But in the input, for rows where the 5 is not present, the output has 8s to the left and 0s to the right. But in the output for rows 5-6, the input has 0 in column 3, so the output has 8s to the left of column 3, and 0s to the right.\n\nBut this would mean that the 8s are present in all rows for columns to the left of the 5's column, and 6s are present in columns to the right of the 5's column. But this doesn't fit the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 0 has 8s in columns 0-2, 5, 6s in columns 4-5. But for row 5, the input has 0 in column 3, so the output has 8s in columns 0-2, then 0 in column 3, and 0s in columns 4-6.\n\nThis seems to fit. But then, what about the 6s? In the output for rows 0-4, the columns to the right of the 5 are 6s. But in rows 5-6, the columns to the right are 0. So why are the 6s present in the first few rows?\n\nAh, perhaps the 6s are only present if the input has a 5 in that column. So, for each cell in the output, if the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 5. Otherwise, if the cell is to the left of the 5's column, it's 8. If to the right, it's 6. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has 5s in column 3 for the first 5 rows. The output for those rows has 6s in columns 4 and 5. For other rows, the output has 0s in those columns. So this suggests that the 6s are only present in the rows where the input has 5 in column 3.\n\nBut how to determine the column where the 5 is in the input. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. In Example 2, the 5 is in column 2. In Example 3, the 5 is in column 4.\n\nSo the transformation seems to be:\n\nFor each row, find the column where the input has a 5. Then, for that row, the output has 8s in columns to the left of that column, 5 in that column, and 6s in columns to the right. For rows where there is no 5, the output has 8s in columns to the left of the 5's column (but since there is no 5, maybe it's 0s or something else).\n\nWait, but in Example 1, for rows where there is no 5, the output has 8s in columns to the left of the 5's column (column 3). For example, in rows 5-6, the input has 0s in column 3. So the output has 8s in columns 0-2, and 0s elsewhere.\n\nBut how to find the column where the 5 is in the input for each row. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows have 5 in column 3. The other rows have 0 in column 3.\n\nSo the transformation could be:\n\nFor each row, find the column c where the input has a 5. If there is no such column, then the output is 0s. Otherwise, for each cell in the output:\n\n- If the cell is in column c: output is 5.\n- If the cell is to the left of c: output is 8.\n- If the cell is to the right of c: output is 6.\n\nBut wait, this would mean that for rows where the input has a 5 in column c, the output has 8s to the left of c, 5 in c, and 6s to the right. For rows where the input has no 5, the output is 0s.\n\nBut this doesn't fit the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 0 is 8 8 8 5 6 6 0. So columns 0-2 are 8, column 3 is 5, columns 4-5 are 6, column 6 is 0. But according to the above logic, columns to the right of c (3) would be 6s. But column 6 is 0. So this suggests that the 6s are only in certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are only in columns to the right of c, but up to a certain number of columns. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in columns 4 and 5 for the first 5 rows. Then, in rows 5-6, the 6s are in column 4. Then in rows 7-8, column 4 is 0. So this suggests that the number of 6s depends on the row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 6s are only in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are present in columns 4-5 for the first 5 rows, then in column 4 for rows 5-6, then in column 4 for rows 7-8, then 0. This seems arbitrary.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to find a pattern based on the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 5s in column 3 for the first 5 rows. The output for those rows has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4 and 5. Then, for rows 5-6, the output has 8s in columns 0-2, then 0 in column 3, then 0 in columns 4-6. For rows 7-8, the output has 8s in columns 0-1, then 0 in column 2, then 0 in column 3, then 0 in columns 4-6. For rows 9-10, 8 in column 0, then 0s elsewhere. For rows 11-13, 0s.\n\nSo the number of 8s decreases as the row index increases. It starts with 3 8s (columns 0-2), then 3, then 2, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.\n\nThis seems like the number of 8s is 3 for the first 5 rows, then 3 for the next 2 rows, then 2 for the next 2 rows, then 1 for the next 2 rows, then 0.\n\nBut how to model this? Perhaps the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the number of 8s is 3 - (i // 5). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s is determined by the number of rows where the input has a 5 in the column. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first 5 rows. So for rows 0-4, the 8s are 3, then for rows 5-6, 3, then rows 7-8, 2, etc.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, the first 5 rows have 3 8s, then for rows 5-6, 3, then rows 7-8, 2, then rows 9-10, 1, then rows 11-13, 0.\n\nThis seems to be a pattern where the number of 8s decreases by 1 every 3 rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the key is to find that for each row, the 8s are in the first few columns, and the 6s are in the next columns, but the number of 8s and 6s decreases as the row index increases. But how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the number of 8s is (some function of i). Let's say that for the first 5 rows, it's 3, then for rows 5-6, it's 3, then rows 7-8, 2, then rows 9-10, 1, then 0. This could be modeled as:\n\nnumber_of_8s = 3 - (i // 5) if i < 10 else 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s is determined by the number of rows where the input has a 5. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first 5 rows. So for rows 0-4, the number of 8s is 3. For rows 5-6, it's 3. For rows 7-8, 2. For rows 9-10, 1. For rows 11-13, 0.\n\nBut how to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s is determined by the minimum between the row index and some value. For example, for row i, the number of 8s is 3 - (i // 5). But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to find that the 8s are in the first few columns for each row, and the 6s are in the next columns, but the number of 8s and 6s decreases as the row index increases. However, without more examples, it's difficult to find the exact pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are in the first three columns for the first few rows, and then the number decreases. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows have 3 8s, then 3, then 2, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the number of 8s for row i is 3 - (i // 5). But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s is determined by the number of rows where the input has a 5 in that column. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first 5 rows. So for rows 0-4, the number of 8s is 3. For rows 5-6, it's 3. For rows 7-8, it's 2. For rows 9-10, it's 1. For rows 11-13, it's 0.\n\nThis suggests that the number of 8s decreases by 1 every 3 rows. But how to model this.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the 8s are in the first few columns for each row, and the number of 8s decreases as the row index increases. For example, in the first few rows, the number of 8s is 3, then 3, then 2, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. The output has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4-5. Then, in rows 5-6, the 6s are in column 4. Then in rows 7-8, the 6s are in column 4. Then in rows 9-10, column 4 is 0. So the 6s are in column 4 for rows 0-4, then 5-6, then 7-8, then 9-10.\n\nThis suggests that the 6s are in column 4 for the first 5 rows, then column 4 for rows 5-6, then column 4 for rows 7-8, then 0.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nFor each cell in the output grid:\n\n- If the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 5.\n- Otherwise, if the cell is to the left of the 5's column in the input, it is 8.\n- If the cell is to the right of the 5's column in the input, it is 6.\n- Otherwise, it is 0.\n\nBut this doesn't fit the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output for rows 5-6 has 8s in columns 0-2, and 0s elsewhere. But according to this logic, if the input has 0 in column 3, then the output would have 8s in columns 0-2, and 6s in columns 4-6. But in the example, it's 0s.\n\nSo this suggests that the 6s are only present when the input has a 5 in that column. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, the 6s are only present in columns to the right of the 5's column for the rows where the input has a 5 in that column. For other rows, the 6s are 0.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I think the best approach is to implement the following logic:\n\nFind the column where the input has a 5 in each row. For each row, if there is a 5, then the output has 8s to the left of that column, 5 in that column, and 6s to the right. For rows where there is no 5, the output has 8s to the left of the 5's column (but since there is no 5, it's 0s).\n\nBut how to find the column where the 5 is in each row.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, for each row, the 5 is in column 3. So for each row, the output has 8s in columns 0-2, 5 in column 3, and 6s in columns 4-5. For other rows, the output has 8s in columns 0-2, and 0s elsewhere.\n\nBut this would mean that the 6s are only present in the first few rows where the input has a 5. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in columns 4-5 for the first 5 rows, then in column 4 for rows 5-6, then in column 4 for rows 7-8, then 0.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nMaybe the number of 6s is determined by the number of rows where the input has a 5 in that column. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first 5 rows. So for those rows, the 6s are in columns 4-5. For rows 5-6, the 6s are in column 4. For rows 7-8, column 4. For rows 9-10, column 4 is 0.\n\nThis suggests that the 6s are in column 4 for the first 5 rows, then in column 4 for rows 5-6, then in column 4 for rows 7-8, then 0.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nFor each cell in the output grid:\n\n- If the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 5.\n- Otherwise, if the cell is to the left of the 5's column in the input, it is 8.\n- If the cell is to the right of the 5's column in the input, it is 6.\n- Otherwise, it is 0.\n\nBut how to find the column where the 5 is in the input for each row.\n\nSo, for each row, find the column c where the input has a 5. If no such column, then the output is 0 for all cells.\n\nBut this would mean that for rows where the input has no 5, the output is 0s.\n\nBut in Example 1, for rows 5-6, the input has 0 in column 3. So the output has 8s in columns 0-2, and 0s elsewhere. But according to this logic, the output would have 8s in columns 0-2, and 6s in columns 4-6, since the 5 is in column 3. But this doesn't fit the example.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to find a different approach. Let's look at the test input.\n\nTest input has 5s in column 3 for the first 7 rows. The output should be similar to the examples. So for the first 7 rows, the output should have 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4-5. Then, for rows 7-13, the output has 8s in columns 0-2, then 0s.\n\nBut how to determine the number of 8s and 6s.\n\nMaybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, the first 7 rows have 3 8s, then 3, then 2, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the number of 8s is 3 - (i // 5). But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nFor each cell in the output grid:\n\n- If the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 5.\n- Otherwise, if the cell is to the left of the 5's column in the input, it is 8.\n- If the cell is to the right of the 5's column in the input, it is 6.\n- Otherwise, it is 0.\n\nBut to find the column where the 5 is in the input for each row, I'll need to find the column c where the input has a 5 in that row. If no such column, then the output is 0.\n\nBut this doesn't fit the examples. For example, in Example 1, for rows 5-6, the input has 0 in column 3. So the output would have 8s in columns 0-2, and 6s in columns 4-6, but in the example, it's 0s.\n\nSo this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output for Example 1:\n\nThe output has 8s in the first three columns for the first 5 rows, then 5, then 6s in columns 4-5. For rows 5-6, the 8s are in columns 0-2, then 0 in column 3, and 0 in columns 4-6. For rows 7-8, the 8s are in columns 0-1, then 0 in column 2, then 0 in column 3, then 0 in columns 4-6. For rows 9-10, 8 in column 0, then 0s. For rows 11-13, 0s.\n\nThis suggests that the number of 8s decreases as the row index increases. So for row i, the number of 8s is 3 - (i // 5). For example:\n\ni=0: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=1: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=2: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=3: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=4: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=5: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=6: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=7: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=8: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=9: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=10: 3 - 2 = 1\n\ni=11: 3 - 2 = 1\n\ni=12: 3 - 2 = 1\n\ni=13: 3 - 3 = 0\n\nBut this doesn't fit the example. For example, in row 5, the number of 8s is 2, but in the example, it's 3. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s is 3 for the first 5 rows, then 3 for the next 2 rows, then 2 for the next 2 rows, then 1 for the next 2 rows, then 0.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nMaybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index, with the number of 8s being 3 - (i // 5). But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Find the column c where the input has a 5. If no such column, then the output for that row is all 0s.\n- Otherwise, for each column in the output:\n   - if column < c: 8\n   - elif column == c: 5\n   - else: 6\n- But this doesn't fit the examples. For example, in Example 1, for rows 5-6, the input has 0 in column 3, so the output would have 8s in columns 0-2, and 6s in columns 4-6. But in the example, it's 0s.\n\nSo this is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time, I'll have to proceed with this approach, even if it's not correct for all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(7)] for _ in range(14)]\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(7):\n            # Find the column c where input has 5 in this row\n            c = None\n            for col in range(7):\n                if grid[i][col] == 5:\n                    c = col\n                    break\n            if c is None:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                if j < c:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif j == c:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 5\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit the examples. For example, in Example 1, for rows 5-6, the input has 0 in column 3, so c is 3. So for j < 3, it's 8, j=3 is 5, j > 3 is 6. But in the example, the output for rows 5-6 is 8 8 8 0 0 0 0. So this code would produce 8 8 8 5 6 6 0, which is not the case. So this is incorrect.\n\nThus, this approach is wrong.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output for rows 5-6 has 8 8 8 0 0 0 0. So the 5 is not present in the input for those rows. So the code should not set the 5 in the output for those rows.\n\nBut according to the code, it would set 5 in column 3, but the input has 0 there. So this is incorrect.\n\nThus, the code should only set 5 in the output if the input has 5 in that column.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nFor each cell in the output:\n\n- if the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 5.\n- else, if the cell is to the left of the 5's column in the input, it is 8.\n- else, if the cell is to the right of the 5's column in the input, it is 6.\n- else, 0.\n\nBut this is not correct for the examples.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach, even if it's not correct for all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(7)] for _ in range(14)]\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(7):\n            # Find the column c where input has 5 in this row\n            c = None\n            for col in range(7):\n                if grid[i][col] == 5:\n                    c = col\n                    break\n            if c is None:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 5\n                elif j < c:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif j > c:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct for the examples. For example, in Example 1, for rows 5-6, the input has 0 in column 3, so c is 3. For j=3, the input is 0, so the code would check if grid[i][j] is 5 (no), then check if j < c (3 < 3: no), then j > c (3 > 3: no), so set to 0. So the output for j=3 is 0, which matches the example. For j=4, it's > c (3), so 6. But in the example, it's 0. So this is incorrect.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to find another pattern. Maybe the 8s are in the first three columns for the first few rows, and then decrease. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows have 3 8s, then 3, then 2, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.\n\nSo, for each row i, the number of 8s is 3 - (i // 5). For example:\n\ni=0: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=1: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=2: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=3: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=4: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=5: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=6: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=7: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=8: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=9: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=10: 3 - 2 = 1\n\ni=11: 3 - 2 = 1\n\ni=12: 3 - 2 = 1\n\ni=13: 3 - 3 = 0\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(7)] for _ in range(14)]\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(7):\n            if i < 5:\n                if j < 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif j == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 5\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n            elif i < 7:\n                if j < 2:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif j == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 5\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n            elif i < 9:\n                if j < 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif j == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 5\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n            elif i < 11:\n                if j < 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif j == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 5\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples.\n\nGiven the time, I think this is the best I can do. The code would handle the first example by having 3 8s for the first 5 rows, then 2 for the next 2 rows, etc. But this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nBut this is not correct for the other examples. For example, in Example 2, the 5s are in column 2 for the first 4 rows. So the code would set 8s in columns 0-1, 5 in column 2, and 6s in columns 3-6. But in the example, the output has 8s in columns 0-1, then 5, then 6s in column 3, then 0s.\n\nBut this is not matching.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this code, even if it's not perfect.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids are transformed into the output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a lot of 0s except for the 5s in the fourth column. The output has 8s and 5s and some 6s and 0s. Hmm. Let me check the positions. The input has 5s in the fourth column for the first 5 rows. The output for those rows has 8s in the first three columns, then 5, then 6s in the next two columns. Then after that, the 8s start to decrease. Wait, maybe the 5s are being transformed into 5s, but the surrounding areas are being modified. Also, the 6s and 8s might be related to the position of the 5s.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 5s in the third column for the first four rows. The output has 8s in the first two columns, then 5, then 6s in the next columns. Then the 8s decrease. So maybe there's a pattern where the 5s are in a certain column and the surrounding cells are transformed based on their position relative to the 5s.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has 5s in the fifth column for the first 8 rows. The output has 8s in the first four columns, then 5, then 6s in the next columns. Then the 8s decrease. So maybe the 5s are in a column, and the cells to the left are 8s, and the cells to the right are 6s, but with some variation based on the row.\n\nWait, maybe the 5s are in a column, and the transformation is that the cells to the left of the 5 are 8s, and the cells to the right are 6s. But how does that work with the rows? For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in column 4 (0-based?), but the output has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 5 and 6. But in the first few rows, the 6s are in columns 5 and 6, but in later rows, they might be fewer. Also, the 8s start to decrease as the rows go down. Maybe the number of 8s decreases as you move down the rows.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has 8s in the first few columns, then 5s, then 6s, then 0s. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being transformed into 5s in the output, but the surrounding cells are transformed based on their position. For example, cells to the left of the 5 are 8s, and cells to the right are 6s. But the 8s might be in a certain number of columns, and the 6s in others. Also, the 8s might be present only up to a certain row.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1, the input has 5s in column 3 (if 0-based, maybe). The output for those rows has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 5 and 6. But in the first 5 rows, the 6s are in columns 5 and 6, but in the next rows, they are only in column 5. Then in the next rows, even fewer. So perhaps the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5, but the number of columns decreases as we go down the rows. Also, the 8s are in the columns to the left of the 5, but the number of 8s decreases as we go down the rows.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the 5s in the input are in a certain column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and 6s in the columns to the right. But the number of 8s and 6s depends on the row. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. The first 5 rows have 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 5 and 6. But in the next rows, the 6s are in column 5 only, then in the next rows, even less. So maybe the number of 8s and 6s is determined by how far the row is from the top.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are in a column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and the 6s in the columns to the right. But the 8s and 6s are only present in certain rows. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows have 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 5 and 6. Then, in the next rows, the 8s start to decrease. Maybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index. Like, for rows 0-4, there are 3 8s (columns 0-2), then for rows 5-7, there are 2 8s (columns 0-1?), then for rows 8-9, 1 8 (column 0?), and so on.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output:\n\nFirst 5 rows: columns 0-2 are 8, then 5, then columns 5 and 6 are 6. Then rows 5-7 have columns 0-2 as 8, then 5, then column 5 as 6. Then rows 8-9: columns 0-1 as 8, then 5, then 0. Then rows 10-13: 8s in columns 0-1, then 5, then 0. Wait, no, looking at the output for Example 1:\n\nThe output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 8 5 6 6 0\n\nRow 1: 8 8 8 5 6 0 0\n\nRow 2: 8 8 8 5 6 0 0\n\nRow 3: 8 8 8 5 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 8 8 8 5 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 6: 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 9: 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 10: 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 13: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo for the first 5 rows (rows 0-4), the 5 is in column 3, then columns 4 and 5 are 6 and 6. Then in rows 5-6, columns 4 and 5 are 0. Then rows 7-8, columns 4 is 0. Then rows 9-10, columns 3 is 0. Hmm, not sure. Maybe the 5s in the input are in a certain column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of the 5, and 6s in the columns to the right. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are in a column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and the 6s in the columns to the right. But the number of 8s and 6s depends on the row. For example, in the first few rows, there are more 8s and 6s, but as the rows go down, the number decreases.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3 (since the input has 5 in column 3 for the first 5 rows). The output for those rows has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4 and 5. Then in rows 5-6, the 6s are in column 4 only. Then in rows 7-8, column 4 is 0. So maybe the 6s are in columns to the right of the 5, but the number of columns decreases as the row index increases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s in the input are in a certain column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of the 5, and 6s in the columns to the right. The 8s and 6s are only present in the rows where the input has a 5 in that column. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the test input. The test input has 5s in column 3 (assuming 0-based) for the first 7 rows. The output for the test input would be similar to the examples. So maybe the transformation is that the 5s in the input are in a column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and 6s in the columns to the right. The number of 8s and 6s depends on the row.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of the input grid as having a certain column where the 5s are. For each row, the 5 is in that column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left, and 6s in the columns to the right. But the 8s and 6s might be limited to certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are in a certain column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and 6s in the columns to the right, but only up to a certain number of rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. The first 5 rows have 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4 and 5. Then, as the rows go down, the 6s and 8s decrease.\n\nAnother idea: The 5s in the input are in a column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and the 6s in the columns to the right. The number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, the first few rows have more 8s, and as the row index increases, the number of 8s decreases. Similarly, the number of 6s to the right of the 5 may decrease.\n\nBut how to translate that into code? Maybe for each cell in the input grid, if the cell is a 5, then in the output, the cells to the left are 8s, and the cells to the right are 6s. But that might not be the case. Wait, looking at Example 1's input, the 5 is in column 3. The output for that row has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4 and 5. So the 5 is in column 3, and the 8s are in columns 0-2, which are to the left of the 5. The 6s are in columns 4 and 5, which are to the right. But in the next rows, the 6s are only in column 4. Then, in later rows, they are 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are in a column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and 6s in the columns to the right, but only up to a certain row. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. The first 5 rows have 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4 and 5. Then, in rows 5-6, the 6s are in column 4. Then, in rows 7-8, the 6s are in column 4, but the 8s are in columns 0-1. Then, in rows 9-10, the 8s are in column 0. Then, in rows 11-13, they are 0.\n\nSo perhaps the number of 8s and 6s depends on the row. For example, the 8s in the left columns are determined by the row index. Maybe the 8s are present in the first (some number) of rows. For example, the first 5 rows have 3 8s (columns 0-2), then 2 8s (columns 0-1), then 1 8 (column 0), then 0.\n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the number of 8s is determined by how far the row is from the top. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows (rows 0-4) have 3 8s. Then rows 5-6 have 2 8s. Rows 7-8 have 1 8. Rows 9-10 have 1 8. Then rows 11-13 have 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 8s is determined by the number of rows where the input has a 5 in that column. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output for each example and see what's happening. For Example 1, the output has 8s in the first three columns for the first 5 rows. Then, in rows 5-6, the 8s are in the first three columns. Then in rows 7-8, the 8s are in the first two columns. Then rows 9-10, first column. Then rows 11-13, zero.\n\nSo maybe the number of 8s is decreasing as the row index increases. For example, the first 5 rows have 3 8s, then 3, then 2, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the number of 8s is (some function of i). But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are present in the first (some number) of rows. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are present in the first 5 rows, then in rows 5-6, they are still present. Then in rows 7-8, they are present. Then in rows 9-10, they are present. Then in rows 11-13, not. So maybe the number of 8s is determined by how many rows are above the 5s in the input. Or perhaps the number of 8s is determined by the distance from the 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are present in the first (some number) of rows where the input has a 5 in the column. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first 5 rows. So the 8s are present in the first 5 rows, but then as the rows go further, they decrease.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are present in the first (some number) of rows, and the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, the first row has 3 8s, then the next row has 3, then 3, then 2, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.\n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the number of 8s is (some function of i). For example, the first 5 rows have 3 8s, then 3, then 2, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 8s is determined by the number of rows where the 5s are in the input. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first 5 rows. So for rows 0-4, there are 3 8s. Then for rows 5-6, there are 3 8s. Then for rows 7-8, 2 8s. Then for rows 9-10, 1 8. Then 0.\n\nThis seems arbitrary. Maybe there's a pattern where the 8s are present in the first (some number) of rows, and the number of 8s decreases as the row index increases.\n\nBut this seems too vague. Maybe the key is that the 5s in the input are in a certain column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and 6s in the columns to the right. The number of 8s and 6s depends on the row index. For example, for each row, the 8s are in the first (some number) columns, and the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of the 5s in the input as being in a column. Let's call that column 'c'. Then, for each row, the output has 8s in columns 0 to (c-1), and 6s in columns (c+1) to (c+something). But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are in a column, and the output has 8s in the columns to the left of that column, and 6s in the columns to the right. However, the 8s and 6s are only present in the first few rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. The output for rows 0-4 has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4 and 5. Then in rows 5-6, the 6s are in column 4, and the 8s are in columns 0-2. Then in rows 7-8, the 8s are in columns 0-1, and the 6s are in column 4. Then in rows 9-10, the 8s are in column 0. Then in rows 11-13, all zeros.\n\nSo the number of 8s is decreasing as the row index increases. The 6s are also decreasing. But how to model this?\n\nMaybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the number of 8s is (some value based on i). For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows (i=0-4) have 3 8s. Then for i=5-6, 3 8s. Then i=7-8, 2 8s. Then i=9-10, 1 8. Then i=11-13, 0.\n\nBut how to compute that? Maybe the number of 8s is the minimum between (some value) and (some function of i). Alternatively, the number of 8s is determined by the row index, but this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are present in the first (some number) of rows, and the number of 8s decreases as the row index increases. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows have 3 8s, then the next 2 rows have 3, then 2, then 1, then 0.\n\nBut this is not helpful for coding.\n\nAnother observation: Looking at the outputs, the 8s and 6s are present in the output only where the input has a 5 in that column. For example, in Example 1, the input has 5s in column 3 for the first 5 rows. The output has 8s in columns 0-2 for those rows, and 6s in columns 4-5. Then, in rows 5-6, the 5s are not in the input (they are 0s), so the output has 8s and 0s. But how does that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 6s are only present in the rows where the input has a 5 in that column. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows have 5s in column 3. So for those rows, the output has 8s to the left of the 5, and 6s to the right. For the other rows, where the input has 0s, the output has 0s.\n\nBut then, in Example 1, the output for rows 5-6 has 8s in columns 0-2, but the input has 0s in those rows. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 6s are present in the output for all rows, but their values depend on the input's 5s. For example, if the input has a 5 in column c, then the output has 8s in columns 0 to c-1, and 6s in columns c+1 to some value.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAnother idea: Let's think of the output as having 8s in the columns to the left of the 5, and 6s in the columns to the right. The 8s and 6s are only present in the first few rows. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. The first 5 rows have 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4-5. Then, in rows 5-6, the 6s are in column 4, and the 8s are in columns 0-2. Then, in rows 7-8, the 8s are in columns 0-1, and the 6s are in column 4. Then in rows 9-10, the 8s are in column 0, and the 6s are in column 4. Then in rows 11-13, all zeros.\n\nThis suggests that the number of 8s decreases as the row index increases, but how to model this? Maybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the number of 8s is (some function of i). For example, the first 5 rows have 3 8s. Then, for rows 5-6, 3 8s. Then for rows 7-8, 2 8s. Then for rows 9-10, 1 8. Then for rows 11-13, 0.\n\nThis seems to be a pattern where the number of 8s decreases as the row index increases. But how to translate that into code?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 8s is determined by the distance from the top. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows have 3 8s. Then, as the rows go down, the number of 8s decreases by 1 every certain rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of 8s is determined by the number of rows where the input has a 5 in that column. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first 5 rows. So the number of 8s is 3 for those rows, then decreases.\n\nBut this is not helpful for coding.\n\nMaybe the key is to find that for each row, the 8s are in the first (some number) columns, and the 6s are in the columns after the 5. The number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, in the first few rows, the number of 8s is 3, then decreases.\n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the number of 8s is (some value) minus the row index. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows have 3 8s. Then, for row i, the number of 8s is 3 - (i // 5). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, in the first 5 rows, the number of 8s is 3. Then for rows 5-6, 3. Then for rows 7-8, 2. Then for rows 9-10, 1. Then for rows 11-13, 0. So the number of 8s decreases by 1 every 3 rows. But this is not a clear pattern.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows:\n\nFor each cell in the output grid, if the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 5. Otherwise, if the cell is to the left of the 5s in the input, it's 8. If to the right, it's 6. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has 5s in column 3 for the first 5 rows. The output for those rows has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4 and 5. So for those rows, the cells to the left of the 5 are 8s, and to the right are 6s. But for rows 5-6, the input has 0s, but the output has 8s in columns 0-2, and 0s elsewhere. So this suggests that the 8s are present in the output for all rows, but only for the columns to the left of the 5s in the input.\n\nBut how to determine which columns are to the left of the 5s in the input. Maybe the 5s in the input are in a certain column, and for each row, the cells to the left of that column are 8s, and to the right are 6s.\n\nBut in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. So for rows where the input has 5 in column 3, the output has 8s in columns 0-2, and 6s in columns 4-5. For rows where the input has 0 in column 3, the output has 8s in columns 0-2, and 0s elsewhere. But this doesn't fit the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 6s are determined by the position of the 5 in the input. For example, if the input has a 5 in column c, then the output has 8s in columns 0 to c-1, and 6s in columns c+1 to some value.\n\nBut how to determine that. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. The output has 8s in columns 0-2, and 6s in columns 4-5. Then, in rows where the input has 0 in column 3, the output has 8s in columns 0-2, and 0s elsewhere.\n\nBut this seems to fit the examples. So the idea is that for each cell in the output, if the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 5. Otherwise, if the cell is to the left of the 5 in the input, it's 8. If to the right, it's 6. But this doesn't fit the examples, because in Example 1, the output for rows 5-6 has 8s in columns 0-2, but the input for those rows has 0 in column 3.\n\nWait, but in the output for rows 5-6, the input has 0 in column 3. So according to this logic, the output would have 8s in columns 0-2, and 0s elsewhere. But in the output for Example 1, rows 5-6 have 8s in columns 0-2, then 0 in column 3, and then 0 in columns 4-6. So that fits.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is: for each cell in the output grid, if the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 5. Otherwise, if the cell is to the left of the 5 in the input, it's 8. If to the right, it's 6. But how to determine the column where the 5 is in the input.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. So for each row, the cells to the left of column 3 are 8, and to the right are 6. But in the input, for rows where the 5 is not present, the output has 8s to the left and 0s to the right. But in the output for rows 5-6, the input has 0 in column 3, so the output has 8s to the left of column 3, and 0s to the right.\n\nBut this would mean that the 8s are present in all rows for columns to the left of the 5's column, and 6s are present in columns to the right of the 5's column. But this doesn't fit the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 0 has 8s in columns 0-2, 5, 6s in columns 4-5. But for row 5, the input has 0 in column 3, so the output has 8s in columns 0-2, then 0 in column 3, and 0s in columns 4-6.\n\nThis seems to fit. But then, what about the 6s? In the output for rows 0-4, the columns to the right of the 5 are 6s. But in rows 5-6, the columns to the right are 0. So why are the 6s present in the first few rows?\n\nAh, perhaps the 6s are only present if the input has a 5 in that column. So, for each cell in the output, if the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 5. Otherwise, if the cell is to the left of the 5's column, it's 8. If to the right, it's 6. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has 5s in column 3 for the first 5 rows. The output for those rows has 6s in columns 4 and 5. For other rows, the output has 0s in those columns. So this suggests that the 6s are only present in the rows where the input has 5 in column 3.\n\nBut how to determine the column where the 5 is in the input. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in column 3. In Example 2, the 5 is in column 2. In Example 3, the 5 is in column 4.\n\nSo the transformation seems to be:\n\nFor each row, find the column where the input has a 5. Then, for that row, the output has 8s in columns to the left of that column, 5 in that column, and 6s in columns to the right. For rows where there is no 5, the output has 8s in columns to the left of the 5's column (but since there is no 5, maybe it's 0s or something else).\n\nWait, but in Example 1, for rows where there is no 5, the output has 8s in columns to the left of the 5's column (column 3). For example, in rows 5-6, the input has 0s in column 3. So the output has 8s in columns 0-2, and 0s elsewhere.\n\nBut how to find the column where the 5 is in the input for each row. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows have 5 in column 3. The other rows have 0 in column 3.\n\nSo the transformation could be:\n\nFor each row, find the column c where the input has a 5. If there is no such column, then the output is 0s. Otherwise, for each cell in the output:\n\n- If the cell is in column c: output is 5.\n- If the cell is to the left of c: output is 8.\n- If the cell is to the right of c: output is 6.\n\nBut wait, this would mean that for rows where the input has a 5 in column c, the output has 8s to the left of c, 5 in c, and 6s to the right. For rows where the input has no 5, the output is 0s.\n\nBut this doesn't fit the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 0 is 8 8 8 5 6 6 0. So columns 0-2 are 8, column 3 is 5, columns 4-5 are 6, column 6 is 0. But according to the above logic, columns to the right of c (3) would be 6s. But column 6 is 0. So this suggests that the 6s are only in certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 6s are only in columns to the right of c, but up to a certain number of columns. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in columns 4 and 5 for the first 5 rows. Then, in rows 5-6, the 6s are in column 4. Then in rows 7-8, column 4 is 0. So this suggests that the number of 6s depends on the row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 6s are only in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are present in columns 4-5 for the first 5 rows, then in column 4 for rows 5-6, then in column 4 for rows 7-8, then 0. This seems arbitrary.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to find a pattern based on the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 5s in column 3 for the first 5 rows. The output for those rows has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4 and 5. Then, for rows 5-6, the output has 8s in columns 0-2, then 0 in column 3, then 0 in columns 4-6. For rows 7-8, the output has 8s in columns 0-1, then 0 in column 2, then 0 in column 3, then 0 in columns 4-6. For rows 9-10, 8 in column 0, then 0s elsewhere. For rows 11-13, 0s.\n\nSo the number of 8s decreases as the row index increases. It starts with 3 8s (columns 0-2), then 3, then 2, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.\n\nThis seems like the number of 8s is 3 for the first 5 rows, then 3 for the next 2 rows, then 2 for the next 2 rows, then 1 for the next 2 rows, then 0.\n\nBut how to model this? Perhaps the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the number of 8s is 3 - (i // 5). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s is determined by the number of rows where the input has a 5 in the column. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first 5 rows. So for rows 0-4, the 8s are 3, then for rows 5-6, 3, then rows 7-8, 2, etc.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, the first 5 rows have 3 8s, then for rows 5-6, 3, then rows 7-8, 2, then rows 9-10, 1, then rows 11-13, 0.\n\nThis seems to be a pattern where the number of 8s decreases by 1 every 3 rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the key is to find that for each row, the 8s are in the first few columns, and the 6s are in the next columns, but the number of 8s and 6s decreases as the row index increases. But how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the number of 8s is (some function of i). Let's say that for the first 5 rows, it's 3, then for rows 5-6, it's 3, then rows 7-8, 2, then rows 9-10, 1, then 0. This could be modeled as:\n\nnumber_of_8s = 3 - (i // 5) if i < 10 else 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s is determined by the number of rows where the input has a 5. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first 5 rows. So for rows 0-4, the number of 8s is 3. For rows 5-6, it's 3. For rows 7-8, 2. For rows 9-10, 1. For rows 11-13, 0.\n\nBut how to calculate this.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s is determined by the minimum between the row index and some value. For example, for row i, the number of 8s is 3 - (i // 5). But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to find that the 8s are in the first few columns for each row, and the 6s are in the next columns, but the number of 8s and 6s decreases as the row index increases. However, without more examples, it's difficult to find the exact pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are in the first three columns for the first few rows, and then the number decreases. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows have 3 8s, then 3, then 2, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the number of 8s for row i is 3 - (i // 5). But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s is determined by the number of rows where the input has a 5 in that column. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first 5 rows. So for rows 0-4, the number of 8s is 3. For rows 5-6, it's 3. For rows 7-8, it's 2. For rows 9-10, it's 1. For rows 11-13, it's 0.\n\nThis suggests that the number of 8s decreases by 1 every 3 rows. But how to model this.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the 8s are in the first few columns for each row, and the number of 8s decreases as the row index increases. For example, in the first few rows, the number of 8s is 3, then 3, then 2, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the 5s are in column 3. The output has 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4-5. Then, in rows 5-6, the 6s are in column 4. Then in rows 7-8, the 6s are in column 4. Then in rows 9-10, column 4 is 0. So the 6s are in column 4 for rows 0-4, then 5-6, then 7-8, then 9-10.\n\nThis suggests that the 6s are in column 4 for the first 5 rows, then column 4 for rows 5-6, then column 4 for rows 7-8, then 0.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe the 6s are in the columns to the right of the 5's column, but only for the first few rows.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nFor each cell in the output grid:\n\n- If the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 5.\n- Otherwise, if the cell is to the left of the 5's column in the input, it is 8.\n- If the cell is to the right of the 5's column in the input, it is 6.\n- Otherwise, it is 0.\n\nBut this doesn't fit the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output for rows 5-6 has 8s in columns 0-2, and 0s elsewhere. But according to this logic, if the input has 0 in column 3, then the output would have 8s in columns 0-2, and 6s in columns 4-6. But in the example, it's 0s.\n\nSo this suggests that the 6s are only present when the input has a 5 in that column. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, the 6s are only present in columns to the right of the 5's column for the rows where the input has a 5 in that column. For other rows, the 6s are 0.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I think the best approach is to implement the following logic:\n\nFind the column where the input has a 5 in each row. For each row, if there is a 5, then the output has 8s to the left of that column, 5 in that column, and 6s to the right. For rows where there is no 5, the output has 8s to the left of the 5's column (but since there is no 5, it's 0s).\n\nBut how to find the column where the 5 is in each row.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, for each row, the 5 is in column 3. So for each row, the output has 8s in columns 0-2, 5 in column 3, and 6s in columns 4-5. For other rows, the output has 8s in columns 0-2, and 0s elsewhere.\n\nBut this would mean that the 6s are only present in the first few rows where the input has a 5. For example, in Example 1, the 6s are in columns 4-5 for the first 5 rows, then in column 4 for rows 5-6, then in column 4 for rows 7-8, then 0.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nMaybe the number of 6s is determined by the number of rows where the input has a 5 in that column. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the first 5 rows. So for those rows, the 6s are in columns 4-5. For rows 5-6, the 6s are in column 4. For rows 7-8, column 4. For rows 9-10, column 4 is 0.\n\nThis suggests that the 6s are in column 4 for the first 5 rows, then in column 4 for rows 5-6, then in column 4 for rows 7-8, then 0.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nFor each cell in the output grid:\n\n- If the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 5.\n- Otherwise, if the cell is to the left of the 5's column in the input, it is 8.\n- If the cell is to the right of the 5's column in the input, it is 6.\n- Otherwise, it is 0.\n\nBut how to find the column where the 5 is in the input for each row.\n\nSo, for each row, find the column c where the input has a 5. If no such column, then the output is 0 for all cells.\n\nBut this would mean that for rows where the input has no 5, the output is 0s.\n\nBut in Example 1, for rows 5-6, the input has 0 in column 3. So the output has 8s in columns 0-2, and 0s elsewhere. But according to this logic, the output would have 8s in columns 0-2, and 6s in columns 4-6, since the 5 is in column 3. But this doesn't fit the example.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to find a different approach. Let's look at the test input.\n\nTest input has 5s in column 3 for the first 7 rows. The output should be similar to the examples. So for the first 7 rows, the output should have 8s in columns 0-2, then 5, then 6s in columns 4-5. Then, for rows 7-13, the output has 8s in columns 0-2, then 0s.\n\nBut how to determine the number of 8s and 6s.\n\nMaybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, the first 7 rows have 3 8s, then 3, then 2, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s is determined by the row index. For example, for row i, the number of 8s is 3 - (i // 5). But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nFor each cell in the output grid:\n\n- If the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 5.\n- Otherwise, if the cell is to the left of the 5's column in the input, it is 8.\n- If the cell is to the right of the 5's column in the input, it is 6.\n- Otherwise, it is 0.\n\nBut to find the column where the 5 is in the input for each row, I'll need to find the column c where the input has a 5 in that row. If no such column, then the output is 0.\n\nBut this doesn't fit the examples. For example, in Example 1, for rows 5-6, the input has 0 in column 3. So the output would have 8s in columns 0-2, and 6s in columns 4-6, but in the example, it's 0s.\n\nSo this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output for Example 1:\n\nThe output has 8s in the first three columns for the first 5 rows, then 5, then 6s in columns 4-5. For rows 5-6, the 8s are in columns 0-2, then 0 in column 3, and 0 in columns 4-6. For rows 7-8, the 8s are in columns 0-1, then 0 in column 2, then 0 in column 3, then 0 in columns 4-6. For rows 9-10, 8 in column 0, then 0s. For rows 11-13, 0s.\n\nThis suggests that the number of 8s decreases as the row index increases. So for row i, the number of 8s is 3 - (i // 5). For example:\n\ni=0: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=1: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=2: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=3: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=4: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=5: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=6: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=7: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=8: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=9: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=10: 3 - 2 = 1\n\ni=11: 3 - 2 = 1\n\ni=12: 3 - 2 = 1\n\ni=13: 3 - 3 = 0\n\nBut this doesn't fit the example. For example, in row 5, the number of 8s is 2, but in the example, it's 3. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s is 3 for the first 5 rows, then 3 for the next 2 rows, then 2 for the next 2 rows, then 1 for the next 2 rows, then 0.\n\nBut how to model this.\n\nMaybe the number of 8s is determined by the row index, with the number of 8s being 3 - (i // 5). But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- Find the column c where the input has a 5. If no such column, then the output for that row is all 0s.\n- Otherwise, for each column in the output:\n   - if column < c: 8\n   - elif column == c: 5\n   - else: 6\n- But this doesn't fit the examples. For example, in Example 1, for rows 5-6, the input has 0 in column 3, so the output would have 8s in columns 0-2, and 6s in columns 4-6. But in the example, it's 0s.\n\nSo this is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time, I'll have to proceed with this approach, even if it's not correct for all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(7)] for _ in range(14)]\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(7):\n            # Find the column c where input has 5 in this row\n            c = None\n            for col in range(7):\n                if grid[i][col] == 5:\n                    c = col\n                    break\n            if c is None:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                if j < c:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif j == c:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 5\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit the examples. For example, in Example 1, for rows 5-6, the input has 0 in column 3, so c is 3. So for j < 3, it's 8, j=3 is 5, j > 3 is 6. But in the example, the output for rows 5-6 is 8 8 8 0 0 0 0. So this code would produce 8 8 8 5 6 6 0, which is not the case. So this is incorrect.\n\nThus, this approach is wrong.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output for rows 5-6 has 8 8 8 0 0 0 0. So the 5 is not present in the input for those rows. So the code should not set the 5 in the output for those rows.\n\nBut according to the code, it would set 5 in column 3, but the input has 0 there. So this is incorrect.\n\nThus, the code should only set 5 in the output if the input has 5 in that column.\n\nSo, the correct approach is:\n\nFor each cell in the output:\n\n- if the input cell is 5, then the output cell is 5.\n- else, if the cell is to the left of the 5's column in the input, it is 8.\n- else, if the cell is to the right of the 5's column in the input, it is 6.\n- else, 0.\n\nBut this is not correct for the examples.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach, even if it's not correct for all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(7)] for _ in range(14)]\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(7):\n            # Find the column c where input has 5 in this row\n            c = None\n            for col in range(7):\n                if grid[i][col] == 5:\n                    c = col\n                    break\n            if c is None:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 5\n                elif j < c:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif j > c:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct for the examples. For example, in Example 1, for rows 5-6, the input has 0 in column 3, so c is 3. For j=3, the input is 0, so the code would check if grid[i][j] is 5 (no), then check if j < c (3 < 3: no), then j > c (3 > 3: no), so set to 0. So the output for j=3 is 0, which matches the example. For j=4, it's > c (3), so 6. But in the example, it's 0. So this is incorrect.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to find another pattern. Maybe the 8s are in the first three columns for the first few rows, and then decrease. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows have 3 8s, then 3, then 2, then 2, then 1, then 1, then 0.\n\nSo, for each row i, the number of 8s is 3 - (i // 5). For example:\n\ni=0: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=1: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=2: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=3: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=4: 3 - 0 = 3\n\ni=5: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=6: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=7: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=8: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=9: 3 - 1 = 2\n\ni=10: 3 - 2 = 1\n\ni=11: 3 - 2 = 1\n\ni=12: 3 - 2 = 1\n\ni=13: 3 - 3 = 0\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(7)] for _ in range(14)]\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(7):\n            if i < 5:\n                if j < 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif j == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 5\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n            elif i < 7:\n                if j < 2:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif j == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 5\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n            elif i < 9:\n                if j < 1:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif j == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 5\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n            elif i < 11:\n                if j < 0:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 8\n                elif j == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 5\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 6\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples.\n\nGiven the time, I think this is the best I can do. The code would handle the first example by having 3 8s for the first 5 rows, then 2 for the next 2 rows, etc. But this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nBut this is not correct for the other examples. For example, in Example 2, the 5s are in column 2 for the first 4 rows. So the code would set 8s in columns 0-1, 5 in column 2, and 6s in columns 3-6. But in the example, the output has 8s in columns 0-1, then 5, then 6s in column 3, then 0s.\n\nBut this is not matching.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this code, even if it's not perfect.\n"
