The numbers seem to be spreading in a diagonal manner, with the number of cells they spread to increasing as the value increases.\n\nFrom the examples, I can see that:\n1. The number 3 in Example 1 spreads to the right and down\n2. The number 4 in Example 2 spreads to the right and down\n3. The number 7 in Example 3 spreads to the right and down\n\nBased on this, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading numbers to adjacent cells in a diagonal pattern, with the number of cells they spread to increasing as the value increases.\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            if value == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # Spread the value to adjacent cells in a diagonal pattern\n            for dx in range(1, value + 1):\n                for dy in range(1, value + 1):\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    if 0 <= ni < 10 and 0 <= nj < 10:\n                        transformed_grid[ni][nj] = value\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            if value == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # Spread the value to adjacent cells in a diagonal pattern\n            for dx in range(1, value + 1):\n                for dy in range(1, value + 1):\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    if 0 <= ni < 10 and 0 <= nj < 10:\n                        transformed_grid[ni][nj] = value\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
