          "Let's analyze the data and deduce a likely transformation pattern:\n\n### Observations:\n\n- All inputs are 4x7 grids, outputs are always 4x3 grids.\n- The columns with '1' (blue in images) serve as a center vertical line in inputs.\n- Inputs have '7' (orange) to the left of the column with '1'.\n- Inputs have '5' or '0' (gray or black) to the right of the column with '1'.\n- Outputs are 4 rows x 3 columns.\n- Output \"3\" (green) seems to correspond to certain clusters of '7's in input.\n- Output \"0\" at other positions.\n- The blue column (with '1's) serves as a vertical axis or separator.\n- Pattern in output columns: output col 0 and col 2 can be nonzero (3), col 1 is sometimes 3 but often 0.\n- It seems output col 1 sometimes indicates if '7's are on the right side of the blue column.\n- Output cells mark the presence of '7's near corresponding rows in input to the left and possibly right of the blue column.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n\n- Output grid is 4x3 with each row corresponding to input row.\n- Output columns correspond to:\n  - col 0: presence of '7' in left part, left half of input left of blue ('1') column.\n  - col 1: presence of '7' nearby the blue column (possibly the blue column itself or adjacent cells).\n  - col 2: presence of '7' in right part, right half of input right of blue column.\n\nBut '7' appears mostly left of blue line in inputs, and rarely on the right. Maybe:\n\n- Output col 0: is 3 if in the input row, there is a '7' in columns left to the blue column (excluding the blue).\n- Output col 1: is 3 if in the input row, the column with '1' contains '7' in neighboring rows? But '1's are always '1', so maybe col 1 set to 3 when a '7' is in the column adjacent to the blue column.\n- Output col 2: is 3 if in the input row there's a '7' in columns to the right of the blue column.\n\nLet's verify based on one example:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nInput: (row 0) 7 7 0 1 5 0 0  \n'7's in cols 0 and 1 (left of col 3 where '1' is).\n\nOutput row 0: 0 0 3 \u2014 so col 2 is marked but not col 0. Hmmm. That contradicts the previous guess.\n\nLet's try instead to map differently:\n\n- The blue '1' column is at index 3.\n- Possibly output columns correspond to input columns as:\n\n  - Output col 0 = input col 0 (or 1) \u2014 presence of '7' corresponds to output 3.\n  - Output col 1 = input col 2 (near '1') or input col 3 ('1' column)\n  - Output col 2 = input col 4 (or beyond) - presence of '5' might lead to 3 in output?\n\nLooking back:\n\n- Output marks 3 where input has '7' on left side in that row corresponding to output col.\n- Maybe output col 2 maps to presence of '5' on right side.\n\nTry a simplified approach:\n\n- For each output row:\n  - Check input columns 0 to 2 for '7'; if any, output cell (row,0) = 3 else 0\n  - Check input column 3 (blue '1') - always 1, output (row,1) is usually 0 or 3 in some examples - but let's say output (row,1) = 3 if input col 3 is '7' (rare) else 0\n  - Check input cols 4 to 6 for '5' - if present, output (row,2) = 3 else 0\n\nCheck example 1:\n\nRow 0 input cols #0-2: 7 7 0 \u2014 contains '7' -> output (0,0) = 3 (expected output is 0, so no)\nRow 0 input col 4-6: 5 0 0 contains '5' -> output(0,2) = 3 correct\n\nBut output (0,0) is 0, not 3 in example 1. So rule must be more selective.\n\n---\n\nLook at outputs: All '3's are in output matrix. No '7' in output.\n\nPossibility: Output highlights **top-left corners** of clusters of '7' in input (like bounding boxes).\n\nOr output are marking locations of connected '7' clusters mapped to 3 columns based on position.\n\n---\n\nSince full pattern is unclear but:\n- Input rows = output rows (4 each)\n- Output columns = 3 (fixed)\n- The main idea seems to be capturing locations of '7's in some summarized 3-column layout\n\n---\n\n### Proposed best-effort solution:\n\n- Identify positions of '7's in input grid.\n- For each row in input:\n  - output_col0 = 3 if count of '7' in left 3 columns (cols 0-2) >= 1 else 0\n  - output_col1 = 3 if '7' in col 3 (the blue col) else 0 \u2014 but this is always '1' so likely 0 always\n  - output_col2 = 3 if '7' in right 3 columns (cols 4-6) else 0\n\nThis roughly splits input horizontally into 3 parts (left, middle, right)\n\nAlso, I note from images that green marks are filled in odd shapes, so maybe the above logic is the best approximate guess given info.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation:\n\n- For each row, check for presence of '7' in these three subgroups to set output accordingly.\n- Return 4x3 output grid with 3s and 0s.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize output grid: 4 rows, 3 cols fill 0\n    output = [[0, 0, 0] for _ in range(4)]\n    \n    for r in range(4):\n        # Check left part (cols 0-2) for '7'\n        if any(grid[r][c] == 7 for c in range(0, 3)):\n            output[r][0] = 3\n        else:\n            output[r][0] = 0\n        \n        # Check middle col (col 3) - '1' always, so 0\n        output[r][1] = 0\n        \n        # Check right part (cols 4-6) for '7'\n        if any(grid[r][c] == 7 for c in range(4, 7)):\n            output[r][2] = 3\n        else:\n            output[r][2] = 0\n    \n    return output\n```"
