From the examples, it appears that:\n\n1. Values in the first 8 columns (columns 0-7) seem to be being shifted or replaced based on their position.\n2. Values in the last 15 columns (columns 8-22) also show some pattern, with values being replaced or shifted.\n3. There seems to be a pattern where values in the first part of the grid are being copied or modified in a way that creates a repeating pattern.\n4. In some examples, values are being replaced with the same value from a previous row or column.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that copies values from the first row to the subsequent rows in a way that creates a repeating pattern.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 23x23 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(23)] for _ in range(23)]\n    \n    # Copy values from the first row to the subsequent rows\n    for row in range(23):\n        for col in range(23):\n            # For the first 8 columns, copy from the first row\n            if col < 8:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[0][col]\n            # For the last 15 columns, copy from the first row\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[0][col]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 23x23 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(23)] for _ in range(23)]\n    \n    # Copy values from the first row to the subsequent rows\n    for row in range(23):\n        for col in range(23):\n            # For the first 8 columns, copy from the first row\n            if col < 8:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[0][col]\n            # For the last 15 columns, copy from the first row\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[0][col]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

Values in the last 15 columns (columns 8-22) also show some pattern, with values being replaced or shifted.\n3. There seems to be a pattern where values in the first part of the grid are being copied or modified in a way that creates a repeating pattern.\n4. In some examples, values are being replaced with the same value from a previous row or column.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that copies values from the first row to the subsequent rows in a way that creates a repeating pattern.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 23x23 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(23)] for _ in range(23)]\n    \n    # Copy values from the first row to the subsequent rows\n    for row in range(23):\n        for col in range(23):\n            # For the first 8 columns, copy from the first row\n            if col < 8:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[0][col]\n            # For the last 15 columns, copy from the first row\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[0][col]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 23x23 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(23)] for _ in range(23)]\n    \n    # Copy values from the first row to the subsequent rows\n    for row in range(23):\n        for col in range(23):\n            # For the first 8 columns, copy from the first row\n            if col < 8:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[0][col]\n            # For the last 15 columns, copy from the first row\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[0][col]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
