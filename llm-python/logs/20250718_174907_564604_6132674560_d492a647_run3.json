Preserving some structure while modifying others\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with 3 or 1 based on their position and value.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values with 3 or 1 based on position and value\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(16):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5 and (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5 and (i + j) % 2 == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 0 and (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 0 and (i + j) % 2 == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
