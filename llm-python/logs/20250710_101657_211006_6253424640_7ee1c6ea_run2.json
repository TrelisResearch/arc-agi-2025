          "Let's analyze the training examples:\n\n1. From the numeric grids and the color-coded images, we see a clear pattern:\n   - The input grids have a large ring or square frame of a particular color (9, 8, 3 in the numeric examples) mostly unchanged between input and output.\n   - Inside this ring, there is a region of a specific color (5) that usually forms shapes like crosses or pluses or connected regions.\n   - The main transformation happens inside the colored shape (color 5).\n   - Within this inner shape, some values neighboring a ring of that color (5) are changed to the ring's \"opposite\" or companion color.\n   \n2. More specifically:\n   - At positions inside the central colored shape (5), the transformation sometimes swaps some values with others \u2014 specifically swapping certain pairs of colors.\n   - Certain local blocks (2x2 or 3x3) inside the shape have some swapping or flipping of colors.\n   - This swapping is asymmetric: some colors within the shape are replaced by other colors in specific positions related to neighbors.\n\n3. Looking closely at the examples:\n   - In example 1: inside the 5-colored shape, some occurrences of 9 change to 4 or vice versa.\n   - In example 2: inside the 5-colored shape, 6 and 8 swap places in certain positions in a pattern that looks like a checkerboard.\n   - In example 3: inside the 5-colored shape, 2 and 3 values swap places in complex local patterns.\n\nHence, the core transformation seems to be:\n\n- Identify the inner region of color 5.\n- For each cell inside this region, if its value is one of two \"dominant\" colors inside the shape, swap it with the other color.\n- These two dominant colors are different per example:\n  - Ex1 inside shape: 4 and 9 swap\n  - Ex2 inside shape: 6 and 8 swap\n  - Ex3 inside shape: 2 and 3 swap\n\nThe outer shape (color 5) remains untouched, only cells of these two internal colors are swapped.\n\n-----\n\nBased on this, a good heuristic solution is:\n\n1. Find the unique color that forms the large connected \"inner shape\" (in training all are color 5).\n\n2. Find the colors inside this shape other than 5 itself.\n\n3. Find the two most frequent colors (besides 5) inside the shape.\n\n4. Swap the two colors inside the shape.\n\n5. Leave all else as is.\n\n-----\n\nLet's implement this.\n\nNote: The grid is always 10x10.\n\n-----\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert to numpy for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Identify the color of the largest connected \"inner shape\"\n    # In training, it's always 5, so we take 5 as the shape color\n    shape_color = 5\n    \n    # Create mask for cells inside the shape\n    mask = (grid_np == shape_color)\n    \n    # Find colors inside the shape excluding the shape color itself\n    inner_colors = grid_np[mask]\n    # Actually, inner_colors are all 5, so check neighbors: We want colors inside the shape area\n    # However, some shape cells have colors other than 5 (e.g. the swapped colors)\n    # So actually, shape area may include cells equal to 5 and also cells with 5-colored shape neighbors\n    \n    # Instead, find all cells fully enclosed by shape_color - but to keep it simple,\n    # Let's consider the bounding box of all shape_color cells:\n    rows, cols = np.where(mask)\n    rmin, rmax = rows.min(), rows.max()\n    cmin, cmax = cols.min(), cols.max()\n    \n    # The \"inner shape area\" is roughly inside this bounding box.\n    # Consider all cells inside this bounding box that are not shape_color\n    inner_area = grid_np[rmin:rmax+1, cmin:cmax+1]\n    \n    # Get colors inside inner_area excluding shape_color\n    colors_in_inner_area = inner_area[inner_area != shape_color]\n    \n    # If no colors other than shape_color, do nothing\n    if len(colors_in_inner_area) == 0:\n        return grid\n    \n    # Find the two most frequent colors inside the inner area besides shape_color\n    from collections import Counter\n    freq = Counter(colors_in_inner_area)\n    most_common = freq.most_common(2)\n    \n    if len(most_common) < 2:\n        # Only one color inside, no swap possible\n        return grid\n    \n    c1, _ = most_common[0]\n    c2, _ = most_common[1]\n    \n    # Perform swapping of c1 and c2 only inside the bounding box inner_area (not outside)\n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    subgrid = transformed[rmin:rmax+1, cmin:cmax+1]\n    \n    # Swap c1 and c2 in subgrid\n    mask_c1 = (subgrid == c1)\n    mask_c2 = (subgrid == c2)\n    subgrid[mask_c1] = c2\n    subgrid[mask_c2] = c1\n    \n    transformed[rmin:rmax+1, cmin:cmax+1] = subgrid\n    \n    return transformed.tolist()\n```\n"

              "Let's analyze the training examples:\n\n1. From the numeric grids and the color-coded images, we see a clear pattern:\n   - The input grids have a large ring or square frame of a particular color (9, 8, 3 in the numeric examples) mostly unchanged between input and output.\n   - Inside this ring, there is a region of a specific color (5) that usually forms shapes like crosses or pluses or connected regions.\n   - The main transformation happens inside the colored shape (color 5).\n   - Within this inner shape, some values neighboring a ring of that color (5) are changed to the ring's \"opposite\" or companion color.\n   \n2. More specifically:\n   - At positions inside the central colored shape (5), the transformation sometimes swaps some values with others \u2014 specifically swapping certain pairs of colors.\n   - Certain local blocks (2x2 or 3x3) inside the shape have some swapping or flipping of colors.\n   - This swapping is asymmetric: some colors within the shape are replaced by other colors in specific positions related to neighbors.\n\n3. Looking closely at the examples:\n   - In example 1: inside the 5-colored shape, some occurrences of 9 change to 4 or vice versa.\n   - In example 2: inside the 5-colored shape, 6 and 8 swap places in certain positions in a pattern that looks like a checkerboard.\n   - In example 3: inside the 5-colored shape, 2 and 3 values swap places in complex local patterns.\n\nHence, the core transformation seems to be:\n\n- Identify the inner region of color 5.\n- For each cell inside this region, if its value is one of two \"dominant\" colors inside the shape, swap it with the other color.\n- These two dominant colors are different per example:\n  - Ex1 inside shape: 4 and 9 swap\n  - Ex2 inside shape: 6 and 8 swap\n  - Ex3 inside shape: 2 and 3 swap\n\nThe outer shape (color 5) remains untouched, only cells of these two internal colors are swapped.\n\n-----\n\nBased on this, a good heuristic solution is:\n\n1. Find the unique color that forms the large connected \"inner shape\" (in training all are color 5).\n\n2. Find the colors inside this shape other than 5 itself.\n\n3. Find the two most frequent colors (besides 5) inside the shape.\n\n4. Swap the two colors inside the shape.\n\n5. Leave all else as is.\n\n-----\n\nLet's implement this.\n\nNote: The grid is always 10x10.\n\n-----\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert to numpy for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Identify the color of the largest connected \"inner shape\"\n    # In training, it's always 5, so we take 5 as the shape color\n    shape_color = 5\n    \n    # Create mask for cells inside the shape\n    mask = (grid_np == shape_color)\n    \n    # Find colors inside the shape excluding the shape color itself\n    inner_colors = grid_np[mask]\n    # Actually, inner_colors are all 5, so check neighbors: We want colors inside the shape area\n    # However, some shape cells have colors other than 5 (e.g. the swapped colors)\n    # So actually, shape area may include cells equal to 5 and also cells with 5-colored shape neighbors\n    \n    # Instead, find all cells fully enclosed by shape_color - but to keep it simple,\n    # Let's consider the bounding box of all shape_color cells:\n    rows, cols = np.where(mask)\n    rmin, rmax = rows.min(), rows.max()\n    cmin, cmax = cols.min(), cols.max()\n    \n    # The \"inner shape area\" is roughly inside this bounding box.\n    # Consider all cells inside this bounding box that are not shape_color\n    inner_area = grid_np[rmin:rmax+1, cmin:cmax+1]\n    \n    # Get colors inside inner_area excluding shape_color\n    colors_in_inner_area = inner_area[inner_area != shape_color]\n    \n    # If no colors other than shape_color, do nothing\n    if len(colors_in_inner_area) == 0:\n        return grid\n    \n    # Find the two most frequent colors inside the inner area besides shape_color\n    from collections import Counter\n    freq = Counter(colors_in_inner_area)\n    most_common = freq.most_common(2)\n    \n    if len(most_common) < 2:\n        # Only one color inside, no swap possible\n        return grid\n    \n    c1, _ = most_common[0]\n    c2, _ = most_common[1]\n    \n    # Perform swapping of c1 and c2 only inside the bounding box inner_area (not outside)\n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    subgrid = transformed[rmin:rmax+1, cmin:cmax+1]\n    \n    # Swap c1 and c2 in subgrid\n    mask_c1 = (subgrid == c1)\n    mask_c2 = (subgrid == c2)\n    subgrid[mask_c1] = c2\n    subgrid[mask_c2] = c1\n    \n    transformed[rmin:rmax+1, cmin:cmax+1] = subgrid\n    \n    return transformed.tolist()\n```\n"
