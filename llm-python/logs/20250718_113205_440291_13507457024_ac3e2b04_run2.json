There seems to be a transformation involving the placement of \"3\" values and their surrounding areas.\n2. In some examples, \"3\" values are replaced with \"1\" values in certain positions.\n3. There appears to be a pattern where \"3\" values are replaced with \"1\" values in specific regions, especially in the middle of the grid.\n4. In some examples, \"2\" values are transformed into \"1\" values in specific positions.\n5. The transformation seems to involve some kind of spatial pattern or rule that affects specific regions of the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values in specific regions of the grid with other values, particularly replacing \"3\" with \"1\" in certain positions.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Check if the cell is a '3' and if it's in a specific region\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace '3' with '1' in specific regions\n                if (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis implementation is a hypothesis based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

There appears to be a pattern where \"3\" values are replaced with \"1\" values in specific regions, especially in the middle of the grid.\n4. In some examples, \"2\" values are transformed into \"1\" values in specific positions.\n5. The transformation seems to involve some kind of spatial pattern or rule that affects specific regions of the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values in specific regions of the grid with other values, particularly replacing \"3\" with \"1\" in certain positions.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Check if the cell is a '3' and if it's in a specific region\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace '3' with '1' in specific regions\n                if (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif (i >= 5 and i <= 6) and (j >= 5 and j <= 6):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis implementation is a hypothesis based on the patterns observed in the training examples. It replaces certain \"3\" values with \"1\" values in specific regions of the grid. The exact pattern is not fully clear, but this is my best attempt based on the given examples.",
