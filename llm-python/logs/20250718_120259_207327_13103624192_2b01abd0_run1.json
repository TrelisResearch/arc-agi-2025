          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a row of 1s in the fifth row. The output for that row is the same. But looking at other rows, like the 7th row in the input is all zeros, but in the output, it's changed to have some 2s and 3s. Wait, the output for the 7th row in Example 1 is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. Hmm. Let me check the input and output for that row. The input row 7 is all zeros. The output row 7 is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. So maybe there's some kind of pattern where certain positions are being modified based on some rules.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has some 8s and 4s in certain positions, and the output changes those. For instance, in the third row of input, there's an 8 in column 9 and 11. In the output, those positions become 8 and 4. Wait, the output for row 3 is 0 0 8 0 8 0 1 0 4 0 4 0. So maybe there's a transformation where certain numbers are replaced based on their position or some other criteria.\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input has a row with 1s and then a row with 5s and 6s. The output changes some of those. For instance, the fifth row in input is all zeros, but in the output, it's 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with numbers based on their position relative to other elements.\n\nHmm, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers based on their position. Let's think about the first example again. The input has a row with 2s and 3s. The output for that row has 3s and 2s. Wait, in the input, the first row is 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0. So the 2s are turned into 3s. Similarly, in the second row of input, the 3 is present, and in the output, it's 2 and 3. Wait, the input row 2 is 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0. The output row 2 is 0 0 3 2 3 3 0 0 0. So the 2s are replaced with 3s, and the 3 is replaced with 2? Or maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being transformed based on their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of symmetry or pattern. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in column 4 (index 3?), and in the output, that's turned into a 3. But maybe there's a rule where if a cell is adjacent to a certain number, it's replaced.\n\nAnother approach: looking for changes in specific positions. Let's look at the first example's output. The fifth row remains the same. The seventh row in input is all zeros, but output has a 2 in the fifth column. The eighth row in input is all zeros, but output has 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0. Wait, that's the same as the input's second row. Wait, no. The input's second row is 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0. The output's eighth row is 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0. So maybe that's a copy? But the output's seventh row is different. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has a row with 1s. The output for that row is the same. But in the output, the seventh row (which was all zeros in input) has a 2 in the fifth column. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with numbers based on some rule. For example, maybe the positions that are in certain rows or columns are being modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers. For example, in Example 2, the input has 8s and 4s, and the output changes them. For example, in row 3 of input, the 8s are in columns 9 and 11. In the output, those positions become 8 and 4. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where numbers are being replaced based on their position relative to other numbers. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 8, it's replaced with a 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid transformation. Like, certain cells are being replaced with a value based on their position. For example, maybe cells that are in certain rows or columns are being modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row with 2s and 3s. The output replaces the 2s with 3s and the 3s with 2s? But that doesn't fit all the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding cells. For example, if a cell has a certain number of adjacent cells with a certain value, then it's replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, certain positions are being filled with specific numbers based on their row or column.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a row with 5s and 6s, and the output changes some of them. For instance, the row in input is 0 0 5 6 6 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 6 5 5 6 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5 and 6s are swapped in some way. Maybe there's a pattern where numbers are being swapped based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of reflection or rotation. For example, if a cell is mirrored or rotated, then its value changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain position, it's replaced with a certain value based on the surrounding cells.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the outputs and see if there's any pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output for the first row is 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0. The input for that row was 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. So the 2s are turned into 3s. In the second row, the input has 2 and 3, and the output has 3 and 2. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being transformed based on their position.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. For example, the fifth row in all examples is left as is. In Example 1, the fifth row is all 1s, and the output is the same. In Example 2, the fifth row is all zeros. In Example 3, the fifth row is all zeros, but in the output, it's changed. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced based on their position relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is in a position that's part of a certain pattern, it's replaced with a different value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell. For example, if the cell is 2, it's replaced with 3, and if it's 3, it's replaced with 2. But that doesn't fit all examples. For instance, in Example 2, there are 8s and 4s. In the output, the 8s are replaced with 4s and vice versa? Or maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with a value based on their position. For example, in the first example, the output's seventh row has a 2 in the fifth column. Maybe that's because the original input had a 2 in that position, but that's not the case. Wait, the input for the seventh row is all zeros. So that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in the grid. For example, if there's a 2 in a certain position, it's replaced with 3. But that's not consistent across examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with the value of their neighbors. For example, in the first example, the input has a 2 in column 4, and the output has a 3. Maybe that's because there's a 3 in a neighboring cell. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output's seventh row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. The input for that row is all zeros. So maybe that's a new cell that's being added based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with values based on their row or column. For example, if the row is even, then certain values are applied.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to think of possible patterns. Let's look at the outputs for each example.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's seventh row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. The input's seventh row is all zeros. So maybe that's a new value introduced in that position. But why?\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1, the first row's 2s are turned into 3s. The second row has a 3 and 2s, which are turned into 3s and 2s. Maybe the transformation is that if a cell is adjacent to a certain value, it's replaced with another. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 2, it's replaced with 3. Or maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of times a certain value appears. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with values based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. For example, in the first example, the seventh row (row index 6, since it's 0-based) in the output has a 2 in the fifth column (column index 4). Maybe that's because that position is in a certain row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their position relative to the original grid. For example, in Example 1, the output's seventh row (row 6) has a 2 in column 4. The original input's row 6 is all zeros. So how does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain patterns. For example, in the first example, the output has some 3s and 2s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is that the output is a modified version of the input where certain cells are replaced with a value based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with the value of the cell that is mirrored or rotated. For example, if a cell is mirrored, its value is changed.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern. Maybe I need to think of other approaches.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a row with 8s and 4s, and the output changes them. For example, in row 3, the input has 8 in column 9 and 11. The output has 8 and 4 in those positions. But in row 4, the input has 8 in column 9 and 11, and the output has 4 and 8. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are swapped with other values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell has a 2 to the left, it's replaced with 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their row and column indices. For example, if the row is even, then certain values are applied.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the output of Example 3. The input has a row with 5s and 6s, and the output has those values swapped in some way. For example, the input row is 0 0 5 6 6 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output row is 0 0 6 5 5 6 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5 and 6 are swapped in some positions. Maybe this is a pattern of swapping adjacent values. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain cells, their value is replaced with a value based on their position. For example, if the cell is in row 3 and column 5, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers. For example, if a cell is 2, it's replaced with 3 if it's in a certain row or column.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's think of the test input. The test input has a grid with 0s and 1s and some 2s and 8s. The output is not given, but the task is to write a function that transforms the input into the output. But since I don't have the test output, I need to make an educated guess based on the training examples.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the positions where changes occur. For example, in Example 1, the output's seventh row has a 2 in the fifth column. The input's seventh row is all zeros. How did that happen? Maybe that position is being set to 2 based on some rule. Maybe the transformation is that certain positions are being filled with 2s or 3s based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell is 2, it's replaced with 3, and if it's 3, it's replaced with 2. But in Example 2, there are 8s and 4s. For example, in the third row of input, the 8 is replaced with 8 and 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with values based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. For instance, in Example 1, the output's seventh row has a 2 in column 4. Maybe that's because that position is in a certain row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell has a 2 in the left or right, it's replaced with 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding cells with certain values. For example, if a cell has a 2 in a neighboring cell, it's replaced with 3.\n\nBut without more data, it's challenging. Let's think of possible patterns that could fit multiple examples.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The first row has 3s where there were 2s. The second row has 3s and 2s. The third row has 3s where there were 2s. The fourth row is all zeros. The fifth row is the same. The seventh row has a 2. The eighth row has the same as the input's second row. The ninth row is the same as the input's third row. The tenth row is the same. The eleventh row is the same. The twelfth row is the same.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is that certain rows are being modified based on their position. For example, rows 1-6 are modified in some way, and rows 7-12 are left as is. But in Example 1, row 7 is modified. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced based on their position. For example, cells in the first four rows are modified, and the rest are not. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the positions where changes occur. For example, in Example 1, the first row's 2s are replaced with 3s. The second row has a 3 and 2s, which are replaced with 3s and 2s. The third row has 2s replaced with 3s. The seventh row has a 2 in the fifth column. The eighth row is the same as the input's second row. So maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being replaced with values based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their position. For example, if the row is less than 5, then certain cells are replaced. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell is 2, it's replaced with 3 if it's in the first four rows. If it's 3, it's replaced with 2. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the first four rows, then certain values are replaced.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to see. Let's think of the third example. The input has a row with 5s and 6s, and the output has them swapped. For example, the input row is 0 0 5 6 6 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output row is 0 0 6 5 5 6 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5 and 6 are swapped in positions 2 and 3, and then positions 4 and 5. Maybe this is a pattern of swapping adjacent values. But how does that fit with other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, then the value is determined by some formula.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the output of Example 2. The input has 8s and 4s. The output has 8s and 4s in some positions. For example, in row 3, the 8s are replaced with 8 and 4. In row 4, the 8s are replaced with 4 and 8. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are swapped with 4 and 8.\n\nBut how to determine this pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on the original grid's values. For example, if the original cell is 2, it's replaced with 3, and if it's 3, it's replaced with 2. But in Example 2, there are 8s and 4s. So maybe this is a pattern of swapping 2 and 3, and 8 and 4.\n\nBut how does this fit with the other examples?\n\nIn Example 1, the first row has 2s replaced with 3s. The second row has 2s and 3s replaced with 3s and 2s. So that might fit with swapping 2 and 3. But in Example 2, the 8s are replaced with 4s and vice versa. So maybe the transformation is that certain values are swapped based on their position.\n\nBut how to determine which values to swap?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain values are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, and i is even, then the value is replaced with a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in the first four rows, then certain values are replaced.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern. Given the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nLet me think of the following hypothesis: The transformation involves swapping certain values based on their position. For example, in the first four rows, certain cells are replaced with 3s and 2s, and in other rows, certain cells are replaced with 4s and 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing cells with values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in the first four rows, then certain values are replaced. For example, in the first example, the first four rows have their 2s replaced with 3s, and 3s replaced with 2s. In the second example, the 8s are replaced with 4s and vice versa. In the third example, the 5s and 6s are swapped.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Maybe the transformation is that certain values are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the first four rows, then certain values are replaced. But how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their position. For example, for each cell, if it's in row i and column j, then the new value is determined by some rule. For example, if the cell is in the first four rows, then if the original value is 2, it becomes 3, and if it's 3, it becomes 2. If it's in other rows, then if the original value is 8, it becomes 4, and vice versa.\n\nBut this is just a guess. How to test this hypothesis?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has 8s and 4s in certain positions. The output has 8s and 4s in some positions. For example, in row 3, the 8s are replaced with 8 and 4. In row 4, the 8s are replaced with 4 and 8. So maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 8s are replaced with 4s and vice versa.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to know. Given that, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation involves swapping certain values based on their position. For example, in the first four rows, 2 and 3 are swapped, and in other rows, 8 and 4 are swapped. But how to determine which rows are which.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, in the first four rows, the values are replaced with 3s and 2s, and in other rows, the values are replaced with 4s and 8s.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, for each cell, if it's in the first four rows, then if the value is 2, it becomes 3, and if it's 3, it becomes 2. If the value is 8, it becomes 4, and if it's 4, it becomes 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut this would fit some examples. For example, in Example 1, the first four rows have 2s replaced with 3s and 3s replaced with 2s. In Example 2, the 8s are replaced with 4s and vice versa. In Example 3, the 5s and 6s are swapped.\n\nBut this doesn't fit all examples. For example, in Example 3, the input has 5 and 6, and the output has them swapped. But according to this hypothesis, those values would not be part of the swapping. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. For example, if the cell is in row 0, then replace 2 with 3, and if it's in row 1, replace 3 with 2, etc.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to write a function that swaps 2 and 3 in certain rows, and 8 and 4 in others, and handles other cases. But how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in the first four rows, then replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. For other rows, replace 8 with 4 and 4 with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nExample 1: Input has 2s in first four rows. Output replaces them with 3s. So that fits. The seventh row is not in the first four rows, so no change. But in the seventh row of the output, there's a 2. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nHmm, this is not working. Maybe the transformation is more complex.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a position where the row is less than 5, then replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. For other rows, replace 8 with 4 and 4 with 8. But this is not working for Example 1's seventh row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain column, then replace with a certain value.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The seventh row in the output has a 2 in the fifth column. The input for that row is all zeros. So maybe this is a new value introduced based on some rule. Perhaps the transformation is that certain cells are being set to 2 or 3 based on their position.\n\nBut without knowing the rule, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to look for patterns where certain cells are being replaced with values based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the seventh row's fifth column is set to 2. Maybe this is because that position is in a certain row and column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a value based on the original cell's value. For example, if the cell is in row 6 (seventh row), then replace it with 2 if it's in column 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain values based on their position. For example, in the first four rows, replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. For other rows, replace 8 with 4 and 4 with 8. Also, for certain positions, like row 6 and column 4, replace with 2.\n\nBut this is not a general solution, but it's the best I can think of.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 2, replace it with 3 if it's in the first four rows, and replace it with 2 if it's in other rows. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their position. For example, in the first four rows, replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. In other rows, replace 8 with 4 and 4 with 8. For other values, leave as is.\n\nBut this would fit some examples, but not all.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first four rows are modified, and the seventh row is not. But in the seventh row of Example 1, there is a 2 in column 4. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on the original cell's value and its position. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, then the new value is determined by some formula involving i and j.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the seventh row's fifth column is set to 2. Maybe that's because i=6 (row index), j=4 (column index). So 6 + 4 = 10, but that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new value is based on the original value plus some function of the row and column.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to write a function that replaces certain values in certain positions based on the examples. For example, in the first example, the first four rows have 2s replaced with 3s. In the second example, 8s are replaced with 4s and vice versa. In the third example, 5s and 6s are swapped.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that:\n\n- For each cell, if it's in the first four rows, replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2.\n- For each cell, if it's in rows 5-12, replace 8 with 4 and 4 with 8.\n- For other values, leave as is.\n- Also, for certain positions like row 6, column 4, set to 2.\n\nBut this is not general.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain values are replaced based on their position. For example, in the first four rows, replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. In other rows, replace 8 with 4 and 4 with 8. And for other values, leave as is.\n\nBut this would not explain the seventh row in Example 1.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the function is:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(12):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(9):\n            if i < 4:\n                if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                    row.append(3)\n                elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                    row.append(2)\n                else:\n                    row.append(grid[i][j])\n            elif i >= 4:\n                if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                    row.append(4)\n                elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                    row.append(8)\n                else:\n                    row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not explain the seventh row in Example 1. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nExample 1's input has a seventh row (i=6) which is all zeros. According to this code, since i >=4, it would check if the value is 8 or 4. Since it's zero, it remains zero. But in the output, the seventh row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. So this code would not generate that. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe the transformation is more complex. Perhaps the seventh row in Example 1 is being modified because it's in a certain row and column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain positions, like row 6, column 4, the value is set to 2. But how to determine which positions.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation involves swapping 2 and 3 in the first four rows, and 8 and 4 in the other rows. Even though this doesn't explain all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(12):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(9):\n            if i < 4:\n                if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                    row.append(3)\n                elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                    row.append(2)\n                else:\n                    row.append(grid[i][j])\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                    row.append(4)\n                elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                    row.append(8)\n                else:\n                    row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not handle the seventh row in Example 1. However, maybe the seventh row in Example 1 is part of the other rows, and the code would leave it as zeros. But in the output, it has a 2. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that for certain positions, like in the seventh row, the value is set to 2. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in the first four rows and has a 2, replace with 3; if it's in the other rows and has a 2, replace with 2. But this doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, in the first four rows, replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. For other rows, replace 8 with 4 and 4 with 8. Also, for certain positions like row 6, column 4, replace with 2.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the code should handle the examples as follows:\n\n- In Example 1, the seventh row has a 2 in column 4. So maybe that's a special case.\n\nBut without knowing the pattern, it's hard to proceed. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that handles the first four rows and other rows, even if it doesn't fully explain all examples.\n\nThe final answer is the code that swaps 2 and 3 in the first four rows, and 8 and 4 in the other rows.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a row of 1s in the fifth row. The output for that row is the same. But looking at other rows, like the 7th row in the input is all zeros, but in the output, it's changed to have some 2s and 3s. Wait, the output for the 7th row in Example 1 is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. Hmm. Let me check the input and output for that row. The input row 7 is all zeros. The output row 7 is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. So maybe there's some kind of pattern where certain positions are being modified based on some rules.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has some 8s and 4s in certain positions, and the output changes those. For instance, in the third row of input, there's an 8 in column 9 and 11. In the output, those positions become 8 and 4. Wait, the output for row 3 is 0 0 8 0 8 0 1 0 4 0 4 0. So maybe there's a transformation where certain numbers are replaced based on their position or some other criteria.\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input has a row with 1s and then a row with 5s and 6s. The output changes some of those. For instance, the fifth row in input is all zeros, but in the output, it's 0 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with numbers based on their position relative to other elements.\n\nHmm, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers based on their position. Let's think about the first example again. The input has a row with 2s and 3s. The output for that row has 3s and 2s. Wait, in the input, the first row is 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0. So the 2s are turned into 3s. Similarly, in the second row of input, the 3 is present, and in the output, it's 2 and 3. Wait, the input row 2 is 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0. The output row 2 is 0 0 3 2 3 3 0 0 0. So the 2s are replaced with 3s, and the 3 is replaced with 2? Or maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being transformed based on their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of symmetry or pattern. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in column 4 (index 3?), and in the output, that's turned into a 3. But maybe there's a rule where if a cell is adjacent to a certain number, it's replaced.\n\nAnother approach: looking for changes in specific positions. Let's look at the first example's output. The fifth row remains the same. The seventh row in input is all zeros, but output has a 2 in the fifth column. The eighth row in input is all zeros, but output has 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0. Wait, that's the same as the input's second row. Wait, no. The input's second row is 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0. The output's eighth row is 0 0 2 3 2 2 0 0 0. So maybe that's a copy? But the output's seventh row is different. Hmm.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input has a row with 1s. The output for that row is the same. But in the output, the seventh row (which was all zeros in input) has a 2 in the fifth column. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with numbers based on some rule. For example, maybe the positions that are in certain rows or columns are being modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers. For example, in Example 2, the input has 8s and 4s, and the output changes them. For example, in row 3 of input, the 8s are in columns 9 and 11. In the output, those positions become 8 and 4. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where numbers are being replaced based on their position relative to other numbers. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 8, it's replaced with a 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid transformation. Like, certain cells are being replaced with a value based on their position. For example, maybe cells that are in certain rows or columns are being modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the input has a row with 2s and 3s. The output replaces the 2s with 3s and the 3s with 2s? But that doesn't fit all the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding cells. For example, if a cell has a certain number of adjacent cells with a certain value, then it's replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, certain positions are being filled with specific numbers based on their row or column.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a row with 5s and 6s, and the output changes some of them. For instance, the row in input is 0 0 5 6 6 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 6 5 5 6 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5 and 6s are swapped in some way. Maybe there's a pattern where numbers are being swapped based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of reflection or rotation. For example, if a cell is mirrored or rotated, then its value changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain position, it's replaced with a certain value based on the surrounding cells.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the outputs and see if there's any pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output for the first row is 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0. The input for that row was 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. So the 2s are turned into 3s. In the second row, the input has 2 and 3, and the output has 3 and 2. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being transformed based on their position.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. For example, the fifth row in all examples is left as is. In Example 1, the fifth row is all 1s, and the output is the same. In Example 2, the fifth row is all zeros. In Example 3, the fifth row is all zeros, but in the output, it's changed. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced based on their position relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is in a position that's part of a certain pattern, it's replaced with a different value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell. For example, if the cell is 2, it's replaced with 3, and if it's 3, it's replaced with 2. But that doesn't fit all examples. For instance, in Example 2, there are 8s and 4s. In the output, the 8s are replaced with 4s and vice versa? Or maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with a value based on their position. For example, in the first example, the output's seventh row has a 2 in the fifth column. Maybe that's because the original input had a 2 in that position, but that's not the case. Wait, the input for the seventh row is all zeros. So that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in the grid. For example, if there's a 2 in a certain position, it's replaced with 3. But that's not consistent across examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with the value of their neighbors. For example, in the first example, the input has a 2 in column 4, and the output has a 3. Maybe that's because there's a 3 in a neighboring cell. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output's seventh row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. The input for that row is all zeros. So maybe that's a new cell that's being added based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with values based on their row or column. For example, if the row is even, then certain values are applied.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to think of possible patterns. Let's look at the outputs for each example.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's seventh row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. The input's seventh row is all zeros. So maybe that's a new value introduced in that position. But why?\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1, the first row's 2s are turned into 3s. The second row has a 3 and 2s, which are turned into 3s and 2s. Maybe the transformation is that if a cell is adjacent to a certain value, it's replaced with another. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 2, it's replaced with 3. Or maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of times a certain value appears. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with values based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. For example, in the first example, the seventh row (row index 6, since it's 0-based) in the output has a 2 in the fifth column (column index 4). Maybe that's because that position is in a certain row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their position relative to the original grid. For example, in Example 1, the output's seventh row (row 6) has a 2 in column 4. The original input's row 6 is all zeros. So how does that happen?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain patterns. For example, in the first example, the output has some 3s and 2s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is that the output is a modified version of the input where certain cells are replaced with a value based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with the value of the cell that is mirrored or rotated. For example, if a cell is mirrored, its value is changed.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern. Maybe I need to think of other approaches.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a row with 8s and 4s, and the output changes them. For example, in row 3, the input has 8 in column 9 and 11. The output has 8 and 4 in those positions. But in row 4, the input has 8 in column 9 and 11, and the output has 4 and 8. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are swapped with other values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell has a 2 to the left, it's replaced with 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their row and column indices. For example, if the row is even, then certain values are applied.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the output of Example 3. The input has a row with 5s and 6s, and the output has those values swapped in some way. For example, the input row is 0 0 5 6 6 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output row is 0 0 6 5 5 6 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5 and 6 are swapped in some positions. Maybe this is a pattern of swapping adjacent values. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain cells, their value is replaced with a value based on their position. For example, if the cell is in row 3 and column 5, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers. For example, if a cell is 2, it's replaced with 3 if it's in a certain row or column.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's think of the test input. The test input has a grid with 0s and 1s and some 2s and 8s. The output is not given, but the task is to write a function that transforms the input into the output. But since I don't have the test output, I need to make an educated guess based on the training examples.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the positions where changes occur. For example, in Example 1, the output's seventh row has a 2 in the fifth column. The input's seventh row is all zeros. How did that happen? Maybe that position is being set to 2 based on some rule. Maybe the transformation is that certain positions are being filled with 2s or 3s based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell is 2, it's replaced with 3, and if it's 3, it's replaced with 2. But in Example 2, there are 8s and 4s. For example, in the third row of input, the 8 is replaced with 8 and 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with values based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. For instance, in Example 1, the output's seventh row has a 2 in column 4. Maybe that's because that position is in a certain row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell has a 2 in the left or right, it's replaced with 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding cells with certain values. For example, if a cell has a 2 in a neighboring cell, it's replaced with 3.\n\nBut without more data, it's challenging. Let's think of possible patterns that could fit multiple examples.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The first row has 3s where there were 2s. The second row has 3s and 2s. The third row has 3s where there were 2s. The fourth row is all zeros. The fifth row is the same. The seventh row has a 2. The eighth row has the same as the input's second row. The ninth row is the same as the input's third row. The tenth row is the same. The eleventh row is the same. The twelfth row is the same.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is that certain rows are being modified based on their position. For example, rows 1-6 are modified in some way, and rows 7-12 are left as is. But in Example 1, row 7 is modified. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced based on their position. For example, cells in the first four rows are modified, and the rest are not. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the positions where changes occur. For example, in Example 1, the first row's 2s are replaced with 3s. The second row has a 3 and 2s, which are replaced with 3s and 2s. The third row has 2s replaced with 3s. The seventh row has a 2 in the fifth column. The eighth row is the same as the input's second row. So maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being replaced with values based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their position. For example, if the row is less than 5, then certain cells are replaced. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell is 2, it's replaced with 3 if it's in the first four rows. If it's 3, it's replaced with 2. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the first four rows, then certain values are replaced.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to see. Let's think of the third example. The input has a row with 5s and 6s, and the output has them swapped. For example, the input row is 0 0 5 6 6 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output row is 0 0 6 5 5 6 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5 and 6 are swapped in positions 2 and 3, and then positions 4 and 5. Maybe this is a pattern of swapping adjacent values. But how does that fit with other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being replaced with values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, then the value is determined by some formula.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the output of Example 2. The input has 8s and 4s. The output has 8s and 4s in some positions. For example, in row 3, the 8s are replaced with 8 and 4. In row 4, the 8s are replaced with 4 and 8. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are swapped with 4 and 8.\n\nBut how to determine this pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on the original grid's values. For example, if the original cell is 2, it's replaced with 3, and if it's 3, it's replaced with 2. But in Example 2, there are 8s and 4s. So maybe this is a pattern of swapping 2 and 3, and 8 and 4.\n\nBut how does this fit with the other examples?\n\nIn Example 1, the first row has 2s replaced with 3s. The second row has 2s and 3s replaced with 3s and 2s. So that might fit with swapping 2 and 3. But in Example 2, the 8s are replaced with 4s and vice versa. So maybe the transformation is that certain values are swapped based on their position.\n\nBut how to determine which values to swap?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain values are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, and i is even, then the value is replaced with a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in the first four rows, then certain values are replaced.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern. Given the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nLet me think of the following hypothesis: The transformation involves swapping certain values based on their position. For example, in the first four rows, certain cells are replaced with 3s and 2s, and in other rows, certain cells are replaced with 4s and 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing cells with values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in the first four rows, then certain values are replaced. For example, in the first example, the first four rows have their 2s replaced with 3s, and 3s replaced with 2s. In the second example, the 8s are replaced with 4s and vice versa. In the third example, the 5s and 6s are swapped.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Maybe the transformation is that certain values are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the first four rows, then certain values are replaced. But how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their position. For example, for each cell, if it's in row i and column j, then the new value is determined by some rule. For example, if the cell is in the first four rows, then if the original value is 2, it becomes 3, and if it's 3, it becomes 2. If it's in other rows, then if the original value is 8, it becomes 4, and vice versa.\n\nBut this is just a guess. How to test this hypothesis?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has 8s and 4s in certain positions. The output has 8s and 4s in some positions. For example, in row 3, the 8s are replaced with 8 and 4. In row 4, the 8s are replaced with 4 and 8. So maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 8s are replaced with 4s and vice versa.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to know. Given that, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation involves swapping certain values based on their position. For example, in the first four rows, 2 and 3 are swapped, and in other rows, 8 and 4 are swapped. But how to determine which rows are which.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, in the first four rows, the values are replaced with 3s and 2s, and in other rows, the values are replaced with 4s and 8s.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, for each cell, if it's in the first four rows, then if the value is 2, it becomes 3, and if it's 3, it becomes 2. If the value is 8, it becomes 4, and if it's 4, it becomes 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut this would fit some examples. For example, in Example 1, the first four rows have 2s replaced with 3s and 3s replaced with 2s. In Example 2, the 8s are replaced with 4s and vice versa. In Example 3, the 5s and 6s are swapped.\n\nBut this doesn't fit all examples. For example, in Example 3, the input has 5 and 6, and the output has them swapped. But according to this hypothesis, those values would not be part of the swapping. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. For example, if the cell is in row 0, then replace 2 with 3, and if it's in row 1, replace 3 with 2, etc.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed to write a function that swaps 2 and 3 in certain rows, and 8 and 4 in others, and handles other cases. But how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in the first four rows, then replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. For other rows, replace 8 with 4 and 4 with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nExample 1: Input has 2s in first four rows. Output replaces them with 3s. So that fits. The seventh row is not in the first four rows, so no change. But in the seventh row of the output, there's a 2. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nHmm, this is not working. Maybe the transformation is more complex.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a position where the row is less than 5, then replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. For other rows, replace 8 with 4 and 4 with 8. But this is not working for Example 1's seventh row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain column, then replace with a certain value.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The seventh row in the output has a 2 in the fifth column. The input for that row is all zeros. So maybe this is a new value introduced based on some rule. Perhaps the transformation is that certain cells are being set to 2 or 3 based on their position.\n\nBut without knowing the rule, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to look for patterns where certain cells are being replaced with values based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the seventh row's fifth column is set to 2. Maybe this is because that position is in a certain row and column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a value based on the original cell's value. For example, if the cell is in row 6 (seventh row), then replace it with 2 if it's in column 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain values based on their position. For example, in the first four rows, replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. For other rows, replace 8 with 4 and 4 with 8. Also, for certain positions, like row 6 and column 4, replace with 2.\n\nBut this is not a general solution, but it's the best I can think of.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if the value is 2, replace it with 3 if it's in the first four rows, and replace it with 2 if it's in other rows. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on their position. For example, in the first four rows, replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. In other rows, replace 8 with 4 and 4 with 8. For other values, leave as is.\n\nBut this would fit some examples, but not all.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first four rows are modified, and the seventh row is not. But in the seventh row of Example 1, there is a 2 in column 4. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that the output is generated by replacing certain cells with values based on the original cell's value and its position. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, then the new value is determined by some formula involving i and j.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the seventh row's fifth column is set to 2. Maybe that's because i=6 (row index), j=4 (column index). So 6 + 4 = 10, but that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new value is based on the original value plus some function of the row and column.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to write a function that replaces certain values in certain positions based on the examples. For example, in the first example, the first four rows have 2s replaced with 3s. In the second example, 8s are replaced with 4s and vice versa. In the third example, 5s and 6s are swapped.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that:\n\n- For each cell, if it's in the first four rows, replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2.\n- For each cell, if it's in rows 5-12, replace 8 with 4 and 4 with 8.\n- For other values, leave as is.\n- Also, for certain positions like row 6, column 4, set to 2.\n\nBut this is not general.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain values are replaced based on their position. For example, in the first four rows, replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. In other rows, replace 8 with 4 and 4 with 8. And for other values, leave as is.\n\nBut this would not explain the seventh row in Example 1.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the function is:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(12):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(9):\n            if i < 4:\n                if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                    row.append(3)\n                elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                    row.append(2)\n                else:\n                    row.append(grid[i][j])\n            elif i >= 4:\n                if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                    row.append(4)\n                elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                    row.append(8)\n                else:\n                    row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not explain the seventh row in Example 1. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nExample 1's input has a seventh row (i=6) which is all zeros. According to this code, since i >=4, it would check if the value is 8 or 4. Since it's zero, it remains zero. But in the output, the seventh row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. So this code would not generate that. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Maybe the transformation is more complex. Perhaps the seventh row in Example 1 is being modified because it's in a certain row and column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain positions, like row 6, column 4, the value is set to 2. But how to determine which positions.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation involves swapping 2 and 3 in the first four rows, and 8 and 4 in the other rows. Even though this doesn't explain all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(12):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(9):\n            if i < 4:\n                if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                    row.append(3)\n                elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                    row.append(2)\n                else:\n                    row.append(grid[i][j])\n            else:\n                if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                    row.append(4)\n                elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                    row.append(8)\n                else:\n                    row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not handle the seventh row in Example 1. However, maybe the seventh row in Example 1 is part of the other rows, and the code would leave it as zeros. But in the output, it has a 2. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the transformation is that for certain positions, like in the seventh row, the value is set to 2. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in the first four rows and has a 2, replace with 3; if it's in the other rows and has a 2, replace with 2. But this doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, in the first four rows, replace 2 with 3 and 3 with 2. For other rows, replace 8 with 4 and 4 with 8. Also, for certain positions like row 6, column 4, replace with 2.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the code should handle the examples as follows:\n\n- In Example 1, the seventh row has a 2 in column 4. So maybe that's a special case.\n\nBut without knowing the pattern, it's hard to proceed. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that handles the first four rows and other rows, even if it doesn't fully explain all examples.\n\nThe final answer is the code that swaps 2 and 3 in the first four rows, and 8 and 4 in the other rows.\n"
