Possibly creating new patterns based on existing ones\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n- Some values are preserved exactly\n- Other values are modified based on their neighbors\n- There seems to be a pattern of \"expanding\" certain values or \"filling in\" gaps\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n1. Preserves the original values where they are 0 or 6\n2. Modifies other values based on their neighbors\n3. Creates new patterns based on the original grid\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is 0 or 6, keep it as is\n            if grid[i][j] in (0, 6):\n                continue\n            \n            # If the cell is 8, replace it with 1\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                \n            # If the cell is 9, replace it with 3\n            if grid[i][j] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                \n            # If the cell is 4, replace it with 2\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                \n            # If the cell is 7, replace it with 3\n            if grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                \n            # If the cell is 5, replace it with 1\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                \n            # If the cell is 3, replace it with 2\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                \n            # If the cell is 2, replace it with 1\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                \n            # If the cell is 1, replace it with 0\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                \n            # If the cell is 8, replace it with 1\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is 0 or 6, keep it as is\n            if grid[i][j] in (0, 6):\n                continue\n            \n            # If the cell is 8, replace it with 1\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                \n            # If the cell is 9, replace it with 3\n            if grid[i][j] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                \n            # If the cell is 4, replace it with 2\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                \n            # If the cell is 7, replace it with 3\n            if grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                \n            # If the cell is 5, replace it with 1\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                \n            # If the cell is 3, replace it with 2\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                \n            # If the cell is 2, replace it with 1\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                \n            # If the cell is 1, replace it with 0\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                \n            # If the cell is 8, replace it with 1\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
