    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let's start by looking at each example carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput is a 5x5 grid (since each line has 5 numbers, but the output is 3x3). Wait, wait, the input is given as 5 rows each with 5 elements? Wait, the input for example 1 is:\n\nInput:\n1 0 0 0 9\n0 5 0 8 0\n0 0 7 0 0\n0 8 0 5 0\n9 0 0 0 1\n\nSo that's 5 rows, each with 5 numbers. The output is a 3x3 grid. So the input is 5x5, and the output is 3x3. How does that transformation work?\n\nLooking at the output for example 1:\n\n1 5 9\n8 7 8\n9 5 1\n\nHmm. Let's think about how the input is transformed into the output. Maybe each row in the output is derived from certain positions in the input. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the first row of the output: 1, 5, 9. In the input, the first row is [1,0,0,0,9]. The first element is 1, then the second row's second element is 5, and the fifth element of the first row is 9. So maybe the output is taking elements from the input in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input by selecting certain positions. Let's think of the output as a 3x3 grid. Let's index the input as rows 0-4 and columns 0-4. The output is 3x3, so maybe each output cell is determined by some formula based on the input's positions.\n\nLooking at the first row of the output (output row 0):\n\nFirst element: 1. In the input, that's input[0][0].\n\nSecond element: 5. In the input, that's input[1][1].\n\nThird element: 9. That's input[0][4].\n\nWait, but how do these positions relate? Maybe the output is constructed by taking certain positions from the input. Let's think of the output as being derived from the input's positions in a way that's related to their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first, middle, and last elements of certain rows. For example, the first row of the output could be the first, middle, and last elements of the first row of the input? But the first row of the input is [1,0,0,0,9]. The first, middle, last would be 1, 0, 9. But the output first row is 1,5,9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking elements from different rows. For example, the first row of the output is input[0][0], input[1][1], input[0][4]. That would be 1,5,9. Which matches the first row of the output.\n\nThen the second row of the output is 8,7,8. Let's see:\n\nLooking at input rows:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 0 0 9\n\nRow 1: 0 5 0 8 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 7 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 8 0 5 0\n\nRow 4: 9 0 0 0 1\n\nSo for the second row of output (output row 1), the elements are 8,7,8.\n\nLooking at input:\n\nMaybe the first element is input[3][1] (which is 8), the second is input[2][2] (7), and the third is input[3][1] again (8). So that would be 8,7,8. That seems to fit.\n\nThen the third row of output is 9,5,1. Let's see:\n\nInput row 4, column 0 is 9. Then input row 1, column 1 is 5. Then input row 4, column 4 is 1. So that would be 9,5,1. Which matches.\n\nSo perhaps the output is constructed by taking elements from the input in a specific pattern. Let's think about the positions:\n\nFor output row 0:\n\noutput[0][0] = input[0][0]\n\noutput[0][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[0][2] = input[0][4]\n\nFor output row 1:\n\noutput[1][0] = input[3][1]\n\noutput[1][1] = input[2][2]\n\noutput[1][2] = input[3][1]\n\nFor output row 2:\n\noutput[2][0] = input[4][0]\n\noutput[2][1] = input[1][1]\n\noutput[2][2] = input[4][4]\n\nHmm, but that seems a bit arbitrary. Let me check for example 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n6 0 0 0 7\n\n0 2 0 4 0\n\n0 0 3 0 0\n\n0 4 0 2 0\n\n7 0 0 0 6\n\nOutput:\n\n6 2 7\n\n4 3 4\n\n7 2 6\n\nSo the output is 3x3. Let's see:\n\nFirst row of output is 6,2,7.\n\nLooking at input:\n\nFirst row is [6,0,0,0,7]. So output[0][0] is 6 (input[0][0]), output[0][1] is 2 (input[1][1]), output[0][2] is 7 (input[0][4]). That matches the pattern from example 1.\n\nSecond row of output is 4,3,4.\n\nLooking at input:\n\ninput[3][1] is 4 (row 3, column 1 is 4). input[2][2] is 3. input[3][1] is 4 again. So that's 4,3,4. Which matches the pattern.\n\nThird row of output is 7,2,6. input[4][0] is 7, input[1][1] is 2, input[4][4] is 6. So that's 7,2,6. Which again matches the same pattern.\n\nSo this seems to be the same pattern for all examples. So the output is constructed as follows:\n\nFor each row in the output (0, 1, 2):\n\n- output_row_0: [input[0][0], input[1][1], input[0][4]]\n- output_row_1: [input[3][1], input[2][2], input[3][1]]\n- output_row_2: [input[4][0], input[1][1], input[4][4]]\n\nWait, but in example 1, the output row 1 is 8,7,8. Which is input[3][1] (row 3, column 1 is 8), input[2][2] (row 2, column 2 is 7), and input[3][1] again (8). So that's the same as the pattern.\n\nSo the output is built by taking specific positions from the input. Let's try to generalize this.\n\nSo the output grid is:\n\nRow 0: [input[0][0], input[1][1], input[0][4]]\n\nRow 1: [input[3][1], input[2][2], input[3][1]]\n\nRow 2: [input[4][0], input[1][1], input[4][4]]\n\nWait, but how do these positions relate? Let me check for example 3.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n\n2 0 0 0 1\n\n0 3 0 6 0\n\n0 0 4 0 0\n\n0 6 0 3 0\n\n1 0 0 0 2\n\nOutput:\n\n2 3 1\n\n6 4 6\n\n1 3 2\n\nLet's check according to the pattern.\n\nFirst row of output is 2,3,1. Which would be input[0][0] (2), input[1][1] (3), input[0][4] (1). That's correct.\n\nSecond row of output is 6,4,6. Which would be input[3][1] (row 3, column 1 is 6), input[2][2] (row 2, column 2 is 4), and input[3][1] again (6). So that's correct.\n\nThird row is 1,3,2. input[4][0] is 1, input[1][1] is 3, input[4][4] is 2. Correct.\n\nSo this pattern seems to hold for all three examples. Therefore, the transformation is taking specific positions from the input grid.\n\nSo the output grid is constructed as follows:\n\nFor the first row of output:\n\n- First element: input[0][0]\n- Second element: input[1][1]\n- Third element: input[0][4]\n\nSecond row:\n\n- First element: input[3][1]\n- Second element: input[2][2]\n- Third element: input[3][1]\n\nThird row:\n\n- First element: input[4][0]\n- Second element: input[1][1]\n- Third element: input[4][4]\n\nSo the output grid is:\n\n[\n [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[0][4]],\n [grid[3][1], grid[2][2], grid[3][1]],\n [grid[4][0], grid[1][1], grid[4][4]]\n]\n\nSo the code would need to take the input grid (which is 5x5) and extract these positions.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n7 0 0 0 5\n0 6 0 4 0\n0 0 2 0 0\n0 4 0 6 0\n5 0 0 0 7\n\nSo the input grid is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Let's apply the same pattern.\n\nFirst row of output:\n\ninput[0][0] = 7\n\ninput[1][1] = 6\n\ninput[0][4] =5 \u2192 so first row is [7,6,5]\n\nSecond row:\n\ninput[3][1] is row 3, column 1: 4\n\ninput[2][2] is row 2, column 2: 2\n\ninput[3][1] again is 4 \u2192 second row is [4, 2, 4]\n\nThird row:\n\ninput[4][0] is 5\n\ninput[1][1] is 6\n\ninput[4][4] is 7 \u2192 third row is [5,6,7]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n7 6 5\n\n4 2 4\n\n5 6 7\n\nBut wait, let me check the test input again. The input is:\n\nRow 0: 7 0 0 0 5 \u2192 [7,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow 1: 0 6 0 4 0 \u2192 [0,6,0,4,0]\n\nRow 2: 0 0 2 0 0 \u2192 [0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow 3: 0 4 0 6 0 \u2192 [0,4,0,6,0]\n\nRow 4: 5 0 0 0 7 \u2192 [5,0,0,0,7]\n\nSo for the first row of output:\n\ninput[0][0] is 7, input[1][1] is 6, input[0][4] is 5 \u2192 correct.\n\nSecond row:\n\ninput[3][1] is 4 (row 3, column 1 is 4), input[2][2] is 2, input[3][1] is 4 again \u2192 [4,2,4].\n\nThird row: input[4][0] is 5, input[1][1] is 6, input[4][4] is 7 \u2192 [5,6,7].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n7 6 5\n\n4 2 4\n\n5 6 7\n\nBut let's check if that's what the code would produce.\n\nSo the code would take the input grid (5x5) and create the output as per the positions mentioned.\n\nSo the Python function would need to take the input grid, which is a list of lists, and return a new 3x3 grid.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Extract the required positions\n    row0 = [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[0][4]]\n    row1 = [grid[3][1], grid[2][2], grid[3][1]]\n    row2 = [grid[4][0], grid[1][1], grid[4][4]]\n    return [row0, row1, row2]\n\nWait, but let's check for example 1:\n\nOriginal input grid for example 1:\n\nRow 0: [1,0,0,0,9]\n\nRow 1: [0,5,0,8,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,7,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,8,0,5,0]\n\nRow 4: [9,0,0,0,1]\n\nSo row0 is [1,5,9], which is correct.\n\nrow1 is [grid[3][1] (which is 8), grid[2][2] (7), grid[3][1] (8)] \u2192 [8,7,8], correct.\n\nrow2 is [grid[4][0] (9), grid[1][1] (5), grid[4][4] (1)] \u2192 [9,5,1], correct.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. The function takes the input grid, which is a 5x5 list of lists, and returns the 3x3 grid as per the positions.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is a 2D list where grid[row][col] gives the value. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code should be written as:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    row0 = [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[0][4]]\n    row1 = [grid[3][1], grid[2][2], grid[3][1]]\n    row2 = [grid[4][0], grid[1][1], grid[4][4]]\n    return [row0, row1, row2]\n\nBut let me check for example 3.\n\nIn example 3, the input is:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow 1: [0,3,0,6,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,4,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,6,0,3,0]\n\nRow 4: [1,0,0,0,2]\n\nSo row0 is [2,3,1] \u2192 correct.\n\nrow1: grid[3][1] is 6, grid[2][2] is 4, grid[3][1] is 6 \u2192 [6,4,6], correct.\n\nrow2: grid[4][0] is 1, grid[1][1] is 3, grid[4][4] is 2 \u2192 [1,3,2], correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works for all examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to extract those specific positions from the input grid.\n"

Let me check for example 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput:\n\n6 0 0 0 7\n\n0 2 0 4 0\n\n0 0 3 0 0\n\n0 4 0 2 0\n\n7 0 0 0 6\n\nOutput:\n\n6 2 7\n\n4 3 4\n\n7 2 6\n\nSo the output is 3x3. Let's see:\n\nFirst row of output is 6,2,7.\n\nLooking at input:\n\nFirst row is [6,0,0,0,7]. So output[0][0] is 6 (input[0][0]), output[0][1] is 2 (input[1][1]), output[0][2] is 7 (input[0][4]). That matches the pattern from example 1.\n\nSecond row of output is 4,3,4.\n\nLooking at input:\n\ninput[3][1] is 4 (row 3, column 1 is 4). input[2][2] is 3. input[3][1] is 4 again. So that's 4,3,4. Which matches the pattern.\n\nThird row of output is 7,2,6. input[4][0] is 7, input[1][1] is 2, input[4][4] is 6. So that's 7,2,6. Which again matches the same pattern.\n\nSo this seems to be the same pattern for all examples. So the output is constructed as follows:\n\nFor each row in the output (0, 1, 2):\n\n- output_row_0: [input[0][0], input[1][1], input[0][4]]\n- output_row_1: [input[3][1], input[2][2], input[3][1]]\n- output_row_2: [input[4][0], input[1][1], input[4][4]]\n\nWait, but in example 1, the output row 1 is 8,7,8. Which is input[3][1] (row 3, column 1 is 8), input[2][2] (row 2, column 2 is 7), and input[3][1] again (8). So that's the same as the pattern.\n\nSo the output is built by taking specific positions from the input. Let's try to generalize this.\n\nSo the output grid is:\n\nRow 0: [input[0][0], input[1][1], input[0][4]]\n\nRow 1: [input[3][1], input[2][2], input[3][1]]\n\nRow 2: [input[4][0], input[1][1], input[4][4]]\n\nWait, but how do these positions relate? Let me check for example 3.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput:\n\n2 0 0 0 1\n\n0 3 0 6 0\n\n0 0 4 0 0\n\n0 6 0 3 0\n\n1 0 0 0 2\n\nOutput:\n\n2 3 1\n\n6 4 6\n\n1 3 2\n\nLet's check according to the pattern.\n\nFirst row of output is 2,3,1. Which would be input[0][0] (2), input[1][1] (3), input[0][4] (1). That's correct.\n\nSecond row of output is 6,4,6. Which would be input[3][1] (row 3, column 1 is 6), input[2][2] (row 2, column 2 is 4), and input[3][1] again (6). So that's correct.\n\nThird row is 1,3,2. input[4][0] is 1, input[1][1] is 3, input[4][4] is 2. Correct.\n\nSo this pattern seems to hold for all three examples. Therefore, the transformation is taking specific positions from the input grid.\n\nSo the output grid is constructed as follows:\n\nFor the first row of output:\n\n- First element: input[0][0]\n- Second element: input[1][1]\n- Third element: input[0][4]\n\nSecond row:\n\n- First element: input[3][1]\n- Second element: input[2][2]\n- Third element: input[3][1]\n\nThird row:\n\n- First element: input[4][0]\n- Second element: input[1][1]\n- Third element: input[4][4]\n\nSo the output grid is:\n\n[\n [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[0][4]],\n [grid[3][1], grid[2][2], grid[3][1]],\n [grid[4][0], grid[1][1], grid[4][4]]\n]\n\nSo the code would need to take the input grid (which is 5x5) and extract these positions.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n7 0 0 0 5\n0 6 0 4 0\n0 0 2 0 0\n0 4 0 6 0\n5 0 0 0 7\n\nSo the input grid is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Let's apply the same pattern.\n\nFirst row of output:\n\ninput[0][0] = 7\n\ninput[1][1] = 6\n\ninput[0][4] =5 \u2192 so first row is [7,6,5]\n\nSecond row:\n\ninput[3][1] is row 3, column 1: 4\n\ninput[2][2] is row 2, column 2: 2\n\ninput[3][1] again is 4 \u2192 second row is [4, 2, 4]\n\nThird row:\n\ninput[4][0] is 5\n\ninput[1][1] is 6\n\ninput[4][4] is 7 \u2192 third row is [5,6,7]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n7 6 5\n\n4 2 4\n\n5 6 7\n\nBut wait, let me check the test input again. The input is:\n\nRow 0: 7 0 0 0 5 \u2192 [7,0,0,0,5]\n\nRow 1: 0 6 0 4 0 \u2192 [0,6,0,4,0]\n\nRow 2: 0 0 2 0 0 \u2192 [0,0,2,0,0]\n\nRow 3: 0 4 0 6 0 \u2192 [0,4,0,6,0]\n\nRow 4: 5 0 0 0 7 \u2192 [5,0,0,0,7]\n\nSo for the first row of output:\n\ninput[0][0] is 7, input[1][1] is 6, input[0][4] is 5 \u2192 correct.\n\nSecond row:\n\ninput[3][1] is 4 (row 3, column 1 is 4), input[2][2] is 2, input[3][1] is 4 again \u2192 [4,2,4].\n\nThird row: input[4][0] is 5, input[1][1] is 6, input[4][4] is 7 \u2192 [5,6,7].\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n7 6 5\n\n4 2 4\n\n5 6 7\n\nBut let's check if that's what the code would produce.\n\nSo the code would take the input grid (5x5) and create the output as per the positions mentioned.\n\nSo the Python function would need to take the input grid, which is a list of lists, and return a new 3x3 grid.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Extract the required positions\n    row0 = [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[0][4]]\n    row1 = [grid[3][1], grid[2][2], grid[3][1]]\n    row2 = [grid[4][0], grid[1][1], grid[4][4]]\n    return [row0, row1, row2]\n\nWait, but let's check for example 1:\n\nOriginal input grid for example 1:\n\nRow 0: [1,0,0,0,9]\n\nRow 1: [0,5,0,8,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,7,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,8,0,5,0]\n\nRow 4: [9,0,0,0,1]\n\nSo row0 is [1,5,9], which is correct.\n\nrow1 is [grid[3][1] (which is 8), grid[2][2] (7), grid[3][1] (8)] \u2192 [8,7,8], correct.\n\nrow2 is [grid[4][0] (9), grid[1][1] (5), grid[4][4] (1)] \u2192 [9,5,1], correct.\n\nYes, that works.\n\nSo the code is straightforward. The function takes the input grid, which is a 5x5 list of lists, and returns the 3x3 grid as per the positions.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that the input is a 2D list where grid[row][col] gives the value. So the code is correct.\n\nSo the code should be written as:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    row0 = [grid[0][0], grid[1][1], grid[0][4]]\n    row1 = [grid[3][1], grid[2][2], grid[3][1]]\n    row2 = [grid[4][0], grid[1][1], grid[4][4]]\n    return [row0, row1, row2]\n\nBut let me check for example 3.\n\nIn example 3, the input is:\n\nRow 0: [2,0,0,0,1]\n\nRow 1: [0,3,0,6,0]\n\nRow 2: [0,0,4,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,6,0,3,0]\n\nRow 4: [1,0,0,0,2]\n\nSo row0 is [2,3,1] \u2192 correct.\n\nrow1: grid[3][1] is 6, grid[2][2] is 4, grid[3][1] is 6 \u2192 [6,4,6], correct.\n\nrow2: grid[4][0] is 1, grid[1][1] is 3, grid[4][4] is 2 \u2192 [1,3,2], correct.\n\nYes.\n\nSo the code works for all examples.\n\nTherefore, the correct approach is to extract those specific positions from the input grid.\n"
