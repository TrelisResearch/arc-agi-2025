          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify patterns and then implement a transformation that captures what I observe.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid is always 9x9\n2. The first 3 columns of the output grid seem to be a copy of the input grid\n3. The next 3 columns are copies of the first 3 columns (so they are the same as the input grid)\n4. The last 3 columns are all zeros\n5. However, in some examples, the last 3 columns are not all zeros but contain the same values as the first 3 columns in different rows\n6. There's also a pattern where the first 3 columns are repeated in the next 3 rows, and then the last 3 columns are filled with the same values as the first 3 columns in those rows\n\nBased on this, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Copying the first 3 columns of the input grid to the first 3 columns of the output grid\n- Copying the first 3 columns again to the next 3 columns of the output grid\n- Filling the last 3 columns with the same values as the first 3 columns in those rows\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid filled with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Copy the first 3 columns of the input grid to the first 3 columns of the output grid\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(3):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Copy the first 3 columns again to the next 3 columns of the output grid\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(3):\n            transformed_grid[i][j+3] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill the last 3 columns with the same values as the first 3 columns in those rows\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(3):\n            transformed_grid[i][j+6] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid filled with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Copy the first 3 columns of the input grid to the first 3 columns of the output grid\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(3):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Copy the first 3 columns again to the next 3 columns of the output grid\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(3):\n            transformed_grid[i][j+3] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill the last 3 columns with the same values as the first 3 columns in those rows\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(3):\n            transformed_grid[i][j+6] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid is always 9x9\n2. The first 3 columns of the output grid are the same as the input grid\n3. The next 3 columns are a copy of the first 3 columns\n4. The last 3 columns are all zeros\n5. However, in some examples, the pattern is more complex, with the original rows being repeated in different positions\n\nBased on this, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Copies the first 3 columns of the input grid to the first 3 columns of the output\n- Copies the next 3 columns (same as first 3) to the next 3 columns of the output\n- Fills the last 3 columns with zeros\n- Also, in some examples, the original rows are repeated in the lower part of the output grid\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid filled with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Copy the first 3 columns of the input grid to the first 3 columns of the output\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(3):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Copy the next 3 columns (same as first 3) to the next 3 columns of the output\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(3, 6):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill the last 3 columns with zeros\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(6, 9):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    # In some examples, the original rows are repeated in the lower part of the output\n    # So we also copy the original rows to the lower part of the output\n    for i in range(3, 9):\n        for j in range(9):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i - 3][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid filled with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Copy the first 3 columns of the input grid to the first 3 columns of the output\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(3):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Copy the next 3 columns (same as first 3) to the next 3 columns of the output\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(3, 6):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill the last 3 columns with zeros\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(6, 9):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    # In some examples, the original rows are repeated in the lower part of the output\n    # So we also copy the original rows to the lower part of the output\n    for i in range(3, 9):\n        for j in range(9):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i - 3][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid is always 9x9\n2. The first 3 columns of the output grid seem to be a copy of the input grid\n3. The next 3 columns are copies of the first 3 columns (so they are the same as the input grid)\n4. The last 3 columns are all zeros\n5. However, in some examples, the last 3 columns are not all zeros but contain the same values as the first 3 columns in different rows\n6. There's also a pattern where the first 3 columns are repeated in the next 3 rows, and then the last 3 columns are filled with the same values as the first 3 columns in those rows\n\nBased on this, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Copying the first 3 columns of the input grid to the first 3 columns of the output grid\n- Copying the first 3 columns again to the next 3 columns of the output grid\n- Filling the last 3 columns with the same values as the first 3 columns in those rows\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid filled with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Copy the first 3 columns of the input grid to the first 3 columns of the output grid\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(3):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Copy the first 3 columns again to the next 3 columns of the output grid\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(3):\n            transformed_grid[i][j+3] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill the last 3 columns with the same values as the first 3 columns in those rows\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(3):\n            transformed_grid[i][j+6] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x9 output grid filled with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Copy the first 3 columns of the input grid to the first 3 columns of the output grid\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(3):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Copy the first 3 columns again to the next 3 columns of the output grid\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(3):\n            transformed_grid[i][j+3] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill the last 3 columns with the same values as the first 3 columns in those rows\n    for i in range(9):\n        for j in range(3):\n            transformed_grid[i][j+6] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
