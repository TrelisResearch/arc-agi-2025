              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe that the transformation involves some complex patterns that involve:\n\n1. Replacing certain values with others (e.g., 0 \u2192 6, 1 \u2192 8, 8 \u2192 1)\n2. Some kind of spatial transformation or pattern matching\n3. Possibly some kind of symmetry or reflection\n4. The transformation seems to involve both value replacement and spatial rearrangement\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that attempts to:\n- Replace certain values with others (e.g., 0 \u2192 6, 1 \u2192 8, 8 \u2192 1)\n- Apply some kind of spatial transformation or pattern matching\n- Maintain the 5x5 grid size\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Value replacement pattern\n    # 0 \u2192 6, 1 \u2192 8, 8 \u2192 1\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    # Additional pattern: Replace certain values based on their position\n    # This is a more complex pattern that I'm not fully certain about\n    # It seems to involve some kind of spatial transformation\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Replace 6 with 1 if it's in the center\n                if i == 2 and j == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                # Replace 6 with 8 if it's in the top-left quadrant\n                elif i < 2 and j < 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                # Replace 6 with 6 if it's in the bottom-right quadrant\n                elif i > 2 and j > 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                # Replace 6 with 1 if it's in the top-right quadrant\n                elif i < 2 and j > 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                # Replace 6 with 8 if it's in the bottom-left quadrant\n                elif i > 2 and j < 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Value replacement pattern\n    # 0 \u2192 6, 1 \u2192 8, 8 \u2192 1\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    # Additional pattern: Replace certain values based on their position\n    # This is a more complex pattern that I'm not fully certain about\n    # It seems to involve some kind of spatial transformation\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Replace 6 with 1 if it's in the center\n                if i == 2 and j == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                # Replace 6 with 8 if it's in the top-left quadrant\n                elif i < 2 and j < 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                # Replace 6 with 6 if it's in the bottom-right quadrant\n                elif i > 2 and j > 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                # Replace 6 with 1 if it's in the top-right quadrant\n                elif i < 2 and j > 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                # Replace 6 with 8 if it's in the bottom-left quadrant\n                elif i > 2 and j < 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
