          "Let's analyze the pattern step-by-step:\n\n**Observations from training examples (textual and visual):**\n\n1. The input grids are 10x10, and the output grids are also 10x10 (requirement).\n\n2. The input grid contains scattered colored dots (values 1 to 4 shown in training examples), on a mostly black (0) background.\n\n3. The output grid in each example shows a small sorted \"stack\" of colors arranged in increasing order of the color number in the bottom-left corner of the grid.\n\n4. In the outputs:\n   - A vertical blue bar is always present at the leftmost column,\n   - Next columns contain colors in ascending order: Red (1), Green (2), Yellow (3 or 4)\n   - The height of each color's vertical bar corresponds to the **count** of that color present in the input grid.\n\n5. The colors in the final output seem to be stacked vertically in columns on the left side:\n   - First column: all 1s (Red),\n   - Second column: all 2s (Green),\n   - Third column: all 3s (Yellow)\n   - Fourth column: all 4s (Blue) or sorted by color number?\n\n   Actually from visual:\n   - The leftmost column is formed by the smallest number found (usually 1 or 2),\n   - The second column is next bigger numbers,\n   - The colors are ordered in columns from left to right by increasing color number.\n\n6. The number of stacked cells in each column equals the count of that color in the input.\n\n7. The columns are arranged starting from the left with the smallest numbered color that occurs in the input.\n\n8. If a color isn\u2019t present in the input, it\u2019s not drawn in output.\n\n**Summary of the pattern:**\n- Count pixels of each color except 0.\n- Sort the colors ascending by their number.\n- For each color, fill that many cells stacked vertically starting at row 9 upwards in their respective column.\n- The columns for colors appear ordered from left to right by increasing color valued colors.\n\n---\n\n**Plan to implement:**\n\n- Take input grid (10x10)\n- Count occurrences of colors 1 to 9 (only colors >0)\n- Sort the colors that appear in ascending order\n- Create empty 10x10 grid filled with 0s\n- For each color in ascending order, fill the corresponding column from bottom upwards as many rows as the count of that color\n- Result is the transformed grid\n\n---\n\n**Check example with the first input:** It matches the counts and arrangement.\n\n---\n\nNow I will implement the transform function according to this understanding.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Count occurrences of each color > 0\n    from collections import Counter\n    counts = Counter()\n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            if val > 0:\n                counts[val] += 1\n    \n    # Sort colors by their number ascending\n    colors_sorted = sorted(counts.keys())\n    \n    # Initialize empty 10x10 grid of zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Fill columns from left to right with vertical stacks of each color\n    col = 0\n    for color in colors_sorted:\n        count = counts[color]\n        # Fill from bottom row (row 9) going up count cells\n        for i in range(count):\n            transformed_grid[9 - i][col] = color\n        col += 1\n        if col >= 10:\n            # Safety break if more than 10 colors (unlikely)\n            break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```"

              "Let's analyze the pattern step-by-step:\n\n**Observations from training examples (textual and visual):**\n\n1. The input grids are 10x10, and the output grids are also 10x10 (requirement).\n\n2. The input grid contains scattered colored dots (values 1 to 4 shown in training examples), on a mostly black (0) background.\n\n3. The output grid in each example shows a small sorted \"stack\" of colors arranged in increasing order of the color number in the bottom-left corner of the grid.\n\n4. In the outputs:\n   - A vertical blue bar is always present at the leftmost column,\n   - Next columns contain colors in ascending order: Red (1), Green (2), Yellow (3 or 4)\n   - The height of each color's vertical bar corresponds to the **count** of that color present in the input grid.\n\n5. The colors in the final output seem to be stacked vertically in columns on the left side:\n   - First column: all 1s (Red),\n   - Second column: all 2s (Green),\n   - Third column: all 3s (Yellow)\n   - Fourth column: all 4s (Blue) or sorted by color number?\n\n   Actually from visual:\n   - The leftmost column is formed by the smallest number found (usually 1 or 2),\n   - The second column is next bigger numbers,\n   - The colors are ordered in columns from left to right by increasing color number.\n\n6. The number of stacked cells in each column equals the count of that color in the input.\n\n7. The columns are arranged starting from the left with the smallest numbered color that occurs in the input.\n\n8. If a color isn\u2019t present in the input, it\u2019s not drawn in output.\n\n**Summary of the pattern:**\n- Count pixels of each color except 0.\n- Sort the colors ascending by their number.\n- For each color, fill that many cells stacked vertically starting at row 9 upwards in their respective column.\n- The columns for colors appear ordered from left to right by increasing color valued colors.\n\n---\n\n**Plan to implement:**\n\n- Take input grid (10x10)\n- Count occurrences of colors 1 to 9 (only colors >0)\n- Sort the colors that appear in ascending order\n- Create empty 10x10 grid filled with 0s\n- For each color in ascending order, fill the corresponding column from bottom upwards as many rows as the count of that color\n- Result is the transformed grid\n\n---\n\n**Check example with the first input:** It matches the counts and arrangement.\n\n---\n\nNow I will implement the transform function according to this understanding.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Count occurrences of each color > 0\n    from collections import Counter\n    counts = Counter()\n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            if val > 0:\n                counts[val] += 1\n    \n    # Sort colors by their number ascending\n    colors_sorted = sorted(counts.keys())\n    \n    # Initialize empty 10x10 grid of zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Fill columns from left to right with vertical stacks of each color\n    col = 0\n    for color in colors_sorted:\n        count = counts[color]\n        # Fill from bottom row (row 9) going up count cells\n        for i in range(count):\n            transformed_grid[9 - i][col] = color\n        col += 1\n        if col >= 10:\n            # Safety break if more than 10 colors (unlikely)\n            break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```"
