          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. I need to look at the input and output grids of the examples and see what's changing.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput has some 6s and 0s. The output is similar but in some rows, there are changes. For instance, the sixth row in input is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4, and the output is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. So the 0s in the middle are replaced with 8s and 7s. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their neighbors?\n\nAnother thing: in the first example, the output's sixth row has 8s and 7s. Let me check other examples. In Example 2, the output has some changes. For example, the second row input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4, and the output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are replaced with 6s and 0s. Hmm, that seems inconsistent. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of rule where certain cells are replaced based on their position or surrounding cells. Let's think about the positions. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row of input is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. The output is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The middle three 6s are replaced with 7s, and the two 0s are replaced with 8s. Maybe there's a rule that replaces 0s with 8s and 6s with 7s in certain positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput's first row is 6 0 6 4 6 0 0 4 6. Output is same as input. So maybe some cells are left unchanged. But in the second row of input, it's 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6, and output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So the 0s in positions (row 1, column 3) and (row 1, column 7) are replaced with 8s. Maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced with 8s if they are in certain positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid-based rule, like replacing certain cells based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 6s, it's replaced with a certain value. But how to determine that?\n\nAnother approach: look for changes in the output grids. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s and 7s in the sixth row. In Example 2, the output has 6s and 0s in some rows. Maybe the transformation is replacing certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, cells in certain rows or columns are modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For instance, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with 8, and if it's 6, it's replaced with 7. But in Example 2, the input has 7s and 8s in some positions, and the output has 6s and 0s. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern that depends on the row and column indices. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row (index 5) has some changes. Let's check the output of that row. The input is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. The output is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. So the first and last elements are same (4), the middle elements are changed. The 0s become 8s, and the 6s become 7s. So maybe for certain positions, like in row 5 (if rows are 0-based?), the middle elements are replaced. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, then it's modified. Let's think about the positions where changes occur.\n\nIn Example 1, the sixth row (assuming 0-based index, maybe row 5) has 0s in columns 1, 2, 7. Those are replaced with 8s. The 6s in columns 3-6 are replaced with 7s. So maybe for certain positions, like in row 5, columns 1 and 2, and 7, the value is 8, and columns 3-6 are 7. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their row and column. For example, if a cell is in row 5 (sixth row), and column 1, then it's replaced with 8. But how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3. The input's second row is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. The output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So the 0s in columns 3 and 7 are replaced with 8. Maybe in certain positions, like columns 3 and 7, the 0s are replaced with 8s. But how to know which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with 8, but if it's 6, it's replaced with 7. But in Example 2, the input has 7s and 8s in some positions. For example, the second row input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4, and the output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are replaced with 6s and 0s. That's inconsistent with the previous idea.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's look for patterns in the output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the sixth row has 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The original input's sixth row is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. So the 0s are replaced with 8s, and the 6s are replaced with 7s. So maybe for certain positions, like in row 5 (assuming 0-based index), the middle elements are replaced.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe for each row, certain columns are modified based on their position. For example, in row 5 (sixth row), columns 1 and 2 are 0s, replaced with 8s. Columns 3-6 are 6s, replaced with 7s. Columns 7 is 0, replaced with 8. So maybe for row 5, the middle columns are replaced with 7s, and the first and last columns are replaced with 8s.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns are affected. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the second row input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are replaced with 6s and 0s. For example, column 1 is 7 \u2192 6, column 2 is 8 \u2192 0, column 3 is 7 \u2192 6, column 4 is 8 \u2192 0, etc. So maybe in this row, the even columns are replaced with 6 and 0 alternately?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row and column, it's replaced with a specific value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if a cell is in row 5, then certain columns are modified. But how to find the exact pattern.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 3. The input's first row is same as output. The second row's input is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6, and output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So columns 3 and 7 are 0s, replaced with 8s. Maybe in certain columns (like 3 and 7), 0s are replaced with 8s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if a cell is in column 3 or 7, then 0s are replaced with 8s. But how to check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid-based rule where certain cells are replaced based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 6s, it's replaced with 7. But this would require checking the surrounding cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if a cell is in row 5, then certain columns are modified. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the sixth row (row 5 in 0-based) has the 0s replaced with 8s and 6s with 7s. Maybe for rows 5 (sixth row), columns 1, 2, 7 are replaced with 8, and columns 3-6 with 7. But how to generalize this to other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with 8 if it's in a certain row or column. But how to determine that.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's check the output of Example 2's second row. The input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the first element is 4, then 7 becomes 6, 8 becomes 0, 7 becomes 6, 8 becomes 0, etc. So maybe the pattern is that in this row, the even columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7) are modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in column 1, then 0 becomes 8, 6 becomes 7. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on some kind of grid pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their row and column. For example, in row 5 (sixth row), columns 1 and 2 are 0s, which are replaced with 8s. Columns 3-6 are 6s, replaced with 7s. Columns 7 is 0, replaced with 8. So for row 5, columns 1, 2, 7 are 8, and 3-6 are 7. But how to find this pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and the row index. For example, for row 5, the middle columns are modified. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's values and the position of the cell. For example, if a cell is in row 5, then certain columns are modified. But how to find the exact rule.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output in each example.\n\nIn Example 1, the sixth row changes 0s to 8s and 6s to 7s. In Example 2, the second row changes 7s and 8s to 6s and 0s. In Example 3, the second row changes 0s to 8s. \n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and whether it's in a certain row or column. For example, if a cell is in row 5 (sixth row), then 0s become 8s and 6s become 7s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the position of the cell. For example, if a cell is in a certain column (like column 3 or 7), then 0s become 8s. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, if a cell is in row i and column j, then the new value is determined by some function of i and j.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find the exact pattern. However, given the examples, perhaps the transformation is replacing certain values in certain positions based on their row and column. \n\nLet me think of possible transformations. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row has certain changes. Maybe the transformation is that for each row, the middle columns are modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and the position of the cell. For example, if a cell is 0 and in row 5, it's replaced with 8. If it's 6 and in row 5, it's replaced with 7. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in column 3 or 7, then 0s are replaced with 8s. But in Example 1, the sixth row has 0s in columns 1, 2, 7. So column 7 is replaced with 8. But in Example 2, the second row has 0s in column 3 and 7, which are replaced with 8s. So maybe columns 3 and 7 are special.\n\nBut then in Example 3's second row, columns 3 and 7 are 0s and replaced with 8s. So this seems to be a pattern. So maybe columns 3 and 7 are replaced with 8s if they are 0s. But what about other columns?\n\nIn Example 1, the sixth row's columns 3-6 are 6s, replaced with 7s. So maybe for certain rows, columns 3-6 are replaced with 7s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if the cell is in row 5 (sixth row), then columns 1, 2, 7 are replaced with 8s, and columns 3-6 are replaced with 7s. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and the position of the cell. For example, for each cell, if it's in row 5, then:\n\n- if column is 1 or 2 or 7 \u2192 replace 0 with 8, 6 with 7?\n\nBut this is getting too specific. How to handle other rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and the row index. For example, for row 5, the middle columns are modified. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven that the examples are not consistent, perhaps the pattern is more complex. Maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and whether it is in a certain row or column, but with some rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if a cell is 0 and in column 3 or 7, it's replaced with 8. If it's 6 and in column 3-6, it's replaced with 7. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in row 5, then:\n\n- columns 1, 2, 7: replace 0 with 8, 6 with 7.\n\nBut this seems too specific. However, given that the examples have such changes, perhaps this is the pattern.\n\nBut how to code this? Let's think of possible code.\n\nThe output grid must be 7x9. So for each cell in the input grid, we need to determine what value to replace it with.\n\nLet's think about possible rules:\n\n1. For each cell (i, j), if it's in row 5 (sixth row), then:\n\n   - if j is 1, 2, or 7: replace 0 with 8, 6 with 7.\n\n   - if j is 3-6: replace 6 with 7.\n\nBut how to handle other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for row 5, columns 1, 2, 7 are replaced with 8s if they are 0, and 6s are replaced with 7s. For other rows, maybe other rules apply.\n\nBut this is just for example 1. How to generalize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, for each cell:\n\n- if the cell is 0 and in column 3 or 7 \u2192 replace with 8.\n\n- if the cell is 6 and in column 3-6 \u2192 replace with 7.\n\nBut this would explain some of the examples. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's sixth row (row 5), columns 3-6 are 6s, replaced with 7s. Columns 1, 2, 7 are 0s, replaced with 8s.\n\nIn Example 3's second row (row 1), columns 3 and 7 are 0s, replaced with 8s.\n\nIn Example 2's second row (row 1), columns 3 and 7 are 0s, replaced with 8s.\n\nBut in Example 2's second row, the original input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So in this row, columns 2 and 4 are 8s, which are replaced with 0s. Hmm, this doesn't fit the previous pattern. So maybe this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, if the cell is 0, and it's in column 3 or 7, then replace with 8. If it's 6, and in column 3-6, replace with 7. But for other cases, leave it as is. But this would not explain the changes in Example 2's second row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is more complex. For example, certain cells are replaced based on their position in the grid. For instance, if the cell is in row 5, then certain columns are modified. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, for each cell (i, j):\n\n- if i is 5 (row 5), then:\n\n   - if j is 1, 2, 7: replace 0 with 8, 6 with 7.\n\n   - if j is 3-6: replace 6 with 7.\n\n- if i is 1 (row 2), then:\n\n   - if j is 3 or 7: replace 0 with 8.\n\nBut this is too specific and may not apply to other examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and whether it's in a certain row or column. For example, if the cell is in column 3 or 7, then 0 becomes 8, 6 becomes 7. But in Example 2's second row, the input has 7 and 8 in columns 2, 3, etc., which are replaced with 6 and 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions, but the rules are not clear. Given the examples, perhaps the best approach is to find a pattern that works for the given examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLooking back at the examples:\n\nExample 1:\n\nIn the sixth row (row 5), the 0s are replaced with 8s, and 6s with 7s. So for this row, the middle columns (3-6) are 6s replaced with 7s, and the first and last columns (1 and 7) are 0s replaced with 8s.\n\nExample 2:\n\nIn the second row (row 1), the input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are replaced with 6 and 0. For example, column 1 (7) becomes 6, column 2 (8) becomes 0, column 3 (7) becomes 6, column 4 (8) becomes 0, and so on.\n\nThis suggests that for this row, even columns are replaced with 6 and 0 alternately. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, for row 1 (second row), columns 1, 3, 5, 7 are replaced with 6 and 0 based on their position.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, if the cell is in row 1 and column 1, it's replaced with 6. If it's in column 2, replaced with 0, etc. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in column 3 or 7, then 0 becomes 8, 6 becomes 7. But in Example 2's second row, the columns 3 and 7 are 0s (in the input?), no, in Example 2's second row, the input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. So the columns are 0-based:\n\ncolumns 0:4, 1:7, 2:8, 3:7, 4:8, 5:8, 6:8, 7:8, 8:4.\n\nThe output for this row is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are modified. So for column 1 (7), it's replaced with 6. Column 2 (8) replaced with 0. Column 3 (7) replaced with 6. Column 4 (8) replaced with 0. Column 5 (8) replaced with 0. Column 6 (8) replaced with 0. Column 7 (8) replaced with 0. So this seems like a pattern where even columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7) are replaced with 6 and 0 alternately. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for this row, the even columns are replaced with 6 and 0 based on their position. For example, column 1 is 6, column 2 is 0, column 3 is 6, column 4 is 0, etc. But how to determine this.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe the best approach is to find a pattern that works for the examples and code it.\n\nLet me think about the following possible rules:\n\nFor each cell (i, j):\n\n- If the cell is in row 5 (sixth row), then:\n\n   - if j is 1, 2, or 7: replace 0 with 8, 6 with 7.\n\n   - if j is 3-6: replace 6 with 7.\n\n- If the cell is in row 1 (second row), then:\n\n   - if j is even (columns 1, 3, 5, 7): replace 7 with 6, 8 with 0.\n\nBut this is just for the examples given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example:\n\n- For row 5 (sixth row), columns 1, 2, 7 are replaced with 8 if they are 0, and 7 if they are 6.\n\n- For row 1 (second row), columns 1, 3, 5, 7 are replaced with 6 and 0 based on their position.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, if the cell is in column 3 or 7, then 0 becomes 8, 6 becomes 7. But this would explain some examples.\n\nBut in Example 2's second row, the input has 7 and 8 in columns 1, 2, 3, etc. So this approach may not explain that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, if the cell is in row 5 and column 3-6, replace 6 with 7. If it's in column 1, 2, or 7, replace 0 with 8.\n\nBut this would explain Example 1 and Example 3. For Example 2, it's not clear.\n\nGiven the time I have, perhaps I should proceed with the following approach:\n\n- For each cell (i, j):\n\n   - If it's in row 5 (sixth row):\n\n      - if j is 1, 2, or 7:\n\n         - if the original value is 0 \u2192 8\n\n         - if the original value is 6 \u2192 7\n\n      - if j is 3-6:\n\n         - if the original value is 6 \u2192 7\n\n   - Else if it's in row 1 (second row):\n\n      - if j is 1, 3, 5, 7:\n\n         - if the original value is 7 \u2192 6\n\n         - if the original value is 8 \u2192 0\n\n   - Else:\n\n      - leave it as is.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples. However, this may not cover all cases.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the position of the cell in a certain way. For example, for certain rows and columns, replace values based on their original value.\n\nBut since the examples are not fully consistent, this is challenging.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output's sixth row has 8s and 7s. In Example 3, the output's second row has 8s in columns 3 and 7. In Example 2, the output's second row has 8s in columns 2 and 7. So maybe the columns 2 and 7 are being replaced with 8s for certain rows.\n\nBut this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, if the cell is in row 5, column 3-6, replace 6 with 7. If the cell is in column 3 or 7, replace 0 with 8.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nLet me try to code this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(7):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(9):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            if i == 5:  # sixth row\n                if j in [1, 2, 7]:\n                    if val == 0:\n                        row.append(8)\n                    elif val == 6:\n                        row.append(7)\n                    else:\n                        row.append(val)\n                elif 3 <= j <= 6:\n                    if val == 6:\n                        row.append(7)\n                    else:\n                        row.append(val)\n                else:\n                    row.append(val)\n            elif i == 1:  # second row\n                if j in [1, 3, 5, 7]:\n                    if val == 7:\n                        row.append(6)\n                    elif val == 8:\n                        row.append(0)\n                    else:\n                        row.append(val)\n                else:\n                    row.append(val)\n            else:\n                row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just for the examples given. However, this code would handle Example 1 and 3, but not sure about Example 2. For Example 2's second row (i=1), the code would replace columns 1,3,5,7. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 2's second row input is [4,7,8,7,8,8,8,8,4]. So for j=1 (7), it's replaced with 6. j=3 (7) \u2192 6. j=5 (8) \u2192 0. j=7 (8) \u2192 0. So the output would be [4,6,8,6,0,8,8,0,4]. But the actual output for this row is [4,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,4]. So this doesn't match. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the code is not correct. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 2's second row, the output is [4,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,4]. The original input is [4,7,8,7,8,8,8,8,4]. So the changes are:\n\n- column 1: 7 \u2192 6\n\n- column 2: 8 \u2192 0\n\n- column 3: 7 \u2192 6\n\n- column 4: 8 \u2192 0\n\n- column 5: 8 \u2192 0\n\n- column 6: 8 \u2192 0\n\n- column 7: 8 \u2192 0\n\nSo for columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 in this row, the values are being replaced. It seems like for even columns (1,3,5,7) and odd columns (2,4,6), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for this row, the even columns are replaced with 6 and 0 alternately. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time I have, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach, even if it doesn't cover all cases, and see if it can handle the examples.\n\nBut how to handle the test input. The test input is a 7x9 grid. The code above would handle the sixth row, but not sure about others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, if the cell is in row 5, then certain columns are replaced. For other rows, maybe other rules.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in column 3 or 7, then 0 becomes 8, 6 becomes 7. For other columns, if the cell is 6, replace with 7.\n\nBut this would explain some examples.\n\nLet me try this:\n\nFor each cell (i, j):\n\n- if j is 3 or 7:\n\n   - if original value is 0 \u2192 8\n\n   - if original value is 6 \u2192 7\n\n- else if original value is 6:\n\n   - replace with 7\n\n- else:\n\n   - leave as is.\n\nBut let's test this on the examples.\n\nExample 1's sixth row:\n\ncolumns 3-6 are 6s, replaced with 7s. Columns 1, 2, 7 are 0s \u2192 replaced with 8. So this would fit.\n\nExample 2's second row: input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. Columns 3 and 7 are 7 and 8. So for column 3 (j=3), original value is 7 \u2192 not 0 or 6, so left as is. But in the output, it's replaced with 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the sixth row's columns 3-6 are replaced with 7s. In Example 3, the second row's columns 3 and 7 are replaced with 8s. So maybe for certain rows, certain columns are replaced.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nGiven the time I have, I think the best approach is to proceed with the code that handles the sixth row and some other rows, even if it's not perfect. The code may not handle all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code will check for certain rows and columns and apply the transformation. For example:\n\n- For row 5 (sixth row), columns 1, 2, 7 are replaced with 8 if 0, and 7 if 6.\n\n- For row 1 (second row), columns 1, 3, 5, 7 are replaced with 6 and 0 based on their position.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, if the cell is in row 5 and column 3-6, replace 6 with 7. For column 1, 2, 7, replace 0 with 8.\n\nThis would handle Example 1 and 3.\n\nBut for Example 2's second row, it's not clear.\n\nIn the end, I'll proceed with this approach, even if it's not perfect, and write the code.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. I need to look at the input and output grids of the examples and see what's changing.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput has some 6s and 0s. The output is similar but in some rows, there are changes. For instance, the sixth row in input is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4, and the output is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. So the 0s in the middle are replaced with 8s and 7s. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their neighbors?\n\nAnother thing: in the first example, the output's sixth row has 8s and 7s. Let me check other examples. In Example 2, the output has some changes. For example, the second row input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4, and the output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are replaced with 6s and 0s. Hmm, that seems inconsistent. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of rule where certain cells are replaced based on their position or surrounding cells. Let's think about the positions. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row of input is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. The output is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The middle three 6s are replaced with 7s, and the two 0s are replaced with 8s. Maybe there's a rule that replaces 0s with 8s and 6s with 7s in certain positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput's first row is 6 0 6 4 6 0 0 4 6. Output is same as input. So maybe some cells are left unchanged. But in the second row of input, it's 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6, and output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So the 0s in positions (row 1, column 3) and (row 1, column 7) are replaced with 8s. Maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced with 8s if they are in certain positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid-based rule, like replacing certain cells based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 6s, it's replaced with a certain value. But how to determine that?\n\nAnother approach: look for changes in the output grids. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s and 7s in the sixth row. In Example 2, the output has 6s and 0s in some rows. Maybe the transformation is replacing certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, cells in certain rows or columns are modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For instance, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with 8, and if it's 6, it's replaced with 7. But in Example 2, the input has 7s and 8s in some positions, and the output has 6s and 0s. That doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern that depends on the row and column indices. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row (index 5) has some changes. Let's check the output of that row. The input is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. The output is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. So the first and last elements are same (4), the middle elements are changed. The 0s become 8s, and the 6s become 7s. So maybe for certain positions, like in row 5 (if rows are 0-based?), the middle elements are replaced. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, then it's modified. Let's think about the positions where changes occur.\n\nIn Example 1, the sixth row (assuming 0-based index, maybe row 5) has 0s in columns 1, 2, 7. Those are replaced with 8s. The 6s in columns 3-6 are replaced with 7s. So maybe for certain positions, like in row 5, columns 1 and 2, and 7, the value is 8, and columns 3-6 are 7. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their row and column. For example, if a cell is in row 5 (sixth row), and column 1, then it's replaced with 8. But how to find that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 3. The input's second row is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. The output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So the 0s in columns 3 and 7 are replaced with 8. Maybe in certain positions, like columns 3 and 7, the 0s are replaced with 8s. But how to know which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with 8, but if it's 6, it's replaced with 7. But in Example 2, the input has 7s and 8s in some positions. For example, the second row input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4, and the output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are replaced with 6s and 0s. That's inconsistent with the previous idea.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's look for patterns in the output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the sixth row has 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The original input's sixth row is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. So the 0s are replaced with 8s, and the 6s are replaced with 7s. So maybe for certain positions, like in row 5 (assuming 0-based index), the middle elements are replaced.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe for each row, certain columns are modified based on their position. For example, in row 5 (sixth row), columns 1 and 2 are 0s, replaced with 8s. Columns 3-6 are 6s, replaced with 7s. Columns 7 is 0, replaced with 8. So maybe for row 5, the middle columns are replaced with 7s, and the first and last columns are replaced with 8s.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns are affected. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the second row input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are replaced with 6s and 0s. For example, column 1 is 7 \u2192 6, column 2 is 8 \u2192 0, column 3 is 7 \u2192 6, column 4 is 8 \u2192 0, etc. So maybe in this row, the even columns are replaced with 6 and 0 alternately?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row and column, it's replaced with a specific value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if a cell is in row 5, then certain columns are modified. But how to find the exact pattern.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 3. The input's first row is same as output. The second row's input is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6, and output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So columns 3 and 7 are 0s, replaced with 8s. Maybe in certain columns (like 3 and 7), 0s are replaced with 8s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if a cell is in column 3 or 7, then 0s are replaced with 8s. But how to check that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid-based rule where certain cells are replaced based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 6s, it's replaced with 7. But this would require checking the surrounding cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if a cell is in row 5, then certain columns are modified. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the sixth row (row 5 in 0-based) has the 0s replaced with 8s and 6s with 7s. Maybe for rows 5 (sixth row), columns 1, 2, 7 are replaced with 8, and columns 3-6 with 7. But how to generalize this to other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with 8 if it's in a certain row or column. But how to determine that.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's check the output of Example 2's second row. The input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the first element is 4, then 7 becomes 6, 8 becomes 0, 7 becomes 6, 8 becomes 0, etc. So maybe the pattern is that in this row, the even columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7) are modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in column 1, then 0 becomes 8, 6 becomes 7. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on some kind of grid pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their row and column. For example, in row 5 (sixth row), columns 1 and 2 are 0s, which are replaced with 8s. Columns 3-6 are 6s, replaced with 7s. Columns 7 is 0, replaced with 8. So for row 5, columns 1, 2, 7 are 8, and 3-6 are 7. But how to find this pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and the row index. For example, for row 5, the middle columns are modified. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's values and the position of the cell. For example, if a cell is in row 5, then certain columns are modified. But how to find the exact rule.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output in each example.\n\nIn Example 1, the sixth row changes 0s to 8s and 6s to 7s. In Example 2, the second row changes 7s and 8s to 6s and 0s. In Example 3, the second row changes 0s to 8s. \n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and whether it's in a certain row or column. For example, if a cell is in row 5 (sixth row), then 0s become 8s and 6s become 7s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the position of the cell. For example, if a cell is in a certain column (like column 3 or 7), then 0s become 8s. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, if a cell is in row i and column j, then the new value is determined by some function of i and j.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find the exact pattern. However, given the examples, perhaps the transformation is replacing certain values in certain positions based on their row and column. \n\nLet me think of possible transformations. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row has certain changes. Maybe the transformation is that for each row, the middle columns are modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and the position of the cell. For example, if a cell is 0 and in row 5, it's replaced with 8. If it's 6 and in row 5, it's replaced with 7. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in column 3 or 7, then 0s are replaced with 8s. But in Example 1, the sixth row has 0s in columns 1, 2, 7. So column 7 is replaced with 8. But in Example 2, the second row has 0s in column 3 and 7, which are replaced with 8s. So maybe columns 3 and 7 are special.\n\nBut then in Example 3's second row, columns 3 and 7 are 0s and replaced with 8s. So this seems to be a pattern. So maybe columns 3 and 7 are replaced with 8s if they are 0s. But what about other columns?\n\nIn Example 1, the sixth row's columns 3-6 are 6s, replaced with 7s. So maybe for certain rows, columns 3-6 are replaced with 7s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if the cell is in row 5 (sixth row), then columns 1, 2, 7 are replaced with 8s, and columns 3-6 are replaced with 7s. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and the position of the cell. For example, for each cell, if it's in row 5, then:\n\n- if column is 1 or 2 or 7 \u2192 replace 0 with 8, 6 with 7?\n\nBut this is getting too specific. How to handle other rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and the row index. For example, for row 5, the middle columns are modified. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven that the examples are not consistent, perhaps the pattern is more complex. Maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and whether it is in a certain row or column, but with some rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, if a cell is 0 and in column 3 or 7, it's replaced with 8. If it's 6 and in column 3-6, it's replaced with 7. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in row 5, then:\n\n- columns 1, 2, 7: replace 0 with 8, 6 with 7.\n\nBut this seems too specific. However, given that the examples have such changes, perhaps this is the pattern.\n\nBut how to code this? Let's think of possible code.\n\nThe output grid must be 7x9. So for each cell in the input grid, we need to determine what value to replace it with.\n\nLet's think about possible rules:\n\n1. For each cell (i, j), if it's in row 5 (sixth row), then:\n\n   - if j is 1, 2, or 7: replace 0 with 8, 6 with 7.\n\n   - if j is 3-6: replace 6 with 7.\n\nBut how to handle other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for row 5, columns 1, 2, 7 are replaced with 8s if they are 0, and 6s are replaced with 7s. For other rows, maybe other rules apply.\n\nBut this is just for example 1. How to generalize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, for each cell:\n\n- if the cell is 0 and in column 3 or 7 \u2192 replace with 8.\n\n- if the cell is 6 and in column 3-6 \u2192 replace with 7.\n\nBut this would explain some of the examples. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's sixth row (row 5), columns 3-6 are 6s, replaced with 7s. Columns 1, 2, 7 are 0s, replaced with 8s.\n\nIn Example 3's second row (row 1), columns 3 and 7 are 0s, replaced with 8s.\n\nIn Example 2's second row (row 1), columns 3 and 7 are 0s, replaced with 8s.\n\nBut in Example 2's second row, the original input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So in this row, columns 2 and 4 are 8s, which are replaced with 0s. Hmm, this doesn't fit the previous pattern. So maybe this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, if the cell is 0, and it's in column 3 or 7, then replace with 8. If it's 6, and in column 3-6, replace with 7. But for other cases, leave it as is. But this would not explain the changes in Example 2's second row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is more complex. For example, certain cells are replaced based on their position in the grid. For instance, if the cell is in row 5, then certain columns are modified. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, for each cell (i, j):\n\n- if i is 5 (row 5), then:\n\n   - if j is 1, 2, 7: replace 0 with 8, 6 with 7.\n\n   - if j is 3-6: replace 6 with 7.\n\n- if i is 1 (row 2), then:\n\n   - if j is 3 or 7: replace 0 with 8.\n\nBut this is too specific and may not apply to other examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and whether it's in a certain row or column. For example, if the cell is in column 3 or 7, then 0 becomes 8, 6 becomes 7. But in Example 2's second row, the input has 7 and 8 in columns 2, 3, etc., which are replaced with 6 and 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's values and their positions, but the rules are not clear. Given the examples, perhaps the best approach is to find a pattern that works for the given examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLooking back at the examples:\n\nExample 1:\n\nIn the sixth row (row 5), the 0s are replaced with 8s, and 6s with 7s. So for this row, the middle columns (3-6) are 6s replaced with 7s, and the first and last columns (1 and 7) are 0s replaced with 8s.\n\nExample 2:\n\nIn the second row (row 1), the input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are replaced with 6 and 0. For example, column 1 (7) becomes 6, column 2 (8) becomes 0, column 3 (7) becomes 6, column 4 (8) becomes 0, and so on.\n\nThis suggests that for this row, even columns are replaced with 6 and 0 alternately. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, for row 1 (second row), columns 1, 3, 5, 7 are replaced with 6 and 0 based on their position.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, if the cell is in row 1 and column 1, it's replaced with 6. If it's in column 2, replaced with 0, etc. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in column 3 or 7, then 0 becomes 8, 6 becomes 7. But in Example 2's second row, the columns 3 and 7 are 0s (in the input?), no, in Example 2's second row, the input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. So the columns are 0-based:\n\ncolumns 0:4, 1:7, 2:8, 3:7, 4:8, 5:8, 6:8, 7:8, 8:4.\n\nThe output for this row is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are modified. So for column 1 (7), it's replaced with 6. Column 2 (8) replaced with 0. Column 3 (7) replaced with 6. Column 4 (8) replaced with 0. Column 5 (8) replaced with 0. Column 6 (8) replaced with 0. Column 7 (8) replaced with 0. So this seems like a pattern where even columns (columns 1, 3, 5, 7) are replaced with 6 and 0 alternately. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for this row, the even columns are replaced with 6 and 0 based on their position. For example, column 1 is 6, column 2 is 0, column 3 is 6, column 4 is 0, etc. But how to determine this.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe the best approach is to find a pattern that works for the examples and code it.\n\nLet me think about the following possible rules:\n\nFor each cell (i, j):\n\n- If the cell is in row 5 (sixth row), then:\n\n   - if j is 1, 2, or 7: replace 0 with 8, 6 with 7.\n\n   - if j is 3-6: replace 6 with 7.\n\n- If the cell is in row 1 (second row), then:\n\n   - if j is even (columns 1, 3, 5, 7): replace 7 with 6, 8 with 0.\n\nBut this is just for the examples given.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example:\n\n- For row 5 (sixth row), columns 1, 2, 7 are replaced with 8 if they are 0, and 7 if they are 6.\n\n- For row 1 (second row), columns 1, 3, 5, 7 are replaced with 6 and 0 based on their position.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, if the cell is in column 3 or 7, then 0 becomes 8, 6 becomes 7. But this would explain some examples.\n\nBut in Example 2's second row, the input has 7 and 8 in columns 1, 2, 3, etc. So this approach may not explain that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, if the cell is in row 5 and column 3-6, replace 6 with 7. If it's in column 1, 2, or 7, replace 0 with 8.\n\nBut this would explain Example 1 and Example 3. For Example 2, it's not clear.\n\nGiven the time I have, perhaps I should proceed with the following approach:\n\n- For each cell (i, j):\n\n   - If it's in row 5 (sixth row):\n\n      - if j is 1, 2, or 7:\n\n         - if the original value is 0 \u2192 8\n\n         - if the original value is 6 \u2192 7\n\n      - if j is 3-6:\n\n         - if the original value is 6 \u2192 7\n\n   - Else if it's in row 1 (second row):\n\n      - if j is 1, 3, 5, 7:\n\n         - if the original value is 7 \u2192 6\n\n         - if the original value is 8 \u2192 0\n\n   - Else:\n\n      - leave it as is.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples. However, this may not cover all cases.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the position of the cell in a certain way. For example, for certain rows and columns, replace values based on their original value.\n\nBut since the examples are not fully consistent, this is challenging.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output's sixth row has 8s and 7s. In Example 3, the output's second row has 8s in columns 3 and 7. In Example 2, the output's second row has 8s in columns 2 and 7. So maybe the columns 2 and 7 are being replaced with 8s for certain rows.\n\nBut this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, if the cell is in row 5, column 3-6, replace 6 with 7. If the cell is in column 3 or 7, replace 0 with 8.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nLet me try to code this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(7):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(9):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            if i == 5:  # sixth row\n                if j in [1, 2, 7]:\n                    if val == 0:\n                        row.append(8)\n                    elif val == 6:\n                        row.append(7)\n                    else:\n                        row.append(val)\n                elif 3 <= j <= 6:\n                    if val == 6:\n                        row.append(7)\n                    else:\n                        row.append(val)\n                else:\n                    row.append(val)\n            elif i == 1:  # second row\n                if j in [1, 3, 5, 7]:\n                    if val == 7:\n                        row.append(6)\n                    elif val == 8:\n                        row.append(0)\n                    else:\n                        row.append(val)\n                else:\n                    row.append(val)\n            else:\n                row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just for the examples given. However, this code would handle Example 1 and 3, but not sure about Example 2. For Example 2's second row (i=1), the code would replace columns 1,3,5,7. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 2's second row input is [4,7,8,7,8,8,8,8,4]. So for j=1 (7), it's replaced with 6. j=3 (7) \u2192 6. j=5 (8) \u2192 0. j=7 (8) \u2192 0. So the output would be [4,6,8,6,0,8,8,0,4]. But the actual output for this row is [4,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,4]. So this doesn't match. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the code is not correct. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 2's second row, the output is [4,6,0,6,0,0,0,0,4]. The original input is [4,7,8,7,8,8,8,8,4]. So the changes are:\n\n- column 1: 7 \u2192 6\n\n- column 2: 8 \u2192 0\n\n- column 3: 7 \u2192 6\n\n- column 4: 8 \u2192 0\n\n- column 5: 8 \u2192 0\n\n- column 6: 8 \u2192 0\n\n- column 7: 8 \u2192 0\n\nSo for columns 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 in this row, the values are being replaced. It seems like for even columns (1,3,5,7) and odd columns (2,4,6), but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for this row, the even columns are replaced with 6 and 0 alternately. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time I have, perhaps I should proceed with the initial approach, even if it doesn't cover all cases, and see if it can handle the examples.\n\nBut how to handle the test input. The test input is a 7x9 grid. The code above would handle the sixth row, but not sure about others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, if the cell is in row 5, then certain columns are replaced. For other rows, maybe other rules.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in column 3 or 7, then 0 becomes 8, 6 becomes 7. For other columns, if the cell is 6, replace with 7.\n\nBut this would explain some examples.\n\nLet me try this:\n\nFor each cell (i, j):\n\n- if j is 3 or 7:\n\n   - if original value is 0 \u2192 8\n\n   - if original value is 6 \u2192 7\n\n- else if original value is 6:\n\n   - replace with 7\n\n- else:\n\n   - leave as is.\n\nBut let's test this on the examples.\n\nExample 1's sixth row:\n\ncolumns 3-6 are 6s, replaced with 7s. Columns 1, 2, 7 are 0s \u2192 replaced with 8. So this would fit.\n\nExample 2's second row: input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. Columns 3 and 7 are 7 and 8. So for column 3 (j=3), original value is 7 \u2192 not 0 or 6, so left as is. But in the output, it's replaced with 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the sixth row's columns 3-6 are replaced with 7s. In Example 3, the second row's columns 3 and 7 are replaced with 8s. So maybe for certain rows, certain columns are replaced.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nGiven the time I have, I think the best approach is to proceed with the code that handles the sixth row and some other rows, even if it's not perfect. The code may not handle all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code will check for certain rows and columns and apply the transformation. For example:\n\n- For row 5 (sixth row), columns 1, 2, 7 are replaced with 8 if 0, and 7 if 6.\n\n- For row 1 (second row), columns 1, 3, 5, 7 are replaced with 6 and 0 based on their position.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original grid's value and the row and column indices. For example, if the cell is in row 5 and column 3-6, replace 6 with 7. For column 1, 2, 7, replace 0 with 8.\n\nThis would handle Example 1 and 3.\n\nBut for Example 2's second row, it's not clear.\n\nIn the end, I'll proceed with this approach, even if it's not perfect, and write the code.\n"
