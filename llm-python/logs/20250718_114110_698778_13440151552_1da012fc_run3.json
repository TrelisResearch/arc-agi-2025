          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice several patterns:\n\n1. The output grid seems to have a \"border\" of 5s along the edges\n2. There are patterns of 2s, 3s, 4s, and 6s that appear in specific positions\n3. The numbers 2, 3, 4, and 6 seem to be \"expanded\" or \"filled in\" in certain areas\n4. The number 5 appears to be a \"border\" or \"outline\" in the output grid\n5. There are patterns where certain numbers are replaced or expanded based on their position\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Keeps the border of 5s\n- Expands certain numbers (2, 3, 4, 6) in specific patterns\n- Leaves other numbers unchanged\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

The output grid seems to have a \"border\" of 5s along the edges\n2. There are patterns of 2s, 3s, 4s, and 6s that appear in specific positions\n3. The numbers 2, 3, 4, and 6 seem to be \"expanded\" or \"filled in\" in certain areas\n4. The number 5 appears to be a \"border\" or \"outline\" in the output grid\n5. There are patterns where certain numbers are replaced or expanded based on their position\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Keeps the border of 5s\n- Expands certain numbers (2, 3, 4, 6) in specific patterns\n- Leaves other numbers unchanged\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
