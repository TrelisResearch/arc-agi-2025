In Example 1, the value 9 in the input (position (0,4)) appears in the output at (3,4) and (4,4), and the value 8 in the input (positions (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)) appears in the output at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), and (6,4) with a new value 6 added at (6,4).\n\n2. In Example 2, the value 7 in the input (position (0,4)) appears in the output at (3,4), and the value 8 in the input (positions (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)) appears in the output at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), and (7,4) with a new value 3 added at (7,4).\n\n3. In Example 3, the value 4 in the input (position (0,4)) appears in the output at (3,4), and the value 8 in the input (positions (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)) appears in the output at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), and (8,4) with new values 4, 3, 2, 7 added at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (7,4).\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Copying values from the input grid to the output grid\n- Adding new values in specific positions based on the input values\n- Modifying values in specific positions based on the input values\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Copies values from the input grid to the output grid\n- Adds new values in specific positions based on the input values\n- Modifies values in specific positions based on the input values\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Check for specific patterns and apply transformations\n    # Example 1 pattern: value 9 at (0,4) appears in output at (3,4) and (4,4)\n    if grid[0][4] == 9:\n        transformed_grid[3][4] = 9\n        transformed_grid[4][4] = 9\n    \n    # Example 2 pattern: value 7 at (0,4) appears in output at (3,4)\n    if grid[0][4] == 7:\n        transformed_grid[3][4] = 7\n    \n    # Example 3 pattern: value 4 at (0,4) appears in output at (3,4)\n    if grid[0][4] == 4:\n        transformed_grid[3][4] = 4\n    \n    # Additional pattern: values in the 4th column (index 4) are modified\n    for row in range(10):\n        if grid[row][4] == 8:\n            transformed_grid[row][4] = 8\n            if row == 3:\n                transformed_grid[row][4] = 9\n            elif row == 6:\n                transformed_grid[row][4] = 6\n            elif row == 7:\n                transformed_grid[row][4] = 3\n            elif row == 8:\n                transformed_grid[row][4] = 7\n    \n    # Additional pattern: values in the 9th column (index 9) are modified\n    for row in range(10):\n        if grid[row][9] == 4:\n            transformed_grid[row][9] = 4\n            if row == 6:\n                transformed_grid[row][9] = 6\n            elif row == 7:\n                transformed_grid[row][9] = 2\n            elif row == 8:\n                transformed_grid[row][9] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The value 3 appears in the input grid and is often preserved in the output grid, but sometimes it's replaced by other values.\n8. The value 0 appears in the input grid and is often preserved in the output grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with others based on their positions and values.\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values based on observed patterns\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8 with 6 or 3 based on position\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif i < 3 and j >= 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif i >= 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif i >= 3 and j >= 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Preserve 4\n                pass\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                # Preserve 7\n                pass\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Preserve 6\n                pass\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Preserve 2\n                pass\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Preserve 3\n                pass\n            elif grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Preserve 0\n                pass\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values based on observed patterns\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8 with 6 or 3 based on position\n                if i < 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif i < 3 and j >= 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif i >= 3 and j < 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif i >= 3 and j >= 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Preserve 4\n                pass\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                # Preserve 7\n                pass\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Preserve 6\n                pass\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Preserve 2\n                pass\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Preserve 3\n                pass\n            elif grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Preserve 0\n                pass\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 1, the value 9 in the input (position (0,4)) appears in the output at (3,4) and (4,4), and the value 8 in the input (positions (3,4), (4,4), (5,4)) appears in the output at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), and (6,4) with a new value 6 added at (6,4).\n\n2. In Example 2, the value 7 in the input (position (0,4)) appears in the output at (3,4), and the value 8 in the input (positions (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4)) appears in the output at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), and (7,4) with a new value 3 added at (7,4).\n\n3. In Example 3, the value 4 in the input (position (0,4)) appears in the output at (3,4), and the value 8 in the input (positions (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4)) appears in the output at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), and (8,4) with new values 4, 3, 2, 7 added at (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (7,4).\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Copying values from the input grid to the output grid\n- Adding new values in specific positions based on the input values\n- Modifying values in specific positions based on the input values\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Copies values from the input grid to the output grid\n- Adds new values in specific positions based on the input values\n- Modifies values in specific positions based on the input values\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Check for specific patterns and apply transformations\n    # Example 1 pattern: value 9 at (0,4) appears in output at (3,4) and (4,4)\n    if grid[0][4] == 9:\n        transformed_grid[3][4] = 9\n        transformed_grid[4][4] = 9\n    \n    # Example 2 pattern: value 7 at (0,4) appears in output at (3,4)\n    if grid[0][4] == 7:\n        transformed_grid[3][4] = 7\n    \n    # Example 3 pattern: value 4 at (0,4) appears in output at (3,4)\n    if grid[0][4] == 4:\n        transformed_grid[3][4] = 4\n    \n    # Additional pattern: values in the 4th column (index 4) are modified\n    for row in range(10):\n        if grid[row][4] == 8:\n            transformed_grid[row][4] = 8\n            if row == 3:\n                transformed_grid[row][4] = 9\n            elif row == 6:\n                transformed_grid[row][4] = 6\n            elif row == 7:\n                transformed_grid[row][4] = 3\n            elif row == 8:\n                transformed_grid[row][4] = 7\n    \n    # Additional pattern: values in the 9th column (index 9) are modified\n    for row in range(10):\n        if grid[row][9] == 4:\n            transformed_grid[row][9] = 4\n            if row == 6:\n                transformed_grid[row][9] = 6\n            elif row == 7:\n                transformed_grid[row][9] = 2\n            elif row == 8:\n                transformed_grid[row][9] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
