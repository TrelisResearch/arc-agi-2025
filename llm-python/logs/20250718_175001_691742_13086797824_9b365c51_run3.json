The output grid seems to be a transformation where certain values are replaced or modified based on their position and value.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where values in the input grid are replaced with other values in the output grid, often based on their position in the grid.\n3. In some examples, values are replaced with a specific number (like 4, 2, 3, etc.) in certain positions.\n4. There seems to be a pattern where values in the input grid are transformed based on their row and column positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces values in the input grid based on their position and value.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
