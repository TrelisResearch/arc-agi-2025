          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid seems to be a transformation of the input grid where certain values are moved or transformed in specific ways.\n2. In Example 1, the values 3, 2, 5 are moved to new positions in the output grid.\n3. In Example 2, the values are rearranged in a specific pattern that seems to be related to their positions.\n4. In Example 3, values are moved to new positions, with some values being replaced by others.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves moving values from their original positions to new positions in a specific pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
