I notice that in some examples, the output grid appears to be a mirror or rotated version of the input grid, but not always.\n\nFrom the examples, I hypothesize that the transformation might involve:\n1. Preserving the original grid structure\n2. Applying some form of symmetry (mirror or rotation)\n3. Changing certain values based on their position\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that preserves the grid structure and applies a simple symmetry transformation (mirroring the grid horizontally).\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Mirror the grid horizontally\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(8):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][15-j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Mirror the grid horizontally\n    for i in range(16):\n        for j in range(8):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][15-j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
