All outputs are vertical (column) grids of varying lengths, but **the prompt requires the output to always be a 3\u00d71 grid**.\n2. In every example, the output cells are **the unique values from the top row, the first row to introduce new values not previously seen**, **in the order those values first appear**.\n   - If the entire grid has consecutive identical rows, just one value appears.\n   - When rows introduce new values (as in longer grids), the output lists the _unique values as they appear for the first time from top to bottom_.\n\n## Examining Examples:\n- Example 1: All identical row values per row, so output is the first value.\n- Example 2: The first row is the output.\n- Example 3: In the first row, sequence is `[2,3,3,8,1]` but output is `[2,3,8,1]` (removing duplicate in sequence, first instance order).\n- Example 4: Rows have repeating values in pairs, the output lists the first value of each block as they appear (from top).\n- Example 5: Each 2-row block is all one value, so output lists the first value for each block (from top).\n\n## Hypothesis:\n- For each contiguous block of identical rows, output the first value of a representative row from each block, in order.\n- If blocks are single rows, simply take the value(s) in the row.\n- To ensure **3\u00d71 output**, only the first 3 unique found values should be extracted (if there are fewer, pad/trim as needed).\n\n## Implementation Plan:\n1.
