          "content": "Based on the training examples, it appears that the transformation involves replacing certain values with 8s in specific patterns. Let's analyze the patterns:\n\n1. **Value Replacement**: The most noticeable pattern is the replacement of some values with 8s. For example, in Example 1, the value 4 is replaced with 8 in the output grid.\n\n2. **Positional Patterns**: There are also positional patterns where certain values are replaced in specific positions. For instance, in Example 2, the value 2 is replaced with 8 in the output grid at certain positions.\n\nGiven these observations, let's implement a transformation function that attempts to capture these patterns. The function will replace values based on the observed patterns.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]  # Create a copy of the input grid\n    \n    # Replace certain values with 8 based on observed patterns\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis function creates a copy of the input grid and then iterates through each element. If the element is 4 or 2, it replaces it with 8. This is a simple and effective way to capture the observed patterns in the training examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]  # Create a copy of the input grid\n    \n    # Replace certain values with 8 based on observed patterns\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "Based on the training examples, it appears that the transformation involves replacing certain values with 8s in specific patterns. Let's analyze the patterns:\n\n1. **Value Replacement**: The most noticeable pattern is the replacement of some values with 8s. For example, in Example 1, the value 4 is replaced with 8 in the output grid.\n\n2. **Positional Patterns**: There are also positional patterns where certain values are replaced in specific positions. For instance, in Example 2, the value 2 is replaced with 8 in the output grid at certain positions.\n\nGiven these observations, let's implement a transformation function that attempts to capture these patterns. The function will replace values based on the observed patterns.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]  # Create a copy of the input grid\n    \n    # Replace certain values with 8 based on observed patterns\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis function creates a copy of the input grid and then iterates through each element. If the element is 4 or 2, it replaces it with 8. This is a simple and effective way to capture the observed patterns in the training examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]  # Create a copy of the input grid\n    \n    # Replace certain values with 8 based on observed patterns\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
