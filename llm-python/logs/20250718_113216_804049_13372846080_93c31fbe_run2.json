The transformation seems to involve some form of pattern recognition and modification, particularly focusing on specific numbers (like 2, 8, 3, 4) and their positions.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain numbers are replaced or modified based on their neighbors or positions.\n3. The transformation often involves expanding or contracting certain patterns, particularly around specific numbers.\n4. There are also instances where numbers are replaced with 0 or other values based on their context.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Looks for specific patterns (like 2s, 8s, 3s, 4s)\n- Modifies them based on their neighbors\n- Expands or contracts patterns as needed\n- Ensures the output is always a 23\u00d725 grid\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

The transformation seems to involve some form of pattern recognition and modification, particularly focusing on specific numbers (like 2, 8, 3, 4) and their positions.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain numbers are replaced or modified based on their neighbors or positions.\n3. The transformation often involves expanding or contracting certain patterns, particularly around specific numbers.\n4. There are also instances where numbers are replaced with 0 or other values based on their context.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Looks for specific patterns (like 2s, 8s, 3s, 4s)\n- Modifies them based on their neighbors\n- Expands or contracts patterns as needed\n- Ensures the output is always a 23\u00d725 grid\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
