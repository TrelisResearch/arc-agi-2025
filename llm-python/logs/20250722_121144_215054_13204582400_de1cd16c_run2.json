Specifically, it appears that the output is the **minimum value among all the unique values that appear in the grid**.\n\nLet me explain this pattern based on the examples:\n\n1. In Example 1, the grid contains values like 4, 6, 8, 0, and 1. The minimum of these is 0, but the output is 8. This suggests that my initial hypothesis might be incorrect.\n\n2. In Example 2, the grid contains values like 3, 2, 1, 8. The minimum is 1, but the output is 2. This further suggests that the pattern is not simply the minimum value.\n\n3. In Example 3, the grid contains values like 1, 5, 6, 4. The minimum is 1, but the output is 6. This is inconsistent with the previous pattern.\n\n4. In Example 4, the grid contains values like 1, 8, 4, 2. The minimum is 1, but the output is 4.\n\nFrom these examples, it seems that the output is the **maximum value that appears in the grid**.

This suggests that the output is the minimum value that appears in the grid, but I need to verify this hypothesis.\n\nLooking at the input grids, I notice that the output value is often the smallest value that appears in the grid. For example:\n- In Example 1, the smallest value is 0, but the output is 8. This doesn't fit the hypothesis.\n- In Example 2, the smallest value is 1, but the output is 2. This doesn't fit the hypothesis.\n- In Example 3, the smallest value is 0, but the output is 6. This doesn't fit the hypothesis.\n- In Example 4, the smallest value is 1, but the output is 4. This doesn't fit the hypothesis.\n\nAfter closer inspection, I notice that the output value is the smallest value that appears in the grid that is not 0.
