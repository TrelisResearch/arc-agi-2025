          "The training examples suggest a pattern of creating and growing blue square patches around specific yellow dot clusters. The core transformations appear to involve:\n\n- Identifying initial yellow clusters (dots) of varying sizes\n- Creating a blue square of specific size around these dots\n- Expanding or increasing the size of the blue square in subsequent steps\n- The blue regions seem to grow outward around the clusters over iterations\n- The test input indicates a new cluster with some initial size, which would likely be expanded into a larger blue square with some yellow dots within, following the observed pattern.\n\nGiven these observations, a likely pattern is:  \n**For each yellow cluster, grow a blue square around it that encompasses the cluster, increasing in size as the pattern proceeds.**  \nIn the training examples, the blue squares tend to expand over iterations, often a 2x2 or larger square. They seem to maintain the position relative to the clusters.\n\n**Implementation plan:**\n- Detect the yellow clusters (cells with value 4)\n- For each cluster, determine its bounding box (min/max row & col)\n- Attempt to create a blue square (value 1) that encompasses the bounding box, expanded by 1 cell in all directions if possible to create the effect seen\n- Replace that region with the blue square\n- The expansion mimics the growth pattern observed over the examples\n\nHere's an implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # Initialize output with zeros\n    output = np.zeros((23, 23), dtype=int)\n\n    # Find yellow clusters (value 4)\n    yellow_positions = np.argwhere(grid == 4)\n\n    if len(yellow_positions) == 0:\n        # No yellow clusters, just fill the grid with original\n        return grid.tolist()\n\n    # Get bounding box for yellow clusters\n    min_row, min_col = yellow_positions.min(axis=0)\n    max_row, max_col = yellow_positions.max(axis=0)\n\n    # Expand bounding box by 1 in all directions, respecting grid bounds\n    top = max(min_row - 1, 0)\n    bottom = min(max_row + 1, rows - 1)\n    left = max(min_col - 1, 0)\n    right = min(max_col + 1, cols - 1)\n\n    # Fill the bounding box with blue square (value 1)\n    output[top:bottom+1, left:right+1] = 1\n\n    # Copy other cells directly from original (for yellow dots, keep their original value)\n    for r, c in yellow_positions:\n        output[r, c] = grid[r, c]\n    # Keep other original values outside the bounding box\n    # For simplicity, copying the rest, since the background is mostly zeros\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if output[r, c] == 0:\n                output[r, c] = grid[r, c]\n\n    # Enforce that output is 23x23\n    # Already initialized as 23x23 with zeros, so no padding needed\n\n    return output.tolist()\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- This approach detects the first yellow cluster and makes a blue square around it similar to the pattern seen.\n- In real patterns, multiple clusters might be involved, but the provided examples suggest growing around the main cluster.\n- The code ensures the output is always 23\u00d723, per requirement.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # Initialize output with zeros\n    output = np.zeros((23, 23), dtype=int)\n\n    # Find yellow clusters (value 4)\n    yellow_positions = np.argwhere(grid == 4)\n\n    if len(yellow_positions) == 0:\n        # No yellow clusters, just fill the grid with original\n        return grid.tolist()\n\n    # Get bounding box for yellow clusters\n    min_row, min_col = yellow_positions.min(axis=0)\n    max_row, max_col = yellow_positions.max(axis=0)\n\n    # Expand bounding box by 1 in all directions, respecting grid bounds\n    top = max(min_row - 1, 0)\n    bottom = min(max_row + 1, rows - 1)\n    left = max(min_col - 1, 0)\n    right = min(max_col + 1, cols - 1)\n\n    # Fill the bounding box with blue square (value 1)\n    output[top:bottom+1, left:right+1] = 1\n\n    # Copy yellow dots in their original positions\n    for r, c in yellow_positions:\n        output[r, c] = grid[r, c]\n\n    # Fill remaining cells from the original grid\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if output[r, c] == 0:\n                output[r, c] = grid[r, c]\n\n    return output.tolist()\n```"

              "The training examples suggest a pattern of creating and growing blue square patches around specific yellow dot clusters. The core transformations appear to involve:\n\n- Identifying initial yellow clusters (dots) of varying sizes\n- Creating a blue square of specific size around these dots\n- Expanding or increasing the size of the blue square in subsequent steps\n- The blue regions seem to grow outward around the clusters over iterations\n- The test input indicates a new cluster with some initial size, which would likely be expanded into a larger blue square with some yellow dots within, following the observed pattern.\n\nGiven these observations, a likely pattern is:  \n**For each yellow cluster, grow a blue square around it that encompasses the cluster, increasing in size as the pattern proceeds.**  \nIn the training examples, the blue squares tend to expand over iterations, often a 2x2 or larger square. They seem to maintain the position relative to the clusters.\n\n**Implementation plan:**\n- Detect the yellow clusters (cells with value 4)\n- For each cluster, determine its bounding box (min/max row & col)\n- Attempt to create a blue square (value 1) that encompasses the bounding box, expanded by 1 cell in all directions if possible to create the effect seen\n- Replace that region with the blue square\n- The expansion mimics the growth pattern observed over the examples\n\nHere's an implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # Initialize output with zeros\n    output = np.zeros((23, 23), dtype=int)\n\n    # Find yellow clusters (value 4)\n    yellow_positions = np.argwhere(grid == 4)\n\n    if len(yellow_positions) == 0:\n        # No yellow clusters, just fill the grid with original\n        return grid.tolist()\n\n    # Get bounding box for yellow clusters\n    min_row, min_col = yellow_positions.min(axis=0)\n    max_row, max_col = yellow_positions.max(axis=0)\n\n    # Expand bounding box by 1 in all directions, respecting grid bounds\n    top = max(min_row - 1, 0)\n    bottom = min(max_row + 1, rows - 1)\n    left = max(min_col - 1, 0)\n    right = min(max_col + 1, cols - 1)\n\n    # Fill the bounding box with blue square (value 1)\n    output[top:bottom+1, left:right+1] = 1\n\n    # Copy other cells directly from original (for yellow dots, keep their original value)\n    for r, c in yellow_positions:\n        output[r, c] = grid[r, c]\n    # Keep other original values outside the bounding box\n    # For simplicity, copying the rest, since the background is mostly zeros\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if output[r, c] == 0:\n                output[r, c] = grid[r, c]\n\n    # Enforce that output is 23x23\n    # Already initialized as 23x23 with zeros, so no padding needed\n\n    return output.tolist()\n```\n\n**Notes:**\n- This approach detects the first yellow cluster and makes a blue square around it similar to the pattern seen.\n- In real patterns, multiple clusters might be involved, but the provided examples suggest growing around the main cluster.\n- The code ensures the output is always 23\u00d723, per requirement.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    rows, cols = grid.shape\n\n    # Initialize output with zeros\n    output = np.zeros((23, 23), dtype=int)\n\n    # Find yellow clusters (value 4)\n    yellow_positions = np.argwhere(grid == 4)\n\n    if len(yellow_positions) == 0:\n        # No yellow clusters, just fill the grid with original\n        return grid.tolist()\n\n    # Get bounding box for yellow clusters\n    min_row, min_col = yellow_positions.min(axis=0)\n    max_row, max_col = yellow_positions.max(axis=0)\n\n    # Expand bounding box by 1 in all directions, respecting grid bounds\n    top = max(min_row - 1, 0)\n    bottom = min(max_row + 1, rows - 1)\n    left = max(min_col - 1, 0)\n    right = min(max_col + 1, cols - 1)\n\n    # Fill the bounding box with blue square (value 1)\n    output[top:bottom+1, left:right+1] = 1\n\n    # Copy yellow dots in their original positions\n    for r, c in yellow_positions:\n        output[r, c] = grid[r, c]\n\n    # Fill remaining cells from the original grid\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if output[r, c] == 0:\n                output[r, c] = grid[r, c]\n\n    return output.tolist()\n```"
