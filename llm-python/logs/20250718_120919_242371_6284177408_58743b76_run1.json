          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let's look at the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are 10x10. The input has some 8s and 0s, and the output changes some of the 0s to other numbers. For instance, in the third row of the input, the third column is 0, and in the output, it's 0, but the seventh column changes from 1 to 4. Wait, looking at the input and output for Example 1:\n\nInput row 3: 8 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\nOutput row 3: 8 8 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\nSo the 7th element (index 6, since it's 0-based) changes from 1 to 4. Similarly, in row 5 of input, the 7th element is 0, and in output it's 4. Hmm, maybe there's some pattern related to the positions of 1s and 0s?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the seventh column in some rows changes from 1 to 4. Maybe the 1s in the input are being replaced by 4s? But in the input, there's a 1 in row 3, column 6 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but in the output, that position becomes 4. Wait, in the input for example 1, the third row is [8,8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. The seventh element (index 6) is 1, and in output it's 4. Similarly, in row 5 of input, the seventh element is 0, but in output it's 4. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me check row 5 of input and output.\n\nInput row 5: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\nOutput row 5: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 4\nSo the 8th element (index 7) was 1, now 4, and the 10th (index 9) was 1, now 4. So maybe whenever there's a 1 in the input, it's replaced by 4? But in the input, there's a 1 in row 3, column 6 (original input), and in output that's 4. Also, in row 5, the 7th element (index 7) was 1, now 4. But in the input, there's also a 1 in row 5, column 9 (index 9). So that's changed to 4. So maybe all 1s in the input are turned into 4s?\n\nBut wait, looking at the output of example 1, there's a 4 in the seventh column of row 3, which was originally 1. So that's a 1\u21924. Also, in row 5, the 7th column is 0, but in output it's 4. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the positions. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input for example 1's third row is:\n\nInput row 3: 8 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nSo the seventh element (index 6) is 1. The output row 3 is:\n\n8 8 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n\nSo that seventh element (index 6) is 4. So that's a 1\u21924. But in row 5 of input, the seventh element (index 6) is 0. The output row 5 is:\n\n8 8 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 4\n\nSo the 7th element (index 6) is 0, but the 8th (index 7) is 4 and the 9th (index 9) is 4. So maybe the 1s are being replaced by 4s, but how does that fit with the 0s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being changed based on their neighbors. For example, in example 1, the 1s are in certain positions and their surrounding cells are being modified. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput has some 8s and 0s, and the output changes some of the 0s to 4, 6, 1, etc. For example, in the third row of input, the fifth element is 2, and in the output, it's 4. Wait, the input for example 2's third row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n\nOutput third row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n\nSo the fifth element (index 4) changes from 2 to 4. Similarly, in the fourth row of input:\n\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 8 8\n\nOutput is:\n\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 8 8\n\nSo the second element (index 1) changes from 2 to 4, and the ninth element (index 8) changes from 2 to 6. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced based on their values. For example, in example 2, the 2s are being replaced by 4s and 6s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, in example 1, the 1s are being replaced by 4s. In example 2, the 2s are being replaced by 4s and 6s. But that's not consistent. Maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding 0s or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, in example 1, the 1 in row 3, column 6 is replaced by 4. Then in example 2, the 2 in row 3, column 4 is replaced by 4. Maybe the 1s and 2s are being replaced by 4s, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1 and example 2, perhaps the transformation is replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the 1s are being turned into 4s. In example 2, the 2s are being turned into 4s and 6s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from certain points. For example, in example 1, the 1 is in the middle of some region, and the 4 is placed there. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. The test input has some 0s, 1s, and 8s. The output is supposed to be a 10x10 grid. But since I don't have the output for the test input, I can't check. But perhaps the pattern is that certain numbers are being replaced based on their positions. For example, in the test input's first row: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8. The output would have some changes. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, in example 1, the 1s are being replaced by 4s. But in example 2, the 2s are being replaced by 4s and 6s. Maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their value and their position. For example, if a cell is a 1, replace with 4. If it's a 2, replace with 4 or 6 based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, if a cell is a 1, then in the output, it's replaced by 4. But in example 1, the 1 in row 3, column 6 is replaced by 4. In example 2, the 2 in row 3, column 4 is replaced by 4. So maybe 1\u21924, 2\u21924 or 6, but why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding cells that are 0. For example, if a cell is 1, and it's surrounded by certain numbers, then it's replaced by 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at example 1's output, the 4s appear in positions where there was a 1 or 0. For example, in row 3, column 6 (originally 1) becomes 4. In row 5, column 7 (originally 0) becomes 4. So maybe the 4s are replacing the 1s and 0s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 0s. For example, in example 1, the 0s in certain positions are being replaced by 4s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 0s in the row or column. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the positions of the 1s and 2s. For example, in example 1, the 1 is replaced by 4, and in example 2, the 2 is replaced by 4. But why?\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the examples. Let's take example 1 and example 2 and see what's changing.\n\nIn example 1, the input has 1s and 0s, and the output changes some of them to 4s. In example 2, the input has 2s and 0s, and the output changes some of them to 4s and 6s. Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are being replaced by other numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is 1, replace with 4. If it's 2, replace with 4 or 6. But how to determine which ones?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, then it's replaced by a certain value. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the 4s are appearing in positions that are adjacent to certain numbers. For example, in row 3, column 6 (originally 1) becomes 4. In row 5, column 7 (originally 0) becomes 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers in the input. For example, in example 1, the 1s are in certain positions and are replaced by 4s. In example 2, the 2s are in certain positions and are replaced by 4s and 6s. Maybe the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, but that doesn't explain the 6 in example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of times a certain value appears in the grid. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, think about the test input. Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest input is a 12x14 grid? Wait, no. Wait, the test input is given as 12 rows, each with 14 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 10x10. Wait, the test input is probably a 10x10 grid. Wait, looking at the test input provided:\n\nThe test input is:\n\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 8 8\n1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 8 8\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 3 1\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 7 4\n\nWait, but the problem says that the output must be 10x10. So the test input is 14 columns? But that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem says that the test input is shown for context, but the actual input is a 10x10 grid. So perhaps the test input is a 12x14 grid, but that's not relevant. The problem says that the function must take a 2D list (grid) where each row is a list of integers, and return a 10x10 grid. So the test input is probably a 10x10 grid. But the way it's written here is confusing. However, the user provided the test input as a 12x14 grid, which is probably a mistake. But regardless, the function needs to process a 10x10 grid.\n\nBut given the examples, perhaps the transformation is that certain numbers are being replaced by others based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the 1s are replaced by 4s, and in example 2, the 2s are replaced by 4s and 6s. Maybe the pattern is that certain numbers are being replaced by 4s, and other numbers by 6s, depending on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's a 1, it's replaced by 4, if it's a 2, replaced by 4 or 6, and 0s are replaced based on some other rule. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, then it's replaced by a certain value. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother idea: in example 1, the output has 4s in positions that were previously 1s or 0s. Maybe the 4s are replacing the 1s and 0s that are in certain positions. For example, in example 1, the 1 in row 3 is replaced by 4, and the 0 in row 5, column 6 is replaced by 4. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding 0s. For example, if a cell has a certain number of 0s around it, then it's replaced by 4. But again, without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers in the input. For example, in example 1, the 1 is at (row 3, column 6), and in the output, it's replaced by 4. In example 2, the 2 is at (row 3, column 4) and is replaced by 4. Maybe the transformation is that any cell with a value of 1 or 2 is replaced by 4. But in example 2, there's a 2 that's replaced by 6. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from certain points. For example, in example 1, the 1 is in a position that is near the center, and is replaced by 4. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output of example 1. The 4s are appearing in positions that are adjacent to other numbers. For example, in row 3, column 6 (originally 1) becomes 4. In row 5, column 7 (originally 0) becomes 4. Maybe this is related to the positions of other numbers.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4. But in example 2, there's a 2 that is replaced by 6. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if row + column is even, replace with 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2's output: in row 3, column 4 (originally 2) is replaced by 4. In row 4, column 1 (originally 2) is replaced by 4, and column 8 (originally 2) is replaced by 6. So maybe the value depends on the position. For example, if the row is even, replace with 4, if odd, replace with 6. But in example 2, row 3 is odd, and the 2 is replaced by 4. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that if a cell is a 1, it's replaced by 4, and if it's a 2, it's replaced by 4 or 6 based on some other condition.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Given that, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the transformation replaces 1s with 4s and 2s with 4s or 6s, and 0s with other values. But how to implement that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the positions of the 1s and 2s. For example, in example 1, the 1 is replaced by 4, and in example 2, the 2 is replaced by 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output, the 4s are in positions where the original value was 1 or 0, and the 4 is placed in a certain pattern. For example, in example 1's third row, the 4 is in the seventh column. Maybe that's part of a larger pattern, like replacing certain positions with 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 is replaced by 4, and any cell that is a 0 is replaced by 4 if it is adjacent to a 1. But again, not sure.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern where certain values are replaced by 4s and 6s based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the 1 is replaced by 4. In example 2, the 2 is replaced by 4 or 6. Maybe the replacement depends on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even, replace with 4; if odd, replace with 6. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell with a value of 1 is replaced by 4, and any cell with a value of 2 is replaced by 4 if it's in an even row, and 6 if it's in an odd row. But how to confirm this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the number of 0s in the row. For example, if a row has a certain number of 0s, then replace certain cells.\n\nBut given that I need to write a function, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the examples. For example, in example 1, the 1s are replaced by 4s. In example 2, the 2s are replaced by 4s and 6s. Maybe the transformation is that 1s become 4s, and 2s become 4s or 6s based on some condition. But how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and other cells are unchanged. But in example 2, there's a 2 that is replaced by 6, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell with value 1 is replaced by 4, and any cell with value 2 is replaced by 4 if it is in the first half of the grid, and 6 if it's in the second half. But without more data, this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, in example 1, the 1 is in row 3, column 6. In the output, it's replaced by 4. In example 2, the 2 is in row 3, column 4, and is replaced by 4. Maybe the transformation is that any cell with value 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and other cells are unchanged. But in example 2, there's a 2 that is replaced by 6, so that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the 1s are replaced by 4s, and the 2s are replaced by 4s or 6s based on their positions. For example, in example 2, the 2 in row 3, column 4 is replaced by 4, and the 2 in row 4, column 1 is replaced by 4, and the 2 in row 4, column 8 is replaced by 6. Maybe the 6 is replaced when the column is even or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, if a cell is a 1, replace with 4. If it's a 2, replace with 4 if the row is even, else 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to write a function that replaces 1s with 4s, and 2s with 4s or 6s based on some condition. However, without more examples, this is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell with value 1 is replaced by 4, and any cell with value 2 is replaced by 4 if it is in the first half of the grid, or 6 if in the second half. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and other cells are unchanged. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the 1s are replaced by 4s, and the 2s are replaced by 4s. But in example 2, there's a 2 that is replaced by 6, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the 1s are replaced by 4s, and the 2s are replaced by 4s if they are in certain positions, and 6s otherwise. But again, without more data, it's hard.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to implement a function that replaces 1s with 4s and 2s with 4s. This would handle the first example and part of the second. But in example 2, there's a 2 replaced by 6, which this would not handle. However, given the examples, maybe the correct pattern is that 1s become 4s and 2s become 4s. But why in example 2, some 2s become 6s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the 1s are replaced by 4s, and the 2s are replaced by 4s or 6s based on their positions. For example, in example 2, the 2s are replaced by 4s if they are in even columns, and 6s if in odd columns. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the number of 0s in the row. For example, if a row has more 0s, replace certain cells.\n\nBut given that I have to write a function, I'll proceed with the assumption that the transformation is replacing 1s with 4s and 2s with 4s. This would handle example 1 and part of example 2. However, in example 2, there's a 2 that is replaced by 6. So this might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell with value 1 is replaced by 4, and any cell with value 2 is replaced by 4 if it is in the first half of the grid, or 6 if in the second half. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the 1s are replaced by 4s, and the 2s are replaced by 4s or 6s based on the sum of their row and column indices. For example, if row + column is even, replace with 4, else 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4. This would handle example 1, but not example 2. But given that example 2 has a 2 replaced by 6, this might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the 1s are replaced by 4s, and the 2s are replaced by 4s if they are in certain positions, and 6s otherwise. But without more data, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that 1s are replaced by 4s, and 2s are replaced by 4s. This is the most straightforward pattern that fits example 1 and some of example 2. However, this may not be correct, but it's the best I can do with the given information.\n\nSo, the function would iterate through each cell, and if the value is 1, replace with 4. If the value is 2, replace with 4. For other values, leave as is. But this may not be correct for example 2, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut in example 2, the output for the third row has a 4 in the fifth column (originally 2), and the fourth row has 4 in column 1 (originally 2), and 6 in column 8 (originally 2). So this suggests that the 2s are being replaced by 4 or 6. So perhaps the replacement depends on the position. For example, if the row is even, replace with 4, else 6. Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the position of the cell. For example, if the row is even, replace 2 with 4; if odd, replace with 6. Let's see:\n\nIn example 2, the third row is row index 2 (assuming 0-based). So it's odd. In that row, the 2 is replaced by 4. So this doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the column is even or odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on the column. For example, if the column is even, replace 2 with 4, else 6. In example 2's third row, the 2 is at column 4 (0-based index 4), which is even. So replaced by 4. In the fourth row, the 2 is at column 1 (odd), replaced by 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit. The fourth row's column 8 is even, replaced by 6. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the row and column indices. For example, if row + column is even, replace with 4, else 6. In example 2, the third row (row 2, 0-based), column 4: 2+4=6 even \u2192 4. That fits. The fourth row (row 3), column 1: 3+1=4 even \u2192 4. But in example 2, the fourth row's column 8 is replaced by 6. row 3 + column 8 = 11, which is odd \u2192 6. That fits. So this seems to work for example 2.\n\nSo the pattern could be that for 2s, replace with 4 if row + column is even, else 6. For 1s, replace with 4. For other values, leave as is.\n\nBut how to verify this with example 1?\n\nIn example 1, the 1 is in row 2 (0-based), column 5 (assuming the input is 10x10). Let's see: row 2 (third row), column 5 (index 5). row + column is 2 + 5 = 7, which is odd. But in example 1, the 1 is replaced by 4. So this would not fit. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are replaced by 4 regardless of their position, and the 2s are replaced based on row + column.\n\nSo the transformation would be:\n\nFor each cell:\n\nif value is 1 \u2192 4\n\nelif value is 2 \u2192 if (row + column) is even \u2192 4, else 6\n\nelse \u2192 leave as is.\n\nBut in example 1, the 1 is replaced by 4, which fits. In example 2, the 2s are replaced based on row + column.\n\nLet's check example 2's third row (row index 2), column 4 (index 4): row + column = 2 + 4 = 6 even \u2192 4. Which matches. The fourth row (row index 3), column 1: 3 + 1 = 4 even \u2192 4. Which matches. The fourth row, column 8: 3 + 8 = 11 odd \u2192 6. Which matches.\n\nSo this seems to work for example 2. For example 1, the 1 is in row 2, column 5: 2 + 5 = 7 odd. But the 1 is replaced by 4. So this doesn't fit. So this suggests that the 1s are replaced by 4 regardless of their position.\n\nSo the overall pattern could be:\n\n- Replace all 1s with 4.\n\n- Replace 2s with 4 if (row + column) is even, else 6.\n\n- For other values, leave as is.\n\nBut how to handle other values. For example, in example 1, the 0s are replaced by 4s in certain positions. But according to this rule, they would remain as 0s. But in example 1, some 0s are replaced by 4s. So this suggests that this rule is not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is more complex. For example, any cell that is a 1 is replaced by 4, any cell that is a 2 is replaced by 4 or 6 based on row + column, and any 0 is replaced by 4 if it is adjacent to a 1, or something like that.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the hypothesis that 1s are replaced by 4, and 2s are replaced based on row + column parity, and other values are left as is. This would handle example 1 and example 2.\n\nBut in example 1, the 0s are being replaced by 4s. For example, in row 3, column 6 (original 1) is replaced by 4, and in row 5, column 6 (original 0) is replaced by 4. So this suggests that the 0s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions. But according to the previous rule, this would not happen. So this suggests that the rule is not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and any 0 is replaced by 4 if it is in certain positions. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and any 0 is replaced by 4 if it is adjacent to a 1 or 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nThe function replaces all 1s with 4s, and replaces 2s with 4 if (row + column) is even, else 6. Other values are left as is.\n\nBut this may not handle all cases, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(10):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            if val == 1:\n                row.append(4)\n            elif val == 2:\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    row.append(4)\n                else:\n                    row.append(6)\n            else:\n                row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the 1 is replaced by 4, and in example 2, the 2s are replaced based on row + column. But in example 1, there are 0s that are replaced by 4s, which this code does not handle. So this code would not handle example 1 correctly.\n\nFor example, in example 1's row 3, column 6 (original 1) is replaced by 4. But in row 5, column 6 (original 0) is replaced by 4. According to the code, this would be 0, so it's not replaced. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nSo this approach is not working. Therefore, I need to think of another pattern.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and any 0 is replaced by 4 if it is in certain positions. But how to determine those positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the 1s are replaced by 4s, and the 0s are replaced by 4s if they are in certain positions. For example, in example 1, the 0s that are replaced by 4 are in positions that are adjacent to 1s. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the 1s are replaced by 4s, and the 0s are replaced by 4s if they are in certain rows or columns.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAnother approach: looking at example 1's output, the 4s are in positions that are part of a pattern. For example, in row 3, column 6 is 4. In row 5, column 7 is 4. In row 6, column 3 is 3, but in the output, it's 3. Wait, no. In example 1's output, row 6 is:\n\n8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBut in the input, it's:\n\n8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo no change. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and any 0 is replaced by 4 if it is in the same row as a 1 or 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 1s with 4s and 2s with 4 or 6 based on row + column, and see if it passes the examples.\n\nBut in example 1, the 0s are being replaced by 4s. So this code would not handle that. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and any 0 is replaced by 4 if it is in the same row or column as a 1 or 2. But this is complex to implement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and any 0 is replaced by 4 if it is in a certain pattern. But without more data, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 1s with 4, and 2s with 4 or 6 based on row + column, and hope that it's the best possible.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let's look at the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are 10x10. The input has some 8s and 0s, and the output changes some of the 0s to other numbers. For instance, in the third row of the input, the third column is 0, and in the output, it's 0, but the seventh column changes from 1 to 4. Wait, looking at the input and output for Example 1:\n\nInput row 3: 8 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\nOutput row 3: 8 8 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\nSo the 7th element (index 6, since it's 0-based) changes from 1 to 4. Similarly, in row 5 of input, the 7th element is 0, and in output it's 4. Hmm, maybe there's some pattern related to the positions of 1s and 0s?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the seventh column in some rows changes from 1 to 4. Maybe the 1s in the input are being replaced by 4s? But in the input, there's a 1 in row 3, column 6 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but in the output, that position becomes 4. Wait, in the input for example 1, the third row is [8,8,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0]. The seventh element (index 6) is 1, and in output it's 4. Similarly, in row 5 of input, the seventh element is 0, but in output it's 4. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me check row 5 of input and output.\n\nInput row 5: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1\nOutput row 5: 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 4\nSo the 8th element (index 7) was 1, now 4, and the 10th (index 9) was 1, now 4. So maybe whenever there's a 1 in the input, it's replaced by 4? But in the input, there's a 1 in row 3, column 6 (original input), and in output that's 4. Also, in row 5, the 7th element (index 7) was 1, now 4. But in the input, there's also a 1 in row 5, column 9 (index 9). So that's changed to 4. So maybe all 1s in the input are turned into 4s?\n\nBut wait, looking at the output of example 1, there's a 4 in the seventh column of row 3, which was originally 1. So that's a 1\u21924. Also, in row 5, the 7th column is 0, but in output it's 4. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the positions. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input for example 1's third row is:\n\nInput row 3: 8 8 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n\nSo the seventh element (index 6) is 1. The output row 3 is:\n\n8 8 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n\nSo that seventh element (index 6) is 4. So that's a 1\u21924. But in row 5 of input, the seventh element (index 6) is 0. The output row 5 is:\n\n8 8 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 4\n\nSo the 7th element (index 6) is 0, but the 8th (index 7) is 4 and the 9th (index 9) is 4. So maybe the 1s are being replaced by 4s, but how does that fit with the 0s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being changed based on their neighbors. For example, in example 1, the 1s are in certain positions and their surrounding cells are being modified. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput has some 8s and 0s, and the output changes some of the 0s to 4, 6, 1, etc. For example, in the third row of input, the fifth element is 2, and in the output, it's 4. Wait, the input for example 2's third row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n\nOutput third row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n\nSo the fifth element (index 4) changes from 2 to 4. Similarly, in the fourth row of input:\n\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 8 8\n\nOutput is:\n\n0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 8 8\n\nSo the second element (index 1) changes from 2 to 4, and the ninth element (index 8) changes from 2 to 6. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced based on their values. For example, in example 2, the 2s are being replaced by 4s and 6s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, in example 1, the 1s are being replaced by 4s. In example 2, the 2s are being replaced by 4s and 6s. But that's not consistent. Maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding 0s or something else.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, in example 1, the 1 in row 3, column 6 is replaced by 4. Then in example 2, the 2 in row 3, column 4 is replaced by 4. Maybe the 1s and 2s are being replaced by 4s, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1 and example 2, perhaps the transformation is replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the 1s are being turned into 4s. In example 2, the 2s are being turned into 4s and 6s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from certain points. For example, in example 1, the 1 is in the middle of some region, and the 4 is placed there. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input. The test input has some 0s, 1s, and 8s. The output is supposed to be a 10x10 grid. But since I don't have the output for the test input, I can't check. But perhaps the pattern is that certain numbers are being replaced based on their positions. For example, in the test input's first row: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8. The output would have some changes. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, in example 1, the 1s are being replaced by 4s. But in example 2, the 2s are being replaced by 4s and 6s. Maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their value and their position. For example, if a cell is a 1, replace with 4. If it's a 2, replace with 4 or 6 based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, if a cell is a 1, then in the output, it's replaced by 4. But in example 1, the 1 in row 3, column 6 is replaced by 4. In example 2, the 2 in row 3, column 4 is replaced by 4. So maybe 1\u21924, 2\u21924 or 6, but why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding cells that are 0. For example, if a cell is 1, and it's surrounded by certain numbers, then it's replaced by 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at example 1's output, the 4s appear in positions where there was a 1 or 0. For example, in row 3, column 6 (originally 1) becomes 4. In row 5, column 7 (originally 0) becomes 4. So maybe the 4s are replacing the 1s and 0s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 0s. For example, in example 1, the 0s in certain positions are being replaced by 4s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 0s in the row or column. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the positions of the 1s and 2s. For example, in example 1, the 1 is replaced by 4, and in example 2, the 2 is replaced by 4. But why?\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the examples. Let's take example 1 and example 2 and see what's changing.\n\nIn example 1, the input has 1s and 0s, and the output changes some of them to 4s. In example 2, the input has 2s and 0s, and the output changes some of them to 4s and 6s. Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are being replaced by other numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is 1, replace with 4. If it's 2, replace with 4 or 6. But how to determine which ones?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, then it's replaced by a certain value. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the 4s are appearing in positions that are adjacent to certain numbers. For example, in row 3, column 6 (originally 1) becomes 4. In row 5, column 7 (originally 0) becomes 4. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers in the input. For example, in example 1, the 1s are in certain positions and are replaced by 4s. In example 2, the 2s are in certain positions and are replaced by 4s and 6s. Maybe the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, but that doesn't explain the 6 in example 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of times a certain value appears in the grid. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, think about the test input. Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest input is a 12x14 grid? Wait, no. Wait, the test input is given as 12 rows, each with 14 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 10x10. Wait, the test input is probably a 10x10 grid. Wait, looking at the test input provided:\n\nThe test input is:\n\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 8 8\n1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 8 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 8 8\n0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 3 1\n8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 7 4\n\nWait, but the problem says that the output must be 10x10. So the test input is 14 columns? But that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The problem says that the test input is shown for context, but the actual input is a 10x10 grid. So perhaps the test input is a 12x14 grid, but that's not relevant. The problem says that the function must take a 2D list (grid) where each row is a list of integers, and return a 10x10 grid. So the test input is probably a 10x10 grid. But the way it's written here is confusing. However, the user provided the test input as a 12x14 grid, which is probably a mistake. But regardless, the function needs to process a 10x10 grid.\n\nBut given the examples, perhaps the transformation is that certain numbers are being replaced by others based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the 1s are replaced by 4s, and in example 2, the 2s are replaced by 4s and 6s. Maybe the pattern is that certain numbers are being replaced by 4s, and other numbers by 6s, depending on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's a 1, it's replaced by 4, if it's a 2, replaced by 4 or 6, and 0s are replaced based on some other rule. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, then it's replaced by a certain value. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother idea: in example 1, the output has 4s in positions that were previously 1s or 0s. Maybe the 4s are replacing the 1s and 0s that are in certain positions. For example, in example 1, the 1 in row 3 is replaced by 4, and the 0 in row 5, column 6 is replaced by 4. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of surrounding 0s. For example, if a cell has a certain number of 0s around it, then it's replaced by 4. But again, without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers in the input. For example, in example 1, the 1 is at (row 3, column 6), and in the output, it's replaced by 4. In example 2, the 2 is at (row 3, column 4) and is replaced by 4. Maybe the transformation is that any cell with a value of 1 or 2 is replaced by 4. But in example 2, there's a 2 that's replaced by 6. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from certain points. For example, in example 1, the 1 is in a position that is near the center, and is replaced by 4. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output of example 1. The 4s are appearing in positions that are adjacent to other numbers. For example, in row 3, column 6 (originally 1) becomes 4. In row 5, column 7 (originally 0) becomes 4. Maybe this is related to the positions of other numbers.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4. But in example 2, there's a 2 that is replaced by 6. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if row + column is even, replace with 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 2's output: in row 3, column 4 (originally 2) is replaced by 4. In row 4, column 1 (originally 2) is replaced by 4, and column 8 (originally 2) is replaced by 6. So maybe the value depends on the position. For example, if the row is even, replace with 4, if odd, replace with 6. But in example 2, row 3 is odd, and the 2 is replaced by 4. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that if a cell is a 1, it's replaced by 4, and if it's a 2, it's replaced by 4 or 6 based on some other condition.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Given that, perhaps the best approach is to assume that the transformation replaces 1s with 4s and 2s with 4s or 6s, and 0s with other values. But how to implement that?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the positions of the 1s and 2s. For example, in example 1, the 1 is replaced by 4, and in example 2, the 2 is replaced by 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output, the 4s are in positions where the original value was 1 or 0, and the 4 is placed in a certain pattern. For example, in example 1's third row, the 4 is in the seventh column. Maybe that's part of a larger pattern, like replacing certain positions with 4s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 is replaced by 4, and any cell that is a 0 is replaced by 4 if it is adjacent to a 1. But again, not sure.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern where certain values are replaced by 4s and 6s based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the 1 is replaced by 4. In example 2, the 2 is replaced by 4 or 6. Maybe the replacement depends on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even, replace with 4; if odd, replace with 6. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell with a value of 1 is replaced by 4, and any cell with a value of 2 is replaced by 4 if it's in an even row, and 6 if it's in an odd row. But how to confirm this?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the number of 0s in the row. For example, if a row has a certain number of 0s, then replace certain cells.\n\nBut given that I need to write a function, perhaps I should make an educated guess based on the examples. For example, in example 1, the 1s are replaced by 4s. In example 2, the 2s are replaced by 4s and 6s. Maybe the transformation is that 1s become 4s, and 2s become 4s or 6s based on some condition. But how to implement this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and other cells are unchanged. But in example 2, there's a 2 that is replaced by 6, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell with value 1 is replaced by 4, and any cell with value 2 is replaced by 4 if it is in the first half of the grid, and 6 if it's in the second half. But without more data, this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, in example 1, the 1 is in row 3, column 6. In the output, it's replaced by 4. In example 2, the 2 is in row 3, column 4, and is replaced by 4. Maybe the transformation is that any cell with value 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and other cells are unchanged. But in example 2, there's a 2 that is replaced by 6, so that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the 1s are replaced by 4s, and the 2s are replaced by 4s or 6s based on their positions. For example, in example 2, the 2 in row 3, column 4 is replaced by 4, and the 2 in row 4, column 1 is replaced by 4, and the 2 in row 4, column 8 is replaced by 6. Maybe the 6 is replaced when the column is even or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, if a cell is a 1, replace with 4. If it's a 2, replace with 4 if the row is even, else 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to write a function that replaces 1s with 4s, and 2s with 4s or 6s based on some condition. However, without more examples, this is difficult.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell with value 1 is replaced by 4, and any cell with value 2 is replaced by 4 if it is in the first half of the grid, or 6 if in the second half. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and other cells are unchanged. But this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the 1s are replaced by 4s, and the 2s are replaced by 4s. But in example 2, there's a 2 that is replaced by 6, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the 1s are replaced by 4s, and the 2s are replaced by 4s if they are in certain positions, and 6s otherwise. But again, without more data, it's hard.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to implement a function that replaces 1s with 4s and 2s with 4s. This would handle the first example and part of the second. But in example 2, there's a 2 replaced by 6, which this would not handle. However, given the examples, maybe the correct pattern is that 1s become 4s and 2s become 4s. But why in example 2, some 2s become 6s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the 1s are replaced by 4s, and the 2s are replaced by 4s or 6s based on their positions. For example, in example 2, the 2s are replaced by 4s if they are in even columns, and 6s if in odd columns. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the number of 0s in the row. For example, if a row has more 0s, replace certain cells.\n\nBut given that I have to write a function, I'll proceed with the assumption that the transformation is replacing 1s with 4s and 2s with 4s. This would handle example 1 and part of example 2. However, in example 2, there's a 2 that is replaced by 6. So this might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell with value 1 is replaced by 4, and any cell with value 2 is replaced by 4 if it is in the first half of the grid, or 6 if in the second half. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the 1s are replaced by 4s, and the 2s are replaced by 4s or 6s based on the sum of their row and column indices. For example, if row + column is even, replace with 4, else 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4. This would handle example 1, but not example 2. But given that example 2 has a 2 replaced by 6, this might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the 1s are replaced by 4s, and the 2s are replaced by 4s if they are in certain positions, and 6s otherwise. But without more data, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that 1s are replaced by 4s, and 2s are replaced by 4s. This is the most straightforward pattern that fits example 1 and some of example 2. However, this may not be correct, but it's the best I can do with the given information.\n\nSo, the function would iterate through each cell, and if the value is 1, replace with 4. If the value is 2, replace with 4. For other values, leave as is. But this may not be correct for example 2, but it's a starting point.\n\nBut in example 2, the output for the third row has a 4 in the fifth column (originally 2), and the fourth row has 4 in column 1 (originally 2), and 6 in column 8 (originally 2). So this suggests that the 2s are being replaced by 4 or 6. So perhaps the replacement depends on the position. For example, if the row is even, replace with 4, else 6. Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the position of the cell. For example, if the row is even, replace 2 with 4; if odd, replace with 6. Let's see:\n\nIn example 2, the third row is row index 2 (assuming 0-based). So it's odd. In that row, the 2 is replaced by 4. So this doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the column is even or odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on the column. For example, if the column is even, replace 2 with 4, else 6. In example 2's third row, the 2 is at column 4 (0-based index 4), which is even. So replaced by 4. In the fourth row, the 2 is at column 1 (odd), replaced by 4. Hmm, that doesn't fit. The fourth row's column 8 is even, replaced by 6. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the row and column indices. For example, if row + column is even, replace with 4, else 6. In example 2, the third row (row 2, 0-based), column 4: 2+4=6 even \u2192 4. That fits. The fourth row (row 3), column 1: 3+1=4 even \u2192 4. But in example 2, the fourth row's column 8 is replaced by 6. row 3 + column 8 = 11, which is odd \u2192 6. That fits. So this seems to work for example 2.\n\nSo the pattern could be that for 2s, replace with 4 if row + column is even, else 6. For 1s, replace with 4. For other values, leave as is.\n\nBut how to verify this with example 1?\n\nIn example 1, the 1 is in row 2 (0-based), column 5 (assuming the input is 10x10). Let's see: row 2 (third row), column 5 (index 5). row + column is 2 + 5 = 7, which is odd. But in example 1, the 1 is replaced by 4. So this would not fit. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are replaced by 4 regardless of their position, and the 2s are replaced based on row + column.\n\nSo the transformation would be:\n\nFor each cell:\n\nif value is 1 \u2192 4\n\nelif value is 2 \u2192 if (row + column) is even \u2192 4, else 6\n\nelse \u2192 leave as is.\n\nBut in example 1, the 1 is replaced by 4, which fits. In example 2, the 2s are replaced based on row + column.\n\nLet's check example 2's third row (row index 2), column 4 (index 4): row + column = 2 + 4 = 6 even \u2192 4. Which matches. The fourth row (row index 3), column 1: 3 + 1 = 4 even \u2192 4. Which matches. The fourth row, column 8: 3 + 8 = 11 odd \u2192 6. Which matches.\n\nSo this seems to work for example 2. For example 1, the 1 is in row 2, column 5: 2 + 5 = 7 odd. But the 1 is replaced by 4. So this doesn't fit. So this suggests that the 1s are replaced by 4 regardless of their position.\n\nSo the overall pattern could be:\n\n- Replace all 1s with 4.\n\n- Replace 2s with 4 if (row + column) is even, else 6.\n\n- For other values, leave as is.\n\nBut how to handle other values. For example, in example 1, the 0s are replaced by 4s in certain positions. But according to this rule, they would remain as 0s. But in example 1, some 0s are replaced by 4s. So this suggests that this rule is not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is more complex. For example, any cell that is a 1 is replaced by 4, any cell that is a 2 is replaced by 4 or 6 based on row + column, and any 0 is replaced by 4 if it is adjacent to a 1, or something like that.\n\nBut given the time, perhaps the best approach is to proceed with the hypothesis that 1s are replaced by 4, and 2s are replaced based on row + column parity, and other values are left as is. This would handle example 1 and example 2.\n\nBut in example 1, the 0s are being replaced by 4s. For example, in row 3, column 6 (original 1) is replaced by 4, and in row 5, column 6 (original 0) is replaced by 4. So this suggests that the 0s are being replaced by 4s in certain positions. But according to the previous rule, this would not happen. So this suggests that the rule is not sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and any 0 is replaced by 4 if it is in certain positions. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and any 0 is replaced by 4 if it is adjacent to a 1 or 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nThe function replaces all 1s with 4s, and replaces 2s with 4 if (row + column) is even, else 6. Other values are left as is.\n\nBut this may not handle all cases, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        row = []\n        for j in range(10):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            if val == 1:\n                row.append(4)\n            elif val == 2:\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    row.append(4)\n                else:\n                    row.append(6)\n            else:\n                row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the 1 is replaced by 4, and in example 2, the 2s are replaced based on row + column. But in example 1, there are 0s that are replaced by 4s, which this code does not handle. So this code would not handle example 1 correctly.\n\nFor example, in example 1's row 3, column 6 (original 1) is replaced by 4. But in row 5, column 6 (original 0) is replaced by 4. According to the code, this would be 0, so it's not replaced. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nSo this approach is not working. Therefore, I need to think of another pattern.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and any 0 is replaced by 4 if it is in certain positions. But how to determine those positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the 1s are replaced by 4s, and the 0s are replaced by 4s if they are in certain positions. For example, in example 1, the 0s that are replaced by 4 are in positions that are adjacent to 1s. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the 1s are replaced by 4s, and the 0s are replaced by 4s if they are in certain rows or columns.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAnother approach: looking at example 1's output, the 4s are in positions that are part of a pattern. For example, in row 3, column 6 is 4. In row 5, column 7 is 4. In row 6, column 3 is 3, but in the output, it's 3. Wait, no. In example 1's output, row 6 is:\n\n8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBut in the input, it's:\n\n8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo no change. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and any 0 is replaced by 4 if it is in the same row as a 1 or 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 1s with 4s and 2s with 4 or 6 based on row + column, and see if it passes the examples.\n\nBut in example 1, the 0s are being replaced by 4s. So this code would not handle that. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and any 0 is replaced by 4 if it is in the same row or column as a 1 or 2. But this is complex to implement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell that is a 1 or 2 is replaced by 4, and any 0 is replaced by 4 if it is in a certain pattern. But without more data, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 1s with 4, and 2s with 4 or 6 based on row + column, and hope that it's the best possible.\n"
