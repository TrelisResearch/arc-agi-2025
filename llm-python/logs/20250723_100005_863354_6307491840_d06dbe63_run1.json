          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid always has a 13x13 size\n2. The input grid has a single 8 in Example 1 and a single 8 in Example 2\n3. The output grids have 5s and 8s in specific patterns\n4. The 8 in the input seems to be the center of a pattern that expands outward\n5. The 5s form a sort of \"spiral\" or \"wave\" pattern around the 8\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Identifying the position of the 8 in the input\n- Creating a spiral or wave pattern of 5s around the 8\n- Keeping all other positions as 0\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 13x13 grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    \n    # Find the position of the 8 in the input grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                #

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the transformation seems to involve:\n1. Identifying certain positions (like the 8 in Example 1) and expanding them into patterns of 5s\n2. The pattern of 5s seems to form a diamond or cross shape around the original value\n3. The transformation appears to be a kind of \"spread\" or \"influence\" pattern\n\nBased on this, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Identifies cells with value 8\n- For each such cell, spreads 5s in a diamond pattern around it\n- Ensures the output is always 13x13\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Spread 5s in a diamond pattern around the 8\n                for dx in range(-2, 3):\n                    for dy in range(-2, 3):\n                        if abs(dx) + abs(dy) <= 2:\n                            ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                            if 0 <= ni < 13 and 0 <= nj < 13:\n                                transformed[ni][nj] = 5\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Spread 5s in a diamond pattern around the 8\n                for dx in range(-2, 3):\n                    for dy in range(-2, 3):\n                        if abs(dx) + abs(dy) <= 2:\n                            ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                            if 0 <= ni < 13 and 0 <= nj < 13:\n                                transformed[ni][nj] = 5\n    \n    return transformed\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid always has a 13x13 size\n2. The input grid has a single 8 in Example 1 and a single 8 in Example 2\n3. The output grids have 5s and 8s in specific patterns\n4. The 8 in the input seems to be the center of a pattern that expands outward\n5. The 5s form a sort of \"spiral\" or \"wave\" pattern around the 8\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Identifying the position of the 8 in the input\n- Creating a spiral or wave pattern of 5s around the 8\n- Keeping all other positions as 0\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
