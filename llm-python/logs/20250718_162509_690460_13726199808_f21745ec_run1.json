          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve:\n   - Preserving the outermost 0s (the borders)\n   - Transforming inner regions with specific patterns\n   - Changing values in specific regions based on their position and value\n\n2. I notice that:\n   - The middle region (around row 5-14 and column 5-14) seems to be transformed in a specific way\n   - Values like 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 appear to be transformed based on their position\n   - There seems to be a pattern of spreading or expanding certain values\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Preserves the outermost 0s\n- Transforms the middle region based on specific rules\n- Applies transformations to specific values based on their position\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the region to transform (middle 9x9 area)\n    for i in range(5, 14):\n        for j in range(5, 14):\n            #

The transformation seems to involve preserving certain regions (like the top and bottom rows) while modifying the middle regions.\n2. There are patterns of \"blocks\" or \"regions\" that seem to be transformed in specific ways:\n   - The middle section (rows 3-7) appears to have patterns that are modified in a way that creates new shapes or connects existing ones.\n   - Certain numbers (like 8, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1) seem to be transformed in specific ways, often involving connecting or spreading out.\n   - The transformation appears to be more about pattern transformation than simple value replacement.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Preserving the top and bottom rows as they are.\n- Modifying the middle rows in a way that connects or spreads out certain numbers.\n- Creating new patterns by connecting or spreading out certain numbers.\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
