          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 27x27. Looking at the first few rows of the input and output:\n\nInput first row: 5 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\nOutput first row: 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\n\nHmm, so the output seems to have the same numbers as the input, but some of the zeros are replaced with the same numbers. Wait, looking at the input's first row, there are zeros in positions 3-8 (indices 3 to 8?), but in the output, those positions are filled with 5,1,3,5,1,3. Wait, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being filled based on some rule.\n\nLooking at the input's first row, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then there are zeros. In the output, those zeros are replaced with 5,1,3,5,1,3. So maybe the pattern is that the output is a repetition of the first three elements in the input row, but extended? Or maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are copied from other parts of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first three elements of each row and repeating them in a certain way. Let me check another row. For example, the second input row is 1 5 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 3 1 1 5 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 1 5 3. The output second row is 1 5 3 1 1 5 3 1 1 5 3 1 1 5 3 1 1 5 3 1 1 5 3 1 1 5 3. So the first three elements are 1,5,3. Then the next elements are 1,1,5,3,1,1,5,3... which seems like the same pattern as the first three elements repeated. Wait, maybe the output is generated by taking the first three elements of the input row and then repeating them in a certain way. For example, the first three elements are 1,5,3. Then in the output, the next elements are 1,1,5,3,1,1,5,3... which seems like the first three elements are followed by their own repetition. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the first three elements of each row and then repeating them in a pattern. For example, the first three elements of the input row are 5,1,3. Then the output row starts with 5,1,3, and then the next three elements are 5,1,3 again? But looking at the output first row, after the initial 5,1,3, the next elements are 5,1,3,5,1,3... which seems like the first three elements are repeated every three positions. But the input's first row has zeros in positions 3-8. So maybe the output is replacing the zeros with the same pattern as the first three elements, but extended.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the input's first row, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the next elements are zeros. In the output, those zeros are replaced with 5,1,3,5,1,3, etc. So the output is taking the first three elements of the row and then repeating them in a way that fills the rest of the row. But how?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output grid is generated by taking the first three elements of each row and then repeating them in a certain pattern. For example, the first three elements are 5,1,3, then the next three elements are 5,1,3 again, then 5,1,3 again. But in the output, the first row is 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3. Wait, that's 27 elements. Let me count the number of elements. The first row of output has 27 elements. The first three are 5,1,3. Then the next three are 5,1,3, then 5,1,5,1,3, etc. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain positions filled in based on some rule.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input's first row is 3 7 4 1 3 7 4 1 3 7 4 1 3 7 4 1 3 7 4 1 3 7 4 1 3 7 4. The output is the same as the input. Wait, but in Example 2, the output is the same as the input? Wait no, looking at the output for Example 2, the first row is the same as the input. But in Example 1, the output is different. So maybe there are different patterns for different examples. But that's confusing. Wait, perhaps the output is the same as the input in some cases, but different in others. So maybe the pattern is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain elements based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output is the same as the input, but with some zeros replaced by the same numbers. Wait, but in the first row of Example 1, the input has zeros, and the output replaces them with the same numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the third example. The input's first row is 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7. The output is the same as the input. But in the input, there are some rows where the output is different. For example, in the third example, the input's 9th row is 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 0 0 0 0 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7. The output for that row is 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7. So the zeros in positions 7-10 are replaced with 1,3,1,7. Which seems to be the same as the first three elements of the row. Wait, the first three elements are 3,1,7. Then the next elements are 5,7,5,3, etc. But in the input, the row has 0s in positions 7-10. In the output, those are replaced with 1,3,1,7. Which is the same as the first three elements of the row. So maybe the pattern is that in the output, any zero in the input is replaced with the value from the first three elements of the row. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by replacing zeros with the same value as the first three elements of the row. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the zeros in the input are replaced with 5,1,3,5,1,3, etc. So the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but with zeros replaced by the first three elements of the row, repeated as needed. But how?\n\nLooking at the first row of Example 1's input:\n\nInput: 5 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\n\nThe output is 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\n\nSo the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the next three elements (positions 3-5) are 5,1,3. Then positions 6-8 are 5,1,5. Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first three elements of the row and then repeating them every three positions. For example, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the next three elements are 5,1,3 again. Then the next three are 5,1,3 again. But the output for the first row has 27 elements. Let's see:\n\nThe output row is 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3.\n\nWait, that's 27 elements. Let's split them into groups of three:\n\nGroup 1: 5 1 3\n\nGroup 2: 5 1 3\n\nGroup 3: 5 1 5 ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the first three elements of the row and then repeating them in a certain pattern. For example, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the next three elements are 5,1,3 again. Then the next three are 5,1,3 again. But that would make the first row have 9 elements, but the actual output is 27. So maybe the first three elements are repeated 9 times. But that's not possible because 3*9=27. But the first row of output is 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3. That's 27 elements. Let me count the number of 5,1,3 sequences.\n\nLooking at the first row of output:\n\nThe first three elements are 5,1,3.\n\nThen next three: 5,1,3.\n\nThen next three: 5,1,5?\n\nNo, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are repeated, but the fourth element is the same as the first. Wait, perhaps the output is generated by taking the first three elements and then repeating them in a way that the entire row is filled with the same three elements, but with some variations. Alternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the original input and some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first three elements of each row and then repeating them in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the first row of output is the same as the input's first row, but with the zeros replaced by the same pattern. So for example, in the input's first row, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the next elements are zeros. The output replaces those zeros with 5,1,3,5,1,3, etc. So the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but any zero in the input is replaced by the first three elements of the row, repeated every three positions. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for symmetry or patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the first three elements are repeated. For example, the first row of output is 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3. It seems that the first three elements are 5,1,3, and then the next three are 5,1,3 again. Then the next three are 5,1,5. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are repeated, but the fourth element is the same as the first, the fifth as the second, etc. So for example, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the fourth element is 5, fifth is 1, sixth is 3, seventh is 5, eighth is 1, ninth is 3, and so on. That would generate the first row of output as 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3. But that's 27 elements. However, in the actual output, the first row is different. For example, the 7th element is 5, 8th is 1, 9th is 5, which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing zeros with the value of the first three elements of the row, but in a way that the entire row is filled with the same three elements. For example, if the first three elements are 5,1,3, then the entire row is 5,1,3 repeated 9 times. But that would make the first row of output as 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3. Which is 27 elements. However, in the actual output for Example 1, the first row is different. Let me check again. The output first row is:\n\n5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\n\nSo the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then next three are 5,1,3. Then next three are 5,1,5. Then next three are 1,3,5, etc. That seems inconsistent. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input's first row is 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7. The output is the same as the input. So in this case, the output is the same as the input. But in other examples, the output is different. So maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, except for certain rows where the zeros are replaced with values from the first three elements of the row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the first three elements of each row and then repeating them in a certain pattern. For example, if the first three elements are a, b, c, then the output row is a, b, c, a, b, c, a, b, c, ... etc. But that would make the row have 27 elements. For example, if the first three elements are 5,1,3, then the row would be 5,1,3 repeated 9 times. But in the first row of Example 1's output, that's not the case. The first row of output is 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3. Which is not exactly that. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first three elements of the row and then replacing the zeros with the same three elements. For example, in Example 1's first row, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the zeros are replaced with 5,1,3,5,1,3, etc. But how to determine the pattern for replacement?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is the same as the input, but for certain rows, the zeros are replaced with the same values as the first three elements of the row. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the first three elements are 5,1,3. The zeros are in positions 3-8 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but in the output, those zeros are replaced with 5,1,3,5,1,3. So the pattern is that the zeros are replaced with the first three elements of the row, repeated as needed.\n\nSo the transformation rule could be: for each row in the input grid, if the value is zero, replace it with the value of the first three elements of the row, repeated in a way that fills the zero positions. But how to determine which value to use?\n\nAlternatively, for each cell in the grid, if it's zero, replace it with the value of the cell at (row, col % 3). For example, for the first row, the first three elements are 5,1,3. For positions 3,4,5,6,7,8, etc., which are 3rd, 4th, etc. columns, the value would be determined by the first three elements. For example, position 3 (0-based) is column 3, which is 3 mod 3 = 0, so take the first element (5). Position 4 is 4 mod 3 = 1, take the second element (1). Position 5 is 5 mod 3 = 2, take third element (3). Position 6 is 0, so 5 again. So that would generate 5,1,3,5,1,3, etc. Which matches the first row of the output for Example 1.\n\nLet me check that. For the first row of Example 1's input, the first three elements are 5,1,3. The zeros are in positions 3-8 (assuming 0-based, columns 3 to 8). Let's say the input row is:\n\nIndices 0-2: 5,1,3\n\nIndices 3-8: 0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nThen for each zero, the value would be determined by (col % 3). For column 3: 3%3=0 \u2192 5. Column 4: 4%3=1 \u2192 1. Column 5: 5%3=2 \u21923. Column 6: 6%3=0 \u21925. Column 7: 7%3=1 \u21921. Column 8: 8%3=2 \u21923. So the zeros would be replaced with 5,1,3,5,1,3. So the first row of the output would be:\n\n5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3, ... which matches the output of Example 1's first row. That seems to fit.\n\nNow, let's check another example. For Example 3's input, the first row is 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7. The output is the same as the input. So in this case, there are no zeros, so the transformation doesn't change anything. That makes sense.\n\nLooking at the third example's input, there are some rows with zeros. For example, the 9th row of Example 3's input is:\n\n3 1 7 5 7 5 3 0 0 0 0 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7\n\nThe first three elements are 3,1,7. The zeros are in columns 7-10. For each of these, the replacement would be:\n\ncolumn 7: 7%3=1 \u21921\n\ncolumn 8: 8%3=2 \u21927\n\ncolumn 9: 9%3=0 \u21923\n\ncolumn 10: 10%3=1 \u21921\n\nSo the zeros would be replaced with 1,7,3,1. But in the output, the row is:\n\n3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7\n\nSo the zeros in positions 7-10 (columns 7-10) are replaced with 1,3,1,7. Wait, that doesn't match the previous calculation. Wait, the first three elements are 3,1,7. For column 7 (index 7), 7 mod 3 is 1 (since 3*2=6, 7-6=1). So the value should be the second element, which is 1. Column 8: 8 mod 3 is 2 \u2192 third element, 7. Column 9: 9 mod 3 is 0 \u2192 first element, 3. Column 10: 10 mod 3 is 1 \u2192 second element, 1. So the zeros would be replaced with 1,7,3,1. But in the output, those positions are 1,3,1,7. That doesn't match. So maybe the pattern is not column mod 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the row's first three elements, and the position is determined by the column's position modulo 3. But in this case, the output for the 9th row of Example 3's input has the zeros replaced with 1,3,1,7. Let me check the output row:\n\nThe output row is:\n\n3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7\n\nLooking at columns 7-10 (assuming 0-based):\n\ncolumn 7: 1\n\ncolumn 8: 3\n\ncolumn 9: 1\n\ncolumn 10:7\n\nSo the values are 1,3,1,7. Which is different from the previous calculation. So maybe the pattern is not column mod 3. Or perhaps it's row-based.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the first three elements are a, b, c. Then, for any column in the row, if the value is zero, it's replaced with a, b, c, a, b, c, etc. So for the first three elements, the pattern is a, b, c, then a, b, c again. So for the first row of Example 1, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the next three elements are 5,1,3 again. So the row is 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3. Which is 27 elements. But in the actual output, the first row is different. So this seems to not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but with zeros replaced by the value of the cell at (row, col % 3). For example, for the first row of Example 3's input, the first three elements are 3,1,7. The zero in column 7 (0-based) is replaced by the value at (row, 7%3=1) which is 1. Column 8 is 8%3=2 \u21927. Column 9 is 9%3=0 \u21923. Column 10 is 10%3=1 \u21921. So the zeros would be replaced with 1,7,3,1. But in the output, the zeros are replaced with 1,3,1,7. Which is different. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on the row's first three elements and the column's position. For example, for each column, the value is determined by (col + 1) % 3. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the third example's input and output, the row with zeros is:\n\nInput row: 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 0 0 0 0 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7\n\nOutput row: 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7\n\nSo the zeros in columns 7-10 are replaced with 1,3,1,7. Let's see the first three elements are 3,1,7. The replaced values are 1,3,1,7. Which is the same as the first three elements of the row, but shifted. For example, 1 is the second element, 3 is the third, 1 is the second, 7 is the third. So maybe the pattern is that the replacement is based on the first three elements, but for each zero, it's the value at (col % 3) + 1? Or perhaps the pattern is that the replacement is the first three elements of the row, but the replacement for column i is the (i % 3)th element of the first three.\n\nBut in the case of the third example's row, the first three elements are 3,1,7. The columns 7-10 are replaced with 1,3,1,7. Let's see:\n\nFor column 7, which is the 7th column (0-based index 7). 7 mod 3 is 1. The first three elements are [3,1,7]. So the 1st element is 1. That matches the first replaced value (1). For column 8, 8 mod 3 is 2 \u2192 third element is 7. But in the output, the value is 3. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the row's first three elements, but the replacement is the same as the first three elements of the row, but shifted. For example, the first three elements are a, b, c. Then, the replacement for each zero is a, b, c, a, b, c, etc. So for the third example's row, the first three elements are 3,1,7. The replacement would be 3,1,7,3,1,7... but in the output, the zeros are replaced with 1,3,1,7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the third example's input and output. The output is the same as the input in some cases, but in others, the zeros are replaced with values from the first three elements. For example, in the third example's input, the 9th row has zeros in positions 7-10. The output replaces them with 1,3,1,7. Which is the same as the first three elements of the row, but in a different order. Wait, the first three elements are 3,1,7. The replaced values are 1,3,1,7. So it's like the second element, third, second, third. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for any zero in the input, it's replaced with the value of the cell at (row, col - 3). For example, in the third example's row, column 7 is replaced with the value at column 4 (7-3=4). The value at column 4 is 7. But in the output, the replaced value is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for any zero in the input, it's replaced with the value of the cell at (row, col % 3). For example, in the third example's row, the first three elements are 3,1,7. For column 7 (index 7), 7 % 3 = 1 \u2192 value is 1. For column 8, 8%3=2 \u21927. For column 9, 9%3=0 \u21923. For column 10, 10%3=1 \u21921. So the replaced values would be 1,7,3,1. But in the output, the replaced values are 1,3,1,7. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for certain rows, the zeros are replaced with the same values as the first three elements of the row, but in a different pattern. For example, in the third example's row, the replaced values are 1,3,1,7. Which is the second element, third element, second element, third element. So maybe it's alternating between the second and third elements. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for any zero in the input, it's replaced with the value of the first three elements of the row, in a way that the first three elements are repeated every three columns. For example, if the first three elements are a, b, c, then the output is a, b, c, a, b, c, a, b, c, etc. So for the first row of Example 1, the output would be 5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3. Which is 27 elements. But the actual output of Example 1's first row is different. Wait, but in the output for Example 1's first row, the first three elements are 5,1,3, then the next three are 5,1,3, then the next three are 5,1,5, which doesn't fit this pattern. So this suggests that the pattern is not this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for any zero, it's replaced with the value of the first three elements of the row, but in a way that the replacement is based on the column's position modulo 3. But in the third example's row, this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of another approach. Let's look at the test input and see what the output should be. But the user says not to predict the test output, just to write the transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but with zeros replaced by the value of the first three elements of the row. For example, if the first three elements are a, b, c, then any zero in the row is replaced with a, b, c, a, b, c, etc. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for any cell that is zero, it is replaced with the value of the cell at (row, col % 3). For example, in the first row of Example 1, the first three elements are 5,1,3. So for column 3 (0-based), 3 % 3 = 0 \u21925. Column 4: 4%3=1 \u21921. Column 5: 5%3=2 \u21923. Column 6: 6%3=0 \u21925. Column 7: 7%3=1 \u21921. Column 8: 8%3=2 \u21923. So the zeros would be replaced with 5,1,3,5,1,3. Which matches the output of Example 1's first row.\n\nIn the third example's row with zeros, the first three elements are 3,1,7. So for column 7 (index 7), 7%3=1 \u21921. Column 8: 8%3=2 \u21927. Column 9: 9%3=0 \u21923. Column 10: 10%3=1 \u21921. So the replaced values would be 1,7,3,1. But in the output, the replaced values are 1,3,1,7. So this doesn't match. But maybe I made a mistake in analyzing the third example's output.\n\nWait, let me check the third example's input and output again. The third example's input has a row:\n\nInput row: 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 0 0 0 0 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7\n\nOutput row: 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7\n\nSo the zeros are in columns 7-10 (indices 7,8,9,10). The output for these columns is 1,3,1,7.\n\nLet's see what the first three elements are: 3,1,7.\n\nFor column 7: 7%3 = 1 \u2192 value is 1. That matches the output (1).\n\nColumn 8: 8%3 = 2 \u2192 value is 7. But in the output, it's 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is different. What if the replacement is based on the first three elements of the row, but the replacement for each zero is the value of the first three elements in the row, but shifted by one. For example, the first three elements are a, b, c. Then, the replacement for column i is b, c, a, b, c, a, etc. But that's just a guess.\n\nIn the third example's row, the first three elements are 3,1,7. So the replacement pattern could be 1,7,3,1,7,3,... for the zeros. Let's see:\n\nFor column 7 (index 7), 7%3=1 \u2192 1 (second element). Column 8: 8%3=2 \u21927 (third element). Column 9: 9%3=0 \u21923 (first element). Column 10: 10%3=1 \u21921 (second element). So the replaced values would be 1,7,3,1. But in the output, the replaced values are 1,3,1,7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the first three elements, but the replacement is the first element, then the second, then the third, then the first, etc. So for the third example's row, the first three elements are 3,1,7. The replacement pattern would be 3,1,7,3,1,7, etc. But in the output, the replaced values are 1,3,1,7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the third example's input and output. The input row has zeros in positions 7-10. The output replaces them with 1,3,1,7. Let's see the first three elements are 3,1,7. The replaced values are 1,3,1,7. So it's like the second element, third element, second element, third element. So the pattern is: for each zero, the value is the second element, third element, second element, third element, etc. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for any zero, it is replaced with the value of the first three elements of the row, but in a way that the first three elements are repeated in a certain order. For example, if the first three elements are a, b, c, then the replacement is a, b, c, a, b, c, etc. But this doesn't fit the third example's case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for any zero, it is replaced with the value of the cell at (row, col - 3). For example, in the third example's row, column 7 is replaced with the value at column 4 (7-3=4). The value at column 4 is 7. But in the output, it's 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the correct approach is to look for the pattern that works for Example 1 and Example 3.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row's zeros are replaced with the first three elements of the row, repeated every three columns. So for column 3, it's 5 (first element), column 4 is 1 (second), column 5 is 3 (third), column 6 is 5 (first), etc. This seems to fit.\n\nIn the third example's row, the replaced values are 1,3,1,7. Which is the second, third, second, third elements of the first three elements. So maybe the pattern is that the replacement is based on the column's position modulo 3, but with a shift. For example, if the first three elements are a, b, c, then the replacement for column i is the value at (i % 3 + 1)th element. Or maybe it's based on the column's position modulo 3, but with a different offset.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the replacement is based on the column's position modulo 3, but the first three elements are a, b, c, and the replacement for column i is the value at (i % 3)th element of the first three elements. But this would work for Example 1 but not for the third example.\n\nBut in the third example's row, the first three elements are 3,1,7. For column 7 (i=7), 7%3=1 \u2192 value is 1 (second element). For column 8, 8%3=2 \u2192 value is 7 (third element). For column 9, 9%3=0 \u2192 value is 3 (first element). For column 10, 10%3=1 \u2192 value is 1 (second element). So the replaced values would be 1,7,3,1. But in the output, it's 1,3,1,7. So this doesn't match. So perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the replacement is based on the first three elements of the row, but the replacement is the same as the first three elements of the row, repeated in a way that the entire row is filled with the first three elements. For example, if the first three elements are a, b, c, then the entire row is a, b, c, a, b, c, a, b, c, ... etc. This would work for Example 1's first row, but not for the third example's row. But in the third example's row, the output is the same as the input, so there are no zeros. So this pattern might work for some cases.\n\nBut how to explain the third example's row? It seems that in some cases, the output is the same as the input, and in others, the zeros are replaced based on the first three elements. So perhaps the general rule is: for each cell in the grid, if it is zero, replace it with the value of the first three elements of the row, repeated every three columns.\n\nSo the transformation would be: for each row in the input grid, if the value at (row, col) is zero, replace it with the value of the first three elements of the row, at position (col % 3). \n\nLet me try this with the third example's row. The first three elements are 3,1,7. For column 7, 7%3=1 \u21921. Column 8: 8%3=2 \u21927. Column 9: 9%3=0 \u21923. Column 10: 10%3=1 \u21921. So the replaced values would be 1,7,3,1. But in the output, the replaced values are 1,3,1,7. So this doesn't match. But maybe the third example's output is a special case, or I'm misunderstanding the input.\n\nWait, let me check the third example's input again. The input row is:\n\n3 1 7 5 7 5 3 0 0 0 0 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7\n\nSo the first three elements are 3,1,7. The zeros are in columns 7-10 (indices 7,8,9,10). The output for these columns is 1,3,1,7. So the values are 1,3,1,7. Let's see what the first three elements are. If the first three elements are 3,1,7, then the replacement for column 7 is 1 (second element), column 8 is 3 (first element?), but that doesn't fit. Or maybe the replacement is based on (col + 1) % 3. For example, for column 7, (7+1) %3 = 8%3=2 \u2192 third element (7). But the output is 1.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should proceed with the pattern that works for Example 1 and see if it can be generalized.\n\nSo the transformation rule would be: for each row, if the value is zero, replace it with the value of the first three elements of the row at position (col % 3). \n\nLet's implement this in code. For each row in the input grid, we take the first three elements. For each column in the row, if the value is zero, replace it with the value of the first three elements at (col % 3). \n\nLet me test this with the third example's row. The first three elements are 3,1,7. The zeros are in columns 7-10. For column 7, 7%3=1 \u2192 value is 1. Column 8: 8%3=2 \u21927. Column 9: 9%3=0 \u21923. Column 10: 10%3=1 \u21921. So the replaced values are 1,7,3,1. But in the output, the replaced values are 1,3,1,7. So this doesn't match. But maybe the third example's output is not following this pattern, or I'm misunderstanding the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are a, b, c, and the replacement is based on (col + 1) % 3. For example, for column 7, (7 + 1) %3 = 8%3=2 \u2192 c. So for the third example's row, the replaced values would be 7,3,7,3. But that doesn't match the output.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to proceed with the pattern that works for Example 1, and see if it can be generalized. Even if it doesn't fit all cases, it's better than nothing.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n- Take the first three elements of the row as a, b, c.\n\n- For each column in the row:\n\n   - If the value is zero, replace it with a, b, c, a, b, c, ... based on (col % 3).\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # get the first three elements\n        a, b, c = row[0], row[1], row[2]\n        new_row = []\n        for col in range(27):\n            if row[col] == 0:\n                # replace with a, b, c, a, b, c, ...\n                mod = col % 3\n                new_row.append([a, b, c][mod])\n            else:\n                new_row.append(row[col])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in Example 1's first row, the first three elements are 5,1,3. For col 3, mod is 0 \u21925. So the replaced value is 5. Which matches the output. For col 4, mod is 1 \u21921. For col 5, mod is 2 \u21923. For col 6, mod is 0 \u21925, etc. So this would generate the first row of the output as 5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3. But the actual output for the first row is different. Wait, the output for the first row of Example 1 is:\n\n5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\n\nSo the 7th element (index 7) is 5, 8th is 1, 9th is 5, 10th is 1, etc. So this suggests that the pattern is not exactly col % 3.\n\nBut according to the code above, for col 7 (index 7), mod is 7%3=1 \u21921. But in the output, it's 5. So this suggests that the code is not correct. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me recheck.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, the input is:\n\n5 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\n\nThe output is:\n\n5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\n\nSo for the first row, the first three elements are 5,1,3. The zeros are from column 3 to 8 (indices 3-8). Let's see what the code would generate for these positions.\n\nFor col 3: 3%3=0 \u21925\n\ncol 4: 4%3=1 \u21921\n\ncol 5: 5%3=2 \u21923\n\ncol 6: 6%3=0 \u21925\n\ncol 7: 7%3=1 \u21921\n\ncol 8: 8%3=2 \u21923\n\nSo the replaced values for these columns would be 5,1,3,5,1,3. So the first row would be:\n\n5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3.\n\nBut the actual output is different. The actual output for the first row is:\n\n5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\n\nSo the 9th element (index 8) is 5, but according to the code, it would be 3. So this suggests that the pattern is not correct.\n\nThis indicates that the initial hypothesis is wrong. So what's the correct pattern?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the first three elements are a, b, c, and for each column, if it's zero, it's replaced with the value of the first three elements at (col - 3) % 3. Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are a, b, c, and the replacement for each zero is the value of the first three elements at (col - 3) % 3. For example, in the first row, for col 3, it's 3-3=0 \u21920%3=0 \u2192a. For col 4, 4-3=1 \u21921%3=1 \u2192b. For col 5, 5-3=2 \u21922%3=2 \u2192c. For col 6, 6-3=3 \u21923%3=0 \u2192a. For col 7, 7-3=4 \u21924%3=1 \u2192b. For col 8, 8-3=5 \u21925%3=2 \u2192c. So the replaced values would be a, b, c, a, b, c. Which matches the first row of the output. But in the actual output, the first row is different. Wait, but according to this, the replaced values would be 5,1,3,5,1,3. So the first row would be 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3. But the actual output is 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3. So the 9th element (index 8) is 5 instead of 3. This suggests that the pattern is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find the exact pattern. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that the pattern is to replace zeros with the first three elements of the row, based on column % 3, even though it doesn't fit all cases. Maybe there's a mistake in the analysis of the third example.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # get the first three elements\n        a, b, c = row[0], row[1], row[2]\n        new_row = []\n        for col in range(27):\n            if row[col] == 0:\n                mod = col % 3\n                new_row.append([a, b, c][mod])\n            else:\n                new_row.append(row[col])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not work for all cases. However, it's the best I can do based on the examples provided.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 27x27. Looking at the first few rows of the input and output:\n\nInput first row: 5 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\nOutput first row: 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\n\nHmm, so the output seems to have the same numbers as the input, but some of the zeros are replaced with the same numbers. Wait, looking at the input's first row, there are zeros in positions 3-8 (indices 3 to 8?), but in the output, those positions are filled with 5,1,3,5,1,3. Wait, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are being filled based on some rule.\n\nLooking at the input's first row, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then there are zeros. In the output, those zeros are replaced with 5,1,3,5,1,3. So maybe the pattern is that the output is a repetition of the first three elements in the input row, but extended? Or maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are copied from other parts of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first three elements of each row and repeating them in a certain way. Let me check another row. For example, the second input row is 1 5 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 3 1 1 5 3 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 1 1 5 3. The output second row is 1 5 3 1 1 5 3 1 1 5 3 1 1 5 3 1 1 5 3 1 1 5 3 1 1 5 3. So the first three elements are 1,5,3. Then the next elements are 1,1,5,3,1,1,5,3... which seems like the same pattern as the first three elements repeated. Wait, maybe the output is generated by taking the first three elements of the input row and then repeating them in a certain way. For example, the first three elements are 1,5,3. Then in the output, the next elements are 1,1,5,3,1,1,5,3... which seems like the first three elements are followed by their own repetition. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the first three elements of each row and then repeating them in a pattern. For example, the first three elements of the input row are 5,1,3. Then the output row starts with 5,1,3, and then the next three elements are 5,1,3 again? But looking at the output first row, after the initial 5,1,3, the next elements are 5,1,3,5,1,3... which seems like the first three elements are repeated every three positions. But the input's first row has zeros in positions 3-8. So maybe the output is replacing the zeros with the same pattern as the first three elements, but extended.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the input's first row, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the next elements are zeros. In the output, those zeros are replaced with 5,1,3,5,1,3, etc. So the output is taking the first three elements of the row and then repeating them in a way that fills the rest of the row. But how?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output grid is generated by taking the first three elements of each row and then repeating them in a certain pattern. For example, the first three elements are 5,1,3, then the next three elements are 5,1,3 again, then 5,1,3 again. But in the output, the first row is 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3. Wait, that's 27 elements. Let me count the number of elements. The first row of output has 27 elements. The first three are 5,1,3. Then the next three are 5,1,3, then 5,1,5,1,3, etc. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain positions filled in based on some rule.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input's first row is 3 7 4 1 3 7 4 1 3 7 4 1 3 7 4 1 3 7 4 1 3 7 4 1 3 7 4. The output is the same as the input. Wait, but in Example 2, the output is the same as the input? Wait no, looking at the output for Example 2, the first row is the same as the input. But in Example 1, the output is different. So maybe there are different patterns for different examples. But that's confusing. Wait, perhaps the output is the same as the input in some cases, but different in others. So maybe the pattern is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain elements based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output is the same as the input, but with some zeros replaced by the same numbers. Wait, but in the first row of Example 1, the input has zeros, and the output replaces them with the same numbers. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the third example. The input's first row is 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7. The output is the same as the input. But in the input, there are some rows where the output is different. For example, in the third example, the input's 9th row is 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 0 0 0 0 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7. The output for that row is 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7. So the zeros in positions 7-10 are replaced with 1,3,1,7. Which seems to be the same as the first three elements of the row. Wait, the first three elements are 3,1,7. Then the next elements are 5,7,5,3, etc. But in the input, the row has 0s in positions 7-10. In the output, those are replaced with 1,3,1,7. Which is the same as the first three elements of the row. So maybe the pattern is that in the output, any zero in the input is replaced with the value from the first three elements of the row. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by replacing zeros with the same value as the first three elements of the row. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the zeros in the input are replaced with 5,1,3,5,1,3, etc. So the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but with zeros replaced by the first three elements of the row, repeated as needed. But how?\n\nLooking at the first row of Example 1's input:\n\nInput: 5 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\n\nThe output is 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\n\nSo the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the next three elements (positions 3-5) are 5,1,3. Then positions 6-8 are 5,1,5. Wait, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first three elements of the row and then repeating them every three positions. For example, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the next three elements are 5,1,3 again. Then the next three are 5,1,3 again. But the output for the first row has 27 elements. Let's see:\n\nThe output row is 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3.\n\nWait, that's 27 elements. Let's split them into groups of three:\n\nGroup 1: 5 1 3\n\nGroup 2: 5 1 3\n\nGroup 3: 5 1 5 ?\n\nWait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the first three elements of the row and then repeating them in a certain pattern. For example, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the next three elements are 5,1,3 again. Then the next three are 5,1,3 again. But that would make the first row have 9 elements, but the actual output is 27. So maybe the first three elements are repeated 9 times. But that's not possible because 3*9=27. But the first row of output is 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3. That's 27 elements. Let me count the number of 5,1,3 sequences.\n\nLooking at the first row of output:\n\nThe first three elements are 5,1,3.\n\nThen next three: 5,1,3.\n\nThen next three: 5,1,5?\n\nNo, that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are repeated, but the fourth element is the same as the first. Wait, perhaps the output is generated by taking the first three elements and then repeating them in a way that the entire row is filled with the same three elements, but with some variations. Alternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the original input and some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first three elements of each row and then repeating them in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the first row of output is the same as the input's first row, but with the zeros replaced by the same pattern. So for example, in the input's first row, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the next elements are zeros. The output replaces those zeros with 5,1,3,5,1,3, etc. So the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but any zero in the input is replaced by the first three elements of the row, repeated every three positions. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for symmetry or patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where the first three elements are repeated. For example, the first row of output is 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3. It seems that the first three elements are 5,1,3, and then the next three are 5,1,3 again. Then the next three are 5,1,5. Wait, that doesn't fit. Maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are repeated, but the fourth element is the same as the first, the fifth as the second, etc. So for example, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the fourth element is 5, fifth is 1, sixth is 3, seventh is 5, eighth is 1, ninth is 3, and so on. That would generate the first row of output as 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3. But that's 27 elements. However, in the actual output, the first row is different. For example, the 7th element is 5, 8th is 1, 9th is 5, which doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing zeros with the value of the first three elements of the row, but in a way that the entire row is filled with the same three elements. For example, if the first three elements are 5,1,3, then the entire row is 5,1,3 repeated 9 times. But that would make the first row of output as 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3. Which is 27 elements. However, in the actual output for Example 1, the first row is different. Let me check again. The output first row is:\n\n5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\n\nSo the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then next three are 5,1,3. Then next three are 5,1,5. Then next three are 1,3,5, etc. That seems inconsistent. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input's first row is 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7. The output is the same as the input. So in this case, the output is the same as the input. But in other examples, the output is different. So maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, except for certain rows where the zeros are replaced with values from the first three elements of the row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the first three elements of each row and then repeating them in a certain pattern. For example, if the first three elements are a, b, c, then the output row is a, b, c, a, b, c, a, b, c, ... etc. But that would make the row have 27 elements. For example, if the first three elements are 5,1,3, then the row would be 5,1,3 repeated 9 times. But in the first row of Example 1's output, that's not the case. The first row of output is 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3. Which is not exactly that. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first three elements of the row and then replacing the zeros with the same three elements. For example, in Example 1's first row, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the zeros are replaced with 5,1,3,5,1,3, etc. But how to determine the pattern for replacement?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is the same as the input, but for certain rows, the zeros are replaced with the same values as the first three elements of the row. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the first three elements are 5,1,3. The zeros are in positions 3-8 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but in the output, those zeros are replaced with 5,1,3,5,1,3. So the pattern is that the zeros are replaced with the first three elements of the row, repeated as needed.\n\nSo the transformation rule could be: for each row in the input grid, if the value is zero, replace it with the value of the first three elements of the row, repeated in a way that fills the zero positions. But how to determine which value to use?\n\nAlternatively, for each cell in the grid, if it's zero, replace it with the value of the cell at (row, col % 3). For example, for the first row, the first three elements are 5,1,3. For positions 3,4,5,6,7,8, etc., which are 3rd, 4th, etc. columns, the value would be determined by the first three elements. For example, position 3 (0-based) is column 3, which is 3 mod 3 = 0, so take the first element (5). Position 4 is 4 mod 3 = 1, take the second element (1). Position 5 is 5 mod 3 = 2, take third element (3). Position 6 is 0, so 5 again. So that would generate 5,1,3,5,1,3, etc. Which matches the first row of the output for Example 1.\n\nLet me check that. For the first row of Example 1's input, the first three elements are 5,1,3. The zeros are in positions 3-8 (assuming 0-based, columns 3 to 8). Let's say the input row is:\n\nIndices 0-2: 5,1,3\n\nIndices 3-8: 0,0,0,0,0,0\n\nThen for each zero, the value would be determined by (col % 3). For column 3: 3%3=0 \u2192 5. Column 4: 4%3=1 \u2192 1. Column 5: 5%3=2 \u21923. Column 6: 6%3=0 \u21925. Column 7: 7%3=1 \u21921. Column 8: 8%3=2 \u21923. So the zeros would be replaced with 5,1,3,5,1,3. So the first row of the output would be:\n\n5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3, ... which matches the output of Example 1's first row. That seems to fit.\n\nNow, let's check another example. For Example 3's input, the first row is 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7. The output is the same as the input. So in this case, there are no zeros, so the transformation doesn't change anything. That makes sense.\n\nLooking at the third example's input, there are some rows with zeros. For example, the 9th row of Example 3's input is:\n\n3 1 7 5 7 5 3 0 0 0 0 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7\n\nThe first three elements are 3,1,7. The zeros are in columns 7-10. For each of these, the replacement would be:\n\ncolumn 7: 7%3=1 \u21921\n\ncolumn 8: 8%3=2 \u21927\n\ncolumn 9: 9%3=0 \u21923\n\ncolumn 10: 10%3=1 \u21921\n\nSo the zeros would be replaced with 1,7,3,1. But in the output, the row is:\n\n3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7\n\nSo the zeros in positions 7-10 (columns 7-10) are replaced with 1,3,1,7. Wait, that doesn't match the previous calculation. Wait, the first three elements are 3,1,7. For column 7 (index 7), 7 mod 3 is 1 (since 3*2=6, 7-6=1). So the value should be the second element, which is 1. Column 8: 8 mod 3 is 2 \u2192 third element, 7. Column 9: 9 mod 3 is 0 \u2192 first element, 3. Column 10: 10 mod 3 is 1 \u2192 second element, 1. So the zeros would be replaced with 1,7,3,1. But in the output, those positions are 1,3,1,7. That doesn't match. So maybe the pattern is not column mod 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the row's first three elements, and the position is determined by the column's position modulo 3. But in this case, the output for the 9th row of Example 3's input has the zeros replaced with 1,3,1,7. Let me check the output row:\n\nThe output row is:\n\n3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7\n\nLooking at columns 7-10 (assuming 0-based):\n\ncolumn 7: 1\n\ncolumn 8: 3\n\ncolumn 9: 1\n\ncolumn 10:7\n\nSo the values are 1,3,1,7. Which is different from the previous calculation. So maybe the pattern is not column mod 3. Or perhaps it's row-based.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the first three elements are a, b, c. Then, for any column in the row, if the value is zero, it's replaced with a, b, c, a, b, c, etc. So for the first three elements, the pattern is a, b, c, then a, b, c again. So for the first row of Example 1, the first three elements are 5,1,3. Then the next three elements are 5,1,3 again. So the row is 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3. Which is 27 elements. But in the actual output, the first row is different. So this seems to not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but with zeros replaced by the value of the cell at (row, col % 3). For example, for the first row of Example 3's input, the first three elements are 3,1,7. The zero in column 7 (0-based) is replaced by the value at (row, 7%3=1) which is 1. Column 8 is 8%3=2 \u21927. Column 9 is 9%3=0 \u21923. Column 10 is 10%3=1 \u21921. So the zeros would be replaced with 1,7,3,1. But in the output, the zeros are replaced with 1,3,1,7. Which is different. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the replacement is based on the row's first three elements and the column's position. For example, for each column, the value is determined by (col + 1) % 3. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the third example's input and output, the row with zeros is:\n\nInput row: 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 0 0 0 0 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7\n\nOutput row: 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7\n\nSo the zeros in columns 7-10 are replaced with 1,3,1,7. Let's see the first three elements are 3,1,7. The replaced values are 1,3,1,7. Which is the same as the first three elements of the row, but shifted. For example, 1 is the second element, 3 is the third, 1 is the second, 7 is the third. So maybe the pattern is that the replacement is based on the first three elements, but for each zero, it's the value at (col % 3) + 1? Or perhaps the pattern is that the replacement is the first three elements of the row, but the replacement for column i is the (i % 3)th element of the first three.\n\nBut in the case of the third example's row, the first three elements are 3,1,7. The columns 7-10 are replaced with 1,3,1,7. Let's see:\n\nFor column 7, which is the 7th column (0-based index 7). 7 mod 3 is 1. The first three elements are [3,1,7]. So the 1st element is 1. That matches the first replaced value (1). For column 8, 8 mod 3 is 2 \u2192 third element is 7. But in the output, the value is 3. That doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the row's first three elements, but the replacement is the same as the first three elements of the row, but shifted. For example, the first three elements are a, b, c. Then, the replacement for each zero is a, b, c, a, b, c, etc. So for the third example's row, the first three elements are 3,1,7. The replacement would be 3,1,7,3,1,7... but in the output, the zeros are replaced with 1,3,1,7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the third example's input and output. The output is the same as the input in some cases, but in others, the zeros are replaced with values from the first three elements. For example, in the third example's input, the 9th row has zeros in positions 7-10. The output replaces them with 1,3,1,7. Which is the same as the first three elements of the row, but in a different order. Wait, the first three elements are 3,1,7. The replaced values are 1,3,1,7. So it's like the second element, third, second, third. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for any zero in the input, it's replaced with the value of the cell at (row, col - 3). For example, in the third example's row, column 7 is replaced with the value at column 4 (7-3=4). The value at column 4 is 7. But in the output, the replaced value is 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for any zero in the input, it's replaced with the value of the cell at (row, col % 3). For example, in the third example's row, the first three elements are 3,1,7. For column 7 (index 7), 7 % 3 = 1 \u2192 value is 1. For column 8, 8%3=2 \u21927. For column 9, 9%3=0 \u21923. For column 10, 10%3=1 \u21921. So the replaced values would be 1,7,3,1. But in the output, the replaced values are 1,3,1,7. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for certain rows, the zeros are replaced with the same values as the first three elements of the row, but in a different pattern. For example, in the third example's row, the replaced values are 1,3,1,7. Which is the second element, third element, second element, third element. So maybe it's alternating between the second and third elements. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for any zero in the input, it's replaced with the value of the first three elements of the row, in a way that the first three elements are repeated every three columns. For example, if the first three elements are a, b, c, then the output is a, b, c, a, b, c, a, b, c, etc. So for the first row of Example 1, the output would be 5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3. Which is 27 elements. But the actual output of Example 1's first row is different. Wait, but in the output for Example 1's first row, the first three elements are 5,1,3, then the next three are 5,1,3, then the next three are 5,1,5, which doesn't fit this pattern. So this suggests that the pattern is not this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for any zero, it's replaced with the value of the first three elements of the row, but in a way that the replacement is based on the column's position modulo 3. But in the third example's row, this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of another approach. Let's look at the test input and see what the output should be. But the user says not to predict the test output, just to write the transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but with zeros replaced by the value of the first three elements of the row. For example, if the first three elements are a, b, c, then any zero in the row is replaced with a, b, c, a, b, c, etc. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for any cell that is zero, it is replaced with the value of the cell at (row, col % 3). For example, in the first row of Example 1, the first three elements are 5,1,3. So for column 3 (0-based), 3 % 3 = 0 \u21925. Column 4: 4%3=1 \u21921. Column 5: 5%3=2 \u21923. Column 6: 6%3=0 \u21925. Column 7: 7%3=1 \u21921. Column 8: 8%3=2 \u21923. So the zeros would be replaced with 5,1,3,5,1,3. Which matches the output of Example 1's first row.\n\nIn the third example's row with zeros, the first three elements are 3,1,7. So for column 7 (index 7), 7%3=1 \u21921. Column 8: 8%3=2 \u21927. Column 9: 9%3=0 \u21923. Column 10: 10%3=1 \u21921. So the replaced values would be 1,7,3,1. But in the output, the replaced values are 1,3,1,7. So this doesn't match. But maybe I made a mistake in analyzing the third example's output.\n\nWait, let me check the third example's input and output again. The third example's input has a row:\n\nInput row: 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 0 0 0 0 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7\n\nOutput row: 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7\n\nSo the zeros are in columns 7-10 (indices 7,8,9,10). The output for these columns is 1,3,1,7.\n\nLet's see what the first three elements are: 3,1,7.\n\nFor column 7: 7%3 = 1 \u2192 value is 1. That matches the output (1).\n\nColumn 8: 8%3 = 2 \u2192 value is 7. But in the output, it's 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is different. What if the replacement is based on the first three elements of the row, but the replacement for each zero is the value of the first three elements in the row, but shifted by one. For example, the first three elements are a, b, c. Then, the replacement for column i is b, c, a, b, c, a, etc. But that's just a guess.\n\nIn the third example's row, the first three elements are 3,1,7. So the replacement pattern could be 1,7,3,1,7,3,... for the zeros. Let's see:\n\nFor column 7 (index 7), 7%3=1 \u2192 1 (second element). Column 8: 8%3=2 \u21927 (third element). Column 9: 9%3=0 \u21923 (first element). Column 10: 10%3=1 \u21921 (second element). So the replaced values would be 1,7,3,1. But in the output, the replaced values are 1,3,1,7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the first three elements, but the replacement is the first element, then the second, then the third, then the first, etc. So for the third example's row, the first three elements are 3,1,7. The replacement pattern would be 3,1,7,3,1,7, etc. But in the output, the replaced values are 1,3,1,7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the third example's input and output. The input row has zeros in positions 7-10. The output replaces them with 1,3,1,7. Let's see the first three elements are 3,1,7. The replaced values are 1,3,1,7. So it's like the second element, third element, second element, third element. So the pattern is: for each zero, the value is the second element, third element, second element, third element, etc. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for any zero, it is replaced with the value of the first three elements of the row, but in a way that the first three elements are repeated in a certain order. For example, if the first three elements are a, b, c, then the replacement is a, b, c, a, b, c, etc. But this doesn't fit the third example's case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the same as the input, but for any zero, it is replaced with the value of the cell at (row, col - 3). For example, in the third example's row, column 7 is replaced with the value at column 4 (7-3=4). The value at column 4 is 7. But in the output, it's 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the correct approach is to look for the pattern that works for Example 1 and Example 3.\n\nIn Example 1, the first row's zeros are replaced with the first three elements of the row, repeated every three columns. So for column 3, it's 5 (first element), column 4 is 1 (second), column 5 is 3 (third), column 6 is 5 (first), etc. This seems to fit.\n\nIn the third example's row, the replaced values are 1,3,1,7. Which is the second, third, second, third elements of the first three elements. So maybe the pattern is that the replacement is based on the column's position modulo 3, but with a shift. For example, if the first three elements are a, b, c, then the replacement for column i is the value at (i % 3 + 1)th element. Or maybe it's based on the column's position modulo 3, but with a different offset.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the replacement is based on the column's position modulo 3, but the first three elements are a, b, c, and the replacement for column i is the value at (i % 3)th element of the first three elements. But this would work for Example 1 but not for the third example.\n\nBut in the third example's row, the first three elements are 3,1,7. For column 7 (i=7), 7%3=1 \u2192 value is 1 (second element). For column 8, 8%3=2 \u2192 value is 7 (third element). For column 9, 9%3=0 \u2192 value is 3 (first element). For column 10, 10%3=1 \u2192 value is 1 (second element). So the replaced values would be 1,7,3,1. But in the output, it's 1,3,1,7. So this doesn't match. So perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the replacement is based on the first three elements of the row, but the replacement is the same as the first three elements of the row, repeated in a way that the entire row is filled with the first three elements. For example, if the first three elements are a, b, c, then the entire row is a, b, c, a, b, c, a, b, c, ... etc. This would work for Example 1's first row, but not for the third example's row. But in the third example's row, the output is the same as the input, so there are no zeros. So this pattern might work for some cases.\n\nBut how to explain the third example's row? It seems that in some cases, the output is the same as the input, and in others, the zeros are replaced based on the first three elements. So perhaps the general rule is: for each cell in the grid, if it is zero, replace it with the value of the first three elements of the row, repeated every three columns.\n\nSo the transformation would be: for each row in the input grid, if the value at (row, col) is zero, replace it with the value of the first three elements of the row, at position (col % 3). \n\nLet me try this with the third example's row. The first three elements are 3,1,7. For column 7, 7%3=1 \u21921. Column 8: 8%3=2 \u21927. Column 9: 9%3=0 \u21923. Column 10: 10%3=1 \u21921. So the replaced values would be 1,7,3,1. But in the output, the replaced values are 1,3,1,7. So this doesn't match. But maybe the third example's output is a special case, or I'm misunderstanding the input.\n\nWait, let me check the third example's input again. The input row is:\n\n3 1 7 5 7 5 3 0 0 0 0 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7 5 7 5 3 1 3 1 7\n\nSo the first three elements are 3,1,7. The zeros are in columns 7-10 (indices 7,8,9,10). The output for these columns is 1,3,1,7. So the values are 1,3,1,7. Let's see what the first three elements are. If the first three elements are 3,1,7, then the replacement for column 7 is 1 (second element), column 8 is 3 (first element?), but that doesn't fit. Or maybe the replacement is based on (col + 1) % 3. For example, for column 7, (7+1) %3 = 8%3=2 \u2192 third element (7). But the output is 1.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should proceed with the pattern that works for Example 1 and see if it can be generalized.\n\nSo the transformation rule would be: for each row, if the value is zero, replace it with the value of the first three elements of the row at position (col % 3). \n\nLet's implement this in code. For each row in the input grid, we take the first three elements. For each column in the row, if the value is zero, replace it with the value of the first three elements at (col % 3). \n\nLet me test this with the third example's row. The first three elements are 3,1,7. The zeros are in columns 7-10. For column 7, 7%3=1 \u2192 value is 1. Column 8: 8%3=2 \u21927. Column 9: 9%3=0 \u21923. Column 10: 10%3=1 \u21921. So the replaced values are 1,7,3,1. But in the output, the replaced values are 1,3,1,7. So this doesn't match. But maybe the third example's output is not following this pattern, or I'm misunderstanding the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are a, b, c, and the replacement is based on (col + 1) % 3. For example, for column 7, (7 + 1) %3 = 8%3=2 \u2192 c. So for the third example's row, the replaced values would be 7,3,7,3. But that doesn't match the output.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to proceed with the pattern that works for Example 1, and see if it can be generalized. Even if it doesn't fit all cases, it's better than nothing.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n- Take the first three elements of the row as a, b, c.\n\n- For each column in the row:\n\n   - If the value is zero, replace it with a, b, c, a, b, c, ... based on (col % 3).\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # get the first three elements\n        a, b, c = row[0], row[1], row[2]\n        new_row = []\n        for col in range(27):\n            if row[col] == 0:\n                # replace with a, b, c, a, b, c, ...\n                mod = col % 3\n                new_row.append([a, b, c][mod])\n            else:\n                new_row.append(row[col])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in Example 1's first row, the first three elements are 5,1,3. For col 3, mod is 0 \u21925. So the replaced value is 5. Which matches the output. For col 4, mod is 1 \u21921. For col 5, mod is 2 \u21923. For col 6, mod is 0 \u21925, etc. So this would generate the first row of the output as 5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3,5,1,3. But the actual output for the first row is different. Wait, the output for the first row of Example 1 is:\n\n5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\n\nSo the 7th element (index 7) is 5, 8th is 1, 9th is 5, 10th is 1, etc. So this suggests that the pattern is not exactly col % 3.\n\nBut according to the code above, for col 7 (index 7), mod is 7%3=1 \u21921. But in the output, it's 5. So this suggests that the code is not correct. But why?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the analysis. Let me recheck.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, the input is:\n\n5 1 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\n\nThe output is:\n\n5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\n\nSo for the first row, the first three elements are 5,1,3. The zeros are from column 3 to 8 (indices 3-8). Let's see what the code would generate for these positions.\n\nFor col 3: 3%3=0 \u21925\n\ncol 4: 4%3=1 \u21921\n\ncol 5: 5%3=2 \u21923\n\ncol 6: 6%3=0 \u21925\n\ncol 7: 7%3=1 \u21921\n\ncol 8: 8%3=2 \u21923\n\nSo the replaced values for these columns would be 5,1,3,5,1,3. So the first row would be:\n\n5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3.\n\nBut the actual output is different. The actual output for the first row is:\n\n5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3\n\nSo the 9th element (index 8) is 5, but according to the code, it would be 3. So this suggests that the pattern is not correct.\n\nThis indicates that the initial hypothesis is wrong. So what's the correct pattern?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the first three elements are a, b, c, and for each column, if it's zero, it's replaced with the value of the first three elements at (col - 3) % 3. Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the first three elements are a, b, c, and the replacement for each zero is the value of the first three elements at (col - 3) % 3. For example, in the first row, for col 3, it's 3-3=0 \u21920%3=0 \u2192a. For col 4, 4-3=1 \u21921%3=1 \u2192b. For col 5, 5-3=2 \u21922%3=2 \u2192c. For col 6, 6-3=3 \u21923%3=0 \u2192a. For col 7, 7-3=4 \u21924%3=1 \u2192b. For col 8, 8-3=5 \u21925%3=2 \u2192c. So the replaced values would be a, b, c, a, b, c. Which matches the first row of the output. But in the actual output, the first row is different. Wait, but according to this, the replaced values would be 5,1,3,5,1,3. So the first row would be 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 3 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3. But the actual output is 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3 5 1 3 5 1 5 1 3. So the 9th element (index 8) is 5 instead of 3. This suggests that the pattern is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find the exact pattern. However, given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that the pattern is to replace zeros with the first three elements of the row, based on column % 3, even though it doesn't fit all cases. Maybe there's a mistake in the analysis of the third example.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # get the first three elements\n        a, b, c = row[0], row[1], row[2]\n        new_row = []\n        for col in range(27):\n            if row[col] == 0:\n                mod = col % 3\n                new_row.append([a, b, c][mod])\n            else:\n                new_row.append(row[col])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not work for all cases. However, it's the best I can do based on the examples provided.\n"
