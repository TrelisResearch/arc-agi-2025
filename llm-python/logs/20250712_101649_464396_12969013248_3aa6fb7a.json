          "From the provided examples, a pattern emerges related to shifting the positions of certain bright cells (value 8) and changing some specific cells (possibly those that form certain shapes or are near these high-value cells). The transformations seem to involve:\n\n- Moving certain high-value cells (8) to new positions\n- Creating new \"pattern points\" (value 1) near or relative to the positions of 8s\n- The output grids tend to preserve the size, but modify the positions of some cells.\n\nIn particular:\n\n- In Example 1, a specific 8 near the top left corner gets a 1 placed near it; this seems to be a positioning pattern.\n- In Example 2, similar shifting or positioning occurs, with 1s appearing near different 8s, following a pattern of proximity or adjacency.\n\nLooking at the test input, the pattern might be to:\n\n- Find all cells with value 8\n- For each 8, decide on a relative position (e.g., if an 8 is at row r, col c, the new position might be offset by some fixed or adaptive rule \u2013 perhaps moving 1 step down and right)\n- Replace some cells near the 8s with 1s to replicate the shape seen in training examples\n- Keep other contents unchanged to maintain the shape and size\n\nWhile not perfectly deterministic from the small sample, the best hypothesis is:\n\n- For each high-value cell (8), place a 1 at a position offset (down-right or similar)\n- Keep other cells as they are\n\nThis is consistent with the sample transformations: two 8s become positions with a 1 near them. Because the pattern is about positioning and small shape modifications, I will attempt a solution implementing a small offset around each 8, turning distinct near cells into 1s.\n\nHere's a best-effort implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    rows, cols = arr.shape\n    \n    # Make a copy to avoid mutating the original\n    new_arr = np.copy(arr)\n    \n    # For each cell, if it's an 8, place a 1 at a position offset (e.g., down and right)\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if arr[r, c] == 8:\n                # Attempt to set a cell diagonally down-right to 1, if within bounds\n                dr, dc = r + 1, c + 1\n                if 0 <= dr < rows and 0 <= dc < cols:\n                    new_arr[dr, dc] = 1\n                # Also, to mimic Example 1 and 2, mark the cell itself as 8\n                new_arr[r, c] = 8\n    \n    # Ensure all high points are preserved, and new ones are added\n    # If needed, could also normalize by making sure only relevant cells are modified\n    # For now, leave the rest unchanged\n    \n    return new_arr.tolist()\n```\n\n**Note:** This implementation attempts to place a '1' near each '8' in a consistent manner, inspired by the observed pattern, and ensures the final grid remains 7\u00d77 as specified.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    rows, cols = arr.shape\n    \n    # Make a copy to avoid mutating the original\n    new_arr = np.copy(arr)\n    \n    # For each cell, if it's an 8, place a 1 at a position offset (e.g., down and right)\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if arr[r, c] == 8:\n                # Attempt to set a cell diagonally down-right to 1, if within bounds\n                dr, dc = r + 1, c + 1\n                if 0 <= dr < rows and 0 <= dc < cols:\n                    new_arr[dr, dc] = 1\n                # Keep the original 8\n                new_arr[r, c] = 8\n    \n    return new_arr.tolist()\n```"
