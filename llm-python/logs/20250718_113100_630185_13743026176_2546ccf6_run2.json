The output grid appears to be a transformation of the input grid where certain patterns are preserved or modified in specific ways.\n2. There are rows with all 6s (Example 1) that remain unchanged in the output.\n3. In Example 2, there are rows with all 2s that remain unchanged in the output.\n4. There are patterns where certain values are replaced or modified in specific positions.\n5. There seems to be a pattern where certain values are preserved in specific positions while others are modified.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves preserving certain values in specific positions while modifying others in a pattern that is not immediately clear.\n\nHere's my best attempt at implementing this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each row in the grid\n    for i in range(17):\n        # For each column in the row\n        for j in range(19):\n            # If the value is 6 (Example 1) or 2 (Example 2), preserve it\n            if grid[i][j] in (6, 2):\n                continue\n            \n            # If the value is 0, replace it with 0 (no change)\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # For other values, replace them with 0\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each row in the grid\n    for i in range(17):\n        # For each column in the row\n        for j in range(19):\n            # If the value is 6 (Example 1) or 2 (Example 2), preserve it\n            if grid[i][j] in (6, 2):\n                continue\n            \n            # If the value is 0, replace it with 0 (no change)\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # For other values, replace them with 0\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid appears to be a transformation of the input grid where certain patterns are preserved or modified in specific ways.\n2. There are rows with all 6s (Example 1) that remain unchanged in the output.\n3. In Example 2, there are rows with all 2s that remain unchanged in the output.\n4. There are patterns where certain values are replaced or modified in specific positions.\n5. There seems to be a pattern where certain values are preserved in specific positions while others are modified.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves preserving certain values in specific positions while modifying others in a pattern that is not immediately clear.\n\nHere's my best attempt at implementing this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each row in the grid\n    for i in range(17):\n        # For each column in the row\n        for j in range(19):\n            # If the value is 6 (Example 1) or 2 (Example 2), preserve it\n            if grid[i][j] in (6, 2):\n                continue\n            \n            # If the value is 0, replace it with 0 (no change)\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # For other values, replace them with 0\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each row in the grid\n    for i in range(17):\n        # For each column in the row\n        for j in range(19):\n            # If the value is 6 (Example 1) or 2 (Example 2), preserve it\n            if grid[i][j] in (6, 2):\n                continue\n            \n            # If the value is 0, replace it with 0 (no change)\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                continue\n            \n            # For other values, replace them with 0\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
