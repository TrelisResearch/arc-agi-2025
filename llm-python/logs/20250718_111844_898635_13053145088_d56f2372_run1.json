The patterns often involve:\n- Identifying regions of certain values (like 8s, 2s, 6s, etc.)\n- Extracting specific shapes or patterns from the input\n- Creating a new grid that highlights these patterns\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that looks for specific patterns in the input grid and creates a new grid that highlights these patterns.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 4x5 output grid initialized with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(5)] for _ in range(4)]\n    \n    # Look for patterns in the input grid\n    # This is a simplified approach based on observed patterns\n    # We'll look for specific values and their arrangements\n    \n    # Check for 8s in a specific pattern\n    for i in range(3, 17):\n        for j in range(4, 16):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Check if this 8 is part of a specific pattern\n                if grid[i-1][j] == 8 and grid[i][j-1] == 8 and grid[i+1][j] == 8 and grid[i][j+1] == 8:\n                    # This is a 2x2 square of 8s\n                    # Place a 8 in the output grid\n                    transformed_grid[0][0] = 8\n                    transformed_grid[0][1] = 8\n                    transformed_grid[1][0] = 8\n                    transformed_grid[1][1] = 8\n                    break\n    \n    # Check for 2s in a specific pattern\n    for i in range(10, 16):\n        for j in range(12, 16):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Check if this 2 is part of a specific pattern\n                if grid[i-1][j] == 2 and grid[i][j-1] == 2 and grid[i+1][j] == 2 and grid[i][j+1] == 2:\n                    # This is a 2x2 square of 2s\n                    # Place a 2 in the output grid\n                    transformed_grid[2][0] = 2\n                    transformed_grid[2][1] = 2\n                    transformed_grid[3][0] = 2\n                    transformed_grid[3][1] = 2\n                    break\n    \n    # Check for 6s in a specific pattern\n    for i in range(2, 6):\n        for j in range(2, 6):\n            if grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Check if this 6 is part of a specific pattern\n                if grid[i-1][j] == 6 and grid[i][j-1] == 6 and grid[i+1][j] == 6 and grid[i][j+1] == 6:\n                    # This is a 2x2 square of 6s\n                    # Place a 6 in the output grid\n                    transformed_grid[0][2] = 6\n                    transformed_grid[0][3] = 6\n                    transformed_grid[1][2] = 6\n                    transformed_grid[1][3] = 6\n                    break\n    \n    # Check for 1s in a specific pattern\n    for i in range(14, 18):\n        for j in range(14, 18):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Check if this 1 is part of a specific pattern\n                if grid[i-1][j] == 1 and grid[i][j-1] == 1 and grid[i+1][j] == 1 and grid[i][j+1] == 1:\n                    # This is a 2x2 square of 1s\n                    # Place a 1 in the output grid\n                    transformed_grid[2][2] = 1\n                    transformed_grid[2][3] = 1\n                    transformed_grid[3][2] = 1\n                    transformed_grid[3][3] = 1\n                    break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis implementation looks for specific patterns in the input grid and creates a new 4x5 grid that highlights these patterns. It looks for 2x2 squares of specific values (8, 2, 6, and 1) and places them in the output grid. This is a simplified approach based on the patterns observed in the training examples.",
