The 8s appear to be placed in positions that form a kind of \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape, but the exact pattern is not entirely clear. However, from the examples, I notice that 8s are often placed in positions that are surrounded by 5s and are in the middle of a cluster of 0s.\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that replaces 0s with 8s in positions that are surrounded by 5s and are in the middle of a cluster of 0s.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert the grid to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Check if the cell is 0 and is surrounded by 5s\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check the surrounding cells (up, down, left, right)\n                surrounding = [\n                    grid_np[i-1][j] if i-1 >= 0 else 0,\n                    grid_np[i+1][j] if i+1 < 10 else 0,\n                    grid_np[i][j-1] if j-1 >= 0 else 0,\n                    grid_np[i][j+1] if j+1 < 10 else 0\n                ]\n                # If all surrounding cells are 5, replace with 8\n                if all(s == 5 for s in surrounding):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    # Convert the transformed numpy array back to a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 0:\n                surrounding = [\n                    grid_np[i-1][j] if i-1 >= 0 else 0,\n                    grid_np[i+1][j] if i+1 < 10 else 0,\n                    grid_np[i][j-1] if j-1 >= 0 else 0,\n                    grid_np[i][j+1] if j+1 < 10 else 0\n                ]\n                if all(s == 5 for s in surrounding):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe that the transformation seems to involve replacing certain values (specifically 0s) with 8s in specific patterns. The 8s appear to be placed in positions that form a kind of \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape, but the exact pattern is not entirely clear. However, from the examples, I notice that 8s are often placed in positions that are surrounded by 5s and are in the middle of a cluster of 0s.\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that replaces 0s with 8s in positions that are surrounded by 5s and are in the middle of a cluster of 0s.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert the grid to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Check if the cell is 0 and is surrounded by 5s\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check the surrounding cells (up, down, left, right)\n                surrounding = [\n                    grid_np[i-1][j] if i-1 >= 0 else 0,\n                    grid_np[i+1][j] if i+1 < 10 else 0,\n                    grid_np[i][j-1] if j-1 >= 0 else 0,\n                    grid_np[i][j+1] if j+1 < 10 else 0\n                ]\n                # If all surrounding cells are 5, replace with 8\n                if all(s == 5 for s in surrounding):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    # Convert the transformed numpy array back to a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 0:\n                surrounding = [\n                    grid_np[i-1][j] if i-1 >= 0 else 0,\n                    grid_np[i+1][j] if i+1 < 10 else 0,\n                    grid_np[i][j-1] if j-1 >= 0 else 0,\n                    grid_np[i][j+1] if j+1 < 10 else 0\n                ]\n                if all(s == 5 for s in surrounding):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
