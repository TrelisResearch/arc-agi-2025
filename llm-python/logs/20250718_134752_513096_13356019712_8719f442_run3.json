          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let's start by analyzing each example.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nThe input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 15x15 grid. The input has 5s in certain positions, and the output seems to expand those 5s into larger blocks. For instance, the first row of input is 0 5 0. The output's first row is a bunch of 0s except for a single 5 in the 8th position. Then, in the next rows, there are blocks of 5s. It looks like the 5s are being expanded into vertical and horizontal lines, maybe forming a cross or some kind of spread.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is another 3x3 grid. The output again is 15x15. The input has 5s in different positions. The output seems to have 5s spread out in a more complex pattern. For example, the first input row is 0 5 0, and the output starts with a 5 in the 8th position, but then there are more 5s in the next rows. It seems like the 5s are being replicated in a way that creates larger structures.\n\nExample 3's input is a 3x3 grid with 5s on the diagonal. The output is again 15x15. The output here has 5s spread out in a way that seems to form a cross or maybe a diamond shape. For instance, the first few rows have 5s in the first column, then in the middle, and then in the third column. It's possible that the 5s are being expanded into a larger grid based on their positions.\n\nHmm. So the transformation seems to take the input grid's 5s and expand them into certain patterns. But how?\n\nLet me think about the positions. The input is 3x3, and the output is 15x15. Maybe the input is being scaled up. For example, each cell in the input might correspond to a 5x5 block in the output? But that would make 3x3 blocks of 5x5, leading to 15x15. But looking at the outputs, the 5s are spread out in a way that might not be just blocks. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 5 in the center. The output has a vertical line of 5s in the middle columns. Wait, looking at the first output row of Example 1: it's 0s except for the 8th position (which is 5). Then the next rows have 5s in positions 7, 8, 9. So maybe the 5s are being expanded in a way that forms a cross or a line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical and horizontal line in the output. Let's think: the input's 5s are in positions (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). Wait, in Example 1, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 0\nRow 1: 5 5 5\nRow 2: 0 5 0\n\nSo the 5s are in positions (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). The output seems to have these 5s expanded into vertical and horizontal lines. For example, the first row of output has a 5 in the 8th column. Then the next rows have 5s in columns 7, 8, 9. Then rows 4-7 have 5s in columns 7-9. Then in row 7, there's a vertical line of 5s. Maybe each 5 in the input is being expanded into a 5x5 block in the output, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in a way that forms a cross in the output.\n\nAnother approach: the output is 15x15. The input is 3x3. Maybe the input is being scaled by a factor of 5. But that would mean each cell in the input is mapped to a 5x5 block in the output. However, the output seems to have 5s in specific positions, not full blocks. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row has a single 5 in the middle. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being spread out in a certain pattern. For example, each 5 in the input is replicated in a way that creates a cross. For instance, if a cell in the input is 5, then in the output, there's a line of 5s in the middle of the output grid, but that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input, which is:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 0\nRow 1: 0 5 0\nRow 2: 0 0 5\n\nThe output starts with 5s in the first column, then in the middle, then in the third column. So maybe the 5s in the input are being expanded into vertical lines in the output. For example, the 5 in (0,0) becomes a vertical line in the output's first column. Similarly, the 5 in (1,1) becomes a vertical line in the middle, and the 5 in (2,2) becomes a vertical line in the third column. But the output in Example 3 has 5s in the first column, then in the middle, then third. But the output is 15x15. So maybe each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line of 5s in the output's corresponding column.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3's output, the first three rows have 5s in the first column. Then, rows 4-7 have 5s in the middle columns. Then rows 8-11 have 5s in the third column. So maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into vertical lines in the output. For example, the input's 5 in (0,0) becomes a vertical line in the first column, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being placed in the output grid in a way that depends on their positions. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross shape in the output. For example, if a cell in the input is 5, then in the output, there's a cross (horizontal and vertical lines) centered at that cell's position.\n\nBut how to map the input's 3x3 grid to the 15x15 output? Maybe the input is being scaled by 5. For example, each cell in the input corresponds to a 5x5 block in the output. But that would make the output 15x15 (since 3x5=15). However, the output in Example 1 seems to have 5s in specific positions, not full blocks. For example, the first row of the output has a 5 in the middle. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAnother thought: the output seems to have 5s in positions that are symmetrically placed. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are spread out in a way that forms a vertical line in the middle columns. Maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that spans the entire output grid. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being expanded into a diamond shape. For example, the input's 5s are in the center, and the output has a diamond pattern. But again, not sure.\n\nLet me think about the positions. The output grid is 15x15. The input is 3x3. So maybe each cell in the input is mapped to a certain region in the output. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is mapped to a region in the output that is centered at (i*5, j*5). But that would make the output 15x15, as 3*5=15. But then, how would the 5s be placed? For example, in Example 1, the input's (0,1) is 5. So in the output, the region around (0*5, 1*5) = (0,5) would have 5s. But the output's first row has a 5 in column 7. Wait, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is being expanded into the output by replicating each 5 in the input into a cross shape. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a horizontal line and a vertical line in the output. For instance, if the input has a 5 at (i,j), then in the output, there's a horizontal line of 5s in the middle row of the output's corresponding block, and a vertical line in the middle column of the output's corresponding block. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input, which is a diagonal of 5s. The output has 5s in the first column, then middle, then third. So maybe each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line in the output. For example, the 5 in (0,0) becomes a vertical line in the first column of the output. Similarly, the 5 in (1,1) becomes a vertical line in the middle column, and the 5 in (2,2) becomes a vertical line in the third column. But how does that fit with the 15x15 grid?\n\nIf the input is 3x3, then each of the three 5s in the input's diagonal would be mapped to vertical lines in the output's columns 0, 5, 10. Wait, 15 columns. So 0, 5, 10. But in Example 3's output, the first three rows have 5s in the first column (column 0?), then rows 4-7 have 5s in column 5, then rows 8-11 have 5s in column 10. So that seems to fit. But how does that work?\n\nSo the idea is that each 5 in the input's (i,j) is expanded into a vertical line in the output's column j*5. But how? For example, in Example 3, the input's (0,0) is 5. So in the output, column 0 (since 0*5=0) has a vertical line. But in the output, the first three rows have 5s in column 0. Then rows 4-7 have 5s in column 5 (from (1,1)), and rows 8-11 have 5s in column 10 (from (2,2)). That seems to fit. So maybe the transformation is that each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line in the output's column j*5, and the vertical line spans from row i*5 to row i*5 + 4 (since 5 rows per block). But that would make the vertical line in the output's column j*5, spanning rows i*5 to i*5 +4. Wait, but the output is 15x15. For example, for i=0, j=0: column 0, rows 0-4. Then i=1, j=1: column 5, rows 5-9. Then i=2, j=2: column 10, rows 10-14. That would fit the example.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output, the first three rows (rows 0-2) have 5s in column 0. Then rows 3-6 have 5s in column 5. Then rows 7-10 have 5s in column 10. Wait, but in the output, the first three rows have 5s in column 0, then rows 4-7 have 5s in column 5. So that's not exactly matching. Maybe the vertical lines are spread out in a way that depends on the input's i and j.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line in the output's column j*5, and the vertical line spans the entire height of the output. But that would be 15 rows. But in Example 3's output, the first column has 5s in rows 0-2, then rows 4-7, etc. That doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical lines are centered. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line in the output's column j*5, but the line is 5 rows tall. So for input (i,j), the vertical line is in column j*5, and spans rows i*5 to i*5 +4. That would make sense. For example, in Example 3, the input (0,0) would be column 0, rows 0-4. But in the output, the first column (column 0) has 5s in rows 0-2, then rows 4-7. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are spread out in a way that depends on their position in the input. For example, the input's 5s are expanded into a cross shape in the output. For example, if a cell in the input is 5, then in the output, there's a horizontal line and vertical line centered at (i*5, j*5). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are expanded into a cross shape in the output. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that is 5x5 in the output. But how to map that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being divided into 3x3 blocks of 5x5. Each block corresponds to a cell in the input. For example, the input's (i,j) corresponds to the block in the output starting at (i*5, j*5). Then, if the input cell is 5, then the entire block is filled with 5s. But looking at Example 1's output, that doesn't seem to be the case. For example, the first block (i=0, j=0) would be a 5x5 block of 5s. But in the output, the first row of the output has a 5 in the 8th column (column 7?), which is part of the block (i=0, j=1). So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are expanded into a cross that spans the entire output. For example, if the input has a 5 in (i,j), then in the output, the cross is centered at (i*5, j*5). But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are expanded into a line that spans the entire output. For example, if the input has a 5 in the center, then the output has a vertical line in the middle of the output.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output, the first row has a 5 in column 7 (assuming 0-based indexing). Then the next rows have 5s in columns 7-9. Then in rows 4-7, columns 7-9. Then in row 7, columns 7-9 are all 5s. Then row 8 has a 5 in column 7. So maybe the 5s are forming a vertical line in the middle of the output. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nThe input for Example 1 has a 5 in the center (row 1, column 1). So maybe that's the center of the vertical line. The vertical line is in the middle of the output, which is column 7 (since 15 columns, middle is 7). So that fits. Then, the vertical line is 5 rows tall. But in the output, the vertical line is in columns 7-9. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are expanded into a cross that is 5x5 in the output. For example, if the input has a 5 in (i,j), then the output has a cross centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). But that's just a guess.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to think of another approach. Maybe the output grid is generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a certain pattern. For example, in the output, the 5s are placed in positions that are symmetrically around the input's 5s.\n\nAnother idea: the output is created by taking the input's 5s and expanding them into a cross shape. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a horizontal and vertical line in the output. For example, if the input has a 5 at (i,j), then in the output, there's a horizontal line of 5s in the row corresponding to i*5 + 2, and a vertical line of 5s in the column corresponding to j*5 + 2. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are expanded into a diamond shape. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a diamond pattern in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being filled with 5s in positions that are determined by the input. For example, in the output, the 5s are placed in positions where the row and column are multiples of 5, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, the 5s are placed in positions that are symmetric around the center of the output. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the middle columns. So maybe the input's 5s are expanded into the middle of the output.\n\nBut how to map the input to the output.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the 5s in the output and see if they can be related to the input.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the first row has a 5 in column 7 (assuming 0-based indexing). The input's first row has a 5 in column 1. So 1*5 + 2 = 7? Maybe. Then, the next row has 5s in columns 7-9. So that's the same column as before. Then rows 4-7 have 5s in columns 7-9. So that's a vertical line of 5s in the middle of the output. So maybe each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line in the output's middle column.\n\nBut how does that relate to the input's position? For example, the input's 5 in (0,1) is expanded into a vertical line in column 7. But 1*5 + 2 = 7. So that's possible. Then, the input's 5 in (1,0) is expanded into a vertical line in column 7 (since 0*5 + 2=2? No, that doesn't fit). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's 5s are expanded into a cross shape that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). For example, the input's (0,1) is expanded into a cross centered at (2, 7). Then, the cross would have 5s in the middle row and middle column of the output. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are expanded into a cross that spans the entire output. For example, if the input has a 5 in the center, then the output has a vertical line in the middle column and a horizontal line in the middle row.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has a 5 in the center (row 1, column 1). The output has a vertical line in column 7 (middle of 15 columns) and a horizontal line in row 7 (middle of 15 rows). So that fits. So perhaps the transformation is that each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, the input's 5s are expanded into a cross that is centered at (i*5, j*5). But that would make the cross in the middle of each block.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try to think of the output for Example 1. The first row has a 5 in column 7. That's the middle column. So maybe the 5s in the input are expanded into the middle of the output. For example, the input's 5 in (0,1) is expanded into the middle column of the output. Then, the input's 5 in (1,0) is expanded into the middle row of the output. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking the input's 5s and expanding them into a cross that spans the entire output. For example, if the input has a 5 in the center, then the output has a cross that is in the middle of the output. But how to handle multiple 5s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is filled with 5s in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, for each 5 in the input, we add a line of 5s in the output in certain positions.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output.\n\nAnother idea: the output is created by expanding each 5 in the input into a 5x5 block in the output. But how?\n\nIn Example 1, the input is 3x3. If each 5 is expanded into a 5x5 block, then the output would be 3x5=15x15. But the output in Example 1 has 5s in specific positions, not full blocks. For example, the first row has a single 5 in the middle. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are expanded into a cross that is 5x5 in the output. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). So the cross would have 5s in the middle row and middle column of the output block. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being built by taking the input's 5s and placing them in the output's grid in a way that forms a cross. For example, if the input has a 5 in (i,j), then in the output, the cross is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). Then, the cross would have 5s in the middle row and middle column of the output block.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the output as a grid where the 5s are placed in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, for each 5 in the input, we add a vertical line in the output's column j*5, and a horizontal line in the output's row i*5.\n\nBut how to determine the exact positions.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being divided into 3x3 blocks of 5x5. Each block corresponds to a cell in the input. If the input cell is 5, then the entire block is filled with 5s. But in Example 1, the input has a 5 in (0,1), so the block (0,1) would be filled with 5s. However, the output's first row has a single 5 in column 7, which is part of the block (0,1). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that is centered at (i*5, j*5). For example, in the output, the cross would have 5s in the middle row and middle column of the output block. So the cross would be 5x5, centered at (i*5, j*5). But how that would fit.\n\nFor example, if the input's (0,1) is 5, then the cross is centered at (0*5, 1*5) = (0,5). The cross would have 5s in the middle row (row 2) and middle column (column 5) of the output block. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure of the exact pattern, but I need to make an educated guess. Let's think about the examples again.\n\nIn Example 3, the input is a diagonal of 5s. The output has vertical lines in the first, middle, and third columns. So perhaps each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line in the output's column j*5. So for input (i,j), the vertical line is in column j*5, and spans the entire height of the output. But that would mean that for each 5 in the input, the output has a vertical line in column j*5. But in Example 3, the input has 5s in (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). So the output has vertical lines in columns 0, 5, 10. But the output's vertical lines are in those columns. For example, in the first column (0), the output has 5s in rows 0-2, then 4-7, etc. So maybe it's not spanning the entire height.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical lines are in columns j*5, and for each row in the output, if the row is in the range i*5 to i*5 +4, then the column j*5 is filled with 5s. So for input (i,j), the vertical line is in column j*5, and spans rows i*5 to i*5 +4. So for example, input (0,0) would have a vertical line in column 0, rows 0-4. Input (1,1) would have a vertical line in column 5, rows 5-9. Input (2,2) would have a vertical line in column 10, rows 10-14. But in the output of Example 3, the first column (column 0) has 5s in rows 0-2, then rows 4-7. That doesn't match. So this idea might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical lines are in columns j*5, and for each row in the output, if the row is in the range i*5 to i*5 +4, then the column j*5 is filled with 5s. But that would mean that in Example 3, the first column (j=0) has 5s in rows 0-4 (i=0), but the output shows that in the first column, rows 0-2 have 5s, and rows 4-7 have 5s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the vertical lines are in columns j*5, and for each row in the output, if the row is in the range i*5 to i*5 +4, then the column j*5 is filled with 5s. But this would mean that the vertical line in column j*5 is 5 rows tall. But in the output of Example 3, the vertical line in column 0 (from input (0,0)) is rows 0-4, but in the output, it's only rows 0-2 and 4-7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the output as being generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a cross that spans the entire output. For example, if the input has a 5 in (i,j), then in the output, there's a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being filled with 5s in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, for each 5 in the input, the output has a horizontal line and vertical line in the middle of the output. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and placing them in the output's grid in a way that forms a cross. For example, the input's 5s are expanded into a cross that is centered at the center of the output. But that would only apply to the input's center cell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and expanding them into a cross that is 5x5 in size, centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). So for example, the input's (0,0) is expanded into a cross centered at (2, 2), which would be a 5x5 cross in the output. But how this would fit into the 15x15 grid.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. I need to find a pattern that works for all three examples.\n\nLet me try to think of the output as a grid where each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line in the output's column j*5, and a horizontal line in the output's row i*5. So for example, in Example 1, the input's (0,1) is 5, so in the output, column 5 (j=1*5=5) has a vertical line, and row 0 (i=0*5=0) has a horizontal line. But in the output, the first row has a 5 in column 7, not 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is in column j*5 + 2, and the horizontal line is in row i*5 + 2. For example, input (0,1) would have a vertical line in column 1*5 + 2 = 7, which matches the first row's 5 in column 7. And a horizontal line in row 0*5 + 2 = 2. So the horizontal line would be row 2. But in the output, the first row has a 5 in column 7, and the second row has 5s in columns 7-9. So that could be the horizontal line in row 2. But this is getting complicated.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each 5 in the input at (i,j), the output has a vertical line in column j*5 + 2, and a horizontal line in row i*5 + 2. But how to determine the exact positions.\n\nSo for example, in Example 1's input, the 5 at (0,1) would have a vertical line in column 1*5 + 2 = 7, and a horizontal line in row 0*5 + 2 = 2. So the vertical line would be column 7, and the horizontal line would be row 2. This would explain the 5 in row 0, column 7 (part of the vertical line), and row 2, columns 7-9 (part of the horizontal line). This seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, the 5 at (1,0) would have a vertical line in column 0*5 + 2 = 2, and a horizontal line in row 1*5 + 2 = 7. So the vertical line is column 2, and the horizontal line is row 7. This would explain the 5s in column 2 in rows 0-4, and row 7 in columns 2-4. But in the output, there are 5s in column 2 in rows 0-4, and row 7 has 5s in columns 2-4. This seems to fit.\n\nThis seems promising. So the pattern is: for each 5 in the input at (i,j), the output has a vertical line in column j*5 + 2, spanning all rows, and a horizontal line in row i*5 + 2, spanning all columns. But wait, that would mean that each 5 in the input adds a vertical and horizontal line in the output. But how?\n\nBut the output is 15x15. So for each 5 in the input, the vertical line is in column j*5 + 2, and the horizontal line is in row i*5 + 2. But the vertical line would be column j*5 + 2, and the horizontal line would be row i*5 + 2. So for example, in Example 1, the input's 5 at (0,1) adds a vertical line in column 7 (1*5+2=7), and a horizontal line in row 2 (0*5+2=2). The vertical line is column 7, and the horizontal line is row 2. But in the output, there are 5s in column 7 for rows 0-4, and in row 2, columns 7-9. This seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, the input's 5 at (1,0) adds a vertical line in column 2 (0*5+2=2), and a horizontal line in row 7 (1*5+2=7). So column 2 has 5s in rows 0-4, and row 7 has 5s in columns 2-4. This fits with the output.\n\nThe input's 5 at (1,1) adds a vertical line in column 7 (1*5+2=7), and a horizontal line in row 7 (1*5+2=7). So the vertical line is column 7, and the horizontal line is row 7. This would explain the 5s in column 7 for rows 0-4, and row 7 for columns 2-4, and also the 5s in row 7, columns 7-9.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the pattern is: for each 5 in the input at (i,j), add a vertical line in column j*5 + 2, and a horizontal line in row i*5 + 2. But wait, how does this work for multiple 5s in the input?\n\nFor example, in Example 3, the input has 5s at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). So for (0,0), vertical line in column 0*5 + 2 = 2, horizontal line in row 0*5 + 2 = 2. For (1,1), vertical line in column 1*5+2=7, horizontal line in row 1*5+2=7. For (2,2), vertical line in column 2*5+2=12, horizontal line in row 2*5+2=12.\n\nSo the vertical lines are in columns 2, 7, 12. The horizontal lines are in rows 2,7,12. This would explain the output of Example 3, where the vertical lines are in columns 2,7,12, and the horizontal lines are in rows 2,7,12. But in the output of Example 3, the first column (column 0) has 5s in rows 0-2, then rows 4-7, etc. Wait, this doesn't fit. So perhaps this is not the correct pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is in column j*5, and the horizontal line is in row i*5. But that doesn't fit the previous examples.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I need to make a decision based on the examples.\n\nLet me try to code this pattern: for each 5 in the input at (i,j), add a vertical line in column j*5 + 2, and a horizontal line in row i*5 + 2. This would create crosses in the output. Let's see if this fits the examples.\n\nFor Example 1:\n\nInput has 5s at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nFor (0,1): vertical line in column 1*5+2=7, horizontal line in row 0*5+2=2.\nFor (1,0): vertical line in 0*5+2=2, horizontal line in 1*5+2=7.\nFor (1,1): vertical line in 1*5+2=7, horizontal line in 1*5+2=7.\nFor (1,2): vertical line in 2*5+2=12, horizontal line in 1*5+2=7.\nFor (2,1): vertical line in 1*5+2=7, horizontal line in 2*5+2=12.\n\nSo the vertical lines are in columns 2,7,12, and the horizontal lines are in rows 2,7,12.\n\nIn the output, the first row has a 5 in column 7 (vertical line from (0,1)). The second row has 5s in columns 7-9 (part of the horizontal line from (1,0) and (1,1)). The third row has 5s in columns 7-9. Row 2 has a horizontal line in row 2, so columns 7-9. Row 7 has a horizontal line in row 7, so columns 2-4 and 7-9. This seems to fit.\n\nSo the output would have 5s in the vertical lines and horizontal lines. So the transformation is: for each 5 in the input, add a vertical line in column j*5+2 and a horizontal line in row i*5+2.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThe plan is:\n\n- For each cell in the input grid:\n   - if the cell is 5, then:\n      - for each row in the output grid, set the cell at column j*5 + 2 to 5.\n      - for each column in the output grid, set the cell at row i*5 + 2 to 5.\n\nBut wait, this would create vertical and horizontal lines. However, this would mean that for each 5 in the input, we add a vertical line and a horizontal line. But in the output, these lines might overlap.\n\nBut this seems to fit the examples.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- Initialize a 15x15 grid filled with 0s.\n- For each i in 0..2 (input rows):\n   - for each j in 0..2 (input columns):\n      - if input[i][j] == 5:\n          - for row in 0..14:\n              - set output[row][j*5 + 2] = 5\n          - for col in 0..14:\n              - set output[i*5 + 2][col] = 5\n\nBut wait, this would create vertical lines for each 5 in the input. For example, in Example 1, the input has 5s in (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). So for each of these, we add a vertical line in column 7, 2, 7, 12, 7. And horizontal lines in row 2, 7, 7, 7, 12.\n\nThis would create vertical lines in columns 2, 7, 12, and horizontal lines in rows 2, 7, 12. This seems to fit the output.\n\nLet's check Example 3's input:\n\nInput is:\n5 0 0\n0 5 0\n0 0 5\n\nSo for (0,0): vertical line in column 0*5 + 2 = 2, horizontal line in row 0*5 + 2 = 2.\nFor (1,1): vertical line in 1*5 +2=7, horizontal line in 1*5 +2=7.\nFor (2,2): vertical line in 2*5+2=12, horizontal line in 2*5+2=12.\n\nSo the vertical lines are in columns 2, 7, 12. The horizontal lines are in rows 2, 7, 12.\n\nIn the output of Example 3, the first column (column 0) has 5s in rows 0-2, then rows 4-7. Wait, but according to this pattern, the vertical lines are in columns 2, 7, 12. So the output would have 5s in column 2, 7, 12, and rows 2, 7, 12. But the output in Example 3 has 5s in columns 0, 5, 10. So this doesn't fit. So perhaps this pattern is not correct.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. But according to the example, the output for Example 3 has 5s in columns 0, 5, 10. Which is j*5 for j=0, 1, 2. So maybe the vertical lines are in columns j*5, not j*5+2.\n\nBut then, for input (0,0), the vertical line would be column 0*5 = 0. And the horizontal line would be row 0*5 = 0. But in the output, the vertical line in column 0 is rows 0-2, and rows 4-7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is in column j*5, and the horizontal line is in row i*5. So for input (0,0), vertical line in column 0, horizontal line in row 0. This would mean that in the output, column 0 has 5s in rows 0-4 (i=0, j=0), and row 0 has 5s in columns 0-4. But in the output of Example 3, the vertical line in column 0 has 5s in rows 0-2, then rows 4-7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that the vertical lines are in j*5 + 2 and horizontal lines in i*5 + 2, even if it doesn't fit all examples perfectly. Or maybe the vertical lines are in j*5, and horizontal in i*5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical lines are in j*5, and the horizontal lines in i*5. Let's see.\n\nFor Example 1's input, the 5 at (0,1) would have vertical line in column 1*5 = 5, and horizontal line in row 0*5=0. So column 5 has 5s in all rows, and row 0 has 5s in all columns. But in the output, the first row has a 5 in column 7, not 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical lines are in j*5 + 2, and horizontal lines in i*5 + 2. This would mean that in Example 3, the vertical lines are in columns 2,7,12, and the horizontal lines in rows 2,7,12. But the output of Example 3 has 5s in columns 0,5,10. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern where each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that spans the output grid. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line in the output's column j*5 and a horizontal line in the output's row i*5. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is filled with 5s in positions where the row and column are multiples of 5, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each 5 in the input, we add a vertical line in column j*5 and a horizontal line in row i*5. So the code would be:\n\nInitialize a 15x15 grid with 0s.\n\nFor each i in 0-2:\n    for each j in 0-2:\n        if input[i][j] == 5:\n            for row in 0-14:\n                output[row][j*5] = 5\n            for col in 0-14:\n                output[i*5][col] = 5\n\nBut in Example 1's input, the 5 at (0,1) would add a vertical line in column 5 (j=1*5=5), and a horizontal line in row 0 (i=0*5=0). So the vertical line in column 5 would have 5s in all rows, and the horizontal line in row 0 would have 5s in all columns. But in the output of Example 1, the first row has a 5 in column 7, not 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps the vertical lines are in j*5 + 2, and the horizontal lines in i*5 + 2.\n\nIn that case, for input (0,1), vertical line in column 1*5 +2 =7, and horizontal line in row 0*5 +2=2. So column 7 has 5s in all rows, and row 2 has 5s in all columns. This would explain the output of Example 1.\n\nIn Example 3, the input's (0,0) would have vertical line in column 0*5 +2 = 2, and horizontal line in row 0*5 +2 = 2. So column 2 has 5s in all rows, and row 2 has 5s in all columns. But the output of Example 3 has 5s in columns 0,5,10, so this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the vertical lines are in j*5, and the horizontal lines in i*5 + 2.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that creates vertical and horizontal lines based on the input's 5s, and see if it fits the examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Vertical line in column j*5 + 2\n                for row in range(15):\n                    output[row][j*5 + 2] = 5\n                # Horizontal line in row i*5 + 2\n                for col in range(15):\n                    output[i*5 + 2][col] = 5\n    return output\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1's input.\n\nInput is:\n0 5 0\n5 5 5\n0 5 0\n\nFor i=0, j=1: grid[0][1] is 5. So vertical line in column 1*5+2=7, and horizontal line in row 0*5+2=2.\n\nSo column 7 is filled with 5s in all rows. Row 2 is filled with 5s in all columns.\n\nFor i=1, j=0: grid[1][0] is 5. Vertical line in column 0*5+2=2, and horizontal line in row 1*5+2=7.\n\nSo column 2 is filled with 5s in all rows. Row 7 is filled with 5s in all columns.\n\nFor i=1, j=1: grid[1][1] is 5. Vertical line in column 1*5+2=7, and horizontal line in row 1*5+2=7.\n\nSo column 7 is filled with 5s (already done), and row 7 is filled with 5s (already done).\n\nFor i=1, j=2: grid[1][2] is 5. Vertical line in column 2*5+2=12, and horizontal line in row 7.\n\nSo column 12 is filled with 5s, and row 7 is filled with 5s.\n\nFor i=2, j=1: grid[2][1] is 5. Vertical line in column 1*5+2=7, and horizontal line in row 2*5+2=12.\n\nSo column 7 is filled with 5s, and row 12 is filled with 5s.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\n- Column 7 filled with 5s (from multiple inputs).\n- Column 2 filled with 5s.\n- Column 12 filled with 5s.\n- Row 2 filled with 5s.\n- Row 7 filled with 5s.\n- Row 12 filled with 5s.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the first row has a 5 in column 7. This would fit. The row 2 has 5s in all columns, which would explain the second row having 5s in columns 7-9. But the output of Example 1 has more 5s in other positions. For example, rows 4-7 have 5s in columns 7-9. So this code might not capture that, but it's a start.\n\nThis seems to be the best hypothesis I can come up with given the time. So the code would be as above.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let's start by analyzing each example.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nThe input is a 3x3 grid. The output is a 15x15 grid. The input has 5s in certain positions, and the output seems to expand those 5s into larger blocks. For instance, the first row of input is 0 5 0. The output's first row is a bunch of 0s except for a single 5 in the 8th position. Then, in the next rows, there are blocks of 5s. It looks like the 5s are being expanded into vertical and horizontal lines, maybe forming a cross or some kind of spread.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is another 3x3 grid. The output again is 15x15. The input has 5s in different positions. The output seems to have 5s spread out in a more complex pattern. For example, the first input row is 0 5 0, and the output starts with a 5 in the 8th position, but then there are more 5s in the next rows. It seems like the 5s are being replicated in a way that creates larger structures.\n\nExample 3's input is a 3x3 grid with 5s on the diagonal. The output is again 15x15. The output here has 5s spread out in a way that seems to form a cross or maybe a diamond shape. For instance, the first few rows have 5s in the first column, then in the middle, and then in the third column. It's possible that the 5s are being expanded into a larger grid based on their positions.\n\nHmm. So the transformation seems to take the input grid's 5s and expand them into certain patterns. But how?\n\nLet me think about the positions. The input is 3x3, and the output is 15x15. Maybe the input is being scaled up. For example, each cell in the input might correspond to a 5x5 block in the output? But that would make 3x3 blocks of 5x5, leading to 15x15. But looking at the outputs, the 5s are spread out in a way that might not be just blocks. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 5 in the center. The output has a vertical line of 5s in the middle columns. Wait, looking at the first output row of Example 1: it's 0s except for the 8th position (which is 5). Then the next rows have 5s in positions 7, 8, 9. So maybe the 5s are being expanded in a way that forms a cross or a line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical and horizontal line in the output. Let's think: the input's 5s are in positions (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). Wait, in Example 1, the input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 0\nRow 1: 5 5 5\nRow 2: 0 5 0\n\nSo the 5s are in positions (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). The output seems to have these 5s expanded into vertical and horizontal lines. For example, the first row of output has a 5 in the 8th column. Then the next rows have 5s in columns 7, 8, 9. Then rows 4-7 have 5s in columns 7-9. Then in row 7, there's a vertical line of 5s. Maybe each 5 in the input is being expanded into a 5x5 block in the output, but that might not fit. Alternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in a way that forms a cross in the output.\n\nAnother approach: the output is 15x15. The input is 3x3. Maybe the input is being scaled by a factor of 5. But that would mean each cell in the input is mapped to a 5x5 block in the output. However, the output seems to have 5s in specific positions, not full blocks. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row has a single 5 in the middle. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being spread out in a certain pattern. For example, each 5 in the input is replicated in a way that creates a cross. For instance, if a cell in the input is 5, then in the output, there's a line of 5s in the middle of the output grid, but that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input, which is:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 0\nRow 1: 0 5 0\nRow 2: 0 0 5\n\nThe output starts with 5s in the first column, then in the middle, then in the third column. So maybe the 5s in the input are being expanded into vertical lines in the output. For example, the 5 in (0,0) becomes a vertical line in the output's first column. Similarly, the 5 in (1,1) becomes a vertical line in the middle, and the 5 in (2,2) becomes a vertical line in the third column. But the output in Example 3 has 5s in the first column, then in the middle, then third. But the output is 15x15. So maybe each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line of 5s in the output's corresponding column.\n\nWait, looking at Example 3's output, the first three rows have 5s in the first column. Then, rows 4-7 have 5s in the middle columns. Then rows 8-11 have 5s in the third column. So maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into vertical lines in the output. For example, the input's 5 in (0,0) becomes a vertical line in the first column, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being placed in the output grid in a way that depends on their positions. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross shape in the output. For example, if a cell in the input is 5, then in the output, there's a cross (horizontal and vertical lines) centered at that cell's position.\n\nBut how to map the input's 3x3 grid to the 15x15 output? Maybe the input is being scaled by 5. For example, each cell in the input corresponds to a 5x5 block in the output. But that would make the output 15x15 (since 3x5=15). However, the output in Example 1 seems to have 5s in specific positions, not full blocks. For example, the first row of the output has a 5 in the middle. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAnother thought: the output seems to have 5s in positions that are symmetrically placed. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are spread out in a way that forms a vertical line in the middle columns. Maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that spans the entire output grid. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being expanded into a diamond shape. For example, the input's 5s are in the center, and the output has a diamond pattern. But again, not sure.\n\nLet me think about the positions. The output grid is 15x15. The input is 3x3. So maybe each cell in the input is mapped to a certain region in the output. For example, the input's cell (i,j) is mapped to a region in the output that is centered at (i*5, j*5). But that would make the output 15x15, as 3*5=15. But then, how would the 5s be placed? For example, in Example 1, the input's (0,1) is 5. So in the output, the region around (0*5, 1*5) = (0,5) would have 5s. But the output's first row has a 5 in column 7. Wait, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is being expanded into the output by replicating each 5 in the input into a cross shape. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a horizontal line and a vertical line in the output. For instance, if the input has a 5 at (i,j), then in the output, there's a horizontal line of 5s in the middle row of the output's corresponding block, and a vertical line in the middle column of the output's corresponding block. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input, which is a diagonal of 5s. The output has 5s in the first column, then middle, then third. So maybe each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line in the output. For example, the 5 in (0,0) becomes a vertical line in the first column of the output. Similarly, the 5 in (1,1) becomes a vertical line in the middle column, and the 5 in (2,2) becomes a vertical line in the third column. But how does that fit with the 15x15 grid?\n\nIf the input is 3x3, then each of the three 5s in the input's diagonal would be mapped to vertical lines in the output's columns 0, 5, 10. Wait, 15 columns. So 0, 5, 10. But in Example 3's output, the first three rows have 5s in the first column (column 0?), then rows 4-7 have 5s in column 5, then rows 8-11 have 5s in column 10. So that seems to fit. But how does that work?\n\nSo the idea is that each 5 in the input's (i,j) is expanded into a vertical line in the output's column j*5. But how? For example, in Example 3, the input's (0,0) is 5. So in the output, column 0 (since 0*5=0) has a vertical line. But in the output, the first three rows have 5s in column 0. Then rows 4-7 have 5s in column 5 (from (1,1)), and rows 8-11 have 5s in column 10 (from (2,2)). That seems to fit. So maybe the transformation is that each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line in the output's column j*5, and the vertical line spans from row i*5 to row i*5 + 4 (since 5 rows per block). But that would make the vertical line in the output's column j*5, spanning rows i*5 to i*5 +4. Wait, but the output is 15x15. For example, for i=0, j=0: column 0, rows 0-4. Then i=1, j=1: column 5, rows 5-9. Then i=2, j=2: column 10, rows 10-14. That would fit the example.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output, the first three rows (rows 0-2) have 5s in column 0. Then rows 3-6 have 5s in column 5. Then rows 7-10 have 5s in column 10. Wait, but in the output, the first three rows have 5s in column 0, then rows 4-7 have 5s in column 5. So that's not exactly matching. Maybe the vertical lines are spread out in a way that depends on the input's i and j.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line in the output's column j*5, and the vertical line spans the entire height of the output. But that would be 15 rows. But in Example 3's output, the first column has 5s in rows 0-2, then rows 4-7, etc. That doesn't fit. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical lines are centered. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line in the output's column j*5, but the line is 5 rows tall. So for input (i,j), the vertical line is in column j*5, and spans rows i*5 to i*5 +4. That would make sense. For example, in Example 3, the input (0,0) would be column 0, rows 0-4. But in the output, the first column (column 0) has 5s in rows 0-2, then rows 4-7. Hmm, that doesn't match. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are spread out in a way that depends on their position in the input. For example, the input's 5s are expanded into a cross shape in the output. For example, if a cell in the input is 5, then in the output, there's a horizontal line and vertical line centered at (i*5, j*5). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are expanded into a cross shape in the output. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that is 5x5 in the output. But how to map that.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being divided into 3x3 blocks of 5x5. Each block corresponds to a cell in the input. For example, the input's (i,j) corresponds to the block in the output starting at (i*5, j*5). Then, if the input cell is 5, then the entire block is filled with 5s. But looking at Example 1's output, that doesn't seem to be the case. For example, the first block (i=0, j=0) would be a 5x5 block of 5s. But in the output, the first row of the output has a 5 in the 8th column (column 7?), which is part of the block (i=0, j=1). So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are expanded into a cross that spans the entire output. For example, if the input has a 5 in (i,j), then in the output, the cross is centered at (i*5, j*5). But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are expanded into a line that spans the entire output. For example, if the input has a 5 in the center, then the output has a vertical line in the middle of the output.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output, the first row has a 5 in column 7 (assuming 0-based indexing). Then the next rows have 5s in columns 7-9. Then in rows 4-7, columns 7-9. Then in row 7, columns 7-9 are all 5s. Then row 8 has a 5 in column 7. So maybe the 5s are forming a vertical line in the middle of the output. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nThe input for Example 1 has a 5 in the center (row 1, column 1). So maybe that's the center of the vertical line. The vertical line is in the middle of the output, which is column 7 (since 15 columns, middle is 7). So that fits. Then, the vertical line is 5 rows tall. But in the output, the vertical line is in columns 7-9. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are expanded into a cross that is 5x5 in the output. For example, if the input has a 5 in (i,j), then the output has a cross centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). But that's just a guess.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to think of another approach. Maybe the output grid is generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a certain pattern. For example, in the output, the 5s are placed in positions that are symmetrically around the input's 5s.\n\nAnother idea: the output is created by taking the input's 5s and expanding them into a cross shape. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a horizontal and vertical line in the output. For example, if the input has a 5 at (i,j), then in the output, there's a horizontal line of 5s in the row corresponding to i*5 + 2, and a vertical line of 5s in the column corresponding to j*5 + 2. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are expanded into a diamond shape. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a diamond pattern in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being filled with 5s in positions that are determined by the input. For example, in the output, the 5s are placed in positions where the row and column are multiples of 5, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, the 5s are placed in positions that are symmetric around the center of the output. For example, in Example 1, the 5s are in the middle columns. So maybe the input's 5s are expanded into the middle of the output.\n\nBut how to map the input to the output.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the 5s in the output and see if they can be related to the input.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the first row has a 5 in column 7 (assuming 0-based indexing). The input's first row has a 5 in column 1. So 1*5 + 2 = 7? Maybe. Then, the next row has 5s in columns 7-9. So that's the same column as before. Then rows 4-7 have 5s in columns 7-9. So that's a vertical line of 5s in the middle of the output. So maybe each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line in the output's middle column.\n\nBut how does that relate to the input's position? For example, the input's 5 in (0,1) is expanded into a vertical line in column 7. But 1*5 + 2 = 7. So that's possible. Then, the input's 5 in (1,0) is expanded into a vertical line in column 7 (since 0*5 + 2=2? No, that doesn't fit). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's 5s are expanded into a cross shape that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). For example, the input's (0,1) is expanded into a cross centered at (2, 7). Then, the cross would have 5s in the middle row and middle column of the output. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are expanded into a cross that spans the entire output. For example, if the input has a 5 in the center, then the output has a vertical line in the middle column and a horizontal line in the middle row.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input has a 5 in the center (row 1, column 1). The output has a vertical line in column 7 (middle of 15 columns) and a horizontal line in row 7 (middle of 15 rows). So that fits. So perhaps the transformation is that each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, the input's 5s are expanded into a cross that is centered at (i*5, j*5). But that would make the cross in the middle of each block.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try to think of the output for Example 1. The first row has a 5 in column 7. That's the middle column. So maybe the 5s in the input are expanded into the middle of the output. For example, the input's 5 in (0,1) is expanded into the middle column of the output. Then, the input's 5 in (1,0) is expanded into the middle row of the output. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is created by taking the input's 5s and expanding them into a cross that spans the entire output. For example, if the input has a 5 in the center, then the output has a cross that is in the middle of the output. But how to handle multiple 5s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is filled with 5s in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, for each 5 in the input, we add a line of 5s in the output in certain positions.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output.\n\nAnother idea: the output is created by expanding each 5 in the input into a 5x5 block in the output. But how?\n\nIn Example 1, the input is 3x3. If each 5 is expanded into a 5x5 block, then the output would be 3x5=15x15. But the output in Example 1 has 5s in specific positions, not full blocks. For example, the first row has a single 5 in the middle. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are expanded into a cross that is 5x5 in the output. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). So the cross would have 5s in the middle row and middle column of the output block. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being built by taking the input's 5s and placing them in the output's grid in a way that forms a cross. For example, if the input has a 5 in (i,j), then in the output, the cross is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). Then, the cross would have 5s in the middle row and middle column of the output block.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the output as a grid where the 5s are placed in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, for each 5 in the input, we add a vertical line in the output's column j*5, and a horizontal line in the output's row i*5.\n\nBut how to determine the exact positions.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being divided into 3x3 blocks of 5x5. Each block corresponds to a cell in the input. If the input cell is 5, then the entire block is filled with 5s. But in Example 1, the input has a 5 in (0,1), so the block (0,1) would be filled with 5s. However, the output's first row has a single 5 in column 7, which is part of the block (0,1). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that is centered at (i*5, j*5). For example, in the output, the cross would have 5s in the middle row and middle column of the output block. So the cross would be 5x5, centered at (i*5, j*5). But how that would fit.\n\nFor example, if the input's (0,1) is 5, then the cross is centered at (0*5, 1*5) = (0,5). The cross would have 5s in the middle row (row 2) and middle column (column 5) of the output block. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure of the exact pattern, but I need to make an educated guess. Let's think about the examples again.\n\nIn Example 3, the input is a diagonal of 5s. The output has vertical lines in the first, middle, and third columns. So perhaps each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line in the output's column j*5. So for input (i,j), the vertical line is in column j*5, and spans the entire height of the output. But that would mean that for each 5 in the input, the output has a vertical line in column j*5. But in Example 3, the input has 5s in (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). So the output has vertical lines in columns 0, 5, 10. But the output's vertical lines are in those columns. For example, in the first column (0), the output has 5s in rows 0-2, then 4-7, etc. So maybe it's not spanning the entire height.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical lines are in columns j*5, and for each row in the output, if the row is in the range i*5 to i*5 +4, then the column j*5 is filled with 5s. So for input (i,j), the vertical line is in column j*5, and spans rows i*5 to i*5 +4. So for example, input (0,0) would have a vertical line in column 0, rows 0-4. Input (1,1) would have a vertical line in column 5, rows 5-9. Input (2,2) would have a vertical line in column 10, rows 10-14. But in the output of Example 3, the first column (column 0) has 5s in rows 0-2, then rows 4-7. That doesn't match. So this idea might not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical lines are in columns j*5, and for each row in the output, if the row is in the range i*5 to i*5 +4, then the column j*5 is filled with 5s. But that would mean that in Example 3, the first column (j=0) has 5s in rows 0-4 (i=0), but the output shows that in the first column, rows 0-2 have 5s, and rows 4-7 have 5s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the vertical lines are in columns j*5, and for each row in the output, if the row is in the range i*5 to i*5 +4, then the column j*5 is filled with 5s. But this would mean that the vertical line in column j*5 is 5 rows tall. But in the output of Example 3, the vertical line in column 0 (from input (0,0)) is rows 0-4, but in the output, it's only rows 0-2 and 4-7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the output as being generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a cross that spans the entire output. For example, if the input has a 5 in (i,j), then in the output, there's a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being filled with 5s in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, for each 5 in the input, the output has a horizontal line and vertical line in the middle of the output. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and placing them in the output's grid in a way that forms a cross. For example, the input's 5s are expanded into a cross that is centered at the center of the output. But that would only apply to the input's center cell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and expanding them into a cross that is 5x5 in size, centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). So for example, the input's (0,0) is expanded into a cross centered at (2, 2), which would be a 5x5 cross in the output. But how this would fit into the 15x15 grid.\n\nBut this is getting too speculative. I need to find a pattern that works for all three examples.\n\nLet me try to think of the output as a grid where each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line in the output's column j*5, and a horizontal line in the output's row i*5. So for example, in Example 1, the input's (0,1) is 5, so in the output, column 5 (j=1*5=5) has a vertical line, and row 0 (i=0*5=0) has a horizontal line. But in the output, the first row has a 5 in column 7, not 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is in column j*5 + 2, and the horizontal line is in row i*5 + 2. For example, input (0,1) would have a vertical line in column 1*5 + 2 = 7, which matches the first row's 5 in column 7. And a horizontal line in row 0*5 + 2 = 2. So the horizontal line would be row 2. But in the output, the first row has a 5 in column 7, and the second row has 5s in columns 7-9. So that could be the horizontal line in row 2. But this is getting complicated.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each 5 in the input at (i,j), the output has a vertical line in column j*5 + 2, and a horizontal line in row i*5 + 2. But how to determine the exact positions.\n\nSo for example, in Example 1's input, the 5 at (0,1) would have a vertical line in column 1*5 + 2 = 7, and a horizontal line in row 0*5 + 2 = 2. So the vertical line would be column 7, and the horizontal line would be row 2. This would explain the 5 in row 0, column 7 (part of the vertical line), and row 2, columns 7-9 (part of the horizontal line). This seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, the 5 at (1,0) would have a vertical line in column 0*5 + 2 = 2, and a horizontal line in row 1*5 + 2 = 7. So the vertical line is column 2, and the horizontal line is row 7. This would explain the 5s in column 2 in rows 0-4, and row 7 in columns 2-4. But in the output, there are 5s in column 2 in rows 0-4, and row 7 has 5s in columns 2-4. This seems to fit.\n\nThis seems promising. So the pattern is: for each 5 in the input at (i,j), the output has a vertical line in column j*5 + 2, spanning all rows, and a horizontal line in row i*5 + 2, spanning all columns. But wait, that would mean that each 5 in the input adds a vertical and horizontal line in the output. But how?\n\nBut the output is 15x15. So for each 5 in the input, the vertical line is in column j*5 + 2, and the horizontal line is in row i*5 + 2. But the vertical line would be column j*5 + 2, and the horizontal line would be row i*5 + 2. So for example, in Example 1, the input's 5 at (0,1) adds a vertical line in column 7 (1*5+2=7), and a horizontal line in row 2 (0*5+2=2). The vertical line is column 7, and the horizontal line is row 2. But in the output, there are 5s in column 7 for rows 0-4, and in row 2, columns 7-9. This seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly, the input's 5 at (1,0) adds a vertical line in column 2 (0*5+2=2), and a horizontal line in row 7 (1*5+2=7). So column 2 has 5s in rows 0-4, and row 7 has 5s in columns 2-4. This fits with the output.\n\nThe input's 5 at (1,1) adds a vertical line in column 7 (1*5+2=7), and a horizontal line in row 7 (1*5+2=7). So the vertical line is column 7, and the horizontal line is row 7. This would explain the 5s in column 7 for rows 0-4, and row 7 for columns 2-4, and also the 5s in row 7, columns 7-9.\n\nThis seems to fit. So the pattern is: for each 5 in the input at (i,j), add a vertical line in column j*5 + 2, and a horizontal line in row i*5 + 2. But wait, how does this work for multiple 5s in the input?\n\nFor example, in Example 3, the input has 5s at (0,0), (1,1), (2,2). So for (0,0), vertical line in column 0*5 + 2 = 2, horizontal line in row 0*5 + 2 = 2. For (1,1), vertical line in column 1*5+2=7, horizontal line in row 1*5+2=7. For (2,2), vertical line in column 2*5+2=12, horizontal line in row 2*5+2=12.\n\nSo the vertical lines are in columns 2, 7, 12. The horizontal lines are in rows 2,7,12. This would explain the output of Example 3, where the vertical lines are in columns 2,7,12, and the horizontal lines are in rows 2,7,12. But in the output of Example 3, the first column (column 0) has 5s in rows 0-2, then rows 4-7, etc. Wait, this doesn't fit. So perhaps this is not the correct pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is in column j*5, and the horizontal line is in row i*5. But that doesn't fit the previous examples.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I need to make a decision based on the examples.\n\nLet me try to code this pattern: for each 5 in the input at (i,j), add a vertical line in column j*5 + 2, and a horizontal line in row i*5 + 2. This would create crosses in the output. Let's see if this fits the examples.\n\nFor Example 1:\n\nInput has 5s at (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1).\n\nFor (0,1): vertical line in column 1*5+2=7, horizontal line in row 0*5+2=2.\nFor (1,0): vertical line in 0*5+2=2, horizontal line in 1*5+2=7.\nFor (1,1): vertical line in 1*5+2=7, horizontal line in 1*5+2=7.\nFor (1,2): vertical line in 2*5+2=12, horizontal line in 1*5+2=7.\nFor (2,1): vertical line in 1*5+2=7, horizontal line in 2*5+2=12.\n\nSo the vertical lines are in columns 2,7,12, and the horizontal lines are in rows 2,7,12.\n\nIn the output, the first row has a 5 in column 7 (vertical line from (0,1)). The second row has 5s in columns 7-9 (part of the horizontal line from (1,0) and (1,1)). The third row has 5s in columns 7-9. Row 2 has a horizontal line in row 2, so columns 7-9. Row 7 has a horizontal line in row 7, so columns 2-4 and 7-9. This seems to fit.\n\nSo the output would have 5s in the vertical lines and horizontal lines. So the transformation is: for each 5 in the input, add a vertical line in column j*5+2 and a horizontal line in row i*5+2.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThe plan is:\n\n- For each cell in the input grid:\n   - if the cell is 5, then:\n      - for each row in the output grid, set the cell at column j*5 + 2 to 5.\n      - for each column in the output grid, set the cell at row i*5 + 2 to 5.\n\nBut wait, this would create vertical and horizontal lines. However, this would mean that for each 5 in the input, we add a vertical line and a horizontal line. But in the output, these lines might overlap.\n\nBut this seems to fit the examples.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- Initialize a 15x15 grid filled with 0s.\n- For each i in 0..2 (input rows):\n   - for each j in 0..2 (input columns):\n      - if input[i][j] == 5:\n          - for row in 0..14:\n              - set output[row][j*5 + 2] = 5\n          - for col in 0..14:\n              - set output[i*5 + 2][col] = 5\n\nBut wait, this would create vertical lines for each 5 in the input. For example, in Example 1, the input has 5s in (0,1), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1). So for each of these, we add a vertical line in column 7, 2, 7, 12, 7. And horizontal lines in row 2, 7, 7, 7, 12.\n\nThis would create vertical lines in columns 2, 7, 12, and horizontal lines in rows 2, 7, 12. This seems to fit the output.\n\nLet's check Example 3's input:\n\nInput is:\n5 0 0\n0 5 0\n0 0 5\n\nSo for (0,0): vertical line in column 0*5 + 2 = 2, horizontal line in row 0*5 + 2 = 2.\nFor (1,1): vertical line in 1*5 +2=7, horizontal line in 1*5 +2=7.\nFor (2,2): vertical line in 2*5+2=12, horizontal line in 2*5+2=12.\n\nSo the vertical lines are in columns 2, 7, 12. The horizontal lines are in rows 2, 7, 12.\n\nIn the output of Example 3, the first column (column 0) has 5s in rows 0-2, then rows 4-7. Wait, but according to this pattern, the vertical lines are in columns 2, 7, 12. So the output would have 5s in column 2, 7, 12, and rows 2, 7, 12. But the output in Example 3 has 5s in columns 0, 5, 10. So this doesn't fit. So perhaps this pattern is not correct.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. But according to the example, the output for Example 3 has 5s in columns 0, 5, 10. Which is j*5 for j=0, 1, 2. So maybe the vertical lines are in columns j*5, not j*5+2.\n\nBut then, for input (0,0), the vertical line would be column 0*5 = 0. And the horizontal line would be row 0*5 = 0. But in the output, the vertical line in column 0 is rows 0-2, and rows 4-7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is in column j*5, and the horizontal line is in row i*5. So for input (0,0), vertical line in column 0, horizontal line in row 0. This would mean that in the output, column 0 has 5s in rows 0-4 (i=0, j=0), and row 0 has 5s in columns 0-4. But in the output of Example 3, the vertical line in column 0 has 5s in rows 0-2, then rows 4-7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that the vertical lines are in j*5 + 2 and horizontal lines in i*5 + 2, even if it doesn't fit all examples perfectly. Or maybe the vertical lines are in j*5, and horizontal in i*5.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical lines are in j*5, and the horizontal lines in i*5. Let's see.\n\nFor Example 1's input, the 5 at (0,1) would have vertical line in column 1*5 = 5, and horizontal line in row 0*5=0. So column 5 has 5s in all rows, and row 0 has 5s in all columns. But in the output, the first row has a 5 in column 7, not 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical lines are in j*5 + 2, and horizontal lines in i*5 + 2. This would mean that in Example 3, the vertical lines are in columns 2,7,12, and the horizontal lines in rows 2,7,12. But the output of Example 3 has 5s in columns 0,5,10. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern where each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that spans the output grid. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a vertical line in the output's column j*5 and a horizontal line in the output's row i*5. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is filled with 5s in positions where the row and column are multiples of 5, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each 5 in the input, we add a vertical line in column j*5 and a horizontal line in row i*5. So the code would be:\n\nInitialize a 15x15 grid with 0s.\n\nFor each i in 0-2:\n    for each j in 0-2:\n        if input[i][j] == 5:\n            for row in 0-14:\n                output[row][j*5] = 5\n            for col in 0-14:\n                output[i*5][col] = 5\n\nBut in Example 1's input, the 5 at (0,1) would add a vertical line in column 5 (j=1*5=5), and a horizontal line in row 0 (i=0*5=0). So the vertical line in column 5 would have 5s in all rows, and the horizontal line in row 0 would have 5s in all columns. But in the output of Example 1, the first row has a 5 in column 7, not 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps the vertical lines are in j*5 + 2, and the horizontal lines in i*5 + 2.\n\nIn that case, for input (0,1), vertical line in column 1*5 +2 =7, and horizontal line in row 0*5 +2=2. So column 7 has 5s in all rows, and row 2 has 5s in all columns. This would explain the output of Example 1.\n\nIn Example 3, the input's (0,0) would have vertical line in column 0*5 +2 = 2, and horizontal line in row 0*5 +2 = 2. So column 2 has 5s in all rows, and row 2 has 5s in all columns. But the output of Example 3 has 5s in columns 0,5,10, so this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the vertical lines are in j*5, and the horizontal lines in i*5 + 2.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that creates vertical and horizontal lines based on the input's 5s, and see if it fits the examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Vertical line in column j*5 + 2\n                for row in range(15):\n                    output[row][j*5 + 2] = 5\n                # Horizontal line in row i*5 + 2\n                for col in range(15):\n                    output[i*5 + 2][col] = 5\n    return output\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1's input.\n\nInput is:\n0 5 0\n5 5 5\n0 5 0\n\nFor i=0, j=1: grid[0][1] is 5. So vertical line in column 1*5+2=7, and horizontal line in row 0*5+2=2.\n\nSo column 7 is filled with 5s in all rows. Row 2 is filled with 5s in all columns.\n\nFor i=1, j=0: grid[1][0] is 5. Vertical line in column 0*5+2=2, and horizontal line in row 1*5+2=7.\n\nSo column 2 is filled with 5s in all rows. Row 7 is filled with 5s in all columns.\n\nFor i=1, j=1: grid[1][1] is 5. Vertical line in column 1*5+2=7, and horizontal line in row 1*5+2=7.\n\nSo column 7 is filled with 5s (already done), and row 7 is filled with 5s (already done).\n\nFor i=1, j=2: grid[1][2] is 5. Vertical line in column 2*5+2=12, and horizontal line in row 7.\n\nSo column 12 is filled with 5s, and row 7 is filled with 5s.\n\nFor i=2, j=1: grid[2][1] is 5. Vertical line in column 1*5+2=7, and horizontal line in row 2*5+2=12.\n\nSo column 7 is filled with 5s, and row 12 is filled with 5s.\n\nSo the output would have:\n\n- Column 7 filled with 5s (from multiple inputs).\n- Column 2 filled with 5s.\n- Column 12 filled with 5s.\n- Row 2 filled with 5s.\n- Row 7 filled with 5s.\n- Row 12 filled with 5s.\n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the first row has a 5 in column 7. This would fit. The row 2 has 5s in all columns, which would explain the second row having 5s in columns 7-9. But the output of Example 1 has more 5s in other positions. For example, rows 4-7 have 5s in columns 7-9. So this code might not capture that, but it's a start.\n\nThis seems to be the best hypothesis I can come up with given the time. So the code would be as above.\n"
