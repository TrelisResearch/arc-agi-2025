In both examples, the values in the input grid are being copied or extended to adjacent cells in a way that creates a sort of \"spread\" or \"influence\" pattern.\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that:\n1. Values in certain positions (like the 8s and 9s) are being copied to adjacent cells.\n2. The transformation seems to involve propagating values to neighboring cells in a specific pattern.\n3. The transformation is not simply a direct copy but involves some kind of spread or influence.\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that propagates values from certain positions to neighboring cells in a specific pattern.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is not zero, propagate its value to neighboring cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Propagate to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)\n                if i > 0 and transformed_grid[i-1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j] = grid[i][j]\n                if i < 9 and transformed_grid[i+1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = grid[i][j]\n                if j > 0 and transformed_grid[i][j-1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j-1] = grid[i][j]\n                if j < 9 and transformed_grid[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell is not zero, propagate its value to neighboring cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Propagate to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)\n                if i > 0 and transformed_grid[i-1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j] = grid[i][j]\n                if i < 9 and transformed_grid[i+1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = grid[i][j]\n                if j > 0 and transformed_grid[i][j-1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j-1] = grid[i][j]\n                if j < 9 and transformed_grid[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
