          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some 2s, 8s, and 3s in certain positions. The output has 8s and 0s in a sort of diamond or cross shape. For instance, in the input, there's a 2 in position (3,4) and 8 in (3,5), but the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. Wait, maybe the output is expanding the 8s in some way. Let me check more carefully.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 8s are in positions (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), etc. Wait, maybe the output is creating a pattern where the 8s are spread out in a certain way. Let me look at the output for Example 1. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross shape. Like, in the fourth row, there's an 8 in column 4 and 6, then in the fifth row, 8s in columns 4 and 6 again, but maybe that's not the case. Wait, the output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 ... \nRow 4: 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 8 ...\nRow 5: same as row 4?\nRow 6: same as row 3?\nSo maybe there's a pattern where the 8s are forming a diamond shape, expanding outward from the original positions. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input: there's a 2 in (5,4), 8s in (5,5), (5,6), etc. The output has a more complex pattern. For instance, in the output, there's a 8 in (4,4), then a cross of 8s in the middle. Maybe the transformation is about expanding certain numbers into a cross or diamond shape, but how?\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 2, 8, and 3 in certain positions. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross, but maybe the 3 is replaced by something? Wait, the output for Example 3 has 8s in positions that form a cross, but maybe the 3 is part of a pattern that's being replaced. Wait, the input in Example 3 has a 3 in position (9,5), but the output has 0s there. Hmm, maybe not. Let me check the input and output for Example 3.\n\nInput for Example 3:\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 8 8 3 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput for Example 3:\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in the input, there's a 3 in position (9,5), but in the output, that position is 0. However, the surrounding positions have 8s. So maybe the transformation is that whenever there's a certain number (like 2, 8, 3?), they are replaced by 8s in a cross or diamond pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain positions are converted to 8s based on their distance from certain points. For example, in Example 1, the original 8s are in positions (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), etc. But the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. Wait, maybe the 8s in the input are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in positions (4,5) and (5,5), and the output has 8s in positions (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), etc. So maybe the transformation is that for each 8 in the input, it's creating a cross shape around it, expanding outward.\n\nBut how to model that? Maybe the 8s in the input are the centers of cross shapes, and the output is filled with 8s in positions that are at a certain distance from those centers. For example, in Example 1, the original 8s are in positions (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), etc. Wait, looking at the input of Example 1:\n\nInput row 3 (index 3) has 0s except for position (3,4) which is 2 and (3,5) is 8. Then row 4 has 0s except for (4,4) which is 2, (4,5) is 8, (4,6) is 2. Wait, maybe not. Let me check the input for Example 1 again.\n\nWait, the input for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 2 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 8 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 2 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in row 3, column 4 is 2, column 5 is 8, column 6 is 2. Then row 4, column 4 is 8, column 5 is 3, column 6 is 8. Then row 5 is similar to row 3.\n\nIn the output of Example 1, the 8s are in positions that form a cross. For example, row 3 has 8 in column 5. Then row 4 has 8s in columns 4, 6. Row 5 has 8 in column 5 again. So maybe the output is expanding the 8s into a cross shape. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are being converted into a cross shape. For example, in the input, there's an 8 in (3,5), and in the output, that's part of a cross. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell with a value of 2 or 8 in the input is replaced by 8 in the output, but that doesn't fit with the examples. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 3 in position (9,5), and the output has 0 there. But in Example 1, the input has 2s and 8s, and the output has 8s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original 8s. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in positions (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. Then the output has 8s in positions that are adjacent to these points. But how to model that.\n\nAnother approach: look for symmetry. For example, in Example 1, the output has a cross shape. Maybe the output is a cross centered at certain points. For instance, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that form a cross centered at (4,5) and (5,5). But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the 8s in the input into a diamond shape. For example, each 8 in the input is converted into a diamond pattern of 8s. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has 8s in positions (4,6), (5,6), etc. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross. For example, in the output, row 4 has 8s in column 4 and 6. Row 5 has 8s in columns 4, 5, 6. Maybe the pattern is that the 8s in the input are being expanded into a cross shape, where each 8 in the input is the center of a cross, and the output has 8s in positions that are adjacent to that center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input that is not zero, the output is filled with 8s in a certain pattern. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by replacing certain positions with 8s based on the original positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in positions that are in the middle of the grid. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross. Maybe the cross is formed by expanding the original 8s into a cross shape, where each 8 in the input is the center of a cross. For example, if there's an 8 in (row, col), then the output has 8s in (row-1, col), (row+1, col), (row, col-1), (row, col+1), etc.\n\nBut how to model that. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in positions (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. Then, the output has 8s in positions that are adjacent to those. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a cross shape where the center is the original 8s. For example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are one step away in all four directions. But then, overlapping would occur.\n\nBut how to code that. For example, for each cell (i,j) in the input that is not zero, we set the output cell (i,j) to 8, and also set cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) to 8. But that might not explain the examples.\n\nLet me check Example 1. Suppose the input has 8s in (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. Then, the output would have 8s in those positions and their neighbors. But in the output, there are 8s in positions (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), etc. Which seems to form a cross shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the original 8s into a diamond shape. For example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are at a Manhattan distance of 1 from the original position. But that would create a cross shape.\n\nBut how to code that. For each cell in the input that is not zero, we check if the cell is part of a cross. But how to determine which cells to mark as 8s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross centered at certain points. For example, in Example 1, the original 8s are in positions that form a vertical line, and the output is a cross that expands from those positions.\n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract. Maybe I should look for patterns in the outputs. For example, in Example 1's output, the 8s are in positions that form a cross. The cross is centered around the middle of the grid. For example, the output has 8s in positions (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), etc. So it's a cross that is 3 cells wide in the vertical and horizontal directions.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by creating a cross shape where the center is the original 8s. For example, in Example 1, the original 8s are in positions (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross around those points.\n\nBut how to code that. Maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input that is not zero, we set the output cell to 8, and also set the cells directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to 8. But that would create a cross around each original 8. However, overlapping would occur, but perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nBut let's test this idea with Example 1. The input has 8s in (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. So for each of these positions, we would set the output to 8 and their adjacent cells. But in the output, the 8s are spread out in a cross shape. However, this might not account for all the 8s in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a cross shape that is 3 cells wide in each direction. For example, for each original 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are 1 cell away in all directions. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 3. The input has a 3 in position (9,5), and the output has 0 there. However, the surrounding cells have 8s. So maybe the 3 is being replaced by 0, but the 8s are being expanded. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is not zero in the input is converted to 8 in the output, but that's not possible because in Example 3, the output has 0s where there was a 3. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original 8s. For example, in Example 1, the original 8s are in positions (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. The output has 8s in positions that are adjacent to those. So, for example, the original 8 at (3,5) would generate 8s at (3,4), (3,6), (4,5), (2,5), etc. But this seems to be the case in the output.\n\nBut how to implement this. Maybe the output is generated by creating a cross around each original 8. For example, for each original 8 in the input, we mark the cell and its four adjacent cells as 8 in the output. But this would create overlapping regions. However, in Example 1, the output seems to have 8s in positions that are part of a cross.\n\nBut let's think of it as follows: for each cell in the input that is not zero, we set the output cell to 8, and also set the cells directly above, below, left, and right to 8. However, this would create a cross around each original 8. But in the output of Example 1, the 8s are spread out in a cross shape, which suggests that this is the case.\n\nBut then, in Example 1's input, there are multiple 8s. For example, in row 3, there's an 8 at (3,5). Then, the output would have 8s at (3,5), (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), (4,5). Similarly, for the 8 at (4,5), the output would have 8s at (4,5), (3,5), (5,5), (4,4), (4,6). But this would create overlapping 8s. However, the output of Example 1 has 8s in positions that form a cross, which would be the case if we do this.\n\nBut wait, in the output of Example 1, there are 8s in positions (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), etc. So this seems to be the case. So the transformation is that for each original 8 in the input, we set the output to 8 and the adjacent cells. However, this would create overlapping regions, but the output seems to have that.\n\nBut then, what about cells that are not 8 in the input? For example, in Example 3's input, there's a 3 in (9,5). According to this logic, since it's not 8, it would remain 0. But in the output of Example 3, that cell is 0, which matches. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut let's test this idea against the examples.\n\nExample 1's input has 8s in positions (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. According to the logic, each of these would generate 8s in their adjacent cells. So the output would have 8s in those positions. But the output of Example 1 has 8s in positions that form a cross. So this seems to fit.\n\nExample 2's input has 8s in positions (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), etc. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross. So this would fit.\n\nExample 3's input has 8s in positions (6,5), (7,4-7), etc. The output has 8s in those positions and their adjacent cells. But in the output of Example 3, the 8s are in positions that form a cross.\n\nBut what about the 3 in Example 3's input? It's not 8, so it remains 0 in the output, which matches.\n\nSo this seems to be a possible pattern. The transformation is: for each cell in the input that is not zero, set the output cell to 8, and also set the cells directly above, below, left, and right to 8. However, if the cell is at the edge of the grid, then the adjacent cells are not set (e.g., for a cell in the top row, there is no cell above it).\n\nBut wait, in the output of Example 1, the 8s are in positions that are part of a cross. So for each original 8, we set the output cell and its four adjacent cells. However, this might not be the case. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. Let's see:\n\nFor the 8 at (3,5), the adjacent cells would be (2,5), (4,5), (3,4), (3,6). So in the output, these would be 8s.\n\nFor the 8 at (4,5), the adjacent cells are (3,5), (5,5), (4,4), (4,6). So those would be 8s.\n\nFor the 8 at (5,5), adjacent cells are (4,5), (6,5), (5,4), (5,6).\n\nFor the 8 at (4,6), adjacent cells are (3,6), (5,6), (4,5), (4,7).\n\nBut this would create a cross shape. So the output would have 8s in positions that are part of a cross.\n\nBut then, what about the 3 in Example 3's input? It's not 8, so it's not part of the transformation, and remains 0. Which matches the output.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3's input, there is a 3 in position (9,5). The output for that position is 0, which is correct. However, the surrounding cells have 8s. For example, in the output of Example 3, the cell (9,5) is 0, but cells (9,4), (9,6), (8,5), (10,5) are 0. But in the input, there are 8s in (8,4-7), (9,4-7), etc. So perhaps the transformation is that any cell in the input that is not zero is converted to 8 in the output, and also their adjacent cells are set to 8. However, the 3 is not zero, but it's not converted to 8. Wait, no. The input is 3, which is not zero. So according to the previous idea, the output cell would be 8. But in the output of Example 3, the cell (9,5) is 0. So that contradicts the idea.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the previous idea is incorrect. So what's wrong here?\n\nIn Example 3's input, the cell (9,5) is 3. According to the previous idea, since it's not 8, it would remain 0. But in the output, it's 0. So that's okay. But why is the 3 not converted to 8? Because the transformation is only for cells that are 8 in the input. So that would be correct. But why is the 3 in the input not converted to 8? Because the transformation is only for cells that are 8 in the input. So that's okay.\n\nBut wait, in the output of Example 3, the cell (9,5) is 0. However, the input has a 3 in that position. So the transformation is not converting 3 to 8. So the previous idea is that only cells with value 8 in the input are converted to 8 in the output, and their adjacent cells are also set to 8. But that would mean that the 3 in the input is not processed. So that's correct.\n\nBut then, why in the output of Example 3, the cells around the 3 are 8s? Because the input has 8s in those positions. For example, in the input, row 8 (index 8) has 8s in columns 4-7. So those cells are processed, and their adjacent cells are set to 8. So the cell (9,5) is not part of any 8 in the input, so it remains 0. But the cell (9,5) is adjacent to (8,5), which is 8 in the input. So according to the previous idea, (8,5) would be processed, and (9,5) would be set to 8. But in the output of Example 3, (9,5) is 0. So that contradicts the idea.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me look at the input and output of Example 3 again.\n\nInput for Example 3:\n\nRow 7 (index 7) is 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8 (index 8) is 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9 (index 9) is 0 0 8 8 3 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in row 8, column 5 is 0. But in row 9, column 5 is 3. So for the cell (8,5) in the input, it's 0. So it's not processed. However, the cell (8,4) is 8. So according to the previous idea, the cell (8,4) is processed. So the output for (8,4) would be 8, and its adjacent cells would be set to 8. The adjacent cells of (8,4) are (7,4), (9,4), (8,3), (8,5). So in the output, those cells would be 8. But in the output of Example 3, row 9, column 4 is 8 (from the output given). However, the cell (9,5) is 0. So that's a problem.\n\nSo according to the previous idea, the cell (8,4) would set (9,4) to 8. But the cell (9,5) is not adjacent to (8,4). The adjacent cells of (8,4) are (7,4), (9,4), (8,3), (8,5). So (9,5) is not adjacent to (8,4). So why is (9,5) 0 in the output?\n\nThis suggests that the previous idea is not correct. So what's the correct pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input that is not zero, we set the output cell to 8 if it's part of a certain pattern. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the 8s are in positions that form a cross. In Example 2's output, the 8s form a more complex cross. In Example 3's output, the 8s form a cross that is wider.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross centered at certain points. For example, the input has certain positions that are the centers of the cross, and the output has 8s in positions that are at a certain distance from the center.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are the centers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a cross shape where the center is the original 8s. For example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are at a Manhattan distance of 1 from the original 8. But that would create a cross.\n\nBut how to code that. For example, for each cell (i,j) in the input that is 8, we set all cells (x,y) in the output where |x - i| + |y - j| == 1 to 8. But this would create a cross around each 8.\n\nBut this would mean that for each 8 in the input, we create a cross of 8s around it. However, this would create overlapping regions. For example, if two 8s are adjacent, their crosses would overlap.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1. The input has 8s at (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. For each of these, we create a cross of 8s around them. The output would have 8s in positions that are at a distance of 1 from these points. This would create a cross shape that covers the entire area. For example, the 8 at (3,5) would create 8s at (2,5), (3,4), (3,6), (4,5). The 8 at (4,5) would create 8s at (3,5), (4,4), (4,6), (5,5). So the combined effect would be a cross that is wider.\n\nBut this seems to fit the output of Example 1.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the 8s are in positions (7,4-7), (8,4-7), (9,4-7). For example, the 8 at (7,4) would create a cross around it, including (6,4), (7,3), (7,5), (8,4). Similarly, the 8 at (8,4) would create a cross around it. So the output would have 8s in positions that form a cross.\n\nBut in Example 3's output, the cell (9,5) is 0. However, the input has a 3 in that position. But according to this idea, the cell (9,5) is not part of any cross. Because the input has 8s in (9,4) and (9,6), but not in (9,5). So the 8s in (9,4) and (9,6) would create crosses around them. For example, the 8 at (9,4) would create a cross around it, including (9,3), (9,5), (8,4), (10,4). So the cell (9,5) would be set to 8. But in the output of Example 3, (9,5) is 0. This contradicts the idea.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. So what's the correct pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross centered at certain points, but only if the original cell is 8 or 2. For example, in Example 1, the input has 2s and 8s, and the output has 8s in cross shapes. But in Example 3, the input has 2s and 8s, and the output has 8s in cross shapes. However, the 3 in the input is not part of the transformation.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if it's 2 or 8, then the output is 8 in a cross shape. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 2 and 8.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: in all the examples, the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. The cross seems to be centered around certain points. For example, in Example 1, the cross is centered around the middle of the grid. In Example 2, the cross is more spread out. In Example 3, the cross is centered around the middle of the grid.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that form a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input.\n\nBut how to determine the cross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original 8s. For example, the output is generated by expanding the 8s in the input into a cross shape that is one cell wide.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the code should iterate over each cell in the input. For each cell that is not zero, we set the output cell to 8, and also set the cells directly above, below, left, and right to 8. But this would create a cross around each original non-zero cell. However, this would not explain the examples where the input has 3s, but the output has 0s. But in the examples, the 3s are not part of the transformation.\n\nWait, in Example 3's input, the 3 is in (9,5), and the output is 0. But according to this idea, since the cell is not 8, it would remain 0. But the cells around it, like (9,4) and (9,6), are 8 in the input. So their adjacent cells would be set to 8. For example, the cell (9,4) is 8 in the input. So the output cell (9,4) is set to 8, and its adjacent cells are set to 8. The cell (9,5) is adjacent to (9,4), so it would be set to 8. But in the output of Example 3, (9,5) is 0. This is a contradiction.\n\nSo this suggests that the previous idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input that is 8, we set the output to 8, and also set the cells that are two steps away in all directions. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, but only if the original cell is 8 or 2. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are part of the cross. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 2 and 8 in the input. For example, the 2s in the input are the centers of the cross, and the 8s are the edges.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that form a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input. For example, the cross is formed by expanding the 8s in the input into a cross shape, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is formed by expanding the original 8s into a diamond shape. For example, each 8 in the input is the center of a diamond, and the output has 8s in positions that are at a certain distance from the center.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nFor example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are at a Manhattan distance of 1 from the center. This would create a cross. But as before, this leads to contradictions in the examples.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. But given the examples, I need to find a way to code a transformation that at least matches the examples.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the input has 8s in the middle of the grid, and the output has a cross that is centered there. In Example 3, the input has 8s in the middle of the grid, and the output has a cross that is centered there. So maybe the transformation is that the output is a cross centered at certain positions, and the cross is determined by the input.\n\nBut how to find the center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that form a cross centered at the middle of the grid, and the cross is determined by the input's 8s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that form a cross, and the cross is determined by the positions of 8s in the input. For example, the cross is formed by expanding the 8s in the input into a cross shape.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the code should create a grid where for each cell (i,j) in the input, if it is 8, then set the output cell to 8, and also set the cells directly adjacent to it to 8. But this would create a cross around each 8.\n\nBut in Example 3, this would lead to the cell (9,5) being set to 8, but in the output it's 0. So this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output for this test input is not provided, but I need to write a transformation that would generate the output. But since I don't have the output, I need to rely on the training examples.\n\nLet me try to think of another pattern. Maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that form a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 2 and 8 in the input. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are at positions that are part of the cross.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is formed by expanding the 2s and 8s in the input into a cross.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input. For example, each 8 in the input is the center of a cross, and the output has 8s in positions that are one step away from the center.\n\nBut again, this leads to the problem in Example 3.\n\nMaybe the key is to realize that in the examples, the output has 8s in positions that are part of a cross, but only if the original cell is 8 or 2. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are part of the cross.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input that is 2 or 8, we set the output cell to 8, and also set the cells directly adjacent to it to 8. But this would create a cross around each 2 or 8.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input has a 3, which is not 2 or 8, so it remains 0. But the 3 is in position (9,5), and the output is 0, which is correct.\n\nBut for the 8s in the input, their adjacent cells are set to 8. So in Example 3, the 8 at (8,4) would set (9,4) to 8, and (8,5) to 8, etc. But in the output of Example 3, the cell (9,5) is 0. This suggests that this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input. For example, the 8s in the input are the centers of the cross, and the output has 8s in positions that are one step away from the center.\n\nBut this would mean that for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are one step away. So, for example, the 8 at (3,5) would have 8s at (2,5), (3,4), (3,6), (4,5). But in the output of Example 1, there are 8s at (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), etc. So this suggests that the 8s in the input are part of a cross that is expanded.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the code should iterate through each cell in the input. For each cell (i,j) that is not zero, set the output cell to 8, and also set the cells directly above, below, left, and right to 8. But this would create a cross around each non-zero cell.\n\nBut this would mean that in Example 3, the 8 at (8,4) would set (9,4) to 8, and (8,5) to 8. The cell (9,5) is adjacent to (9,4) and (9,6), but not directly to (8,5). So if (8,5) is 0, then it would not set (9,5) to 8. But in the input of Example 3, (8,5) is 0. So this would not set (9,5) to 8. So this would explain why (9,5) is 0 in the output.\n\nBut why is (8,5) 0 in the input? Let's look at the input for Example 3:\n\nRow 8 (index 8) is: 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the cell (8,4) is 8, (8,5) is 0, (8,6) is 8. So for the 8 at (8,4), the adjacent cells are (7,4), (9,4), (8,3), (8,5). So (8,5) is 0 in the input, but in the output, it would be set to 8. But in the output of Example 3, (8,5) is 0. This is a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the previous idea is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I need to find a pattern that fits the examples. Let me try to think of the output as a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input. For example, in Example 1, the original 8s are in positions that form a vertical line, and the output has a cross that expands from those positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input. The cross is formed by expanding the original 8s into a cross shape.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the code should create a grid where for each cell (i,j) in the input, if it is 8, then the output has 8s in positions (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), and (i,j). But this would create a cross around each 8.\n\nBut this would mean that in Example 3, the 8 at (8,4) would set (9,4) to 8. But in the output of Example 3, (9,4) is 8. The cell (9,5) is 0, which is correct because it's not adjacent to any 8 in the input.\n\nBut in the input, (8,5) is 0, so it's not part of the transformation. So the cell (9,5) is not set to 8, which matches the output.\n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is to set the output cell to 8 if it is adjacent to an 8 in the input, or if it is an 8 in the input.\n\nSo the code would be: for each cell (i,j) in the input, if it is 8, then set the output cell (i,j) to 8, and also set the cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) to 8. But if those cells are out of bounds, they are not set.\n\nThis would create a cross around each 8 in the input.\n\nLet me test this with Example 3.\n\nIn the input, the cell (8,4) is 8. So in the output, (8,4) is 8, and the cells (7,4), (9,4), (8,3), (8,5) are set to 8. So in the output, (9,4) is 8. But in the input, (9,4) is 8. So this is correct.\n\nThe cell (9,5) is not adjacent to any 8 in the input. Because the input has 8 at (9,4) and (9,6), but (9,5) is not adjacent to (9,4) or (9,6). Wait, (9,4) is 8 in the input. So the cell (9,4) is 8, and its adjacent cells are (8,4), (10,4), (9,3), (9,5). So (9,5) would be set to 8. But in the output of Example 3, (9,5) is 0. This is a contradiction.\n\nWait, but in the input, (9,4) is 8. So according to this transformation, (9,5) would be set to 8. But in the output of Example 3, it's 0. This suggests that this transformation is not correct.\n\nBut why is this happening? Maybe the input for Example 3 has (9,4) as 8, and (9,5) is 3. So according to the transformation, (9,5) should be 8. But the output is 0. So this is a problem.\n\nThis indicates that the transformation is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find the exact pattern. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input. For example, the 8s in the input are the centers of the cross, and the output has 8s in positions that are at a certain distance from the center.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input. For example, the cross is formed by expanding the original 8s into a cross shape, but only if the original 8 is in a certain position.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given that, I'll proceed with the code that sets the output cell to 8 if it is adjacent to an 8 in the input or is an 8 itself.\n\nThis code would look like:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Set the current cell to 8\n                transformed[i][j] = 8\n                # Check adjacent cells\n                for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    if 0 <= ni < 13 and 0 <= nj < 13:\n                        transformed[ni][nj] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would set the output to 8 for cells that are adjacent to any non-zero cell in the input. Let's see if this fits the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s in (3,5), (4,5), etc. The code would set their adjacent cells to 8. This would create a cross, which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 8s in (8,4), (8,5) is 0, (8,6), etc. So for the 8 at (8,4), the code would set (9,4) to 8. But in the output of Example 3, (9,4) is 8, which is correct. The cell (9,5) is not set to 8 because it's not adjacent to any 8 in the input. But in the input, (9,4) is 8, so (9,5) is adjacent to it. Wait, (9,4) is 8, so the code would set (9,5) to 8. But in the output of Example 3, (9,5) is 0. This suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the input of Example 3, (9,4) is 8. So the code would set (9,5) to 8. But in the output, it's 0. This is a contradiction.\n\nSo this suggests that the code is not correct. But perhaps I'm misinterpreting the input.\n\nWait, let me recheck the input for Example 3:\n\nInput for Example 3:\n\nRow 8 (index 8) is: 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the cell (8,4) is 8, (8,5) is 0, (8,6) is 8.\n\nSo for the cell (8,4), the code would set (9,4) to 8. For the cell (8,6), the code would set (9,6) to 8. For the cell (8,4), the code would also set (8,5) to 8. But in the input, (8,5) is 0, so the code would set it to 8 in the output. But in the output of Example 3, (8,5) is 0. This is a problem.\n\nBut according to the output of Example 3, (8,5) is 0. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the correct pattern is. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the code that sets the output to 8 for cells that are adjacent to any non-zero cell in the input, and see if it passes the examples.\n\nBut this may not be correct. However, given the examples, this is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some 2s, 8s, and 3s in certain positions. The output has 8s and 0s in a sort of diamond or cross shape. For instance, in the input, there's a 2 in position (3,4) and 8 in (3,5), but the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. Wait, maybe the output is expanding the 8s in some way. Let me check more carefully.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 8s are in positions (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), etc. Wait, maybe the output is creating a pattern where the 8s are spread out in a certain way. Let me look at the output for Example 1. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross shape. Like, in the fourth row, there's an 8 in column 4 and 6, then in the fifth row, 8s in columns 4 and 6 again, but maybe that's not the case. Wait, the output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 ... \nRow 4: 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 8 ...\nRow 5: same as row 4?\nRow 6: same as row 3?\nSo maybe there's a pattern where the 8s are forming a diamond shape, expanding outward from the original positions. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input: there's a 2 in (5,4), 8s in (5,5), (5,6), etc. The output has a more complex pattern. For instance, in the output, there's a 8 in (4,4), then a cross of 8s in the middle. Maybe the transformation is about expanding certain numbers into a cross or diamond shape, but how?\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 2, 8, and 3 in certain positions. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross, but maybe the 3 is replaced by something? Wait, the output for Example 3 has 8s in positions that form a cross, but maybe the 3 is part of a pattern that's being replaced. Wait, the input in Example 3 has a 3 in position (9,5), but the output has 0s there. Hmm, maybe not. Let me check the input and output for Example 3.\n\nInput for Example 3:\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 8 8 3 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput for Example 3:\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in the input, there's a 3 in position (9,5), but in the output, that position is 0. However, the surrounding positions have 8s. So maybe the transformation is that whenever there's a certain number (like 2, 8, 3?), they are replaced by 8s in a cross or diamond pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain positions are converted to 8s based on their distance from certain points. For example, in Example 1, the original 8s are in positions (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), etc. But the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. Wait, maybe the 8s in the input are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in positions (4,5) and (5,5), and the output has 8s in positions (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), etc. So maybe the transformation is that for each 8 in the input, it's creating a cross shape around it, expanding outward.\n\nBut how to model that? Maybe the 8s in the input are the centers of cross shapes, and the output is filled with 8s in positions that are at a certain distance from those centers. For example, in Example 1, the original 8s are in positions (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), etc. Wait, looking at the input of Example 1:\n\nInput row 3 (index 3) has 0s except for position (3,4) which is 2 and (3,5) is 8. Then row 4 has 0s except for (4,4) which is 2, (4,5) is 8, (4,6) is 2. Wait, maybe not. Let me check the input for Example 1 again.\n\nWait, the input for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 2 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 8 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 2 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in row 3, column 4 is 2, column 5 is 8, column 6 is 2. Then row 4, column 4 is 8, column 5 is 3, column 6 is 8. Then row 5 is similar to row 3.\n\nIn the output of Example 1, the 8s are in positions that form a cross. For example, row 3 has 8 in column 5. Then row 4 has 8s in columns 4, 6. Row 5 has 8 in column 5 again. So maybe the output is expanding the 8s into a cross shape. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s in the input are being converted into a cross shape. For example, in the input, there's an 8 in (3,5), and in the output, that's part of a cross. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that any cell with a value of 2 or 8 in the input is replaced by 8 in the output, but that doesn't fit with the examples. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 3 in position (9,5), and the output has 0 there. But in Example 1, the input has 2s and 8s, and the output has 8s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original 8s. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in positions (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. Then the output has 8s in positions that are adjacent to these points. But how to model that.\n\nAnother approach: look for symmetry. For example, in Example 1, the output has a cross shape. Maybe the output is a cross centered at certain points. For instance, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that form a cross centered at (4,5) and (5,5). But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the 8s in the input into a diamond shape. For example, each 8 in the input is converted into a diamond pattern of 8s. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has 8s in positions (4,6), (5,6), etc. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross. For example, in the output, row 4 has 8s in column 4 and 6. Row 5 has 8s in columns 4, 5, 6. Maybe the pattern is that the 8s in the input are being expanded into a cross shape, where each 8 in the input is the center of a cross, and the output has 8s in positions that are adjacent to that center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input that is not zero, the output is filled with 8s in a certain pattern. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by replacing certain positions with 8s based on the original positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in positions that are in the middle of the grid. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross. Maybe the cross is formed by expanding the original 8s into a cross shape, where each 8 in the input is the center of a cross. For example, if there's an 8 in (row, col), then the output has 8s in (row-1, col), (row+1, col), (row, col-1), (row, col+1), etc.\n\nBut how to model that. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in positions (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. Then, the output has 8s in positions that are adjacent to those. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a cross shape where the center is the original 8s. For example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are one step away in all four directions. But then, overlapping would occur.\n\nBut how to code that. For example, for each cell (i,j) in the input that is not zero, we set the output cell (i,j) to 8, and also set cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) to 8. But that might not explain the examples.\n\nLet me check Example 1. Suppose the input has 8s in (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. Then, the output would have 8s in those positions and their neighbors. But in the output, there are 8s in positions (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), etc. Which seems to form a cross shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the original 8s into a diamond shape. For example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are at a Manhattan distance of 1 from the original position. But that would create a cross shape.\n\nBut how to code that. For each cell in the input that is not zero, we check if the cell is part of a cross. But how to determine which cells to mark as 8s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross centered at certain points. For example, in Example 1, the original 8s are in positions that form a vertical line, and the output is a cross that expands from those positions.\n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract. Maybe I should look for patterns in the outputs. For example, in Example 1's output, the 8s are in positions that form a cross. The cross is centered around the middle of the grid. For example, the output has 8s in positions (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), etc. So it's a cross that is 3 cells wide in the vertical and horizontal directions.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by creating a cross shape where the center is the original 8s. For example, in Example 1, the original 8s are in positions (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross around those points.\n\nBut how to code that. Maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input that is not zero, we set the output cell to 8, and also set the cells directly adjacent (up, down, left, right) to 8. But that would create a cross around each original 8. However, overlapping would occur, but perhaps that's acceptable.\n\nBut let's test this idea with Example 1. The input has 8s in (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. So for each of these positions, we would set the output to 8 and their adjacent cells. But in the output, the 8s are spread out in a cross shape. However, this might not account for all the 8s in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a cross shape that is 3 cells wide in each direction. For example, for each original 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are 1 cell away in all directions. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 3. The input has a 3 in position (9,5), and the output has 0 there. However, the surrounding cells have 8s. So maybe the 3 is being replaced by 0, but the 8s are being expanded. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that any cell that is not zero in the input is converted to 8 in the output, but that's not possible because in Example 3, the output has 0s where there was a 3. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original 8s. For example, in Example 1, the original 8s are in positions (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. The output has 8s in positions that are adjacent to those. So, for example, the original 8 at (3,5) would generate 8s at (3,4), (3,6), (4,5), (2,5), etc. But this seems to be the case in the output.\n\nBut how to implement this. Maybe the output is generated by creating a cross around each original 8. For example, for each original 8 in the input, we mark the cell and its four adjacent cells as 8 in the output. But this would create overlapping regions. However, in Example 1, the output seems to have 8s in positions that are part of a cross.\n\nBut let's think of it as follows: for each cell in the input that is not zero, we set the output cell to 8, and also set the cells directly above, below, left, and right to 8. However, this would create a cross around each original 8. But in the output of Example 1, the 8s are spread out in a cross shape, which suggests that this is the case.\n\nBut then, in Example 1's input, there are multiple 8s. For example, in row 3, there's an 8 at (3,5). Then, the output would have 8s at (3,5), (3,4), (3,6), (2,5), (4,5). Similarly, for the 8 at (4,5), the output would have 8s at (4,5), (3,5), (5,5), (4,4), (4,6). But this would create overlapping 8s. However, the output of Example 1 has 8s in positions that form a cross, which would be the case if we do this.\n\nBut wait, in the output of Example 1, there are 8s in positions (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), etc. So this seems to be the case. So the transformation is that for each original 8 in the input, we set the output to 8 and the adjacent cells. However, this would create overlapping regions, but the output seems to have that.\n\nBut then, what about cells that are not 8 in the input? For example, in Example 3's input, there's a 3 in (9,5). According to this logic, since it's not 8, it would remain 0. But in the output of Example 3, that cell is 0, which matches. So that seems to fit.\n\nBut let's test this idea against the examples.\n\nExample 1's input has 8s in positions (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. According to the logic, each of these would generate 8s in their adjacent cells. So the output would have 8s in those positions. But the output of Example 1 has 8s in positions that form a cross. So this seems to fit.\n\nExample 2's input has 8s in positions (4,6), (5,6), (5,5), etc. The output has 8s in positions that form a cross. So this would fit.\n\nExample 3's input has 8s in positions (6,5), (7,4-7), etc. The output has 8s in those positions and their adjacent cells. But in the output of Example 3, the 8s are in positions that form a cross.\n\nBut what about the 3 in Example 3's input? It's not 8, so it remains 0 in the output, which matches.\n\nSo this seems to be a possible pattern. The transformation is: for each cell in the input that is not zero, set the output cell to 8, and also set the cells directly above, below, left, and right to 8. However, if the cell is at the edge of the grid, then the adjacent cells are not set (e.g., for a cell in the top row, there is no cell above it).\n\nBut wait, in the output of Example 1, the 8s are in positions that are part of a cross. So for each original 8, we set the output cell and its four adjacent cells. However, this might not be the case. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. Let's see:\n\nFor the 8 at (3,5), the adjacent cells would be (2,5), (4,5), (3,4), (3,6). So in the output, these would be 8s.\n\nFor the 8 at (4,5), the adjacent cells are (3,5), (5,5), (4,4), (4,6). So those would be 8s.\n\nFor the 8 at (5,5), adjacent cells are (4,5), (6,5), (5,4), (5,6).\n\nFor the 8 at (4,6), adjacent cells are (3,6), (5,6), (4,5), (4,7).\n\nBut this would create a cross shape. So the output would have 8s in positions that are part of a cross.\n\nBut then, what about the 3 in Example 3's input? It's not 8, so it's not part of the transformation, and remains 0. Which matches the output.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3's input, there is a 3 in position (9,5). The output for that position is 0, which is correct. However, the surrounding cells have 8s. For example, in the output of Example 3, the cell (9,5) is 0, but cells (9,4), (9,6), (8,5), (10,5) are 0. But in the input, there are 8s in (8,4-7), (9,4-7), etc. So perhaps the transformation is that any cell in the input that is not zero is converted to 8 in the output, and also their adjacent cells are set to 8. However, the 3 is not zero, but it's not converted to 8. Wait, no. The input is 3, which is not zero. So according to the previous idea, the output cell would be 8. But in the output of Example 3, the cell (9,5) is 0. So that contradicts the idea.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the previous idea is incorrect. So what's wrong here?\n\nIn Example 3's input, the cell (9,5) is 3. According to the previous idea, since it's not 8, it would remain 0. But in the output, it's 0. So that's okay. But why is the 3 not converted to 8? Because the transformation is only for cells that are 8 in the input. So that would be correct. But why is the 3 in the input not converted to 8? Because the transformation is only for cells that are 8 in the input. So that's okay.\n\nBut wait, in the output of Example 3, the cell (9,5) is 0. However, the input has a 3 in that position. So the transformation is not converting 3 to 8. So the previous idea is that only cells with value 8 in the input are converted to 8 in the output, and their adjacent cells are also set to 8. But that would mean that the 3 in the input is not processed. So that's correct.\n\nBut then, why in the output of Example 3, the cells around the 3 are 8s? Because the input has 8s in those positions. For example, in the input, row 8 (index 8) has 8s in columns 4-7. So those cells are processed, and their adjacent cells are set to 8. So the cell (9,5) is not part of any 8 in the input, so it remains 0. But the cell (9,5) is adjacent to (8,5), which is 8 in the input. So according to the previous idea, (8,5) would be processed, and (9,5) would be set to 8. But in the output of Example 3, (9,5) is 0. So that contradicts the idea.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me look at the input and output of Example 3 again.\n\nInput for Example 3:\n\nRow 7 (index 7) is 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8 (index 8) is 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9 (index 9) is 0 0 8 8 3 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in row 8, column 5 is 0. But in row 9, column 5 is 3. So for the cell (8,5) in the input, it's 0. So it's not processed. However, the cell (8,4) is 8. So according to the previous idea, the cell (8,4) is processed. So the output for (8,4) would be 8, and its adjacent cells would be set to 8. The adjacent cells of (8,4) are (7,4), (9,4), (8,3), (8,5). So in the output, those cells would be 8. But in the output of Example 3, row 9, column 4 is 8 (from the output given). However, the cell (9,5) is 0. So that's a problem.\n\nSo according to the previous idea, the cell (8,4) would set (9,4) to 8. But the cell (9,5) is not adjacent to (8,4). The adjacent cells of (8,4) are (7,4), (9,4), (8,3), (8,5). So (9,5) is not adjacent to (8,4). So why is (9,5) 0 in the output?\n\nThis suggests that the previous idea is not correct. So what's the correct pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input that is not zero, we set the output cell to 8 if it's part of a certain pattern. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the 8s are in positions that form a cross. In Example 2's output, the 8s form a more complex cross. In Example 3's output, the 8s form a cross that is wider.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross centered at certain points. For example, the input has certain positions that are the centers of the cross, and the output has 8s in positions that are at a certain distance from the center.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are the centers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by creating a cross shape where the center is the original 8s. For example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are at a Manhattan distance of 1 from the original 8. But that would create a cross.\n\nBut how to code that. For example, for each cell (i,j) in the input that is 8, we set all cells (x,y) in the output where |x - i| + |y - j| == 1 to 8. But this would create a cross around each 8.\n\nBut this would mean that for each 8 in the input, we create a cross of 8s around it. However, this would create overlapping regions. For example, if two 8s are adjacent, their crosses would overlap.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1. The input has 8s at (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (4,6), etc. For each of these, we create a cross of 8s around them. The output would have 8s in positions that are at a distance of 1 from these points. This would create a cross shape that covers the entire area. For example, the 8 at (3,5) would create 8s at (2,5), (3,4), (3,6), (4,5). The 8 at (4,5) would create 8s at (3,5), (4,4), (4,6), (5,5). So the combined effect would be a cross that is wider.\n\nBut this seems to fit the output of Example 1.\n\nIn Example 3's input, the 8s are in positions (7,4-7), (8,4-7), (9,4-7). For example, the 8 at (7,4) would create a cross around it, including (6,4), (7,3), (7,5), (8,4). Similarly, the 8 at (8,4) would create a cross around it. So the output would have 8s in positions that form a cross.\n\nBut in Example 3's output, the cell (9,5) is 0. However, the input has a 3 in that position. But according to this idea, the cell (9,5) is not part of any cross. Because the input has 8s in (9,4) and (9,6), but not in (9,5). So the 8s in (9,4) and (9,6) would create crosses around them. For example, the 8 at (9,4) would create a cross around it, including (9,3), (9,5), (8,4), (10,4). So the cell (9,5) would be set to 8. But in the output of Example 3, (9,5) is 0. This contradicts the idea.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. So what's the correct pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross centered at certain points, but only if the original cell is 8 or 2. For example, in Example 1, the input has 2s and 8s, and the output has 8s in cross shapes. But in Example 3, the input has 2s and 8s, and the output has 8s in cross shapes. However, the 3 in the input is not part of the transformation.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if it's 2 or 8, then the output is 8 in a cross shape. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 2 and 8.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: in all the examples, the output has 8s in positions that form a cross. The cross seems to be centered around certain points. For example, in Example 1, the cross is centered around the middle of the grid. In Example 2, the cross is more spread out. In Example 3, the cross is centered around the middle of the grid.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that form a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input.\n\nBut how to determine the cross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original 8s. For example, the output is generated by expanding the 8s in the input into a cross shape that is one cell wide.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the code should iterate over each cell in the input. For each cell that is not zero, we set the output cell to 8, and also set the cells directly above, below, left, and right to 8. But this would create a cross around each original non-zero cell. However, this would not explain the examples where the input has 3s, but the output has 0s. But in the examples, the 3s are not part of the transformation.\n\nWait, in Example 3's input, the 3 is in (9,5), and the output is 0. But according to this idea, since the cell is not 8, it would remain 0. But the cells around it, like (9,4) and (9,6), are 8 in the input. So their adjacent cells would be set to 8. For example, the cell (9,4) is 8 in the input. So the output cell (9,4) is set to 8, and its adjacent cells are set to 8. The cell (9,5) is adjacent to (9,4), so it would be set to 8. But in the output of Example 3, (9,5) is 0. This is a contradiction.\n\nSo this suggests that the previous idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input that is 8, we set the output to 8, and also set the cells that are two steps away in all directions. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, but only if the original cell is 8 or 2. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are part of the cross. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 2 and 8 in the input. For example, the 2s in the input are the centers of the cross, and the 8s are the edges.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that form a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input. For example, the cross is formed by expanding the 8s in the input into a cross shape, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is formed by expanding the original 8s into a diamond shape. For example, each 8 in the input is the center of a diamond, and the output has 8s in positions that are at a certain distance from the center.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nFor example, for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are at a Manhattan distance of 1 from the center. This would create a cross. But as before, this leads to contradictions in the examples.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. But given the examples, I need to find a way to code a transformation that at least matches the examples.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the input has 8s in the middle of the grid, and the output has a cross that is centered there. In Example 3, the input has 8s in the middle of the grid, and the output has a cross that is centered there. So maybe the transformation is that the output is a cross centered at certain positions, and the cross is determined by the input.\n\nBut how to find the center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that form a cross centered at the middle of the grid, and the cross is determined by the input's 8s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that form a cross, and the cross is determined by the positions of 8s in the input. For example, the cross is formed by expanding the 8s in the input into a cross shape.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the code should create a grid where for each cell (i,j) in the input, if it is 8, then set the output cell to 8, and also set the cells directly adjacent to it to 8. But this would create a cross around each 8.\n\nBut in Example 3, this would lead to the cell (9,5) being set to 8, but in the output it's 0. So this is a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nBut I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another approach.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output for this test input is not provided, but I need to write a transformation that would generate the output. But since I don't have the output, I need to rely on the training examples.\n\nLet me try to think of another pattern. Maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that form a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 2 and 8 in the input. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are at positions that are part of the cross.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is formed by expanding the 2s and 8s in the input into a cross.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input. For example, each 8 in the input is the center of a cross, and the output has 8s in positions that are one step away from the center.\n\nBut again, this leads to the problem in Example 3.\n\nMaybe the key is to realize that in the examples, the output has 8s in positions that are part of a cross, but only if the original cell is 8 or 2. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are part of the cross.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input that is 2 or 8, we set the output cell to 8, and also set the cells directly adjacent to it to 8. But this would create a cross around each 2 or 8.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input has a 3, which is not 2 or 8, so it remains 0. But the 3 is in position (9,5), and the output is 0, which is correct.\n\nBut for the 8s in the input, their adjacent cells are set to 8. So in Example 3, the 8 at (8,4) would set (9,4) to 8, and (8,5) to 8, etc. But in the output of Example 3, the cell (9,5) is 0. This suggests that this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input. For example, the 8s in the input are the centers of the cross, and the output has 8s in positions that are one step away from the center.\n\nBut this would mean that for each 8 in the input, the output has 8s in positions that are one step away. So, for example, the 8 at (3,5) would have 8s at (2,5), (3,4), (3,6), (4,5). But in the output of Example 1, there are 8s at (3,4), (3,6), (4,4), (4,6), (5,4), (5,6), etc. So this suggests that the 8s in the input are part of a cross that is expanded.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nMaybe the code should iterate through each cell in the input. For each cell (i,j) that is not zero, set the output cell to 8, and also set the cells directly above, below, left, and right to 8. But this would create a cross around each non-zero cell.\n\nBut this would mean that in Example 3, the 8 at (8,4) would set (9,4) to 8, and (8,5) to 8. The cell (9,5) is adjacent to (9,4) and (9,6), but not directly to (8,5). So if (8,5) is 0, then it would not set (9,5) to 8. But in the input of Example 3, (8,5) is 0. So this would not set (9,5) to 8. So this would explain why (9,5) is 0 in the output.\n\nBut why is (8,5) 0 in the input? Let's look at the input for Example 3:\n\nRow 8 (index 8) is: 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the cell (8,4) is 8, (8,5) is 0, (8,6) is 8. So for the 8 at (8,4), the adjacent cells are (7,4), (9,4), (8,3), (8,5). So (8,5) is 0 in the input, but in the output, it would be set to 8. But in the output of Example 3, (8,5) is 0. This is a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the previous idea is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I need to find a pattern that fits the examples. Let me try to think of the output as a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input. For example, in Example 1, the original 8s are in positions that form a vertical line, and the output has a cross that expands from those positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input. The cross is formed by expanding the original 8s into a cross shape.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the code should create a grid where for each cell (i,j) in the input, if it is 8, then the output has 8s in positions (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), and (i,j). But this would create a cross around each 8.\n\nBut this would mean that in Example 3, the 8 at (8,4) would set (9,4) to 8. But in the output of Example 3, (9,4) is 8. The cell (9,5) is 0, which is correct because it's not adjacent to any 8 in the input.\n\nBut in the input, (8,5) is 0, so it's not part of the transformation. So the cell (9,5) is not set to 8, which matches the output.\n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is to set the output cell to 8 if it is adjacent to an 8 in the input, or if it is an 8 in the input.\n\nSo the code would be: for each cell (i,j) in the input, if it is 8, then set the output cell (i,j) to 8, and also set the cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) to 8. But if those cells are out of bounds, they are not set.\n\nThis would create a cross around each 8 in the input.\n\nLet me test this with Example 3.\n\nIn the input, the cell (8,4) is 8. So in the output, (8,4) is 8, and the cells (7,4), (9,4), (8,3), (8,5) are set to 8. So in the output, (9,4) is 8. But in the input, (9,4) is 8. So this is correct.\n\nThe cell (9,5) is not adjacent to any 8 in the input. Because the input has 8 at (9,4) and (9,6), but (9,5) is not adjacent to (9,4) or (9,6). Wait, (9,4) is 8 in the input. So the cell (9,4) is 8, and its adjacent cells are (8,4), (10,4), (9,3), (9,5). So (9,5) would be set to 8. But in the output of Example 3, (9,5) is 0. This is a contradiction.\n\nWait, but in the input, (9,4) is 8. So according to this transformation, (9,5) would be set to 8. But in the output of Example 3, it's 0. This suggests that this transformation is not correct.\n\nBut why is this happening? Maybe the input for Example 3 has (9,4) as 8, and (9,5) is 3. So according to the transformation, (9,5) should be 8. But the output is 0. So this is a problem.\n\nThis indicates that the transformation is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find the exact pattern. Given the time I've spent, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is that the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input. For example, the 8s in the input are the centers of the cross, and the output has 8s in positions that are at a certain distance from the center.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid where 8s are placed in positions that are part of a cross, and the cross is determined by the original positions of 8s in the input. For example, the cross is formed by expanding the original 8s into a cross shape, but only if the original 8 is in a certain position.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given that, I'll proceed with the code that sets the output cell to 8 if it is adjacent to an 8 in the input or is an 8 itself.\n\nThis code would look like:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Set the current cell to 8\n                transformed[i][j] = 8\n                # Check adjacent cells\n                for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    if 0 <= ni < 13 and 0 <= nj < 13:\n                        transformed[ni][nj] = 8\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would set the output to 8 for cells that are adjacent to any non-zero cell in the input. Let's see if this fits the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s in (3,5), (4,5), etc. The code would set their adjacent cells to 8. This would create a cross, which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 8s in (8,4), (8,5) is 0, (8,6), etc. So for the 8 at (8,4), the code would set (9,4) to 8. But in the output of Example 3, (9,4) is 8, which is correct. The cell (9,5) is not set to 8 because it's not adjacent to any 8 in the input. But in the input, (9,4) is 8, so (9,5) is adjacent to it. Wait, (9,4) is 8, so the code would set (9,5) to 8. But in the output of Example 3, (9,5) is 0. This suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut according to the input of Example 3, (9,4) is 8. So the code would set (9,5) to 8. But in the output, it's 0. This is a contradiction.\n\nSo this suggests that the code is not correct. But perhaps I'm misinterpreting the input.\n\nWait, let me recheck the input for Example 3:\n\nInput for Example 3:\n\nRow 8 (index 8) is: 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the cell (8,4) is 8, (8,5) is 0, (8,6) is 8.\n\nSo for the cell (8,4), the code would set (9,4) to 8. For the cell (8,6), the code would set (9,6) to 8. For the cell (8,4), the code would also set (8,5) to 8. But in the input, (8,5) is 0, so the code would set it to 8 in the output. But in the output of Example 3, (8,5) is 0. This is a problem.\n\nBut according to the output of Example 3, (8,5) is 0. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the correct pattern is. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the code that sets the output to 8 for cells that are adjacent to any non-zero cell in the input, and see if it passes the examples.\n\nBut this may not be correct. However, given the examples, this is the best I can do.\n"
