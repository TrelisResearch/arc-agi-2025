          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a 2 in the 13th row (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), and the output has that 2 in the same position. But then there's a 3 starting from row 4, column 5. Wait, in the output, row 4 (which is the fifth row) has a 3 in column 5. Then in the next rows, the 3s spread outwards. Like, each row below has a 3 in column 5, but then in row 5, it's column 6? Wait, looking at the output for example 1:\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 \u2192 but the output for row 4 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2? Wait no, the output for example 1 is:\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 \u2192 but then row 5 has a 3 in column 5? Wait, the output for example 1's fifth row (row 4 if zero-indexed?) is:\n\nRow 4 (original input row 4 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, but output row 4 is same? Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait example 1's input is 13 rows. The input has a 2 in row 12 (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), because the input's 13th row (probably row 12) is 0 1 0 ... 0. Wait, the input for example 1 is:\n\nThe input is 13 rows. Let me check:\n\nThe input for example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\n...\n\nRow 3: all zeros except the last column is 2.\n\nThen row 4: all zeros.\n\nThen row 5: all zeros.\n\n...\n\nRow 10: has a 1 in column 1.\n\nRow 11: all zeros.\n\nRow 12: all zeros.\n\nWait, the output for example 1 has a 3 spreading out from row 4 (the fifth row) and column 5. Let me check the output:\n\nIn the output for example 1, row 4 (original input row 4) is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. Then row 5 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0. Row 6: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. Row 7: 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Row 8: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Row 9: 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Row 10: 0 1 0 ... 0. Then rows 11 and 12 are zeros.\n\nSo the 3s are spreading outwards from the position (row 4, column 5) in a diagonal way. Like, each row below has a 3 in column 5, then 6, then 7, etc. Wait, row 4: column 5 is 0? Wait the output for row 4 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. So the 2 is in column 11. Then row 5 has a 3 in column 5 (the sixth column?), but the output for row 5 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0. So column 6 (index 6) is 3. Then row 6 has 3 in column 5 (index 5?) or column 6? Wait, row 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 ... \u2192 column 6 (index 6) is 3. Then row 6: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 ... \u2192 column 5 (index 5) is 3. Then row 7: 0 0 0 0 3 0 ... \u2192 column 4 (index 4) is 3. Then row 8: column 3 (index 3) is 3. Then row 9: column 2 (index 2) is 3. Then row 10: column 1 (index 1) is 1. So the 3s are spreading out in a diagonal pattern, starting from row 4, column 5 (index 5?), but the 3s are moving up and to the left. Wait, but the 3s are in positions that are moving diagonally. So for each row, the 3s are placed in a way that their positions are moving up and to the left as the row increases. \n\nWait, maybe the 3s are expanding in a diamond shape. Like, starting from a point, and expanding outward. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in positions that are moving diagonally. For example, in example 1, the 3 starts at row 4, column 5 (but that's zero in the input). Wait, the input for example 1 has a 2 in row 3 (the fourth row), column 11. Then the output has that 2 in the same place. Then the 3s are expanding from the position where there was a 1 in row 10, column 1. Wait, in the input of example 1, row 10 has a 1 in column 1. In the output, that's still there, but the 3s are expanding from that position. Wait, but in the output, the 3s start in row 4, column 5. That seems unrelated. Maybe I need to look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at example 2. The input has a 2 in row 1 (second row), column 1. The output has that 2 in the same position. Then in the output, the 3s start in row 2, column 2, and spread outwards. So for example, row 2 has a 3 in column 2. Then row 3 has 3 in column 2, then row 4 has 3 in column 2, etc., until row 8, then row 9 has 3 in column 3, then row 10 has 3 in column 4, etc. So this seems like a diamond pattern expanding from the original position. \n\nIn example 2, the 3s spread out in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in a diagonal line. For example, starting from row 2, column 2 (the position where the 2 was in the input), the 3s spread out to the right and down. Wait, but in the output, row 2 has a 3 in column 2, row 3 has 3 in column 2, then row 4 has 3 in column 2, etc., until row 8, then row 9 has 3 in column 3, then row 10 has 3 in column 4, etc. So this seems like a diamond shape that expands outward from the original position. \n\nIn example 3, the input has a 2 in row 1 (second row), column 6 (assuming 0-indexed?), and the output has that 2 in the same position. Then the 3s start expanding from that position. The output shows that in row 2, column 5 (index 5?), there's a 3. Then row 3, column 5, row 4, column 5, etc., up to row 8, then row 9 has 3 in column 5, then row 10 has 3 in column 5, then row 11 has 3 in column 5. Then row 12 has 3 in column 4. Then row 13 has 3 in column 3. Wait, no, the input for example 3 has a 1 in row 12 (the 13th row?), column 3. The output for example 3 has that 1 in the same place. So the 3s are expanding in a way that starts from the position of the 2, and spreads outwards in a diamond shape. \n\nIn example 4, the input has a 1 in row 1 (second row), column 11. The output has that 1 in the same place. Then the 3s spread out from that position. The output shows that in row 2, column 10, there's a 3. Then row 3, column 9, row 4, column 8, etc., up to row 8, then row 9 has 3 in column 7, etc. So again, the 3s are expanding outward in a diamond pattern from the original position.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that whenever there's a non-zero value in the input, it starts a diamond-shaped expansion. For example, if there's a 2 in position (row, col), then the output has a 3 expanding in a diamond shape from that position. But wait, in example 1, the 2 is in row 3 (original input row 3?), and the 3s start in row 4, column 5. But in example 2, the 2 is in row 1 (original input row 1?), and the 3s start in row 2, column 2. So maybe the 3s spread out in a diamond pattern from the position of the original non-zero value. \n\nBut how does that work? Let's think. For example, in example 2, the input has a 2 in (row 1, column 1). The output has 3s expanding from that position. The first 3 is in (row 2, column 2). Then in the next rows, the 3s are in (row 3, column 2), (row 4, column 2), etc., until row 8, then (row 9, column 3), (row 10, column 4), etc. So the 3s spread out in a way that for each row, the 3s are in positions that are moving diagonally. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original position. For example, the original position is (r, c), and the 3s are placed in positions (r + k, c + k) for k steps. But that's not matching the examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s spread in a diamond shape, expanding outward in all four directions. For example, the original position is the center, and the 3s are placed in a diamond pattern. But how?\n\nLooking at example 2, the original 2 is at (1,1). The first 3 is at (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), then (9,3), (10,4), etc. So it's like a line that starts at (2,2) and moves down, then starts to move right. So maybe the 3s spread in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in positions that are in a diagonal line. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in positions that are a certain distance from the original position. For example, the original position is (r, c). For each row i, the 3s are placed in columns that are (i - r) steps away. But that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are expanding in a diamond shape, where each step away from the original position increases the distance. For example, the original position is the center, and the 3s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the center. \n\nBut how to model this. Maybe for each cell in the input grid that is non-zero, we need to create a diamond-shaped pattern of 3s expanding from that cell. \n\nBut in example 1, the original 2 is in row 3, column 11. The output has a 2 in the same position. Then the 3s start expanding from the position of the 1 in row 10, column 1. So maybe the 3s are expanding from the position of the 1. \n\nWait, in example 1, the input has a 1 in row 10, column 1. The output has that 1 in the same position. Then the 3s start expanding from that position. So the 3s are expanding from the position of the 1. \n\nSo the pattern is that whenever there's a non-zero value in the input, it starts a diamond-shaped expansion of 3s. But how? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are expanding from the position of the non-zero value, but in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in positions that are a certain distance away. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each cell (i,j) in the input, if the cell is non-zero, then in the output, the cells that are at a certain distance from (i,j) are filled with 3s. \n\nBut how to determine that distance. Let's look at example 1. The 1 is at (10,1). The output has 3s in positions (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1) (but that's the original 1). Wait, no. In example 1, the output has 3s in positions (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). Wait, but (10,1) is the original 1. So maybe the 3s are expanding from the original position in a diamond shape, but the original position is not changed. \n\nWait, in example 1, the 1 is in (10,1). The output has 3s in positions (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). Wait, but (10,1) is the original 1. So perhaps the 3s are expanding from the original position, but the original position is kept as is. \n\nBut how does this form a diamond? Let's think of the positions as (i,j). The original position is (10,1). The 3s are placed in positions that are (i,j) where the Manhattan distance from (10,1) is equal to some value. \n\nFor example, the Manhattan distance between (10,1) and (4,5) is |10-4| + |1-5| = 6 +4 = 10. But that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, the Chebyshev distance. Or maybe the positions are in a diagonal line. \n\nLooking at the positions of the 3s in example 1:\n\n(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). \n\nThese positions are moving down and to the left. So for each row i, the column j decreases by 1 as i increases by 1. \n\nSo for row 4, j=5. Then row 5, j=5. Then row 6, j=5. Then row 7, j=4. Then row 8, j=3. Then row 9, j=2. Then row 10, j=1. \n\nSo this forms a line that starts at (4,5) and moves down, then starts to move left. \n\nBut how does that relate to the original position (10,1)? The line starts at (4,5) and ends at (10,1). So the line is from (4,5) to (10,1), which is a diagonal line. \n\nSo the 3s are expanding in a line from the original position. But why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in a column that is (original_col - (row - original_row)). \n\nFor example, original_row is 10, original_col is 1. For row i, the column j is original_col - (i - original_row). \n\nSo for row 4: j = 1 - (4 -10) = 1 - (-6) = 7? But in example 1, for row 4, j is 5. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are placed in a line that starts from a certain point and expands. \n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of the 3s in example 1. The 3s start at row 4, column 5. Then in row 5, column 5. Then row 6, column 5. Then row 7, column 4. Row 8, column 3. Row 9, column 2. Row 10, column 1. \n\nSo this is a line that starts at (4,5) and moves down, then starts to move left. The line is from (4,5) to (10,1). The difference between the rows is 6 (from 4 to 10). The difference between columns is 4 (from 5 to 1). So the line is a diagonal line. \n\nThis suggests that the 3s are expanding in a diagonal line from the original position. But how to determine where that line starts. \n\nIn example 1, the original position is (10,1). The line starts at (4,5). How is that calculated? \n\nThe difference between the rows is 10-4 = 6. The difference between columns is 5-1 = 4. So 6 rows and 4 columns. \n\nBut why would that line be chosen? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a certain distance from the original position. For example, the line starts at a distance of 6 steps from the original position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a certain row and column based on the original position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in columns that are (original_col + (original_row - row)), but that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are expanding in a diamond pattern, but the diamond is formed by expanding from the original position in all directions. \n\nBut in example 1, the 3s are only expanding in one direction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each cell (i,j) in the input, if the cell is non-zero, then in the output, the cells that are in the same row and column as the original position are filled with 3s. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are expanding in a way that for each cell (i,j) in the input, the output has 3s in positions that are at a certain distance from (i,j). \n\nBut how to determine that distance. \n\nLooking at example 2: the input has a 2 in row 1, column 1. The output has 3s expanding from that position. The first 3 is in row 2, column 2. Then row 3, column 2. Then row 4, column 2, etc. So for rows 2 to 8, column 2 is 3. Then row 9, column 3. Row 10, column 4. So this is a line that starts at (2,2) and moves down, then moves right. \n\nThis suggests that the 3s are expanding in a line that starts at a certain point and moves down and then to the right. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nAnother approach: Look for the pattern in the positions of the 3s. \n\nIn example 1, the 3s are in positions that form a line from (4,5) to (10,1). \n\nIn example 2, the 3s are in positions that form a line from (2,2) to (8,2), then (9,3), (10,4), etc. \n\nIn example 3, the 3s are in positions that form a line from (2,5) to (8,5), then (9,5), (10,5), (11,5), (12,4), (13,3), etc. \n\nIn example 4, the 3s are in positions that form a line from (2,10) to (8,8), then (9,7), (10,6), etc. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the 3s are expanding in a line that starts at a certain position and moves down and to the left. \n\nBut how to determine where that starting position is. \n\nLooking at example 1, the original position is (10,1). The line starts at (4,5). How is that calculated? \n\nThe difference between the original row and the starting row is 10-4=6. The difference between the original column and starting column is 1-5= -4. \n\nBut why 6 and 4? \n\nAlternatively, the line starts at a position that is 6 rows above and 4 columns to the right of the original position. \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nAlternatively, the line starts at a position that is (original_row - 6, original_col + 4). \n\nBut why those numbers? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column. \n\nBut this seems arbitrary. \n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in a column that is (original_col + (original_row - row)). \n\nFor example, in example 1, original_row is 10, original_col is 1. For row 4: 1 + (10 -4) = 1 +6=7. But in the output, the column is 5. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the column is (original_col - (row - original_row)). \n\nFor row 4: original_col - (4 - original_row) = 1 - (4-10) = 1 - (-6) = 7. Again, not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a certain point. For example, in example 1, the line starts at row 4, column 5. Which is 6 rows above the original position (10-4=6), and 4 columns to the right (5-1=4). \n\nBut why those numbers? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column. For example, the line starts at row i = original_row - k, and column j = original_col + k, where k is some value. \n\nIn example 1, original_row is 10, original_col is 1. For k=6, i=10-6=4, j=1+6=7. But in the output, the starting column is 5. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe k is 4. i=10-4=6, j=1+4=5. So for row 6, column 5. But in the output, the first 3 is in row 4, column 5. \n\nThis is getting complicated. \n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each non-zero cell in the input, the output has 3s expanding in a line that starts at a certain position and moves down and to the left. The starting position is determined by the original cell's position. \n\nBut how to find that starting position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a position that is (original_row - 6, original_col + 4) for example 1. But why? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line is determined by the original cell's position and the position of the 2 in the input. \n\nIn example 1, the 2 is in row 3, column 11. The 3s start expanding from the 1 in row 10, column 1. So perhaps the 3s are expanding from the position of the 1. \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding from the position of the first non-zero cell in the input. \n\nBut in example 1, the 2 is in row 3, column 11. But the 3s are expanding from the 1 in row 10, column 1. \n\nThis suggests that the 3s are expanding from the position of the 1, which is the first non-zero cell in the input. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding from the position of the 1, which is the only non-zero cell in the input. \n\nBut in example 2, the input has a 2 and the output has 3s expanding from the 2. \n\nSo perhaps the 3s are expanding from the position of the first non-zero cell in the input. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding from the position of the non-zero cell, and the expansion is in a diamond shape. \n\nBut how to model that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original position. \n\nFor example, in example 1, the 3s are placed in positions that are at a distance of 6 rows and 4 columns from the original position. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output for example 1, the 3s are expanding in a line that starts at row 4, column 5, and moves down and to the left. This line is a diagonal line from (4,5) to (10,1). The length of this line is 6 rows. \n\nIn example 2, the line starts at (2,2) and moves down, then to the right. The line is from (2,2) to (8,2), then (9,3), etc. \n\nIn example 3, the line starts at (2,5) and moves down, then to the left. \n\nIn example 4, the line starts at (2,10) and moves down and to the left. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the 3s expand in a diagonal line from the original position, but the line starts at a certain point. \n\nBut how to determine that starting point. \n\nMaybe the starting point is determined by the original position's row and column. For example, in example 1, the original position is (10,1), and the line starts at (4,5). This is 6 rows above and 4 columns to the right. \n\nIn example 2, the original position is (1,1), and the line starts at (2,2). That is 1 row below and 1 column to the right. \n\nIn example 3, the original position is (12,3), and the line starts at (2,5). That is 10 rows above and 2 columns to the right. \n\nIn example 4, the original position is (13,3), and the line starts at (2,10). That is 11 rows above and 7 columns to the right. \n\nThis seems inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column. For example, the line starts at row original_row - k, column original_col + k. \n\nIn example 1, original_row is 10, original_col is 1. Let's say k=6: row 10-6=4, column 1+6=7. But the starting column is 5. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, k=4: row 10-4=6, column 1+4=5. So starting at row 6, column 5. But in the output, the first 3 is at row 4, column 5. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nMaybe the starting point is determined by the original position's row and column. For example, the line starts at (original_row - 6, original_col + 4) for example 1. \n\nBut why those numbers? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column, and the line is part of a diamond pattern that expands from the original position. \n\nBut I'm not seeing the pattern. \n\nMaybe it's easier to think in terms of the output for each example. \n\nIn example 1, the 3s are expanding in a line from (4,5) to (10,1). This line has a slope of -1 (since for each step down, the column decreases by 1). \n\nIn example 2, the line is from (2,2) down to (8,2), then moves right. \n\nIn example 3, the line is from (2,5) down to (12,3). \n\nIn example 4, the line is from (2,10) down to (13,3). \n\nSo the line is a diagonal line with slope -1. \n\nThis suggests that the 3s are expanding in a diagonal line with slope -1 from the original position. \n\nBut how to determine where this line starts. \n\nIn example 1, the original position is (10,1). The line starts at (4,5). Let's see: \n\nThe line from (4,5) to (10,1) has a slope of (1-5)/(10-4) = -4/6 = -2/3. Not -1. \n\nSo that's not a diagonal line. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position and the position of the 2 in the input. \n\nIn example 1, the original position is (10,1), but the 2 is in row 3, column 11. The 3s start expanding from the 1. \n\nBut why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding from the position of the first non-zero cell in the input. \n\nIn example 1, the first non-zero cell is the 2 in row 3, column 11. But the 3s are expanding from the 1. So that doesn't fit. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. \n\nLooking at the output for example 1, the 3s are expanding from the 1 in (10,1). The line starts at (4,5), which is 6 rows above and 4 columns to the right. \n\nBut why those numbers? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column, and the line is part of a diamond pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each cell (i,j) in the input, if the cell is non-zero, then the output has 3s in cells that are in the same row and column as the original cell. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each cell (i,j) in the input, the output has 3s in cells that are in the same row and column as the original cell, but shifted in a certain way. \n\nBut I'm not seeing it. \n\nMaybe I should think of the transformation as follows: whenever there is a non-zero value in the input, it starts a pattern of 3s that expand in a diamond shape. \n\nBut how to model that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are expanding in a way that for each cell (i,j) in the input, if the cell is non-zero, then in the output, the cells (i + k, j + k) for k steps are filled with 3s. \n\nBut in example 1, the original position is (10,1). For k = -6, i + k = 10 -6 =4, j +k =1-6 = -5. But that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, for k steps in the positive direction. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach. \n\nLooking at the output for example 1, the 3s are expanding from the 1 in (10,1). The line starts at (4,5), which is 6 rows above and 4 columns to the right. \n\nBut why? \n\nMaybe the line starts at (original_row - 6, original_col + 4). \n\nIn example 1, original_row is 10, original_col is 1. 10-6=4, 1+4=5. So yes. \n\nIn example 2, original_row is 1, original_col is 1. If the line starts at (1 + 1, 1 + 1) = (2,2). Which matches the example. \n\nIn example 3, original_row is 12, original_col is 3. If the line starts at (12 - 10, 3 + 2) = (2,5). Which matches the example. \n\nIn example 4, original_row is 13, original_col is 3. If the line starts at (13 - 11, 3 +7) = (2,10). Which matches the example. \n\nSo this seems to be a pattern. \n\nThe starting position is (original_row - k, original_col + k), where k is the number of steps. \n\nBut what is k? \n\nIn example 1, k is 6. \n\nIn example 2, k is 1. \n\nIn example 3, k is 10. \n\nIn example 4, k is 11. \n\nThis seems arbitrary. \n\nBut looking at the examples:\n\nExample 1: the starting position is (4,5). This is 6 rows above and 4 columns to the right of the original position (10,1). \n\nExample 2: starting position is (2,2). This is 1 row below and 1 column to the right of the original position (1,1). \n\nExample 3: starting position is (2,5). This is 10 rows above and 2 columns to the right of the original position (12,3). \n\nExample 4: starting position is (2,10). This is 11 rows above and 7 columns to the right of the original position (13,3). \n\nSo the k values are varying. \n\nBut what is the pattern here? \n\nLooking at the starting positions:\n\nFor example 1, the starting row is 4, which is 10 - 6 = 4. Starting column is 5 = 1 + 4. \n\nFor example 2, starting row is 2 = 1 + 1. Starting column is 2 = 1 + 1. \n\nFor example 3, starting row is 2 = 12 - 10. Starting column is 5 = 3 + 2. \n\nFor example 4, starting row is 2 = 13 - 11. Starting column is 10 = 3 +7. \n\nSo it seems that the starting position is determined by the original position's row and column, but the values of k are varying. \n\nBut how to determine k? \n\nMaybe k is the number of steps from the original position to the starting position. \n\nBut without knowing the pattern, this is not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the starting position is determined by the original position's row and column, and the line starts at a certain point. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nMaybe the starting position is determined by the original position's row and column, and the line starts at a certain row and column that is determined by the original position. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column, and the line is part of a diamond pattern. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think about the test input. \n\nThe test input has a 1 in row 12, column 3. The output should be transformed. \n\nBased on the pattern from the examples, the 3s should expand from that position. \n\nSo the output should have 3s expanding from (12,3). \n\nThe starting position for the line would be (original_row - k, original_col + k). \n\nIf the line starts at (2,10) for example 4, which is 13-11=2 and 3+7=10. \n\nSo for the test input, the original position is (12,3). Assuming that k is 10, the starting position would be (12-10=2, 3+10=13). But the grid is 13 rows and 12 columns. So column 13 is out of bounds. \n\nBut in example 4, the starting column is 10, which is within the 12 columns. \n\nThis suggests that k is determined by the original position's row and column. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to proceed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line starts at a position that is (original_row - 10, original_col + 10). But this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a position that is (original_row - 6, original_col + 4) for example 1, and similar for other examples. \n\nBut this is not a general rule. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column, and the line is part of a diamond pattern that expands in all directions. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nThe pattern seems to be that for each non-zero cell in the input, the output has a line of 3s expanding from that cell in a diagonal line, starting at a certain position. \n\nThe starting position for the line is determined by the original position's row and column, but the exact calculation is unclear. \n\nBut looking at the examples, the line starts at a position that is (original_row - k, original_col + k), where k is the number of rows from the original position to the starting point. \n\nIn example 1, k is 6. \n\nIn example 2, k is 1. \n\nIn example 3, k is 10. \n\nIn example 4, k is 11. \n\nBut how to determine k. \n\nMaybe k is the number of steps from the original position to the starting point. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column, and the line is part of a diamond pattern that expands in all directions. \n\nBut I'm not able to find the exact pattern. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is to expand 3s in a diagonal line from the original non-zero cell. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nMaybe for each non-zero cell (i,j) in the input, we need to generate a line of 3s starting at a certain position and expanding in a diagonal line. \n\nBut how to determine the starting position. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line starts at a position that is (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1, but this is not generalizable. \n\nAt this point, I'll have to make a hypothesis based on the examples. \n\nThe hypothesis is: for each non-zero cell (i,j) in the input, the output has a line of 3s expanding from (i, j) in a diagonal line, starting at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1. \n\nBut this is not general. \n\nAlternatively, the line starts at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1, but this is not applicable to other examples. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent. \n\nAnother idea: The line starts at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1, but for other examples, it starts at (i - 1, j + 1). \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll try to implement a function that for each non-zero cell (i,j), expands 3s in a diagonal line from (i, j) in a certain way. \n\nFor example, in example 1, the line starts at (4,5) and moves down and to the left. \n\nSo for each row, the column decreases by 1 as the row increases by 1. \n\nSo for a given starting row and column, the line is (start_row, start_col), (start_row+1, start_col-1), (start_row+2, start_col-2), etc., until the column is >= 0 or the row is < 13. \n\nBut how to determine the starting row and column. \n\nIn example 1, the starting row is 4, column 5. \n\nIn example 2, the starting row is 2, column 2. \n\nIn example 3, the starting row is 2, column 5. \n\nIn example 4, the starting row is 2, column 10. \n\nSo the starting row is 2 for all examples. \n\nWait, in example 1, the starting row is 4, but in example 2, it's 2. So that's not consistent. \n\nBut in example 2, the starting row is 2, which is the row of the original cell (1,1) plus 1. \n\nMaybe the starting row is original_row + 1, and the starting column is original_col + 1. \n\nIn example 2, original_row is 1, original_col is 1. Starting row is 2, starting column is 2. \n\nIn example 1, original_row is 10, original_col is 1. Starting row is 4, which is 10 - 6. \n\nThis is not consistent. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. \n\nLet's look at the test input. The test input has a 1 in row 12, column 3. The output should have 3s expanding from this position. \n\nBased on example 4, where the original position is (13,3), the starting position is (2,10). So for the test input, the starting position would be (2,10). \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nMaybe the starting position is (2, original_col + 7). For example 4, original_col is 3, 3 + 7 = 10. \n\nIn example 1, original_col is 1, 1 + 4 = 5. \n\nIn example 2, original_col is 1, 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nIn example 3, original_col is 3, 3 + 2 = 5. \n\nSo the added value is varying. \n\nThis suggests that the added value is (original_col + k), where k is some value. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: \n\nFor each non-zero cell (i,j) in the input, create a line of 3s starting at (i - 6, j + 4) if it's in example 1, but this is not general. \n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero cell, start the line at (i - 6, j + 4) and expand in a diagonal line. \n\nBut this is not general. \n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero cell, start the line at (i - 6, j + 4) if the cell is in the first example, and adjust for other examples. \n\nBut this is not feasible. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: \n\nThe 3s expand in a diagonal line from the original position, starting at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1, but this is not general. \n\nBut this is not helpful for other examples. \n\nAlternatively, the line starts at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1, and for other examples, it starts at (i - 1, j + 1). \n\nBut this is not consistent. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: \n\nFor each non-zero cell (i,j) in the input, the output has 3s in a line starting at (i - 6, j + 4) and expanding down and to the left. \n\nBut this is not correct for other examples. \n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero cell (i,j), the output has 3s in positions (i + k, j - k) for k from 0 to some value. \n\nBut how to determine k. \n\nIn example 1, the original position is (10,1). The line starts at (4,5) and expands down and left. \n\nSo for k = 6, i + k = 10 + 6 = 16 (out of bounds). \n\nThis is not helpful. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nThe pattern seems to be that for each non-zero cell (i,j), the output has 3s in a line that starts at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1, but for other examples, it starts at (i - 1, j + 1). \n\nBut this is not general. \n\nAlternatively, the line starts at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1, and for other examples, it starts at (i - 1, j + 1). \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: \n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid, if the cell is non-zero, then for each row from i down to i - 6, and column from j + 4 to the left, set the cell to 3. \n\nBut this is not correct for other examples. \n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero cell (i,j), the output has 3s in positions (i + k, j - k) for k from 0 to 6. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nIn example 1, the original cell is (10,1). For k=0, it's (10,1). For k=1, (11,0) which is out of bounds. So this is not correct. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: \n\nThe transformation is to expand 3s in a line from the original non-zero cell, starting at (i - 6, j + 4) and expanding down and to the left. \n\nBut this is not correct for other examples. \n\nBut given the examples, I'll proceed with this. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n   for each column in the input grid:\n\n       if the cell is non-zero:\n\n           start_row = i - 6\n\n           start_col = j + 4\n\n           for k in range(0, 6):\n\n               new_row = start_row + k\n\n               new_col = start_col - k\n\n               if new_row is between 0 and 12 and new_col is between 0 and 11:\n\n                   set output[new_row][new_col] = 3\n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nBut in example 1, the original cell is (10,1). start_row = 10 -6 = 4, start_col = 1 +4 =5. Then for k=0, new_row=4, new_col=5. For k=1, new_row=5, new_col=4. For k=2, new_row=6, new_col=3. For k=3, new_row=7, new_col=2. For k=4, new_row=8, new_col=1. For k=5, new_row=9, new_col=0. \n\nBut in the output for example 1, the 3s are in (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). \n\nSo this code would not produce the correct positions. \n\nBut in the code above, for k=0, new_row=4, new_col=5. For k=1, new_row=5, new_col=4. For k=2, new_row=6, new_col=3. For k=3, new_row=7, new_col=2. For k=4, new_row=8, new_col=1. For k=5, new_row=9, new_col=0. \n\nBut in the output, the 3s are at (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). \n\nSo this code would only set (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), (9,0), (10,-1). \n\nBut the correct positions are (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). \n\nSo this is not matching. \n\nThus, this approach is incorrect. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck and need to make a different approach. \n\nMaybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in a column that is (original_col + (original_row - row)). \n\nFor example, in example 1, original_row is 10, original_col is 1. For row 4, column is 1 + (10 -4) = 7. But the correct column is 5. \n\nThis doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, column is original_col - (row - original_row). \n\nFor row 4: 1 - (4-10) = 1 +6 = 7. Still not matching. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nMaybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in columns that are (original_col + (original_row - row)). \n\nFor example, in example 1, original_row is 10, original_col is 1. For row 4, column is 1 + (10-4) = 7. But the correct column is 5. \n\nNo. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nAt this point, I'll have to give up and make a guess based on the examples. \n\nThe code will look for non-zero cells and expand 3s in a line from the original cell, but I'll have to implement it in a way that matches the examples. \n\nLooking at example 1, the 3s are in a line from (4,5) to (10,1). This line has a slope of -1/1. So for each step down, the column decreases by 1. \n\nSo for each row i, the column is 5 - (i -4). \n\nFor i=4: 5 - 0 =5. \n\ni=5: 5 -1=4. \n\ni=6: 5-2=3. \n\ni=7: 5-3=2. \n\ni=8:5-4=1. \n\ni=9:5-5=0. \n\ni=10:5-6=-1. \n\nBut in the output, the 3s are at (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). \n\nSo this suggests that the column is 5 for i=4,5,6, then decreases. \n\nSo for rows 4,5,6, the column is 5. Then for row 7, column is 4. \n\nThis suggests that the line starts at (4,5) and for the next rows, the column decreases by 1 every other row. \n\nThis is not clear. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: \n\nFor each non-zero cell (i,j) in the input, the output has 3s in positions (i, j), (i+1, j), (i+2, j), ..., until the row is 12, and then for the next rows, the column decreases by 1. \n\nBut this is not correct for example 1. \n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this. \n\nThe code will be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Expand 3s from this cell\n                for k in range(13 - i):\n                    if i + k < 13 and j + k < 12:\n                        transformed[i + k][j + k] = 3\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct for the examples. \n\nFor example 1, the input has a 2 in row 3, column 11. The code would set transformed[3+0][11+0] = 3, which is (3,11). But the output for example 1 has a 2 in (3,11), and 3s in other positions. \n\nThis is not matching. \n\nAt this point, I'm forced to conclude that I'm unable to determine the exact pattern, but based on the examples, the transformation involves expanding 3s in a diagonal line from the original non-zero cell. \n\nSo, I'll write a function that for each non-zero cell, expands 3s in a diagonal line from that cell, but I'll have to adjust based on the examples. \n\nFor example, in example 1, the 3s start at (4,5) and expand down and left. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Expand 3s in a diagonal line from (i,j)\n                # Start at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1\n                # But this is not general\n                # For now, assume that the line starts at (i - 6, j + 4)\n                # and expands down and left\n                start_row = i - 6\n                start_col = j + 4\n                for k in range(0, 7):\n                    new_row = start_row + k\n                    new_col = start_col - k\n                    if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 12:\n                        transformed[new_row][new_col] = 3\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct for other examples. \n\nHowever, given the time, this is the best I can do. \n\nBut this code would not work for example 2. \n\nIn example 2, the original cell is (1,1). start_row = 1 -6 = -5, which is invalid. So this code would not work. \n\nThus, this approach is incorrect. \n\nGiven the time, I'll have to proceed with the following code, even if it's not correct for all examples. \n\nBut based on the examples, the 3s are expanding in a diagonal line from the original non-zero cell. \n\nSo, the code will be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Expand 3s in a diagonal line from (i,j)\n                # For example 1, it's (4,5) to (10,1)\n                # So for each row from i down to i - 6, and column from j + 4 to the left\n                # But this is not general\n                for k in range(6):\n                    new_row = i - k\n                    new_col = j + k\n                    if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 12:\n                        transformed[new_row][new_col] = 3\n    return transformed\n\nThis code would for example 1, the original cell (10,1) would set new_row = 10-0=10, new_col=1+0=1. Then k=1: new_row=9, new_col=2. k=2: new_row=8, new_col=3. k=3: new_row=7, new_col=4. k=4: new_row=6, new_col=5. k=5: new_row=5, new_col=6. \n\nBut in the output for example 1, the 3s are at (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). \n\nThis code would set (10,1), (9,2), (8,3), (7,4), (6,5), (5,6). \n\nBut the correct positions are (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). \n\nSo this code is not correct. \n\nAt this point, I'm forced to conclude that I'm unable to determine the exact pattern, but based on the examples, the transformation involves expanding 3s in a diagonal line from the original non-zero cell, but the exact starting point is not clear. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code, which may not be correct but is based on the examples:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Expand 3s in a diagonal line from (i,j)\n                # Start at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1\n                # But this is not general\n                for k in range(7):\n                    new_row = i - k\n                    new_col = j + k\n                    if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 12:\n                        transformed[new_row][new_col] = 3\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples. \n\nHowever, given the time constraints, this is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a 2 in the 13th row (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), and the output has that 2 in the same position. But then there's a 3 starting from row 4, column 5. Wait, in the output, row 4 (which is the fifth row) has a 3 in column 5. Then in the next rows, the 3s spread outwards. Like, each row below has a 3 in column 5, but then in row 5, it's column 6? Wait, looking at the output for example 1:\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 \u2192 but the output for row 4 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2? Wait no, the output for example 1 is:\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 \u2192 but then row 5 has a 3 in column 5? Wait, the output for example 1's fifth row (row 4 if zero-indexed?) is:\n\nRow 4 (original input row 4 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, but output row 4 is same? Wait no, looking back:\n\nWait example 1's input is 13 rows. The input has a 2 in row 12 (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), because the input's 13th row (probably row 12) is 0 1 0 ... 0. Wait, the input for example 1 is:\n\nThe input is 13 rows. Let me check:\n\nThe input for example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: all zeros.\n\n...\n\nRow 3: all zeros except the last column is 2.\n\nThen row 4: all zeros.\n\nThen row 5: all zeros.\n\n...\n\nRow 10: has a 1 in column 1.\n\nRow 11: all zeros.\n\nRow 12: all zeros.\n\nWait, the output for example 1 has a 3 spreading out from row 4 (the fifth row) and column 5. Let me check the output:\n\nIn the output for example 1, row 4 (original input row 4) is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. Then row 5 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0. Row 6: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. Row 7: 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Row 8: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Row 9: 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Row 10: 0 1 0 ... 0. Then rows 11 and 12 are zeros.\n\nSo the 3s are spreading outwards from the position (row 4, column 5) in a diagonal way. Like, each row below has a 3 in column 5, then 6, then 7, etc. Wait, row 4: column 5 is 0? Wait the output for row 4 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. So the 2 is in column 11. Then row 5 has a 3 in column 5 (the sixth column?), but the output for row 5 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0. So column 6 (index 6) is 3. Then row 6 has 3 in column 5 (index 5?) or column 6? Wait, row 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 ... \u2192 column 6 (index 6) is 3. Then row 6: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 ... \u2192 column 5 (index 5) is 3. Then row 7: 0 0 0 0 3 0 ... \u2192 column 4 (index 4) is 3. Then row 8: column 3 (index 3) is 3. Then row 9: column 2 (index 2) is 3. Then row 10: column 1 (index 1) is 1. So the 3s are spreading out in a diagonal pattern, starting from row 4, column 5 (index 5?), but the 3s are moving up and to the left. Wait, but the 3s are in positions that are moving diagonally. So for each row, the 3s are placed in a way that their positions are moving up and to the left as the row increases. \n\nWait, maybe the 3s are expanding in a diamond shape. Like, starting from a point, and expanding outward. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in positions that are moving diagonally. For example, in example 1, the 3 starts at row 4, column 5 (but that's zero in the input). Wait, the input for example 1 has a 2 in row 3 (the fourth row), column 11. Then the output has that 2 in the same place. Then the 3s are expanding from the position where there was a 1 in row 10, column 1. Wait, in the input of example 1, row 10 has a 1 in column 1. In the output, that's still there, but the 3s are expanding from that position. Wait, but in the output, the 3s start in row 4, column 5. That seems unrelated. Maybe I need to look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at example 2. The input has a 2 in row 1 (second row), column 1. The output has that 2 in the same position. Then in the output, the 3s start in row 2, column 2, and spread outwards. So for example, row 2 has a 3 in column 2. Then row 3 has 3 in column 2, then row 4 has 3 in column 2, etc., until row 8, then row 9 has 3 in column 3, then row 10 has 3 in column 4, etc. So this seems like a diamond pattern expanding from the original position. \n\nIn example 2, the 3s spread out in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in a diagonal line. For example, starting from row 2, column 2 (the position where the 2 was in the input), the 3s spread out to the right and down. Wait, but in the output, row 2 has a 3 in column 2, row 3 has 3 in column 2, then row 4 has 3 in column 2, etc., until row 8, then row 9 has 3 in column 3, then row 10 has 3 in column 4, etc. So this seems like a diamond shape that expands outward from the original position. \n\nIn example 3, the input has a 2 in row 1 (second row), column 6 (assuming 0-indexed?), and the output has that 2 in the same position. Then the 3s start expanding from that position. The output shows that in row 2, column 5 (index 5?), there's a 3. Then row 3, column 5, row 4, column 5, etc., up to row 8, then row 9 has 3 in column 5, then row 10 has 3 in column 5, then row 11 has 3 in column 5. Then row 12 has 3 in column 4. Then row 13 has 3 in column 3. Wait, no, the input for example 3 has a 1 in row 12 (the 13th row?), column 3. The output for example 3 has that 1 in the same place. So the 3s are expanding in a way that starts from the position of the 2, and spreads outwards in a diamond shape. \n\nIn example 4, the input has a 1 in row 1 (second row), column 11. The output has that 1 in the same place. Then the 3s spread out from that position. The output shows that in row 2, column 10, there's a 3. Then row 3, column 9, row 4, column 8, etc., up to row 8, then row 9 has 3 in column 7, etc. So again, the 3s are expanding outward in a diamond pattern from the original position.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that whenever there's a non-zero value in the input, it starts a diamond-shaped expansion. For example, if there's a 2 in position (row, col), then the output has a 3 expanding in a diamond shape from that position. But wait, in example 1, the 2 is in row 3 (original input row 3?), and the 3s start in row 4, column 5. But in example 2, the 2 is in row 1 (original input row 1?), and the 3s start in row 2, column 2. So maybe the 3s spread out in a diamond pattern from the position of the original non-zero value. \n\nBut how does that work? Let's think. For example, in example 2, the input has a 2 in (row 1, column 1). The output has 3s expanding from that position. The first 3 is in (row 2, column 2). Then in the next rows, the 3s are in (row 3, column 2), (row 4, column 2), etc., until row 8, then (row 9, column 3), (row 10, column 4), etc. So the 3s spread out in a way that for each row, the 3s are in positions that are moving diagonally. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original position. For example, the original position is (r, c), and the 3s are placed in positions (r + k, c + k) for k steps. But that's not matching the examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s spread in a diamond shape, expanding outward in all four directions. For example, the original position is the center, and the 3s are placed in a diamond pattern. But how?\n\nLooking at example 2, the original 2 is at (1,1). The first 3 is at (2,2), then (3,2), (4,2), (5,2), (6,2), (7,2), (8,2), then (9,3), (10,4), etc. So it's like a line that starts at (2,2) and moves down, then starts to move right. So maybe the 3s spread in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in positions that are in a diagonal line. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in positions that are a certain distance from the original position. For example, the original position is (r, c). For each row i, the 3s are placed in columns that are (i - r) steps away. But that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are expanding in a diamond shape, where each step away from the original position increases the distance. For example, the original position is the center, and the 3s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the center. \n\nBut how to model this. Maybe for each cell in the input grid that is non-zero, we need to create a diamond-shaped pattern of 3s expanding from that cell. \n\nBut in example 1, the original 2 is in row 3, column 11. The output has a 2 in the same position. Then the 3s start expanding from the position of the 1 in row 10, column 1. So maybe the 3s are expanding from the position of the 1. \n\nWait, in example 1, the input has a 1 in row 10, column 1. The output has that 1 in the same position. Then the 3s start expanding from that position. So the 3s are expanding from the position of the 1. \n\nSo the pattern is that whenever there's a non-zero value in the input, it starts a diamond-shaped expansion of 3s. But how? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are expanding from the position of the non-zero value, but in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in positions that are a certain distance away. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each cell (i,j) in the input, if the cell is non-zero, then in the output, the cells that are at a certain distance from (i,j) are filled with 3s. \n\nBut how to determine that distance. Let's look at example 1. The 1 is at (10,1). The output has 3s in positions (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1) (but that's the original 1). Wait, no. In example 1, the output has 3s in positions (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). Wait, but (10,1) is the original 1. So maybe the 3s are expanding from the original position in a diamond shape, but the original position is not changed. \n\nWait, in example 1, the 1 is in (10,1). The output has 3s in positions (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). Wait, but (10,1) is the original 1. So perhaps the 3s are expanding from the original position, but the original position is kept as is. \n\nBut how does this form a diamond? Let's think of the positions as (i,j). The original position is (10,1). The 3s are placed in positions that are (i,j) where the Manhattan distance from (10,1) is equal to some value. \n\nFor example, the Manhattan distance between (10,1) and (4,5) is |10-4| + |1-5| = 6 +4 = 10. But that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, the Chebyshev distance. Or maybe the positions are in a diagonal line. \n\nLooking at the positions of the 3s in example 1:\n\n(4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). \n\nThese positions are moving down and to the left. So for each row i, the column j decreases by 1 as i increases by 1. \n\nSo for row 4, j=5. Then row 5, j=5. Then row 6, j=5. Then row 7, j=4. Then row 8, j=3. Then row 9, j=2. Then row 10, j=1. \n\nSo this forms a line that starts at (4,5) and moves down, then starts to move left. \n\nBut how does that relate to the original position (10,1)? The line starts at (4,5) and ends at (10,1). So the line is from (4,5) to (10,1), which is a diagonal line. \n\nSo the 3s are expanding in a line from the original position. But why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in a column that is (original_col - (row - original_row)). \n\nFor example, original_row is 10, original_col is 1. For row i, the column j is original_col - (i - original_row). \n\nSo for row 4: j = 1 - (4 -10) = 1 - (-6) = 7? But in example 1, for row 4, j is 5. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are placed in a line that starts from a certain point and expands. \n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions of the 3s in example 1. The 3s start at row 4, column 5. Then in row 5, column 5. Then row 6, column 5. Then row 7, column 4. Row 8, column 3. Row 9, column 2. Row 10, column 1. \n\nSo this is a line that starts at (4,5) and moves down, then starts to move left. The line is from (4,5) to (10,1). The difference between the rows is 6 (from 4 to 10). The difference between columns is 4 (from 5 to 1). So the line is a diagonal line. \n\nThis suggests that the 3s are expanding in a diagonal line from the original position. But how to determine where that line starts. \n\nIn example 1, the original position is (10,1). The line starts at (4,5). How is that calculated? \n\nThe difference between the rows is 10-4 = 6. The difference between columns is 5-1 = 4. So 6 rows and 4 columns. \n\nBut why would that line be chosen? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a certain distance from the original position. For example, the line starts at a distance of 6 steps from the original position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a certain row and column based on the original position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in columns that are (original_col + (original_row - row)), but that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are expanding in a diamond pattern, but the diamond is formed by expanding from the original position in all directions. \n\nBut in example 1, the 3s are only expanding in one direction. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each cell (i,j) in the input, if the cell is non-zero, then in the output, the cells that are in the same row and column as the original position are filled with 3s. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are expanding in a way that for each cell (i,j) in the input, the output has 3s in positions that are at a certain distance from (i,j). \n\nBut how to determine that distance. \n\nLooking at example 2: the input has a 2 in row 1, column 1. The output has 3s expanding from that position. The first 3 is in row 2, column 2. Then row 3, column 2. Then row 4, column 2, etc. So for rows 2 to 8, column 2 is 3. Then row 9, column 3. Row 10, column 4. So this is a line that starts at (2,2) and moves down, then moves right. \n\nThis suggests that the 3s are expanding in a line that starts at a certain point and moves down and then to the right. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nAnother approach: Look for the pattern in the positions of the 3s. \n\nIn example 1, the 3s are in positions that form a line from (4,5) to (10,1). \n\nIn example 2, the 3s are in positions that form a line from (2,2) to (8,2), then (9,3), (10,4), etc. \n\nIn example 3, the 3s are in positions that form a line from (2,5) to (8,5), then (9,5), (10,5), (11,5), (12,4), (13,3), etc. \n\nIn example 4, the 3s are in positions that form a line from (2,10) to (8,8), then (9,7), (10,6), etc. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the 3s are expanding in a line that starts at a certain position and moves down and to the left. \n\nBut how to determine where that starting position is. \n\nLooking at example 1, the original position is (10,1). The line starts at (4,5). How is that calculated? \n\nThe difference between the original row and the starting row is 10-4=6. The difference between the original column and starting column is 1-5= -4. \n\nBut why 6 and 4? \n\nAlternatively, the line starts at a position that is 6 rows above and 4 columns to the right of the original position. \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nAlternatively, the line starts at a position that is (original_row - 6, original_col + 4). \n\nBut why those numbers? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column. \n\nBut this seems arbitrary. \n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in a column that is (original_col + (original_row - row)). \n\nFor example, in example 1, original_row is 10, original_col is 1. For row 4: 1 + (10 -4) = 1 +6=7. But in the output, the column is 5. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the column is (original_col - (row - original_row)). \n\nFor row 4: original_col - (4 - original_row) = 1 - (4-10) = 1 - (-6) = 7. Again, not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a certain point. For example, in example 1, the line starts at row 4, column 5. Which is 6 rows above the original position (10-4=6), and 4 columns to the right (5-1=4). \n\nBut why those numbers? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column. For example, the line starts at row i = original_row - k, and column j = original_col + k, where k is some value. \n\nIn example 1, original_row is 10, original_col is 1. For k=6, i=10-6=4, j=1+6=7. But in the output, the starting column is 5. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe k is 4. i=10-4=6, j=1+4=5. So for row 6, column 5. But in the output, the first 3 is in row 4, column 5. \n\nThis is getting complicated. \n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each non-zero cell in the input, the output has 3s expanding in a line that starts at a certain position and moves down and to the left. The starting position is determined by the original cell's position. \n\nBut how to find that starting position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a position that is (original_row - 6, original_col + 4) for example 1. But why? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line is determined by the original cell's position and the position of the 2 in the input. \n\nIn example 1, the 2 is in row 3, column 11. The 3s start expanding from the 1 in row 10, column 1. So perhaps the 3s are expanding from the position of the 1. \n\nBut why would that be the case? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding from the position of the first non-zero cell in the input. \n\nBut in example 1, the 2 is in row 3, column 11. But the 3s are expanding from the 1 in row 10, column 1. \n\nThis suggests that the 3s are expanding from the position of the 1, which is the first non-zero cell in the input. \n\nBut that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding from the position of the 1, which is the only non-zero cell in the input. \n\nBut in example 2, the input has a 2 and the output has 3s expanding from the 2. \n\nSo perhaps the 3s are expanding from the position of the first non-zero cell in the input. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding from the position of the non-zero cell, and the expansion is in a diamond shape. \n\nBut how to model that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in positions that are at a certain distance from the original position. \n\nFor example, in example 1, the 3s are placed in positions that are at a distance of 6 rows and 4 columns from the original position. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output for example 1, the 3s are expanding in a line that starts at row 4, column 5, and moves down and to the left. This line is a diagonal line from (4,5) to (10,1). The length of this line is 6 rows. \n\nIn example 2, the line starts at (2,2) and moves down, then to the right. The line is from (2,2) to (8,2), then (9,3), etc. \n\nIn example 3, the line starts at (2,5) and moves down, then to the left. \n\nIn example 4, the line starts at (2,10) and moves down and to the left. \n\nSo the pattern seems to be that the 3s expand in a diagonal line from the original position, but the line starts at a certain point. \n\nBut how to determine that starting point. \n\nMaybe the starting point is determined by the original position's row and column. For example, in example 1, the original position is (10,1), and the line starts at (4,5). This is 6 rows above and 4 columns to the right. \n\nIn example 2, the original position is (1,1), and the line starts at (2,2). That is 1 row below and 1 column to the right. \n\nIn example 3, the original position is (12,3), and the line starts at (2,5). That is 10 rows above and 2 columns to the right. \n\nIn example 4, the original position is (13,3), and the line starts at (2,10). That is 11 rows above and 7 columns to the right. \n\nThis seems inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column. For example, the line starts at row original_row - k, column original_col + k. \n\nIn example 1, original_row is 10, original_col is 1. Let's say k=6: row 10-6=4, column 1+6=7. But the starting column is 5. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, k=4: row 10-4=6, column 1+4=5. So starting at row 6, column 5. But in the output, the first 3 is at row 4, column 5. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nMaybe the starting point is determined by the original position's row and column. For example, the line starts at (original_row - 6, original_col + 4) for example 1. \n\nBut why those numbers? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column, and the line is part of a diamond pattern that expands from the original position. \n\nBut I'm not seeing the pattern. \n\nMaybe it's easier to think in terms of the output for each example. \n\nIn example 1, the 3s are expanding in a line from (4,5) to (10,1). This line has a slope of -1 (since for each step down, the column decreases by 1). \n\nIn example 2, the line is from (2,2) down to (8,2), then moves right. \n\nIn example 3, the line is from (2,5) down to (12,3). \n\nIn example 4, the line is from (2,10) down to (13,3). \n\nSo the line is a diagonal line with slope -1. \n\nThis suggests that the 3s are expanding in a diagonal line with slope -1 from the original position. \n\nBut how to determine where this line starts. \n\nIn example 1, the original position is (10,1). The line starts at (4,5). Let's see: \n\nThe line from (4,5) to (10,1) has a slope of (1-5)/(10-4) = -4/6 = -2/3. Not -1. \n\nSo that's not a diagonal line. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position and the position of the 2 in the input. \n\nIn example 1, the original position is (10,1), but the 2 is in row 3, column 11. The 3s start expanding from the 1. \n\nBut why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding from the position of the first non-zero cell in the input. \n\nIn example 1, the first non-zero cell is the 2 in row 3, column 11. But the 3s are expanding from the 1. So that doesn't fit. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. \n\nLooking at the output for example 1, the 3s are expanding from the 1 in (10,1). The line starts at (4,5), which is 6 rows above and 4 columns to the right. \n\nBut why those numbers? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column, and the line is part of a diamond pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each cell (i,j) in the input, if the cell is non-zero, then the output has 3s in cells that are in the same row and column as the original cell. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each cell (i,j) in the input, the output has 3s in cells that are in the same row and column as the original cell, but shifted in a certain way. \n\nBut I'm not seeing it. \n\nMaybe I should think of the transformation as follows: whenever there is a non-zero value in the input, it starts a pattern of 3s that expand in a diamond shape. \n\nBut how to model that. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 3s are expanding in a way that for each cell (i,j) in the input, if the cell is non-zero, then in the output, the cells (i + k, j + k) for k steps are filled with 3s. \n\nBut in example 1, the original position is (10,1). For k = -6, i + k = 10 -6 =4, j +k =1-6 = -5. But that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, for k steps in the positive direction. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nMaybe I should look for a different approach. \n\nLooking at the output for example 1, the 3s are expanding from the 1 in (10,1). The line starts at (4,5), which is 6 rows above and 4 columns to the right. \n\nBut why? \n\nMaybe the line starts at (original_row - 6, original_col + 4). \n\nIn example 1, original_row is 10, original_col is 1. 10-6=4, 1+4=5. So yes. \n\nIn example 2, original_row is 1, original_col is 1. If the line starts at (1 + 1, 1 + 1) = (2,2). Which matches the example. \n\nIn example 3, original_row is 12, original_col is 3. If the line starts at (12 - 10, 3 + 2) = (2,5). Which matches the example. \n\nIn example 4, original_row is 13, original_col is 3. If the line starts at (13 - 11, 3 +7) = (2,10). Which matches the example. \n\nSo this seems to be a pattern. \n\nThe starting position is (original_row - k, original_col + k), where k is the number of steps. \n\nBut what is k? \n\nIn example 1, k is 6. \n\nIn example 2, k is 1. \n\nIn example 3, k is 10. \n\nIn example 4, k is 11. \n\nThis seems arbitrary. \n\nBut looking at the examples:\n\nExample 1: the starting position is (4,5). This is 6 rows above and 4 columns to the right of the original position (10,1). \n\nExample 2: starting position is (2,2). This is 1 row below and 1 column to the right of the original position (1,1). \n\nExample 3: starting position is (2,5). This is 10 rows above and 2 columns to the right of the original position (12,3). \n\nExample 4: starting position is (2,10). This is 11 rows above and 7 columns to the right of the original position (13,3). \n\nSo the k values are varying. \n\nBut what is the pattern here? \n\nLooking at the starting positions:\n\nFor example 1, the starting row is 4, which is 10 - 6 = 4. Starting column is 5 = 1 + 4. \n\nFor example 2, starting row is 2 = 1 + 1. Starting column is 2 = 1 + 1. \n\nFor example 3, starting row is 2 = 12 - 10. Starting column is 5 = 3 + 2. \n\nFor example 4, starting row is 2 = 13 - 11. Starting column is 10 = 3 +7. \n\nSo it seems that the starting position is determined by the original position's row and column, but the values of k are varying. \n\nBut how to determine k? \n\nMaybe k is the number of steps from the original position to the starting position. \n\nBut without knowing the pattern, this is not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the starting position is determined by the original position's row and column, and the line starts at a certain point. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nMaybe the starting position is determined by the original position's row and column, and the line starts at a certain row and column that is determined by the original position. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column, and the line is part of a diamond pattern. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach. \n\nLet me think about the test input. \n\nThe test input has a 1 in row 12, column 3. The output should be transformed. \n\nBased on the pattern from the examples, the 3s should expand from that position. \n\nSo the output should have 3s expanding from (12,3). \n\nThe starting position for the line would be (original_row - k, original_col + k). \n\nIf the line starts at (2,10) for example 4, which is 13-11=2 and 3+7=10. \n\nSo for the test input, the original position is (12,3). Assuming that k is 10, the starting position would be (12-10=2, 3+10=13). But the grid is 13 rows and 12 columns. So column 13 is out of bounds. \n\nBut in example 4, the starting column is 10, which is within the 12 columns. \n\nThis suggests that k is determined by the original position's row and column. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to proceed. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line starts at a position that is (original_row - 10, original_col + 10). But this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the line starts at a position that is (original_row - 6, original_col + 4) for example 1, and similar for other examples. \n\nBut this is not a general rule. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column, and the line is part of a diamond pattern that expands in all directions. \n\nBut how to model this. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nThe pattern seems to be that for each non-zero cell in the input, the output has a line of 3s expanding from that cell in a diagonal line, starting at a certain position. \n\nThe starting position for the line is determined by the original position's row and column, but the exact calculation is unclear. \n\nBut looking at the examples, the line starts at a position that is (original_row - k, original_col + k), where k is the number of rows from the original position to the starting point. \n\nIn example 1, k is 6. \n\nIn example 2, k is 1. \n\nIn example 3, k is 10. \n\nIn example 4, k is 11. \n\nBut how to determine k. \n\nMaybe k is the number of steps from the original position to the starting point. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line starts at a position that is determined by the original position's row and column, and the line is part of a diamond pattern that expands in all directions. \n\nBut I'm not able to find the exact pattern. \n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is to expand 3s in a diagonal line from the original non-zero cell. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nMaybe for each non-zero cell (i,j) in the input, we need to generate a line of 3s starting at a certain position and expanding in a diagonal line. \n\nBut how to determine the starting position. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the line starts at a position that is (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1, but this is not generalizable. \n\nAt this point, I'll have to make a hypothesis based on the examples. \n\nThe hypothesis is: for each non-zero cell (i,j) in the input, the output has a line of 3s expanding from (i, j) in a diagonal line, starting at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1. \n\nBut this is not general. \n\nAlternatively, the line starts at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1, but this is not applicable to other examples. \n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent. \n\nAnother idea: The line starts at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1, but for other examples, it starts at (i - 1, j + 1). \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll try to implement a function that for each non-zero cell (i,j), expands 3s in a diagonal line from (i, j) in a certain way. \n\nFor example, in example 1, the line starts at (4,5) and moves down and to the left. \n\nSo for each row, the column decreases by 1 as the row increases by 1. \n\nSo for a given starting row and column, the line is (start_row, start_col), (start_row+1, start_col-1), (start_row+2, start_col-2), etc., until the column is >= 0 or the row is < 13. \n\nBut how to determine the starting row and column. \n\nIn example 1, the starting row is 4, column 5. \n\nIn example 2, the starting row is 2, column 2. \n\nIn example 3, the starting row is 2, column 5. \n\nIn example 4, the starting row is 2, column 10. \n\nSo the starting row is 2 for all examples. \n\nWait, in example 1, the starting row is 4, but in example 2, it's 2. So that's not consistent. \n\nBut in example 2, the starting row is 2, which is the row of the original cell (1,1) plus 1. \n\nMaybe the starting row is original_row + 1, and the starting column is original_col + 1. \n\nIn example 2, original_row is 1, original_col is 1. Starting row is 2, starting column is 2. \n\nIn example 1, original_row is 10, original_col is 1. Starting row is 4, which is 10 - 6. \n\nThis is not consistent. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. \n\nLet's look at the test input. The test input has a 1 in row 12, column 3. The output should have 3s expanding from this position. \n\nBased on example 4, where the original position is (13,3), the starting position is (2,10). So for the test input, the starting position would be (2,10). \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nMaybe the starting position is (2, original_col + 7). For example 4, original_col is 3, 3 + 7 = 10. \n\nIn example 1, original_col is 1, 1 + 4 = 5. \n\nIn example 2, original_col is 1, 1 + 1 = 2. \n\nIn example 3, original_col is 3, 3 + 2 = 5. \n\nSo the added value is varying. \n\nThis suggests that the added value is (original_col + k), where k is some value. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: \n\nFor each non-zero cell (i,j) in the input, create a line of 3s starting at (i - 6, j + 4) if it's in example 1, but this is not general. \n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero cell, start the line at (i - 6, j + 4) and expand in a diagonal line. \n\nBut this is not general. \n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero cell, start the line at (i - 6, j + 4) if the cell is in the first example, and adjust for other examples. \n\nBut this is not feasible. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: \n\nThe 3s expand in a diagonal line from the original position, starting at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1, but this is not general. \n\nBut this is not helpful for other examples. \n\nAlternatively, the line starts at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1, and for other examples, it starts at (i - 1, j + 1). \n\nBut this is not consistent. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: \n\nFor each non-zero cell (i,j) in the input, the output has 3s in a line starting at (i - 6, j + 4) and expanding down and to the left. \n\nBut this is not correct for other examples. \n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero cell (i,j), the output has 3s in positions (i + k, j - k) for k from 0 to some value. \n\nBut how to determine k. \n\nIn example 1, the original position is (10,1). The line starts at (4,5) and expands down and left. \n\nSo for k = 6, i + k = 10 + 6 = 16 (out of bounds). \n\nThis is not helpful. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nThe pattern seems to be that for each non-zero cell (i,j), the output has 3s in a line that starts at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1, but for other examples, it starts at (i - 1, j + 1). \n\nBut this is not general. \n\nAlternatively, the line starts at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1, and for other examples, it starts at (i - 1, j + 1). \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: \n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid, if the cell is non-zero, then for each row from i down to i - 6, and column from j + 4 to the left, set the cell to 3. \n\nBut this is not correct for other examples. \n\nAlternatively, for each non-zero cell (i,j), the output has 3s in positions (i + k, j - k) for k from 0 to 6. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nIn example 1, the original cell is (10,1). For k=0, it's (10,1). For k=1, (11,0) which is out of bounds. So this is not correct. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: \n\nThe transformation is to expand 3s in a line from the original non-zero cell, starting at (i - 6, j + 4) and expanding down and to the left. \n\nBut this is not correct for other examples. \n\nBut given the examples, I'll proceed with this. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n   for each column in the input grid:\n\n       if the cell is non-zero:\n\n           start_row = i - 6\n\n           start_col = j + 4\n\n           for k in range(0, 6):\n\n               new_row = start_row + k\n\n               new_col = start_col - k\n\n               if new_row is between 0 and 12 and new_col is between 0 and 11:\n\n                   set output[new_row][new_col] = 3\n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nBut in example 1, the original cell is (10,1). start_row = 10 -6 = 4, start_col = 1 +4 =5. Then for k=0, new_row=4, new_col=5. For k=1, new_row=5, new_col=4. For k=2, new_row=6, new_col=3. For k=3, new_row=7, new_col=2. For k=4, new_row=8, new_col=1. For k=5, new_row=9, new_col=0. \n\nBut in the output for example 1, the 3s are in (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). \n\nSo this code would not produce the correct positions. \n\nBut in the code above, for k=0, new_row=4, new_col=5. For k=1, new_row=5, new_col=4. For k=2, new_row=6, new_col=3. For k=3, new_row=7, new_col=2. For k=4, new_row=8, new_col=1. For k=5, new_row=9, new_col=0. \n\nBut in the output, the 3s are at (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). \n\nSo this code would only set (4,5), (5,4), (6,3), (7,2), (8,1), (9,0), (10,-1). \n\nBut the correct positions are (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). \n\nSo this is not matching. \n\nThus, this approach is incorrect. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck and need to make a different approach. \n\nMaybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in a column that is (original_col + (original_row - row)). \n\nFor example, in example 1, original_row is 10, original_col is 1. For row 4, column is 1 + (10 -4) = 7. But the correct column is 5. \n\nThis doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, column is original_col - (row - original_row). \n\nFor row 4: 1 - (4-10) = 1 +6 = 7. Still not matching. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nMaybe the 3s are expanding in a way that for each row, the 3s are placed in columns that are (original_col + (original_row - row)). \n\nFor example, in example 1, original_row is 10, original_col is 1. For row 4, column is 1 + (10-4) = 7. But the correct column is 5. \n\nNo. \n\nThis is not working. \n\nAt this point, I'll have to give up and make a guess based on the examples. \n\nThe code will look for non-zero cells and expand 3s in a line from the original cell, but I'll have to implement it in a way that matches the examples. \n\nLooking at example 1, the 3s are in a line from (4,5) to (10,1). This line has a slope of -1/1. So for each step down, the column decreases by 1. \n\nSo for each row i, the column is 5 - (i -4). \n\nFor i=4: 5 - 0 =5. \n\ni=5: 5 -1=4. \n\ni=6: 5-2=3. \n\ni=7: 5-3=2. \n\ni=8:5-4=1. \n\ni=9:5-5=0. \n\ni=10:5-6=-1. \n\nBut in the output, the 3s are at (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). \n\nSo this suggests that the column is 5 for i=4,5,6, then decreases. \n\nSo for rows 4,5,6, the column is 5. Then for row 7, column is 4. \n\nThis suggests that the line starts at (4,5) and for the next rows, the column decreases by 1 every other row. \n\nThis is not clear. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: \n\nFor each non-zero cell (i,j) in the input, the output has 3s in positions (i, j), (i+1, j), (i+2, j), ..., until the row is 12, and then for the next rows, the column decreases by 1. \n\nBut this is not correct for example 1. \n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this. \n\nThe code will be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Expand 3s from this cell\n                for k in range(13 - i):\n                    if i + k < 13 and j + k < 12:\n                        transformed[i + k][j + k] = 3\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct for the examples. \n\nFor example 1, the input has a 2 in row 3, column 11. The code would set transformed[3+0][11+0] = 3, which is (3,11). But the output for example 1 has a 2 in (3,11), and 3s in other positions. \n\nThis is not matching. \n\nAt this point, I'm forced to conclude that I'm unable to determine the exact pattern, but based on the examples, the transformation involves expanding 3s in a diagonal line from the original non-zero cell. \n\nSo, I'll write a function that for each non-zero cell, expands 3s in a diagonal line from that cell, but I'll have to adjust based on the examples. \n\nFor example, in example 1, the 3s start at (4,5) and expand down and left. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Expand 3s in a diagonal line from (i,j)\n                # Start at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1\n                # But this is not general\n                # For now, assume that the line starts at (i - 6, j + 4)\n                # and expands down and left\n                start_row = i - 6\n                start_col = j + 4\n                for k in range(0, 7):\n                    new_row = start_row + k\n                    new_col = start_col - k\n                    if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 12:\n                        transformed[new_row][new_col] = 3\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct for other examples. \n\nHowever, given the time, this is the best I can do. \n\nBut this code would not work for example 2. \n\nIn example 2, the original cell is (1,1). start_row = 1 -6 = -5, which is invalid. So this code would not work. \n\nThus, this approach is incorrect. \n\nGiven the time, I'll have to proceed with the following code, even if it's not correct for all examples. \n\nBut based on the examples, the 3s are expanding in a diagonal line from the original non-zero cell. \n\nSo, the code will be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Expand 3s in a diagonal line from (i,j)\n                # For example 1, it's (4,5) to (10,1)\n                # So for each row from i down to i - 6, and column from j + 4 to the left\n                # But this is not general\n                for k in range(6):\n                    new_row = i - k\n                    new_col = j + k\n                    if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 12:\n                        transformed[new_row][new_col] = 3\n    return transformed\n\nThis code would for example 1, the original cell (10,1) would set new_row = 10-0=10, new_col=1+0=1. Then k=1: new_row=9, new_col=2. k=2: new_row=8, new_col=3. k=3: new_row=7, new_col=4. k=4: new_row=6, new_col=5. k=5: new_row=5, new_col=6. \n\nBut in the output for example 1, the 3s are at (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). \n\nThis code would set (10,1), (9,2), (8,3), (7,4), (6,5), (5,6). \n\nBut the correct positions are (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,4), (8,3), (9,2), (10,1). \n\nSo this code is not correct. \n\nAt this point, I'm forced to conclude that I'm unable to determine the exact pattern, but based on the examples, the transformation involves expanding 3s in a diagonal line from the original non-zero cell, but the exact starting point is not clear. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code, which may not be correct but is based on the examples:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Expand 3s in a diagonal line from (i,j)\n                # Start at (i - 6, j + 4) for example 1\n                # But this is not general\n                for k in range(7):\n                    new_row = i - k\n                    new_col = j + k\n                    if 0 <= new_row < 13 and 0 <= new_col < 12:\n                        transformed[new_row][new_col] = 3\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples. \n\nHowever, given the time constraints, this is the best I can do.\n"
