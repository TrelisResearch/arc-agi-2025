          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 19x19. The input has some numbers, and the output has some numbers that look similar but with changes. For instance, looking at the first row of the input and output:\n\nInput first row: 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0\nOutput first row: same as input. So maybe the first row isn't changed. But looking at other rows, like the seventh row of input and output:\n\nInput seventh row: 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput seventh row: 0 5 0 5 2 4 7 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\nSo here, the 5th element (index 4?) was 2 in input, but in output it's 2. Wait, maybe I'm getting the indices wrong. Let me check. The input row is 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 5 0 5 2 4 7 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. So the fifth element (index 4?) is 2, but in the output, the sixth element (index 5?) is 4, and the seventh (index 6?) is 7. Hmm, maybe there's some pattern here. Maybe numbers are being replaced with other numbers based on their position or neighboring cells.\n\nLooking at the seventh row of input and output, the original numbers are 2, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Wait, maybe not. Let me check the exact positions. Let me think of the seventh row of input as:\n\nOriginal input row: [0,5,0,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row: [0,5,0,5,2,4,7,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the fifth element (index 4) is 2, same as input. The sixth (index 5) is 4, seventh (index 6) is 7. Then the next elements are 5, 0, etc. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced with other numbers based on some rule. For example, maybe numbers in certain positions are being replaced with the sum of their neighbors or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, maybe numbers in certain positions are being replaced with a value based on their row or column. But that seems too vague.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, there are some 7s and 4s. For instance, in the seventh row, the sixth and seventh elements are 4 and 7. Also, in the eighth row of example 1's output, the sixth element is 2, and the seventh is 7. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced with numbers based on their position in the grid. Or maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being replaced with numbers that are the sum of their adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with other numbers based on some rule. For example, in example 1, the input has a 2 in some positions, and the output has 2, 4, 7, etc. Maybe the numbers are being replaced with the sum of their neighbors, or some other operation.\n\nLooking at example 2, the input has a 2 in some positions, and the output has 2, 4, 7, etc. For example, in the second row of example 2's input:\n\nInput row: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 5 5 5 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 7 5 5 0 0 0\nSo the 13th element (index 12) is 5 in input, but in output it's 7. Hmm. Maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being replaced with numbers that are the sum of their neighbors. For example, if a cell is surrounded by certain numbers, it's replaced with a sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with a value based on their position. For example, in example 1, the seventh row's sixth element (index 5) is 4, and the seventh element (index 6) is 7. Maybe these numbers are being replaced based on their row and column. For example, if a cell is in row i and column j, then the value is some function of i and j. But that's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers in certain positions with a value that's the sum of their adjacent cells. For example, in example 1, the seventh row's sixth element (index 5) is 4. Let's check the surrounding cells. The cell at (6,5) in the input is 5 (original input row 6, which is the seventh row, index 5). Wait, maybe I'm getting the indices wrong. Let me think of the grid as rows and columns. Let's take the seventh row of example 1's input. The original input row is:\n\nOriginal input row: 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the elements are:\n\nindex 0: 0\n\nindex 1:5\n\nindex 2:0\n\nindex 3:5\n\nindex 4:2\n\nindex 5:5\n\nindex 6:5\n\nindex 7:5\n\nindex 8:0\n\nindex 9:0\n\nindex 10:0\n\nindex 11:0\n\nindex 12:5\n\nindex 13:5\n\nindex 14:0\n\nindex 15:0\n\nindex 16:0\n\nindex 17:0\n\nindex 18:0\n\nIn the output row, the same row is:\n\n0 5 0 5 2 4 7 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo index 5 is 4, index 6 is 7. Let me check the surrounding cells. For index 5 (row 6, column 5), what's around it? Let's look at the cells in row 6, columns 4, 5, 6, and also the cells in row 5 and 7.\n\nIn the input, row 5 (original input row 5) is:\n\n5 0 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo row 5, column 5 is 0. Row 6, column 5 is 5. Row 7, column 5 is 5 (from input row 7: 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, row 7 is the seventh row? Or maybe I'm mixing up the rows. Let me clarify: the input is 19x19. The first example's input is 19 rows. The seventh row of input is the one that's being transformed. Let me think of the seventh row as row index 6 (since Python is 0-based). So row 6, column 5 is 5. The cell at row 6, column 5 is 5. What's around it?\n\nLooking at the cell at (6,5), which is 5. The surrounding cells would be:\n\n(5,5) which is row 5, column 5: 0.\n\n(6,4): row 6, column 4: 2.\n\n(6,6): row 6, column 6: 5.\n\n(7,5): row 7, column 5: 5 (from input row 7: 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. So column 5 is 5.\n\nSo the surrounding cells are 0, 2, 5, 5. The sum is 0+2+5+5 = 12. But the output for this cell is 4. That doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe it's the average? 12/4=3. Not 4. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell is replaced with the sum of the cells in the same row and column. But that's unclear.\n\nLooking at example 2's output, there's a 7 in some positions. For example, in example 2's output, the second row's 13th element (index 12) is 7. Let me check the input for that cell. The input row 1 (second row) is:\n\n0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 5 5 5 0 0 0\n\nSo the 12th element (index 12) is 2. The output is 7. Maybe that's the sum of some cells. For example, the cell at (1,12) is 2. The surrounding cells: let's check the cells around it. Maybe the sum of the cells in the same row and column? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with a value based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the outputs. For example, in example 1, the output has some 7s and 4s. In example 2, there are 7s and 4s. In example 3, there are 7s and 4s. So maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being replaced with 4 or 7 based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their adjacent cells. For example, in example 1, the cell at (6,5) is 5. The sum of adjacent cells is 0 (from row 5, column 5) + 2 (row 6, column 4) + 5 (row 6, column 6) + 5 (row 7, column 5) = 12. But the output is 4. That doesn't match. Maybe it's the sum divided by something. 12/3=4. Hmm, maybe. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their neighboring cells. But how to determine that.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the seventh row's sixth element is 4. Let me check the surrounding cells again. Maybe the sum of the cells in the same row and column. For example, in row 6, the cells around column 5. The row is 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. So the sum of the row from column 4 to 6 is 2 +5 +5 = 12. But that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their adjacent cells in the same row and column. For example, the cell at (6,5) is 5. The adjacent cells in the same row would be (6,4)=2, (6,6)=5. In the same column, (5,5)=0, (7,5)=5. Sum is 2+5+0+5 = 12. But output is 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their neighbors in a certain way. For example, if a cell is in a certain pattern, like a 2 in the input, then it's replaced with 2, but if it's surrounded by certain numbers, it's replaced with 4 or 7.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where the numbers change. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the original input has a 2 in column 4 (index 4). The output has the same 2. But the next elements are 4 and 7. Maybe these are positions that are part of a certain pattern, like being in a diagonal or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, then it's replaced with a certain value. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd. But that's hard to see.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. For example, the first row of input is 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. The output is 0 0 7 7 7 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. So the third and fourth elements (indices 2 and 3) are 5 in input, but in output they are 7. Maybe those positions are being replaced with 7. Similarly, in the third row of example 3's input, the first element is 5, and in the output it's 5. But the third element is 5 in input and 7 in output. So maybe certain positions are being replaced with 7 based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with a certain value based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. For example, if the row is even, then replace certain cells with 7. But how to determine which cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in their row and column. For example, for a cell (i,j), the sum of the row i and column j. But that seems too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column, but only for certain cells. For example, if the cell is part of a certain pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 7s and 4s in certain positions. For example, in the seventh row, the sixth and seventh elements are 4 and 7. In the eighth row, the sixth element is 2 and the seventh is 7. Maybe these positions are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in row 6 (seventh row) and column 5 or 6, then it's replaced with 4 or 7.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their neighbors in a certain way. For example, in example 1, the cell (6,5) is 5, and the output is 4. Maybe the sum of the neighbors is 12, and 12 mod something is 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column, but only for certain cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column, but only if the original number is 2. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the original number is 2, and the output is 2. But in other positions, like the sixth and seventh elements, which are 5 in input, they are replaced with 4 and 7. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the outputs. For example, in example 1's output, the seventh row has 4 and 7 in positions that are adjacent to each other. Similarly, in example 2, there are 7s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with a value based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 4 or 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column. For example, for a cell (i,j), the sum of the row i and column j, then take that sum modulo something. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column, but only for certain cells. For example, if the cell is in a certain position, like the middle of the grid.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's try to think of another approach. Let's look at the outputs of the three examples and see if there's a common pattern.\n\nIn example 1, the output has 7s and 4s in certain positions. In example 2, there are 7s and 4s. In example 3, there are 7s and 4s. So maybe the transformation is replacing certain cells with 4 or 7 based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 4 or 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column. For example, for a cell (i,j), the sum of the row i and column j, then take that sum modulo 10. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column, but only if the original number is 2. For example, in example 1, the seventh row has a 2 in the fourth column (index 4), and the output has the same 2. But other cells are replaced with 4 and 7.\n\nAnother idea: looking for patterns in the outputs. For example, in example 1's output, the seventh row has 4 and 7 in positions that are adjacent to each other. Maybe those positions are being replaced based on some rule related to their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in their immediate neighbors. For example, for a cell (i,j), the value is the sum of the cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), and then take that sum modulo 10. Let's test this.\n\nIn example 1's seventh row, the cell at (6,5) is 5. Let's look at its neighbors. The cell to the left (6,4) is 2, to the right (6,6) is 5. Above (5,5) is 0, below (7,5) is 5. Sum is 2+5+0+5 = 12. 12 mod 10 is 2. But the output is 4. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the four neighbors plus the original cell. For example, 2+5+0+5+5 = 17 mod 10 is 7. But the output is 4. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the four neighbors, but divided by something. 12/3=4. That would give 4. So maybe that's the rule. But how to know.\n\nAnother example: in example 2's second row, the cell at (1,12) is 2 in input. The output is 7. Let's check the neighbors. The cell (1,12) is in row 1, column 12. The neighbors are (0,12), (2,12), (1,11), (1,13). Let's assume the input for row 0, column 12 is 5 (from example 2's input row 0: 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5. So column 12 is 5. Row 2, column 12: input row 2 is 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 5 5 2 5 5 0 5 0 0 0. So column 12 is 2. Row 1, column 11 is 2, column 13 is 5. So the sum of neighbors is 5 (row 0,12) + 2 (row 2,12) + 2 (row 1,11) + 5 (row 1,13) = 14. 14 divided by something gives 7. 14/2=7. So maybe the rule is sum of neighbors divided by 2, rounded down. But how to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing the cell with the sum of the four neighboring cells. For example, in example 1's seventh row, cell (6,5) has neighbors sum 12. If that's the case, then 12 would be replaced with 12, but the output is 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing the cell with the sum of the neighbors, but only if the original cell is 2. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the original cell is 2. The sum of the neighbors is 12, but the output is 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let's look for patterns in the outputs of the three examples.\n\nIn example 1, the output has 7s and 4s in certain positions. In example 2, there are 7s and 4s. In example 3, there are 7s and 4s. So maybe the transformation is replacing certain cells with 4 or 7 based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 4 or 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, then it's replaced with 4 or 7. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the sixth and seventh elements are replaced with 4 and 7. Maybe those positions are in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on the position of the cell in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 4 or 7. For example, in example 1, the seventh row (row index 6) has some cells replaced with 4 and 7. Maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on whether the row and column indices are even or odd. For example, if the sum of row and column is even, replace with 4, else 7. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, replace with 7. But how to determine the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on the original number. For example, if the original number is 2, replace with 2. If it's 5, replace with 4 or 7 based on some condition.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the seventh row has a 2 in the fourth column, which is the same as the input. The fifth column is 4, sixth is 7. Maybe these positions are part of a pattern where certain cells are replaced with 4 or 7 based on their position.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Maybe I should look for a pattern where certain cells are being replaced with 4 or 7 based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column, but only for certain cells. For example, if the cell is in a certain position, like the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column, but only if the original number is 2. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the original number is 2, and the output is 2. But other cells are replaced with 4 and 7.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in their row and column. For example, for a cell (i,j), the value is the sum of the row i and column j. Let's try this for example 1's seventh row, sixth element (row 6, column 5).\n\nRow 6 of input is: 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. The sum of this row is 0+5+0+5+2+5+5+5+0+0+0+0+5+5+0+0+0+0+0 = let's calculate:\n\n0+5=5, +0=5, +5=10, +2=12, +5=17, +5=22, +5=27, +0=27, +0=27, +0=27, +0=27, +5=32, +5=37, +0=37, +0=37, +0=37, +0=37, +0=37. So sum of row 6 is 37.\n\nColumn 5 of input: let's look at column 5 for all rows. For example, row 0: 5, row 1:5, row 2:5, row 3:0, row 4:0, row 5:0, row 6:5, row 7:5, row 8:5, row 9:5, row 10:0, row 11:0, row 12:5, row 13:5, row 14:0, row 15:0, row 16:0, row 17:0, row 18:0. Sum of column 5 is 5+5+5+0+0+0+5+5+5+5+0+0+5+5+0+0+0+0+0 = let's calculate:\n\n5+5=10, +5=15, +0=15, +0=15, +0=15, +5=20, +5=25, +5=30, +5=35, +0=35, +0=35, +5=40, +5=45, +0=45, +0=45, +0=45, +0=45, +0=45. So sum of column 5 is 45.\n\nSo for cell (6,5), the sum of row 6 is 37, column 5 is 45. Total is 37 + 45 = 82. But the output is 4. That doesn't match. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column, but only for certain cells. For example, if the original number is 2, replace it with 2. If it's 5, replace with 4 or 7 based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on their position in the grid. For example, if the row and column indices are both even, replace with 4. If they are both odd, replace with 7. But how to test this.\n\nIn example 1's seventh row (row index 6), which is even. Let's take cell (6,5). Row index 6 is even, column 5 is odd. So maybe it's replaced with 4 or 7 based on some condition. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on the position of the cell in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, replace with 7. But without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to say.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. But given the examples, perhaps the transformation is replacing certain numbers with 4 or 7 based on their position. For example, in the examples, the output has 4 and 7 in certain positions, which may be related to their position in the grid.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output changes from input. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the input has 5 in position 5 and 6, and the output has 4 and 7. Maybe these positions are part of a diagonal or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 4 or 7. For example, if the row is even, replace with 4, if odd, replace with 7. Or something like that.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are being replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 4 or 7. For example, if the cell is in row 6 (seventh row), and column 5 or 6, replace with 4 or 7.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess. Perhaps the transformation is replacing certain numbers with 4 or 7 based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 4 or 7. Or maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their neighbors, but only if the original number is 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their neighbors, but only if the original number is 2. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the cell at (6,4) is 2. Its neighbors are 0, 5, 5, 5. Sum is 15. But the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their neighbors divided by 3, rounded down. For example, in example 1's seventh row, cell (6,5) has neighbors sum 12. 12/3=4, which matches the output. For cell (6,6), neighbors sum is 5 (from row 6, column 5) + 5 (row 6, column 7) + 5 (row 7, column 6) + 5 (row 5, column 6). Wait, let me calculate. The cell at (6,6) has neighbors:\n\nrow 5, column 6: input is 0 (from row 5: 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So column 6 is 0?\n\nWait, row 5 is the sixth row of input. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal input for row 5 (sixth row):\n\n5 0 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo column 6 is 5 (index 6). So for cell (6,6), the neighbors are:\n\nrow 5, column 6: 5\n\nrow 7, column 6: 5 (from row 7: 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. column 6 is 5.\n\nrow 6, column 5: 5 (input)\n\nrow 6, column 7: 5 (input)\n\nSo the sum of the four neighbors is 5+5+5+5=20. 20/3 is 6.666, which rounds to 6. But the output for cell (6,6) is 7. Hmm, not matching.\n\nBut in the output, the cell (6,6) is 7. So maybe it's the sum of the neighbors divided by 3, rounded up. 20/3 is 6.666, rounded up to 7. That would fit. Let's check for the cell (6,5). Sum of neighbors is 0 (row 5, column 5) + 2 (row 6, column 4) + 5 (row 6, column 6) + 5 (row 7, column 5) = 0+2+5+5=12. 12/3=4, which matches the output. So this seems to fit.\n\nSo the transformation might be: for each cell, if the original value is not 2, replace it with the sum of its four neighboring cells divided by 3, rounded up. Or maybe for cells that are 2, leave them as is.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's seventh row, the cell (6,4) is 2, and the output is 2. So that fits. For other cells, like (6,5), the sum of neighbors is 12, divided by 3 is 4. For (6,6), the sum is 20, divided by 3 is 6.666, rounded up to 7. That matches the output.\n\nLet's check another example. In example 2's second row, the cell (1,12) is 2 in input. The output is 7. Wait, according to this rule, if the cell is 2, it remains 2. But in the output, it's 7. So this contradicts the hypothesis. Hmm.\n\nWait, in example 2's second row of input: the cell at (1,12) is 2. In the output, it's 7. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is different. For example, for cells that are not 2, replace with sum of neighbors divided by 3, rounded up. But for cells that are 2, replace with something else.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let me check example 2's second row. The input row is:\n\n0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 5 5 5 0 0 0\n\nThe output row is:\n\n0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 7 5 5 0 0 0\n\nSo the cell at (1,12) is 2 in input, and the output is 2. The cell at (1,13) is 2 in input, and the output is 7. So this contradicts the previous idea.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the rule is not as simple as sum of neighbors divided by 3.\n\nAnother observation: in example 2's output, the cell (1,13) is 7. Let's calculate the sum of its neighbors. The cell (1,13) is in row 1, column 13.\n\nNeighbors are:\n\nrow 0, column 13: 5 (from input row 0: 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5. column 13 is 5.\n\nrow 2, column 13: 5 (from input row 2: 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 5 5 2 5 5 0 5 0 0 0. column 13 is 5.\n\nrow 1, column 12: 2 (input).\n\nrow 1, column 14: 5 (input row 1, column 14 is 5.\n\nSum is 5 + 5 + 2 + 5 = 17. 17 divided by 3 is 5.666, rounded up to 6. But the output is 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. Given the time, I'll try to make a hypothesis based on the examples where the sum of neighbors divided by 3 gives the correct result.\n\nSo, the transformation might be: for each cell, if the original value is not 2, replace it with the sum of its four neighboring cells divided by 3, rounded up. But this doesn't fit all examples, but it fits some.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the neighbors, but only for certain cells. For example, if the original value is 5, replace it with the sum of the neighbors divided by something.\n\nBut given that I have to write code, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and see.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nif the original value is 2, leave it as is.\n\nelse, compute the sum of the four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right), then divide by 3, rounded up.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's seventh row, cell (6,5) is 5 in input. The sum of neighbors is 0 (up) + 2 (left) + 5 (right) + 5 (down) = 12. 12/3 =4, which matches the output.\n\nFor cell (6,6), sum of neighbors is 5 (up) + 5 (left) + 5 (down) + 5 (right) = 20. 20/3 is 6.666, rounded up to 7. Which matches the output.\n\nIn example 2's second row, cell (1,13) is 5 in input. Let's calculate the sum of neighbors. The cell is at (1,13). Neighbors are:\n\nup: row 0, column 13: 5.\n\ndown: row 2, column 13: 5.\n\nleft: row 1, column 12: 2.\n\nright: row 1, column 14: 5.\n\nSum is 5+5+2+5=17. 17/3=5.666, rounded up to 6. But the output is 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in the output, the cell is 7. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nMaybe the rule is to take the sum of the neighbors and add the original cell value, then divide by something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to take the sum of the neighbors and add the original cell value, then divide by 3.\n\nFor example, cell (6,5) in example 1: original value is 5. Sum of neighbors is 12. Total is 12+5=17. 17/3=5.666, rounded up to 6. But the output is 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their neighbors divided by 3, rounded up, and see if that works for some examples.\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(19)]\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                # calculate sum of neighbors\n                sum_neighbors = 0\n                for dx, dy in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    if 0 <= ni < 19 and 0 <= nj < 19:\n                        sum_neighbors += grid[ni][nj]\n                # calculate value\n                # sum_neighbors divided by 3, rounded up\n                value = (sum_neighbors + 2) // 3  # this is equivalent to ceiling division\n                transformed[i][j] = value\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but in example 1's seventh row, cell (6,5) is 5 in input. The sum of neighbors is 0+2+5+5=12. 12+2=14, divided by 3 is 4.666, which integer division would be 4. Which matches the output.\n\nFor cell (6,6), sum of neighbors is 5+5+5+5=20. 20+2=22, divided by 3 is 7.333, integer division is 7. Which matches the output.\n\nIn example 2's cell (1,13) which is 5 in input. Sum of neighbors is 5+5+2+5=17. 17+2=19, divided by 3 is 6.333, integer division is 6. But the output is 7. So this doesn't fit. But maybe the original value is not 2, so it's replaced with (sum_neighbors + 2) // 3.\n\nWait, in this case, the original value is 5, not 2. So the code would calculate sum_neighbors (17) and add 2? Why? Or is it sum_neighbors divided by 3, rounded up?\n\nWait, the code I wrote is: value = (sum_neighbors + 2) // 3. This is equivalent to ceiling division. For example, 12 + 2 = 14, divided by 3 is 4.666, integer division is 4. Which is correct.\n\nBut for 17: 17 + 2 = 19, divided by 3 is 6.333, integer division is 6. But the output is 7. So this doesn't fit. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe the code should be (sum_neighbors + 2) // 3, but for some reason, this doesn't work. Or maybe the original value is not 2, but the code is replacing it with (sum_neighbors + 2) // 3.\n\nBut this doesn't fit for example 2's cell (1,13). So perhaps the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code, as it fits some examples and may be the best I can do.\n\nSo the final code would be:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(19)]\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                sum_neighbors = 0\n                for dx, dy in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    if 0 <= ni < 19 and 0 <= nj < 19:\n                        sum_neighbors += grid[ni][nj]\n                # Calculate value as ceiling(sum_neighbors / 3)\n                value = (sum_neighbors + 2) // 3\n                transformed[i][j] = value\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in example 1's seventh row, cell (6,5) is 5 in input, and the code would replace it with (12 + 2) // 3 = 14//3=4, which matches the output. For cell (6,6), sum_neighbors is 20, (20 + 2) // 3 = 22//3=7, which matches the output.\n\nIn example 2's cell (1,13), the sum_neighbors is 5+5+2+5=17. (17 + 2) //3 = 19//3=6. But the output is 7. So this is a problem. But maybe there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should be (sum_neighbors + 2) // 3 if the original value is not 2, but for some other reason. Or maybe the code is not correct for all cases, but it's the best possible based on the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should be sum_neighbors divided by 3, rounded up, which is (sum_neighbors + 2) // 3.\n\nBut in example 2's cell (1,13), the code gives 6, but the output is 7. So this suggests that the code is not correct. But maybe there's a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me recheck example 2's cell (1,13). The input is:\n\nRow 1 of input: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 5 5 5 0 0 0\n\nSo for cell (1,13), the value is 5. The neighbors are:\n\nUp: row 0, column 13: 5 (from input row 0: 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5. So column 13 is 5.\n\nDown: row 2, column 13: 5 (from input row 2: 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 5 5 2 5 5 0 5 0 0 0. column 13 is 5.\n\nLeft: row 1, column 12: 2.\n\nRight: row 1, column 14: 5.\n\nSo sum_neighbors is 5 + 5 + 2 + 5 = 17.\n\n(17 + 2) // 3 = 19 // 3 = 6. But the output is 7. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nBut in the output, the cell (1,13) is 7. So this suggests that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the correct pattern is. Given the time, I'll proceed with this code, as it fits some examples and may be the best possible.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing between the input and output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 19x19. The input has some numbers, and the output has some numbers that look similar but with changes. For instance, looking at the first row of the input and output:\n\nInput first row: 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0\nOutput first row: same as input. So maybe the first row isn't changed. But looking at other rows, like the seventh row of input and output:\n\nInput seventh row: 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput seventh row: 0 5 0 5 2 4 7 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\nSo here, the 5th element (index 4?) was 2 in input, but in output it's 2. Wait, maybe I'm getting the indices wrong. Let me check. The input row is 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 5 0 5 2 4 7 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. So the fifth element (index 4?) is 2, but in the output, the sixth element (index 5?) is 4, and the seventh (index 6?) is 7. Hmm, maybe there's some pattern here. Maybe numbers are being replaced with other numbers based on their position or neighboring cells.\n\nLooking at the seventh row of input and output, the original numbers are 2, 5, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Wait, maybe not. Let me check the exact positions. Let me think of the seventh row of input as:\n\nOriginal input row: [0,5,0,5,2,5,5,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nOutput row: [0,5,0,5,2,4,7,5,0,0,0,0,5,5,0,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo the fifth element (index 4) is 2, same as input. The sixth (index 5) is 4, seventh (index 6) is 7. Then the next elements are 5, 0, etc. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced with other numbers based on some rule. For example, maybe numbers in certain positions are being replaced with the sum of their neighbors or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, maybe numbers in certain positions are being replaced with a value based on their row or column. But that seems too vague.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, there are some 7s and 4s. For instance, in the seventh row, the sixth and seventh elements are 4 and 7. Also, in the eighth row of example 1's output, the sixth element is 2, and the seventh is 7. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being replaced with numbers based on their position in the grid. Or maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being replaced with numbers that are the sum of their adjacent cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with other numbers based on some rule. For example, in example 1, the input has a 2 in some positions, and the output has 2, 4, 7, etc. Maybe the numbers are being replaced with the sum of their neighbors, or some other operation.\n\nLooking at example 2, the input has a 2 in some positions, and the output has 2, 4, 7, etc. For example, in the second row of example 2's input:\n\nInput row: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 5 5 5 0 0 0\nOutput row: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 7 5 5 0 0 0\nSo the 13th element (index 12) is 5 in input, but in output it's 7. Hmm. Maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being replaced with numbers that are the sum of their neighbors. For example, if a cell is surrounded by certain numbers, it's replaced with a sum.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with a value based on their position. For example, in example 1, the seventh row's sixth element (index 5) is 4, and the seventh element (index 6) is 7. Maybe these numbers are being replaced based on their row and column. For example, if a cell is in row i and column j, then the value is some function of i and j. But that's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers in certain positions with a value that's the sum of their adjacent cells. For example, in example 1, the seventh row's sixth element (index 5) is 4. Let's check the surrounding cells. The cell at (6,5) in the input is 5 (original input row 6, which is the seventh row, index 5). Wait, maybe I'm getting the indices wrong. Let me think of the grid as rows and columns. Let's take the seventh row of example 1's input. The original input row is:\n\nOriginal input row: 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the elements are:\n\nindex 0: 0\n\nindex 1:5\n\nindex 2:0\n\nindex 3:5\n\nindex 4:2\n\nindex 5:5\n\nindex 6:5\n\nindex 7:5\n\nindex 8:0\n\nindex 9:0\n\nindex 10:0\n\nindex 11:0\n\nindex 12:5\n\nindex 13:5\n\nindex 14:0\n\nindex 15:0\n\nindex 16:0\n\nindex 17:0\n\nindex 18:0\n\nIn the output row, the same row is:\n\n0 5 0 5 2 4 7 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo index 5 is 4, index 6 is 7. Let me check the surrounding cells. For index 5 (row 6, column 5), what's around it? Let's look at the cells in row 6, columns 4, 5, 6, and also the cells in row 5 and 7.\n\nIn the input, row 5 (original input row 5) is:\n\n5 0 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo row 5, column 5 is 0. Row 6, column 5 is 5. Row 7, column 5 is 5 (from input row 7: 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, row 7 is the seventh row? Or maybe I'm mixing up the rows. Let me clarify: the input is 19x19. The first example's input is 19 rows. The seventh row of input is the one that's being transformed. Let me think of the seventh row as row index 6 (since Python is 0-based). So row 6, column 5 is 5. The cell at row 6, column 5 is 5. What's around it?\n\nLooking at the cell at (6,5), which is 5. The surrounding cells would be:\n\n(5,5) which is row 5, column 5: 0.\n\n(6,4): row 6, column 4: 2.\n\n(6,6): row 6, column 6: 5.\n\n(7,5): row 7, column 5: 5 (from input row 7: 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. So column 5 is 5.\n\nSo the surrounding cells are 0, 2, 5, 5. The sum is 0+2+5+5 = 12. But the output for this cell is 4. That doesn't match. Alternatively, maybe it's the average? 12/4=3. Not 4. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell is replaced with the sum of the cells in the same row and column. But that's unclear.\n\nLooking at example 2's output, there's a 7 in some positions. For example, in example 2's output, the second row's 13th element (index 12) is 7. Let me check the input for that cell. The input row 1 (second row) is:\n\n0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 5 5 5 0 0 0\n\nSo the 12th element (index 12) is 2. The output is 7. Maybe that's the sum of some cells. For example, the cell at (1,12) is 2. The surrounding cells: let's check the cells around it. Maybe the sum of the cells in the same row and column? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with a value based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the outputs. For example, in example 1, the output has some 7s and 4s. In example 2, there are 7s and 4s. In example 3, there are 7s and 4s. So maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are being replaced with 4 or 7 based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their adjacent cells. For example, in example 1, the cell at (6,5) is 5. The sum of adjacent cells is 0 (from row 5, column 5) + 2 (row 6, column 4) + 5 (row 6, column 6) + 5 (row 7, column 5) = 12. But the output is 4. That doesn't match. Maybe it's the sum divided by something. 12/3=4. Hmm, maybe. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their neighboring cells. But how to determine that.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the seventh row's sixth element is 4. Let me check the surrounding cells again. Maybe the sum of the cells in the same row and column. For example, in row 6, the cells around column 5. The row is 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. So the sum of the row from column 4 to 6 is 2 +5 +5 = 12. But that's not directly helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their adjacent cells in the same row and column. For example, the cell at (6,5) is 5. The adjacent cells in the same row would be (6,4)=2, (6,6)=5. In the same column, (5,5)=0, (7,5)=5. Sum is 2+5+0+5 = 12. But output is 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their neighbors in a certain way. For example, if a cell is in a certain pattern, like a 2 in the input, then it's replaced with 2, but if it's surrounded by certain numbers, it's replaced with 4 or 7.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where the numbers change. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the original input has a 2 in column 4 (index 4). The output has the same 2. But the next elements are 4 and 7. Maybe these are positions that are part of a certain pattern, like being in a diagonal or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, then it's replaced with a certain value. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd. But that's hard to see.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. For example, the first row of input is 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. The output is 0 0 7 7 7 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. So the third and fourth elements (indices 2 and 3) are 5 in input, but in output they are 7. Maybe those positions are being replaced with 7. Similarly, in the third row of example 3's input, the first element is 5, and in the output it's 5. But the third element is 5 in input and 7 in output. So maybe certain positions are being replaced with 7 based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with a certain value based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. For example, if the row is even, then replace certain cells with 7. But how to determine which cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in their row and column. For example, for a cell (i,j), the sum of the row i and column j. But that seems too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column, but only for certain cells. For example, if the cell is part of a certain pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 7s and 4s in certain positions. For example, in the seventh row, the sixth and seventh elements are 4 and 7. In the eighth row, the sixth element is 2 and the seventh is 7. Maybe these positions are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in row 6 (seventh row) and column 5 or 6, then it's replaced with 4 or 7.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their neighbors in a certain way. For example, in example 1, the cell (6,5) is 5, and the output is 4. Maybe the sum of the neighbors is 12, and 12 mod something is 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column, but only for certain cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column, but only if the original number is 2. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the original number is 2, and the output is 2. But in other positions, like the sixth and seventh elements, which are 5 in input, they are replaced with 4 and 7. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the outputs. For example, in example 1's output, the seventh row has 4 and 7 in positions that are adjacent to each other. Similarly, in example 2, there are 7s in certain positions. Maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with a value based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 4 or 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column. For example, for a cell (i,j), the sum of the row i and column j, then take that sum modulo something. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column, but only for certain cells. For example, if the cell is in a certain position, like the middle of the grid.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's try to think of another approach. Let's look at the outputs of the three examples and see if there's a common pattern.\n\nIn example 1, the output has 7s and 4s in certain positions. In example 2, there are 7s and 4s. In example 3, there are 7s and 4s. So maybe the transformation is replacing certain cells with 4 or 7 based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 4 or 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column. For example, for a cell (i,j), the sum of the row i and column j, then take that sum modulo 10. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column, but only if the original number is 2. For example, in example 1, the seventh row has a 2 in the fourth column (index 4), and the output has the same 2. But other cells are replaced with 4 and 7.\n\nAnother idea: looking for patterns in the outputs. For example, in example 1's output, the seventh row has 4 and 7 in positions that are adjacent to each other. Maybe those positions are being replaced based on some rule related to their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in their immediate neighbors. For example, for a cell (i,j), the value is the sum of the cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1), and then take that sum modulo 10. Let's test this.\n\nIn example 1's seventh row, the cell at (6,5) is 5. Let's look at its neighbors. The cell to the left (6,4) is 2, to the right (6,6) is 5. Above (5,5) is 0, below (7,5) is 5. Sum is 2+5+0+5 = 12. 12 mod 10 is 2. But the output is 4. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the four neighbors plus the original cell. For example, 2+5+0+5+5 = 17 mod 10 is 7. But the output is 4. No.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the four neighbors, but divided by something. 12/3=4. That would give 4. So maybe that's the rule. But how to know.\n\nAnother example: in example 2's second row, the cell at (1,12) is 2 in input. The output is 7. Let's check the neighbors. The cell (1,12) is in row 1, column 12. The neighbors are (0,12), (2,12), (1,11), (1,13). Let's assume the input for row 0, column 12 is 5 (from example 2's input row 0: 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5. So column 12 is 5. Row 2, column 12: input row 2 is 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 5 5 2 5 5 0 5 0 0 0. So column 12 is 2. Row 1, column 11 is 2, column 13 is 5. So the sum of neighbors is 5 (row 0,12) + 2 (row 2,12) + 2 (row 1,11) + 5 (row 1,13) = 14. 14 divided by something gives 7. 14/2=7. So maybe the rule is sum of neighbors divided by 2, rounded down. But how to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing the cell with the sum of the four neighboring cells. For example, in example 1's seventh row, cell (6,5) has neighbors sum 12. If that's the case, then 12 would be replaced with 12, but the output is 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing the cell with the sum of the neighbors, but only if the original cell is 2. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the original cell is 2. The sum of the neighbors is 12, but the output is 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let's look for patterns in the outputs of the three examples.\n\nIn example 1, the output has 7s and 4s in certain positions. In example 2, there are 7s and 4s. In example 3, there are 7s and 4s. So maybe the transformation is replacing certain cells with 4 or 7 based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 4 or 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, then it's replaced with 4 or 7. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the sixth and seventh elements are replaced with 4 and 7. Maybe those positions are in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on the position of the cell in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 4 or 7. For example, in example 1, the seventh row (row index 6) has some cells replaced with 4 and 7. Maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on whether the row and column indices are even or odd. For example, if the sum of row and column is even, replace with 4, else 7. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, replace with 7. But how to determine the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on the original number. For example, if the original number is 2, replace with 2. If it's 5, replace with 4 or 7 based on some condition.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the seventh row has a 2 in the fourth column, which is the same as the input. The fifth column is 4, sixth is 7. Maybe these positions are part of a pattern where certain cells are replaced with 4 or 7 based on their position.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Maybe I should look for a pattern where certain cells are being replaced with 4 or 7 based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column, but only for certain cells. For example, if the cell is in a certain position, like the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column, but only if the original number is 2. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the original number is 2, and the output is 2. But other cells are replaced with 4 and 7.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in their row and column. For example, for a cell (i,j), the value is the sum of the row i and column j. Let's try this for example 1's seventh row, sixth element (row 6, column 5).\n\nRow 6 of input is: 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. The sum of this row is 0+5+0+5+2+5+5+5+0+0+0+0+5+5+0+0+0+0+0 = let's calculate:\n\n0+5=5, +0=5, +5=10, +2=12, +5=17, +5=22, +5=27, +0=27, +0=27, +0=27, +0=27, +5=32, +5=37, +0=37, +0=37, +0=37, +0=37, +0=37. So sum of row 6 is 37.\n\nColumn 5 of input: let's look at column 5 for all rows. For example, row 0: 5, row 1:5, row 2:5, row 3:0, row 4:0, row 5:0, row 6:5, row 7:5, row 8:5, row 9:5, row 10:0, row 11:0, row 12:5, row 13:5, row 14:0, row 15:0, row 16:0, row 17:0, row 18:0. Sum of column 5 is 5+5+5+0+0+0+5+5+5+5+0+0+5+5+0+0+0+0+0 = let's calculate:\n\n5+5=10, +5=15, +0=15, +0=15, +0=15, +5=20, +5=25, +5=30, +5=35, +0=35, +0=35, +5=40, +5=45, +0=45, +0=45, +0=45, +0=45, +0=45. So sum of column 5 is 45.\n\nSo for cell (6,5), the sum of row 6 is 37, column 5 is 45. Total is 37 + 45 = 82. But the output is 4. That doesn't match. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the numbers in the same row and column, but only for certain cells. For example, if the original number is 2, replace it with 2. If it's 5, replace with 4 or 7 based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on their position in the grid. For example, if the row and column indices are both even, replace with 4. If they are both odd, replace with 7. But how to test this.\n\nIn example 1's seventh row (row index 6), which is even. Let's take cell (6,5). Row index 6 is even, column 5 is odd. So maybe it's replaced with 4 or 7 based on some condition. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on the position of the cell in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, replace with 7. But without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to say.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. But given the examples, perhaps the transformation is replacing certain numbers with 4 or 7 based on their position. For example, in the examples, the output has 4 and 7 in certain positions, which may be related to their position in the grid.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output changes from input. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the input has 5 in position 5 and 6, and the output has 4 and 7. Maybe these positions are part of a diagonal or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 4 or 7. For example, if the row is even, replace with 4, if odd, replace with 7. Or something like that.\n\nBut how to determine which cells are being replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with 4 or 7 based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 4 or 7. For example, if the cell is in row 6 (seventh row), and column 5 or 6, replace with 4 or 7.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess. Perhaps the transformation is replacing certain numbers with 4 or 7 based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 4 or 7. Or maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their neighbors, but only if the original number is 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their neighbors, but only if the original number is 2. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the cell at (6,4) is 2. Its neighbors are 0, 5, 5, 5. Sum is 15. But the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their neighbors divided by 3, rounded down. For example, in example 1's seventh row, cell (6,5) has neighbors sum 12. 12/3=4, which matches the output. For cell (6,6), neighbors sum is 5 (from row 6, column 5) + 5 (row 6, column 7) + 5 (row 7, column 6) + 5 (row 5, column 6). Wait, let me calculate. The cell at (6,6) has neighbors:\n\nrow 5, column 6: input is 0 (from row 5: 5 0 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So column 6 is 0?\n\nWait, row 5 is the sixth row of input. Let me recheck:\n\nOriginal input for row 5 (sixth row):\n\n5 0 0 5 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo column 6 is 5 (index 6). So for cell (6,6), the neighbors are:\n\nrow 5, column 6: 5\n\nrow 7, column 6: 5 (from row 7: 0 5 0 5 2 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 0. column 6 is 5.\n\nrow 6, column 5: 5 (input)\n\nrow 6, column 7: 5 (input)\n\nSo the sum of the four neighbors is 5+5+5+5=20. 20/3 is 6.666, which rounds to 6. But the output for cell (6,6) is 7. Hmm, not matching.\n\nBut in the output, the cell (6,6) is 7. So maybe it's the sum of the neighbors divided by 3, rounded up. 20/3 is 6.666, rounded up to 7. That would fit. Let's check for the cell (6,5). Sum of neighbors is 0 (row 5, column 5) + 2 (row 6, column 4) + 5 (row 6, column 6) + 5 (row 7, column 5) = 0+2+5+5=12. 12/3=4, which matches the output. So this seems to fit.\n\nSo the transformation might be: for each cell, if the original value is not 2, replace it with the sum of its four neighboring cells divided by 3, rounded up. Or maybe for cells that are 2, leave them as is.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's seventh row, the cell (6,4) is 2, and the output is 2. So that fits. For other cells, like (6,5), the sum of neighbors is 12, divided by 3 is 4. For (6,6), the sum is 20, divided by 3 is 6.666, rounded up to 7. That matches the output.\n\nLet's check another example. In example 2's second row, the cell (1,12) is 2 in input. The output is 7. Wait, according to this rule, if the cell is 2, it remains 2. But in the output, it's 7. So this contradicts the hypothesis. Hmm.\n\nWait, in example 2's second row of input: the cell at (1,12) is 2. In the output, it's 7. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is different. For example, for cells that are not 2, replace with sum of neighbors divided by 3, rounded up. But for cells that are 2, replace with something else.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let me check example 2's second row. The input row is:\n\n0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 5 5 5 0 0 0\n\nThe output row is:\n\n0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 7 5 5 0 0 0\n\nSo the cell at (1,12) is 2 in input, and the output is 2. The cell at (1,13) is 2 in input, and the output is 7. So this contradicts the previous idea.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the rule is not as simple as sum of neighbors divided by 3.\n\nAnother observation: in example 2's output, the cell (1,13) is 7. Let's calculate the sum of its neighbors. The cell (1,13) is in row 1, column 13.\n\nNeighbors are:\n\nrow 0, column 13: 5 (from input row 0: 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5. column 13 is 5.\n\nrow 2, column 13: 5 (from input row 2: 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 5 5 2 5 5 0 5 0 0 0. column 13 is 5.\n\nrow 1, column 12: 2 (input).\n\nrow 1, column 14: 5 (input row 1, column 14 is 5.\n\nSum is 5 + 5 + 2 + 5 = 17. 17 divided by 3 is 5.666, rounded up to 6. But the output is 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. Given the time, I'll try to make a hypothesis based on the examples where the sum of neighbors divided by 3 gives the correct result.\n\nSo, the transformation might be: for each cell, if the original value is not 2, replace it with the sum of its four neighboring cells divided by 3, rounded up. But this doesn't fit all examples, but it fits some.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of the neighbors, but only for certain cells. For example, if the original value is 5, replace it with the sum of the neighbors divided by something.\n\nBut given that I have to write code, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and see.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\nFor each cell (i,j):\n\nif the original value is 2, leave it as is.\n\nelse, compute the sum of the four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right), then divide by 3, rounded up.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nBut wait, in example 1's seventh row, cell (6,5) is 5 in input. The sum of neighbors is 0 (up) + 2 (left) + 5 (right) + 5 (down) = 12. 12/3 =4, which matches the output.\n\nFor cell (6,6), sum of neighbors is 5 (up) + 5 (left) + 5 (down) + 5 (right) = 20. 20/3 is 6.666, rounded up to 7. Which matches the output.\n\nIn example 2's second row, cell (1,13) is 5 in input. Let's calculate the sum of neighbors. The cell is at (1,13). Neighbors are:\n\nup: row 0, column 13: 5.\n\ndown: row 2, column 13: 5.\n\nleft: row 1, column 12: 2.\n\nright: row 1, column 14: 5.\n\nSum is 5+5+2+5=17. 17/3=5.666, rounded up to 6. But the output is 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in the output, the cell is 7. So maybe the rule is different.\n\nMaybe the rule is to take the sum of the neighbors and add the original cell value, then divide by something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to take the sum of the neighbors and add the original cell value, then divide by 3.\n\nFor example, cell (6,5) in example 1: original value is 5. Sum of neighbors is 12. Total is 12+5=17. 17/3=5.666, rounded up to 6. But the output is 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is replacing numbers with the sum of their neighbors divided by 3, rounded up, and see if that works for some examples.\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(19)]\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                # calculate sum of neighbors\n                sum_neighbors = 0\n                for dx, dy in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    if 0 <= ni < 19 and 0 <= nj < 19:\n                        sum_neighbors += grid[ni][nj]\n                # calculate value\n                # sum_neighbors divided by 3, rounded up\n                value = (sum_neighbors + 2) // 3  # this is equivalent to ceiling division\n                transformed[i][j] = value\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but in example 1's seventh row, cell (6,5) is 5 in input. The sum of neighbors is 0+2+5+5=12. 12+2=14, divided by 3 is 4.666, which integer division would be 4. Which matches the output.\n\nFor cell (6,6), sum of neighbors is 5+5+5+5=20. 20+2=22, divided by 3 is 7.333, integer division is 7. Which matches the output.\n\nIn example 2's cell (1,13) which is 5 in input. Sum of neighbors is 5+5+2+5=17. 17+2=19, divided by 3 is 6.333, integer division is 6. But the output is 7. So this doesn't fit. But maybe the original value is not 2, so it's replaced with (sum_neighbors + 2) // 3.\n\nWait, in this case, the original value is 5, not 2. So the code would calculate sum_neighbors (17) and add 2? Why? Or is it sum_neighbors divided by 3, rounded up?\n\nWait, the code I wrote is: value = (sum_neighbors + 2) // 3. This is equivalent to ceiling division. For example, 12 + 2 = 14, divided by 3 is 4.666, integer division is 4. Which is correct.\n\nBut for 17: 17 + 2 = 19, divided by 3 is 6.333, integer division is 6. But the output is 7. So this doesn't fit. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe the code should be (sum_neighbors + 2) // 3, but for some reason, this doesn't work. Or maybe the original value is not 2, but the code is replacing it with (sum_neighbors + 2) // 3.\n\nBut this doesn't fit for example 2's cell (1,13). So perhaps the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code, as it fits some examples and may be the best I can do.\n\nSo the final code would be:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(19)]\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                sum_neighbors = 0\n                for dx, dy in [(-1,0), (1,0), (0,-1), (0,1)]:\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    if 0 <= ni < 19 and 0 <= nj < 19:\n                        sum_neighbors += grid[ni][nj]\n                # Calculate value as ceiling(sum_neighbors / 3)\n                value = (sum_neighbors + 2) // 3\n                transformed[i][j] = value\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in example 1's seventh row, cell (6,5) is 5 in input, and the code would replace it with (12 + 2) // 3 = 14//3=4, which matches the output. For cell (6,6), sum_neighbors is 20, (20 + 2) // 3 = 22//3=7, which matches the output.\n\nIn example 2's cell (1,13), the sum_neighbors is 5+5+2+5=17. (17 + 2) //3 = 19//3=6. But the output is 7. So this is a problem. But maybe there's another rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should be (sum_neighbors + 2) // 3 if the original value is not 2, but for some other reason. Or maybe the code is not correct for all cases, but it's the best possible based on the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should be sum_neighbors divided by 3, rounded up, which is (sum_neighbors + 2) // 3.\n\nBut in example 2's cell (1,13), the code gives 6, but the output is 7. So this suggests that the code is not correct. But maybe there's a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me recheck example 2's cell (1,13). The input is:\n\nRow 1 of input: 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 5 5 0 5 2 2 5 5 5 0 0 0\n\nSo for cell (1,13), the value is 5. The neighbors are:\n\nUp: row 0, column 13: 5 (from input row 0: 5 5 0 5 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 5. So column 13 is 5.\n\nDown: row 2, column 13: 5 (from input row 2: 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 5 5 5 2 5 5 0 5 0 0 0. column 13 is 5.\n\nLeft: row 1, column 12: 2.\n\nRight: row 1, column 14: 5.\n\nSo sum_neighbors is 5 + 5 + 2 + 5 = 17.\n\n(17 + 2) // 3 = 19 // 3 = 6. But the output is 7. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nBut in the output, the cell (1,13) is 7. So this suggests that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the correct pattern is. Given the time, I'll proceed with this code, as it fits some examples and may be the best possible.\n"
