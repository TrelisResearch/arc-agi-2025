The output grid has 9 rows and 3 columns\n2. The output values are often 0 or 2\n3. The output seems to be a transformation of the input grid, possibly involving some kind of pattern expansion or repetition\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves expanding each cell in the input grid into a 3x3 block in the output grid, with some pattern of values (0 or 2) based on the original value.\n\nHere's my implementation of this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x3 output grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # For each cell in the input grid, expand it into a 3x3 block in the output grid\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            # If the value is 0, fill the corresponding 3x3 block with 0s\n            if value == 0:\n                for x in range(3):\n                    for y in range(3):\n                        transformed_grid[x*3][y*3 + j] = 0\n            # If the value is 1, fill the corresponding 3x3 block with 2s\n            elif value == 1:\n                for x in range(3):\n                    for y in range(3):\n                        transformed_grid[x*3][y*3 + j] = 2\n            # If the value is something else, fill the corresponding 3x3 block with 0s\n            else:\n                for x in range(3):\n                    for y in range(3):\n                        transformed_grid[x*3][y*3 + j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x3 output grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # For each cell in the input grid, expand it into a 3x3 block in the output grid\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            # If the value is 0, fill the corresponding 3x3 block with 0s\n            if value == 0:\n                for x in range(3):\n                    for y in range(3):\n                        transformed_grid[x*3][y*3 + j] = 0\n            # If the value is 1, fill the corresponding 3x3 block with 2s\n            elif value == 1:\n                for x in range(3):\n                    for y in range(3):\n                        transformed_grid[x*3][y*3 + j] = 2\n            # If the value is something else, fill the corresponding 3x3 block with 0s\n            else:\n                for x in range(3):\n                    for y in range(3):\n                        transformed_grid[x*3][y*3 + j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output seems to be derived from certain patterns in the input grid, particularly focusing on the positions of 2s and 1s.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that the output seems to be related to the positions of certain values in the input grid. Specifically, it appears that the output is derived from the positions of 2s and 1s in the input grid, with the output being a sequence of 0s and 1s indicating the presence or absence of certain patterns.\n\nHere's my hypothesis for the transformation:\n- The output is a 1\u00d75 grid where each element indicates whether a certain pattern is present in the input grid.\n- The pattern seems to be related to the positions of 2s and 1s in the input grid.\n\nBased on this, I'll write a Python function that implements this transformation.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

The output patterns seem to be based on the shape and position of these regions\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Identifies connected regions of non-zero values in the input grid\n- Converts these regions into patterns in the output grid\n- The output grid is always 3x6\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Find all non-zero values\n    non_zero_positions = np.argwhere(grid_np != 0)\n    \n    # If there are no non-zero values, return a grid of zeros\n    if len(non_zero_positions) == 0:\n        return [[0 for _ in range(6)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Create a 3x6 output grid initialized to zero\n    output = np.zeros((3, 6), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Define the pattern to use for non-zero regions\n    # This pattern is based on the examples and is a 3x2 block\n    pattern = np.array([\n        [8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n        [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n    ])\n    \n    # Find the position of the first non-zero value\n    first_non_zero = non_zero_positions[0]\n    \n    # Calculate the position in the output grid\n    row = first_non_zero[0] // 8\n    col = first_non_zero[1] // 8\n    \n    # Place the pattern in the output grid\n    output[row:row+3, col:col+6] = pattern\n    \n    return output.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Find all non-zero values\n    non_zero_positions = np.argwhere(grid_np != 0)\n    \n    # If there are no non-zero values, return a grid of zeros\n    if len(non_zero_positions) == 0:\n        return [[0 for _ in range(6)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Create a 3x6 output grid initialized to zero\n    output = np.zeros((3, 6), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Define the pattern to use for non-zero regions\n    # This pattern is based on the examples and is a 3x2 block\n    pattern = np.array([\n        [8, 8, 0, 8, 8, 0],\n        [0, 8, 0, 0, 8, 0],\n        [8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8]\n    ])\n    \n    # Find the position of the first non-zero value\n    first_non_zero = non_zero_positions[0]\n    \n    # Calculate the position in the output grid\n    row = first_non_zero[0] // 8\n    col = first_non_zero[1] // 8\n    \n    # Place the pattern in the output grid\n    output[row:row+3, col:col+6] = pattern\n    \n    return output.tolist()\n```",

In Example 1, the output seems to be a repetition of the first row, with alternating patterns in the second row.\n2. In Example 2, the output appears to be a vertical repetition of the first row, with alternating values in the second row.\n3. Both examples show a pattern where the first row is repeated, and then a pattern of alternating values is applied to the subsequent rows.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Repeating the first row of the input grid\n- Applying a pattern where the second row alternates between the first row's values and a modified version\n- Repeating this pattern for the remaining rows\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Ensure the input is a 6x10 grid\n    if len(grid) != 6 or len(grid[0]) != 10:\n        return grid\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # The first row is repeated as is\n    for i in range(1, 6):\n        # For even rows (0-based), copy the first row\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            transformed_grid[i] = transformed_grid[0]\n        # For odd rows, alternate between the first row and a modified version\n        else:\n            # Create a modified version of the first row\n            modified_row = []\n            for j in range(10):\n                if j % 2 == 0:\n                    modified_row.append(transformed_grid[0][j])\n                else:\n                    modified_row.append(transformed_grid[0][j] + 2)\n            transformed_grid[i] = modified_row\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

Alternates between the original value and 0 in a pattern that repeats every two rows\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the first row as the base pattern\n    base_row = grid[0]\n    \n    # Create a new grid with the same dimensions\n    transformed_grid = []\n    \n    # Repeat the base row for all 6 rows\n    for i in range(6):\n        # Alternate between the original value and 0\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            transformed_row = base_row\n        else:\n            transformed_row = [0 if x != 0 else x for x in base_row]\n        transformed_grid.append(transformed_row)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output also seems to be a vertical and horizontal duplication of the input grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation is to duplicate each row of the input grid twice (vertically) and each column of the input grid twice (horizontally).\n\nHere's my implementation of this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the dimensions of the input grid\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Create a new 6x8 grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(6)]\n    \n    # Fill the transformed grid by duplicating each row twice vertically\n    # and each column twice horizontally\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            # Fill the transformed grid with the original value\n            # at positions (i, j), (i, j+4), (i+4, j), (i+4, j+4)\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i][j+4] = grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i+4][j] = grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i+4][j+4] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(6)]\n    \n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i][j+4] = grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i+4][j] = grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i+4][j+4] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

This suggests that the transformation involves some kind of tiling or repetition pattern.\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that the output grid appears to be a combination of the input grid repeated in a specific pattern. For example, in the first example, the input grid is repeated in a way that creates a symmetrical pattern.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that repeats the input grid in a specific pattern to create a 6x8 output grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

The values in the output grids seem to be related to the values in the input grids in a non-trivial way.\n\nBased on the examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves a complex pattern that might include:\n1. Replacing certain values with others\n2. Rotating or reflecting certain patterns\n3. Applying some kind of transformation based on the position of elements\n\nHere's my best attempt at implementing this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a transformed grid\n    transformed_grid = np.zeros((4, 4), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Apply some transformation based on observed patterns\n    # This is a placeholder - the actual transformation logic is not fully clear\n    # Based on the examples, it seems to involve some kind of pattern recognition\n    \n    # For demonstration purposes, I'll implement a simple pattern that might match the examples\n    # This is a placeholder and may not be accurate\n    \n    # Example pattern: replace values based on some rule\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    transformed_grid = np.zeros((4, 4), dtype=int)\n    \n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",

It appears that the transformation might involve some form of pattern recognition or transformation based on the values in the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that preserves certain patterns and modifies others in a way that seems to align with the examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # For each row in the grid\n    for i in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        # For each column in the row\n        for j in range(len(transformed_grid[i])):\n            # If the value is 1, change it to 3\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            # If the value is 2, change it to 1\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            # If the value is 3, change it to 2\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            # If the value is 4, change it to 1\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            # If the value is 6, change it to 4\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            # If the value is 8, change it to 6\n            elif transformed_grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid is always 6x6\n2. The input grid is 3x3\n3. The output seems to be a replication or expansion of the input grid in some pattern\n4.

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid is always 9 rows by 4 columns.\n2. The input grid appears to be 3 rows by 2 columns.\n3. The output seems to be a transformation of the input grid that creates a more complex pattern, possibly involving repetition, reflection, and expansion.\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that the output grid appears to be a combination of the input values in a specific pattern. For example, in Example 1, the input values [0, 8], [0, 0], [0, 8] are transformed into a pattern that repeats and mirrors the input values.\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that creates a 9x4 grid by repeating and mirroring the input values in a specific pattern.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 9x4 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Input grid is 3x2, so we'll use it to create the pattern\n    input_rows = grid\n    \n    # Fill the output grid with the input pattern\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(2):\n            # Repeat the value in a pattern\n            for row in range(3):\n                for col in range(4):\n                    # Calculate the position in the output grid\n                    output_row = i * 3 + row\n                    output_col = j * 2 + col\n                    if output_row < 9 and output_col < 4:\n                        transformed_grid[output_row][output_col] = input_rows[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

There's a pattern of values propagating or transforming in a specific way\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that propagates values from the first three columns to the rest of the grid in a specific pattern.\n\nHere's my hypothesis for the transformation:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n- The first three values are used to influence the rest of the row\n- The transformation seems to involve some form of pattern propagation or transformation that affects the grid in a specific way\n\nI'll implement a transformation that propagates values from the first three columns to the rest of the grid in a specific pattern.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 3x11 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(11)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Propagate values from the first three columns to the rest of the grid\n    for row in range(3):\n        for col in range(11):\n            # If we're in the first three columns, copy the value directly\n            if col < 3:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][col]\n            # For the rest of the columns, apply a transformation\n            else:\n                # This is a hypothesis based on the examples\n                # The transformation seems to involve some form of pattern propagation\n                # For simplicity, we'll use the value from the first three columns\n                # in a specific pattern\n                if col == 3:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][0]\n                elif col == 4:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][1]\n                elif col == 5:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][2]\n                elif col == 6:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][0]\n                elif col == 7:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][1]\n                elif col == 8:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][2]\n                elif col == 9:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][0]\n                elif col == 10:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][1]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid seems to be influenced by the values in the input grid, particularly the middle cell (position [1][1]).\n2. The middle row and middle column in the output grid seem to be affected by the middle cell of the input grid.\n3. The values in the output grid often change based on the value in the center of the input grid.\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that:\n- When the center value is 1, the middle row and column in the output grid often become 5.\n- When the center value is 2, the middle row and column in the output grid often become 5.\n- When the center value is 8, the middle row and column in the output grid often become 5.\n- When the center value is 3, the middle row and column in the output grid often become 5.\n- When the center value is 4, the middle row and column in the output grid often become 4.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Keeping the first row and last row unchanged.\n- For the middle row, if the center value is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 8, the middle row becomes 5s.\n- For the middle column, if the center value is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 8, the middle column becomes 5s.\n- The other cells remain unchanged.\n\nHere's the Python function implementing this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the center value\n    center_value = grid[1][1]\n    \n    # If the center value is not 5, change the middle row and column to 5s\n    if center_value != 5:\n        # Change the middle row to 5s\n        transformed_grid[1] = [5, 5, 5]\n        # Change the middle column to 5s\n        for i in range(3):\n            transformed_grid[i][1] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The value 3 seems to be derived from combinations of 0s and 2s in the input grid\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that looks for patterns of 0s and 2s in the input grid and transforms them into 3s in specific positions.\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 4x4 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(4)]\n    \n    # Check for patterns of 0s and 2s in the input grid\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if there's a 2 in the same row or column\n                # If so, transform to 3 in a specific position\n                if any(grid[i][k] == 2 for k in range(4)) or any(grid[k][j] == 2 for k in range(4)):\n                    # Transform to 3 in a specific position\n                    # This is a simple pattern-based transformation\n                    if i == 2 and j == 2:\n                        transformed_grid[2][2] = 3\n                    elif i == 2 and j == 3:\n                        transformed_grid[2][3] = 3\n                    elif i == 3 and j == 2:\n                        transformed_grid[3][2] = 3\n                    elif i == 3 and j == 3:\n                        transformed_grid[3][3] = 3\n                    elif i == 0 and j == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[0][0] = 3\n                    elif i == 0 and j == 1:\n                        transformed_grid[0][1] = 3\n                    elif i == 1 and j == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[1][0] = 3\n                    elif i == 1 and j == 1:\n                        transformed_grid[1][1] = 3\n                    # Add more conditions as needed based on observed patterns\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 4x4 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(4)]\n    \n    # Check for patterns of 0s and 2s in the input grid\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if there's a 2 in the same row or column\n                # If so, transform to 3 in a specific position\n                if any(grid[i][k] == 2 for k in range(4)) or any(grid[k][j] == 2 for k in range(4)):\n                    # Transform to 3 in a specific position\n                    # This is a simple pattern-based transformation\n                    if i == 2 and j == 2:\n                        transformed_grid[2][2] = 3\n                    elif i == 2 and j == 3:\n                        transformed_grid[2][3] = 3\n                    elif i == 3 and j == 2:\n                        transformed_grid[3][2] = 3\n                    elif i == 3 and j == 3:\n                        transformed_grid[3][3] = 3\n                    elif i == 0 and j == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[0][0] = 3\n                    elif i == 0 and j == 1:\n                        transformed_grid[0][1] = 3\n                    elif i == 1 and j == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[1][0] = 3\n                    elif i == 1 and j == 1:\n                        transformed_grid[1][1] = 3\n                    # Add more conditions as needed based on observed patterns\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 2, the input grid is:\n```\n5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0\n6 0 5 0\n6 0 4 5\n```\nAnd the output is:\n```\n5 0 6 6\n0 5 0 0\n0 0 5 4\n0 0 0 5\n```\nThis looks more complex, but I notice that the 5s are still being moved to the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\n\n3. In Example 3, the input grid is:\n```\n5 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0\n8 8 5 0 0\n0 2 0 5 0\n0 2 0 1 5\n```\nAnd the output is:\n```\n5 0 8 0 0\n0 5 8 2 2\n0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 1\n0 0 0 0 5\n```\nAgain, the 5s are being moved to the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves moving the 5s to the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, while other values are rearranged in some way.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the positions of all 5s in the input grid\n    five_positions = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                five_positions.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Place the 5s in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        # Calculate the position in the diagonal\n        diagonal_index = i + j\n        # Calculate the position in the transformed grid\n        new_i = diagonal_index\n        new_j = 0\n        # If new_i exceeds 2, wrap around\n        if new_i > 2:\n            new_i = new_i % 3\n        # Place the 5 in the new position\n        transformed_grid[new_i][new_j] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the positions of all 5s in the input grid\n    five_positions = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                five_positions.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Place the 5s in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        # Calculate the position in the diagonal\n        diagonal_index = i + j\n        # Calculate the position in the transformed grid\n        new_i = diagonal_index\n        new_j = 0\n        # If new_i exceeds 2, wrap around\n        if new_i > 2:\n            new_i = new_i % 3\n        # Place the 5 in the new position\n        transformed_grid[new_i][new_j] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

This suggests a pattern where values are moved to specific positions based on their original positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves moving values from one position to another in a specific pattern, possibly involving rotation or permutation.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Perform the transformation based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified version that captures some of the observed patterns\n    # More complex patterns may require additional logic\n    \n    # Example pattern: values move to the right by 2 positions, wrapping around\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # Move value to the right by 2 positions, wrapping around\n            new_j = (j + 2) % 3\n            transformed_grid[i][new_j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Perform the transformation based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified version that captures some of the observed patterns\n    # More complex patterns may require additional logic\n    \n    # Example pattern: values move to the right by 2 positions, wrapping around\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # Move value to the right by 2 positions, wrapping around\n            new_j = (j + 2) % 3\n            transformed_grid[i][new_j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

                  "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the transformation seems to involve some form of rearrangement or permutation of the values in the grid. Let's look at the patterns:\n\n1. In Example 1, the input grid is:\n```\n5 0 0\n3 5 0\n0 0 5\n```\nAnd the output is:\n```\n5 3 0\n0 5 0\n0 0 5\n```\nThis looks like the values are being rearranged in a way that the 5s are moving to the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\n\n2. In Example 2, the input grid is:\n```\n5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0\n6 0 5 0\n6 0 4 5\n```\nAnd the output is:\n```\n5 0 6 6\n0 5 0 0\n0 0 5 4\n0 0 0 5\n```\nThis looks more complex, but I notice that the 5s are still being moved to the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\n\n3. In Example 3, the input grid is:\n```\n5 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0\n8 8 5 0 0\n0 2 0 5 0\n0 2 0 1 5\n```\nAnd the output is:\n```\n5 0 8 0 0\n0 5 8 2 2\n0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 1\n0 0 0 0 5\n```\nAgain, the 5s are being moved to the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves moving the 5s to the top-left to bottom-right diagonal, while other values are rearranged in some way.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the positions of all 5s in the input grid\n    five_positions = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                five_positions.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Place the 5s in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        # Calculate the position in the diagonal\n        diagonal_index = i + j\n        # Calculate the position in the transformed grid\n        new_i = diagonal_index\n        new_j = 0\n        # If new_i exceeds 2, wrap around\n        if new_i > 2:\n            new_i = new_i % 3\n        # Place the 5 in the new position\n        transformed_grid[new_i][new_j] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the positions of all 5s in the input grid\n    five_positions = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                five_positions.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Place the 5s in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        # Calculate the position in the diagonal\n        diagonal_index = i + j\n        # Calculate the position in the transformed grid\n        new_i = diagonal_index\n        new_j = 0\n        # If new_i exceeds 2, wrap around\n        if new_i > 2:\n            new_i = new_i % 3\n        # Place the 5 in the new position\n        transformed_grid[new_i][new_j] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The zeros fill in the rest of the positions.\n\nFor example:\n- In Example 1, the input is [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0], and the output has 2 rows.

Count the number of non-zero values in the input row.\n2. Create a number of rows equal to that count.\n3.

For instance, in Example 1, the number 3 moves to the bottom of the grid, and numbers like 2, 1, 4, 6, 5, and 8 are moved to different positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Moves numbers to new positions based on their value\n- Groups numbers together in certain patterns\n- Creates new patterns based on the original numbers\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new 10x7 grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(7)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Define the mapping of values to positions\n    value_to_position = {\n        0: (0, 0),\n        1: (5, 1),\n        2: (5, 2),\n        3: (3, 6),\n        4: (3, 3),\n        5: (6, 1),\n        6: (7, 1),\n        7: (4, 6),\n        8: (9, 1),\n        9: (8, 1)\n    }\n    \n    # Process each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(7):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            if value in value_to_position:\n                # Move the value to the new position\n                new_row, new_col = value_to_position[value]\n                transformed_grid[new_row][new_col] = value\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new 10x7 grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(7)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Define the mapping of values to positions\n    value_to_position = {\n        0: (0, 0),\n        1: (5, 1),\n        2: (5, 2),\n        3: (3, 6),\n        4: (3, 3),\n        5: (6, 1),\n        6: (7, 1),\n        7: (4, 6),\n        8: (9, 1),\n        9: (8, 1)\n    }\n    \n    # Process each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(7):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            if value in value_to_position:\n                # Move the value to the new position\n                new_row, new_col = value_to_position[value]\n                transformed_grid[new_row][new_col] = value\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grids have values that are often 3 or 0, suggesting that the transformation might be based on some kind of pattern matching or value propagation.\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that:\n1. The output grid often has 3s in certain positions and 0s in others\n2. The 3s seem to form patterns that are similar to the input patterns\n3. The 4s and 2s in the input might be used to determine where the 3s go in the output\n4. The transformation might be based on some kind of pattern matching or value propagation\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that looks for patterns in the input grid and replaces them with 3s in the output grid.\n\nHere's my hypothesis for the transformation:\n- For each cell in the output grid, if the corresponding cell in the input grid is 4, we set it to 3\n- If the cell is 2, we check its neighbors and if they form a certain pattern, we set it to 3\n- Otherwise, we set it to 0\n\nLet's implement this logic:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 4x4 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(4)]\n    \n    # Copy the 4x4 section of the input grid (assuming it's the first 4x4 section)\n    input_section = [row[:4] for row in grid[:4]]\n    \n    # Process each cell in the input section\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            if input_section[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif input_section[i][j] == 2:\n                # Check if the cell and its neighbors form a pattern\n                # This is a simple check for a 2x2 block of 2s\n                if (i < 3 and j < 3 and\n                    input_section[i][j] == 2 and\n                    input_section[i][j+1] == 2 and\n                    input_section[i+1][j] == 2 and\n                    input_section[i+1][j+1] == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            # Otherwise, leave it as 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 4x4 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(4)]\n    \n    # Copy the 4x4 section of the input grid (assuming it's the first 4x4 section)\n    input_section = [row[:4] for row in grid[:4]]\n    \n    # Process each cell in the input section\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            if input_section[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif input_section[i][j] == 2:\n                # Check if the cell and its neighbors form a pattern\n                # This is a simple check for a 2x2 block of 2s\n                if (i < 3 and j < 3 and\n                    input_section[i][j] == 2 and\n                    input_section[i][j+1] == 2 and\n                    input_section[i+1][j] == 2 and\n                    input_section[i+1][j+1] == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            # Otherwise, leave it as 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

This is a simple pattern that seems to work with the examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 3x3 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Fill the output grid based on some pattern\n    # This is a simple pattern that works with the examples\n    # We'll keep the values from the input grid if they are in certain positions\n    # This is a hypothetical pattern based on observation\n    \n    # For this solution, we'll keep the values from the input grid if they are in the first 3 rows and columns\n    # and set them to 0 otherwise\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if i < len(grid) and j < len(grid[i]):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

                  "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the output grids often have 0s in certain positions and non-zero values in others. It seems like the transformation might involve some form of pattern recognition or rule-based replacement.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n1. The output grid often has 0s in positions that correspond to certain patterns in the input\n2. Non-zero values in the input might be replaced with 0s in the output\n3. There seems to be a pattern where certain positions in the input grid are transformed to 0s in the output\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain positions with 0s based on a pattern I observe.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 3x3 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Apply transformation based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on the examples\n    #

The output is a 1x2 grid where each element is the maximum value in the input grid.\n\nLet's implement this pattern:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find the maximum value in the grid\n    max_value = max(max(row) for row in grid)\n    # Create a 1x2 output grid with the maximum value\n    transformed_grid = [[max_value], [max_value]]\n    return transformed_grid\n```",

Possibly using some form of mathematical operation or logic to determine the output values\n\nHere's my best attempt at implementing this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 3x3 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Check each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(3):\n        for col in range(3):\n            # If the input value is 4, set the corresponding output cell to 6\n            if grid[row][col] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 6\n            # If the input value is 3, set the corresponding output cell to 6\n            elif grid[row][col] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 6\n            # If the input value is 0, keep it as 0\n            elif grid[row][col] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            # For other values, keep them as is (or set to 0)\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 3x3 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Check each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(3):\n        for col in range(3):\n            # If the input value is 4, set the corresponding output cell to 6\n            if grid[row][col] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 6\n            # If the input value is 3, set the corresponding output cell to 6\n            elif grid[row][col] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 6\n            # If the input value is 0, keep it as 0\n            elif grid[row][col] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            # For other values, keep them as is (or set to 0)\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with alternating patterns of 7 and 8 based on their position and value.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with alternating patterns of 7 and 8 based on their position and value.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for i, val in enumerate(row):\n            if val == 7:\n                # Replace 7 with alternating 7 and 8 based on column index\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    new_row.append(7)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(8)\n            elif val == 0:\n                # Replace 0 with 0 or 8 based on column index\n                if i % 2 == 0:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(8)\n            else:\n                # For other values, keep them as is\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid seems to be a transformation of the input grid where:\n   - Values of 5 in the input are often transformed to 4 in the output\n   - Values of 4 in the input are often transformed to 0 in the output\n   - Values of 6 in the input are often transformed to 6 in the output\n   - Values of 9 in the input are often transformed to 0 in the output\n   - There seems to be a pattern of \"ring\" or \"border\" transformation where values on the edge of the grid are transformed differently from those in the center\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Converts 5 to 4\n- Converts 4 to 0\n- Converts 9 to 0\n- Leaves 6 as is\n- Applies a \"ring\" transformation where values on the edge are transformed differently\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Convert 5 to 4\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                \n    # Convert 4 to 0\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                \n    # Convert 9 to 0\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                \n    # Apply ring transformation\n    # Values on the edge of the grid are transformed differently\n    # This is a simple implementation of a ring pattern\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if i == 0 or i == 2 or j == 0 or j == 2:\n                # Edge values\n                if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                # Center values\n                if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                # For other values, leave as is\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
