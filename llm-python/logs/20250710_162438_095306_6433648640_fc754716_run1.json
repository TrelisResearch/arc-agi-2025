          "Let's analyze the patterns from the training examples:\n\nObservations:\n1. Each input has mostly zeros except for one colored cell somewhere in the grid (the \"center\" cell or a unique cell).\n2. The output replaces the input's center colored cell with a \"frame\" or \"border\" of that color around the edges of the output grid.\n3. The output grids have the same width as the input in example 3 and 4, but in examples 1 and 2 the input grid is smaller. However, the instruction clearly says the output grid must always be 3x3, so we have to produce a 3x3 output in code.\n4. The frame formed by this color is on the outside/edges of the output grid.\n5. Inside the frame is either zero or partially zero rows/cols, with the original center cell's position roughly corresponding to zeros inside.\n\nSummary:\n- Find the single nonzero color value in the input.\n- Output a 3x3 grid.\n- Set the frame (edges) of the 3x3 grid to that color.\n- Set the center cell (position (1,1)) to zero.\n\nThis matches the first example perfectly:\nInput (3x3):\n  0 0 0\n  0 2 0\n  0 0 0\nOutput:\n  2 2 2\n  2 0 2\n  2 2 2\n\nSimilarly for the other examples, the frame is colored with the found color, the inner cells are zero.\n\nWe will:\n- Scan the input grid for the nonzero cell (should be just one).\n- Get its color.\n- Make a 3x3 grid filled with that color.\n- Set the center cell to zero.\n- Return that 3x3 grid.\n\nThis satisfies the requirement \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\"\n\nNote: The larger outputs in training examples 3 and 4 show a larger frame but since the requirement is fixed 3x3 outputs, we produce a 3x3 framed grid.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find the unique nonzero color in the input grid\n    color = 0\n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            if val != 0:\n                color = val\n                break\n        if color != 0:\n            break\n            \n    # Create 3x3 grid filled with the found color\n    output = [[color]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Set the center cell to zero\n    output[1][1] = 0\n    \n    return output\n```"

The output grids form a border of that single non-zero value color around the outer edge of the grid, and the inside mostly zeros.\n3. The size of the output grid is the same as the input grid, except for the first two examples, where outputs are smaller or equal to input size vertically.\n   - Example 1: input 3x3 \u2192 output 3x3\n   - Example 2: input 5x3 (5 rows, 3 cols) \u2192 output 5x3 (same size)\n   - Example 3: input 7x5 \u2192 output 5x7 (swapped dimensions, but really it's 7x5 -- from task description, Example 3 output shape is 5x7). Seems here the output has the same shape but drawn with border.\n   - Example 4: input 5x5 \u2192 output 5x5\n4. The output is a border of the central color around the entire output grid, and filled zeros inside.\n5. The central color is located by detecting the single non-zero value inside input; outputs are the same size or sometimes reshaped with that border pattern.\n\nCrucially, the requirement for our transformation is:\n\n> The transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\n\nThis makes it challenging because we have larger inputs in training.\n\nHence, our best guess for this 3\u00d73 output transformation is:\n\n- Find the single non-zero color in the input grid (assume exactly one).\n- Produce a 3x3 grid where the border cells are set to this color.\n- The center cell is zero.\n\nThis pattern matches well with Example 1 output directly: a 3x3 grid with border of the color 2, center 0.\n\nOther examples output larger grids, but for the task we must always output 3x3 so we stick with what Example 1 shows.\n\nSo to summarize:\n\n- Detect the unique non-zero color in the input.\n- Create a 3x3 grid with that color on the border cells.\n- Set center cell to zero.\n\nThis will produce a meaningful border pattern consistent with Example 1, and consistent with the general idea of \"highlighting\" the border with the detected central color.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find the unique non-zero color in the input\n    color = None\n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            if val != 0:\n                color = val\n                break\n        if color is not None:\n            break\n    \n    # Construct 3x3 output grid\n    # Border cells set to color, center cell = 0\n    transformed_grid = [[color if r in (0,2) or c in (0,2) else 0 for c in range(3)] for r in range(3)]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```"
