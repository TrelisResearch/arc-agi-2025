This suggests that the output is a transformation of the input grid that repeats or extends it in some way.\n\nLooking at the examples more closely:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n1 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 0 0\nOutput:\n1 1 0\n1 1 1\n0 0 0\n0 0 0\n1 1 1\n1 1 0\n\nThe output seems to be the input grid repeated in a specific pattern.
