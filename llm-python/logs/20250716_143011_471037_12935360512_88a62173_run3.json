    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, I have three training examples, and I need to find out how the input grid transforms into the output grid. The output is always a 2x2 grid. Let me look at each example carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput is a 5x5 grid. The output is 2x2. Let me look at the input values and see if there's any pattern. The input for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 0 2\nRow 1: 2 2 0 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 2 0 2 2\nRow 4: 2 2 0 2 0\n\nThe output is:\n2 2\n2 0\n\nHmm. So the output is two rows, each with two elements. Maybe the output is derived from certain positions in the input. Let me think about possible positions. For example, maybe the output is based on some specific cells in the input grid. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1: first row is 2 and 2. Second row is 2 and 0. Let me check the input. Maybe the output is determined by taking certain cells from the input. For example, maybe the first output cell is the value at (0,1) which is 2, then (0,4) is 2. But that's two cells. Wait, but the output is two cells per row. Maybe the first row of output is the maximum of certain positions? Or maybe it's based on some pattern like the positions where the value is 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by looking at the positions where the input has certain values. For example, maybe the output is based on the positions of the 2s in the input. Let's see. In Example 1, the output is 2 2 in the first row. Let me check the positions where 2s are in the input. For example, in row 0, positions 1 and 4 are 2. Row 1 has positions 0,1,3,4. Row 3 has positions 1,3,4. Row 4 has positions 0,1,3. Maybe the output is based on the positions of the 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the output is a 2x2 grid where each cell is determined by some condition. Let's think about the first output cell (top-left). In Example 1, it's 2. Maybe it's the number of 2s in a certain region. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by looking at the corners of the input grid. For example, in Example 1, the input is 5x5. The corners are (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4). Let's check their values. (0,0) is 0, (0,4) is 2, (4,0) is 2, (4,4) is 0. But the output is 2 2 in the first row. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 2s in the input. Let me think about the output for Example 1. The first row of output is 2 and 2. The second row is 2 and 0. Let's see: maybe each cell in the output is determined by the count of 2s in certain regions. For example, the first row of output could be the count of 2s in the first and third columns of the input. Or maybe the output is based on some kind of parity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by looking at the positions where the input has 2s. For example, the first output cell is the number of 2s in the first column. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 1, the first column of the input is:\n\nRow 0: 0\n\nRow 1: 2\n\nRow 2: 0\n\nRow 3: 0\n\nRow 4: 2\n\nSo that's 2s in row 1 and 4. So count is 2. So first output cell is 2. Then the second cell in the first row of output is 2. Maybe that's the count of 2s in the third column? Let's check third column:\n\nRow 0: 0\n\nRow 1: 0\n\nRow 2: 0\n\nRow 3: 2\n\nRow 4: 0\n\nSo count is 1. But the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the output is determined by the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the first output cell is the number of 2s in the top-left quadrant. But the input is 5x5. The quadrants would be 2x2 each. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the output is a 2x2 grid where each cell is the value of the input at certain positions. For example, maybe the first output cell is the value at (0,1), the second is (0,4), third is (4,1), fourth is (4,4). Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, (0,1) is 2, (0,4) is 2, (4,1) is 2, (4,4) is 0. Then the output would be:\n\nFirst row: 2, 2\n\nSecond row: 2, 0. Which matches the output. That seems possible. Let me check if this holds for the other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n\nInput is:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 0 1 0\n\nRow 1: 0 1 0 0 1\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 1 0 0 1 0\n\nRow 4: 1 1 0 0 1\n\nOutput is:\n\n1 0\n\n1 1\n\nSo according to the previous hypothesis, the output would be the values at (0,1), (0,4), (4,1), (4,4). Let's check:\n\n(0,1) is 0. (0,4) is 0. (4,1) is 1. (4,4) is 1. So the output would be:\n\nFirst row: 0, 0\n\nSecond row: 1, 1. But the actual output is 1 0 in first row and 1 1 in second. So that doesn't match. So maybe this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions are different. Let's think again.\n\nIn Example 1, the output is 2 2 in the first row. Maybe those are the values at (0,1) and (0,4). Then the second row of output is 2 and 0, which could be (4,1) and (4,4). But in Example 2, the output is 1 0 in first row. Let's check the input for Example 2:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 0 1 0 \u2192 (0,1) is 0, (0,4) is 0. So first row of output would be 0 and 0. But the actual output is 1 and 0. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is based on the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the output is determined by the positions where the input has 2s. Let's think about the first example. The output is 2 2 in the first row. Maybe that's the count of 2s in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the first output cell is the number of 2s in the first row. Let's check Example 1: first row is 0 2 0 0 2 \u2192 two 2s. So first output cell is 2. Second output cell in first row is the number of 2s in the third row? But third row is all zeros. That would be zero. But the output is 2 and 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the first row of output is the number of 2s in the first and third columns of the input. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, first column has two 2s (row 1 and 4). Third column (column 2) has 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So total 2. So first row of output would be 2 and 2. Then second row would be the number of 2s in column 1 and 3? Wait, but that's not matching the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the first output cell is the number of 2s in the top-left 2x2 square. Let's see for Example 1:\n\nTop-left 2x2 square is rows 0-1, columns 0-1. Values:\n\nRow 0: 0, 2\n\nRow 1: 2, 2 \u2192 total 3 2s. But the output is 2 in first row first cell. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look at the outputs of the three examples and see if there's a pattern.\n\nExample 1 output is 2 2 in first row, 2 0 in second.\n\nExample 2 output is 1 0 in first row, 1 1 in second.\n\nExample 3 output is 0 8 in first row, 8 0 in second.\n\nLooking at the outputs, maybe the first row of output is determined by the values at positions (0,1) and (0,4), and the second row is (4,1) and (4,4). Let's check:\n\nExample 1:\n\n(0,1) is 2, (0,4) is 2 \u2192 first row is 2 2.\n\n(4,1) is 2, (4,4) is 0 \u2192 second row 2 0. Which matches.\n\nExample 2:\n\n(0,1) is 0, (0,4) is 0 \u2192 first row 0 0. But the output is 1 0. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So that's not correct. But maybe the positions are different. Maybe the first row is (0,1) and (4,4), and the second row is (4,1) and (0,4)? Let's check:\n\nExample 1:\n\n(0,1) is 2, (4,4) is 0 \u2192 first row 2 0. But the output is 2 2. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions are (0,1), (1,1), (4,1), (4,4). Let's check for example 1:\n\n(0,1) is 2, (1,1) is 2. So first row is 2 2. Then (4,1) is 2, (4,4) is 0. So second row 2 0. Which matches.\n\nExample 2's output is first row 1 0. Let's check:\n\n(0,1) is 0, (1,1) is 1. So first row would be 0 and 1. But the output is 1 and 0. Hmm. Not matching. But maybe the first row is (1,1) and (0,4)? Let's see:\n\nIn example 2, (1,1) is 1, (0,4) is 0 \u2192 first row 1 0. Which matches the output. Then the second row would be (4,1) and (4,4). For example 2, (4,1) is 1, (4,4) is 1. So second row is 1 1. Which matches the output. That seems to fit!\n\nLet me check this hypothesis for example 3.\n\nExample 3 input:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 0 0 8\n\nRow 1: 8 0 0 8 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 8 8 0 8 8\n\nRow 4: 8 0 0 8 0\n\nOutput is 0 8 in first row and 8 0 in second.\n\nAccording to the hypothesis, the first row is (1,1) and (0,4). Let's check:\n\n(1,1) is 0. (0,4) is 8. So first row is 0 and 8. Which matches the output. Second row is (4,1) and (4,4). (4,1) is 0, (4,4) is 0. Wait, but the output is 8 and 0. That doesn't fit. Hmm. Wait, what's (4,1) in example 3? Row 4 is 8 0 0 8 0. So column 1 is 0. (4,4) is 0. So according to the hypothesis, second row would be 0 and 0. But the output is 8 and 0. So that's not matching. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the second row is (4,1) and (0,4)? Let me check:\n\nIn example 3, (4,1) is 0, (0,4) is 8. So second row would be 0 and 8. But the output is 8 and 0. So that's not matching either.\n\nHmm. So this approach works for example 1 and 2, but not example 3. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions (1,1) and (0,4) for the first row, and (4,1) and (4,4) for the second row. Let's check example 3 again.\n\nFor example 3, the output is 0 8 and 8 0. According to the previous hypothesis, first row would be (1,1)=0 and (0,4)=8. That's correct. Second row would be (4,1)=0 and (4,4)=0. But the output is 8 0. So that's not matching. So maybe the second row is (1,4) and (4,1)? Let me check:\n\n(1,4) is 0 (row 1, column 4 is 0). (4,1) is 0. So that's 0 and 0. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe the second row is (1,4) and (4,1) but swapped. So 0 and 0. Still no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second row is (4,1) and (1,4). For example 3, that's 0 and 0. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions (0,1), (1,4), (4,1), (4,4). Let's check for example 3:\n\nFirst row: (0,1) is 8, (1,4) is 0. So 8 and 0. But the output is 0 8. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions (0,1), (0,4), (4,1), (4,4) for the first and second rows. But example 3's output is 0 8 and 8 0. Let's check:\n\n(0,1) is 8, (0,4) is 8. So first row would be 8 8. But the output is 0 8. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the three examples:\n\nExample 1 output: 2 2 in first row, 2 0 in second.\n\nExample 2 output: 1 0 in first row, 1 1 in second.\n\nExample 3 output: 0 8 in first row, 8 0 in second.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the first row of output seems to be (something) and (something else), and the second row is (something else) and (something else). Maybe there's a pattern where the first row is the values at (0,1) and (0,4), and the second row is (4,1) and (4,4). But for example 3, that would be:\n\n(0,1) is 8, (0,4) is 8 \u2192 first row 8 8. But the output is 0 8. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, but in example 3, the output is 0 8 and 8 0. Let me check the input for example 3. The input is:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 0 0 8 \u2192 columns 0-4.\n\nRow 1: 8 0 0 8 0 \u2192 columns 0-4.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 8 8 0 8 8.\n\nRow 4: 8 0 0 8 0.\n\nSo (0,1) is 8, (0,4) is 8. So first row of output would be 8 and 8. But the output is 0 and 8. So that's not matching. So this approach is not working.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is determined by the positions where the input has the maximum value in certain regions. For example, in example 1, the first row of output is 2 and 2. Maybe those are the maximum values in certain areas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions where the input has a certain value. For example, in example 1, the output is 2 in the first row. Maybe it's the count of 2s in the first row. First row has two 2s. So that's 2. Then the second cell in the first row is the count of 2s in the third row. Third row is all zeros, so zero. But the output is 2 and 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of the 2s. For example, the first row of output is the count of 2s in the first column and third column. Let's check example 1:\n\nFirst column has two 2s. Third column has zero. So first row would be 2 and 0. But the output is 2 and 2. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the output is determined by the values at positions (1,1) and (1,4) for the first row, and (4,1) and (4,4) for the second row. Let's check:\n\nExample 1:\n\n(1,1) is 2, (1,4) is 2 \u2192 first row 2 2. Second row (4,1) is 2, (4,4) is 0 \u2192 2 0. Which matches.\n\nExample 2:\n\n(1,1) is 1, (1,4) is 1 \u2192 first row 1 1. But the output is 1 0. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nWait, maybe the first row of output is (1,1) and (0,4), and the second row is (4,1) and (1,4). Let's check example 2.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 0 1 0 \u2192 (0,4) is 0.\n\nRow 1: 0 1 0 0 1 \u2192 (1,1) is 1. So first row would be 1 and 0 \u2192 matches the output of 1 0. Second row: (4,1) is 1, (1,4) is 1 \u2192 1 and 1. Which matches the output of 1 1. That works for example 2.\n\nNow check example 3:\n\nFirst row is (1,1) and (0,4). (1,1) is 0 (row 1, column 1 is 0). (0,4) is 8. So first row is 0 and 8. Which matches the output. Second row is (4,1) and (1,4). (4,1) is 0, (1,4) is 0. So second row would be 0 and 0. But the output is 8 and 0. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, in example 3, the output is 0 8 and 8 0. So the second row is 8 and 0. How can we get that?\n\nMaybe the second row is (1,4) and (4,1)? For example 3, (1,4) is 0, (4,1) is 0. So that would be 0 and 0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second row is (4,1) and (0,4). For example 3, (4,1) is 0 and (0,4) is 8 \u2192 0 and 8. But the output is 8 and 0. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at example 3's output, the second row is 8 and 0. Let's look at the input for example 3. Which positions have 8? For example, row 0 has 8 in column 0 and 1, 4. Row 1 has 8 in column 0 and 3. Row 3 has 8 in columns 0,1,3,4. Row 4 has 8 in column 0 and 3.\n\nSo maybe the second row of output is derived from the positions (0,0) and (4,4). But (0,0) is 8, (4,4) is 0. So that would be 8 0. Which matches the output. And the first row is (1,1) and (0,4) \u2192 0 and 8. Which matches. So perhaps the pattern is:\n\nFirst row is (1,1) and (0,4).\n\nSecond row is (0,0) and (4,4).\n\nBut let's check this with example 1 and 2.\n\nExample 1:\n\nFirst row is (1,1) is 2 and (0,4) is 2 \u2192 2 2. Correct.\n\nSecond row is (0,0) is 0 and (4,4) is 0 \u2192 0 0. But the output is 2 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second row is (4,0) and (0,4). For example 1, (4,0) is 2, (0,4) is 2. So 2 2. But output is 2 0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second row is (4,0) and (4,4). For example 1: 2 and 0. Which matches. For example 2: (4,0) is 1, (4,4) is 1. So output would be 1 1. Which matches example 2's second row. For example 3: (4,0) is 8, (4,4) is 0 \u2192 8 0. Which matches the output. And for example 3's first row, (1,1) is 0, (0,4) is 8 \u2192 0 8. Which matches. So this seems to fit all three examples!\n\nLet me check this hypothesis.\n\nFor example 1:\n\nFirst row of output is (1,1) and (0,4) \u2192 2 and 2. Correct.\n\nSecond row is (4,0) and (4,4) \u2192 2 and 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2:\n\nFirst row is (1,1) and (0,4) \u2192 1 and 0. Correct.\n\nSecond row is (4,0) and (4,4) \u2192 1 and 1. Correct.\n\nExample 3:\n\nFirst row is (1,1) and (0,4) \u2192 0 and 8. Correct.\n\nSecond row is (4,0) and (4,4) \u2192 8 and 0. Correct.\n\nYes! This seems to fit all three examples. So the pattern is:\n\nThe output is a 2x2 grid where:\n\n- The first row is the values at (1,1) and (0,4) of the input.\n\n- The second row is the values at (4,0) and (4,4) of the input.\n\nWait, but why are these positions chosen? Let me think. The input is always 5x5, so the indices are from 0 to 4 for rows and columns. The positions (1,1), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4) are specific points in the grid.\n\nSo the transformation is: take the values at these four positions and arrange them into a 2x2 grid. The first row is (1,1) and (0,4), and the second row is (4,0) and (4,4). \n\nBut wait, for example 2, the second row is (4,0) and (4,4), which are 1 and 1. Which matches the output. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nTake the input grid, and get the values at:\n\nrow 1, column 1 \u2192 grid[1][1]\n\nrow 0, column 4 \u2192 grid[0][4]\n\nrow 4, column 0 \u2192 grid[4][0]\n\nrow 4, column 4 \u2192 grid[4][4]\n\nThen, arrange them into a 2x2 grid:\n\nFirst row is [grid[1][1], grid[0][4]]\n\nSecond row is [grid[4][0], grid[4][4]]\n\nSo the output is:\n\n[ [grid[1][1], grid[0][4]], [grid[4][0], grid[4][4]] ]\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\ngrid[1][1] is 2 (row 1, column 1 is 2).\n\ngrid[0][4] is 2 (row 0, column 4 is 2).\n\ngrid[4][0] is 2 (row 4, column 0 is 2).\n\ngrid[4][4] is 0 (row 4, column 4 is 0).\n\nSo output is [[2,2], [2,0]] \u2192 correct.\n\nExample 2:\n\ngrid[1][1] is 1 (row 1, column 1 is 1).\n\ngrid[0][4] is 0 (row 0, column 4 is 0).\n\ngrid[4][0] is 1 (row 4, column 0 is 1).\n\ngrid[4][4] is 1 (row 4, column 4 is 1).\n\nSo output is [[1,0], [1,1]] \u2192 correct.\n\nExample 3:\n\ngrid[1][1] is 0 (row 1, column 1 is 0).\n\ngrid[0][4] is 8 (row 0, column 4 is 8).\n\ngrid[4][0] is 8 (row 4, column 0 is 8).\n\ngrid[4][4] is 0 (row 4, column 4 is 0).\n\nSo output is [[0,8], [8,0]] \u2192 correct.\n\nYes! This seems to work. So the transformation is to take these four specific positions from the input grid and arrange them into the output grid as described.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\n5 5 0 5 0\n\n0 5 0 0 5\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n5 5 0 5 5\n\n0 5 0 0 5\n\nSo the input is a 5x5 grid. Let's compute the four values:\n\ngrid[1][1] is row 1, column 1. Row 1 is [0,5,0,0,5]. So column 1 is 5.\n\ngrid[0][4] is row 0, column 4. Row 0 is [5,5,0,5,0]. Column 4 is 0.\n\ngrid[4][0] is row 4, column 0. Row 4 is [0,5,0,0,5]. Column 0 is 0.\n\ngrid[4][4] is row 4, column 4. Which is 5.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nFirst row: 5 and 0 \u2192 [5,0]\n\nSecond row: 0 and 5 \u2192 [0,5]\n\nSo the output grid is:\n\n5 0\n\n0 5\n\nBut according to the pattern, the output should be [[5,0], [0,5]]. \n\nBut the code should return this as the transformed grid. \n\nSo the Python function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the four values\n    a = grid[1][1]\n    b = grid[0][4]\n    c = grid[4][0]\n    d = grid[4][4]\n    return [[a, b], [c, d]]\n\nThis should work for all the examples. Let me check if there are any edge cases. For example, if the input is not 5x5? But according to the problem statement, the input is a 5x5 grid. The test input is also 5x5. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the final answer is this function.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, I have three training examples, and I need to find out how the input grid transforms into the output grid. The output is always a 2x2 grid. Let me look at each example carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput is a 5x5 grid. The output is 2x2. Let me look at the input values and see if there's any pattern. The input for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 0 2\nRow 1: 2 2 0 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 2 0 2 2\nRow 4: 2 2 0 2 0\n\nThe output is:\n2 2\n2 0\n\nHmm. So the output is two rows, each with two elements. Maybe the output is derived from certain positions in the input. Let me think about possible positions. For example, maybe the output is based on some specific cells in the input grid. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1: first row is 2 and 2. Second row is 2 and 0. Let me check the input. Maybe the output is determined by taking certain cells from the input. For example, maybe the first output cell is the value at (0,1) which is 2, then (0,4) is 2. But that's two cells. Wait, but the output is two cells per row. Maybe the first row of output is the maximum of certain positions? Or maybe it's based on some pattern like the positions where the value is 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by looking at the positions where the input has certain values. For example, maybe the output is based on the positions of the 2s in the input. Let's see. In Example 1, the output is 2 2 in the first row. Let me check the positions where 2s are in the input. For example, in row 0, positions 1 and 4 are 2. Row 1 has positions 0,1,3,4. Row 3 has positions 1,3,4. Row 4 has positions 0,1,3. Maybe the output is based on the positions of the 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the output is a 2x2 grid where each cell is determined by some condition. Let's think about the first output cell (top-left). In Example 1, it's 2. Maybe it's the number of 2s in a certain region. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by looking at the corners of the input grid. For example, in Example 1, the input is 5x5. The corners are (0,0), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4). Let's check their values. (0,0) is 0, (0,4) is 2, (4,0) is 2, (4,4) is 0. But the output is 2 2 in the first row. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 2s in the input. Let me think about the output for Example 1. The first row of output is 2 and 2. The second row is 2 and 0. Let's see: maybe each cell in the output is determined by the count of 2s in certain regions. For example, the first row of output could be the count of 2s in the first and third columns of the input. Or maybe the output is based on some kind of parity.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by looking at the positions where the input has 2s. For example, the first output cell is the number of 2s in the first column. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 1, the first column of the input is:\n\nRow 0: 0\n\nRow 1: 2\n\nRow 2: 0\n\nRow 3: 0\n\nRow 4: 2\n\nSo that's 2s in row 1 and 4. So count is 2. So first output cell is 2. Then the second cell in the first row of output is 2. Maybe that's the count of 2s in the third column? Let's check third column:\n\nRow 0: 0\n\nRow 1: 0\n\nRow 2: 0\n\nRow 3: 2\n\nRow 4: 0\n\nSo count is 1. But the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the output is determined by the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the first output cell is the number of 2s in the top-left quadrant. But the input is 5x5. The quadrants would be 2x2 each. Maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the output is a 2x2 grid where each cell is the value of the input at certain positions. For example, maybe the first output cell is the value at (0,1), the second is (0,4), third is (4,1), fourth is (4,4). Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, (0,1) is 2, (0,4) is 2, (4,1) is 2, (4,4) is 0. Then the output would be:\n\nFirst row: 2, 2\n\nSecond row: 2, 0. Which matches the output. That seems possible. Let me check if this holds for the other examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n\nInput is:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 0 1 0\n\nRow 1: 0 1 0 0 1\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 1 0 0 1 0\n\nRow 4: 1 1 0 0 1\n\nOutput is:\n\n1 0\n\n1 1\n\nSo according to the previous hypothesis, the output would be the values at (0,1), (0,4), (4,1), (4,4). Let's check:\n\n(0,1) is 0. (0,4) is 0. (4,1) is 1. (4,4) is 1. So the output would be:\n\nFirst row: 0, 0\n\nSecond row: 1, 1. But the actual output is 1 0 in first row and 1 1 in second. So that doesn't match. So maybe this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions are different. Let's think again.\n\nIn Example 1, the output is 2 2 in the first row. Maybe those are the values at (0,1) and (0,4). Then the second row of output is 2 and 0, which could be (4,1) and (4,4). But in Example 2, the output is 1 0 in first row. Let's check the input for Example 2:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 0 1 0 \u2192 (0,1) is 0, (0,4) is 0. So first row of output would be 0 and 0. But the actual output is 1 and 0. So that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is based on the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the output is determined by the positions where the input has 2s. Let's think about the first example. The output is 2 2 in the first row. Maybe that's the count of 2s in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the first output cell is the number of 2s in the first row. Let's check Example 1: first row is 0 2 0 0 2 \u2192 two 2s. So first output cell is 2. Second output cell in first row is the number of 2s in the third row? But third row is all zeros. That would be zero. But the output is 2 and 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the first row of output is the number of 2s in the first and third columns of the input. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, first column has two 2s (row 1 and 4). Third column (column 2) has 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So total 2. So first row of output would be 2 and 2. Then second row would be the number of 2s in column 1 and 3? Wait, but that's not matching the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions of the 2s in the input. For example, the first output cell is the number of 2s in the top-left 2x2 square. Let's see for Example 1:\n\nTop-left 2x2 square is rows 0-1, columns 0-1. Values:\n\nRow 0: 0, 2\n\nRow 1: 2, 2 \u2192 total 3 2s. But the output is 2 in first row first cell. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look at the outputs of the three examples and see if there's a pattern.\n\nExample 1 output is 2 2 in first row, 2 0 in second.\n\nExample 2 output is 1 0 in first row, 1 1 in second.\n\nExample 3 output is 0 8 in first row, 8 0 in second.\n\nLooking at the outputs, maybe the first row of output is determined by the values at positions (0,1) and (0,4), and the second row is (4,1) and (4,4). Let's check:\n\nExample 1:\n\n(0,1) is 2, (0,4) is 2 \u2192 first row is 2 2.\n\n(4,1) is 2, (4,4) is 0 \u2192 second row 2 0. Which matches.\n\nExample 2:\n\n(0,1) is 0, (0,4) is 0 \u2192 first row 0 0. But the output is 1 0. Doesn't match.\n\nHmm. So that's not correct. But maybe the positions are different. Maybe the first row is (0,1) and (4,4), and the second row is (4,1) and (0,4)? Let's check:\n\nExample 1:\n\n(0,1) is 2, (4,4) is 0 \u2192 first row 2 0. But the output is 2 2. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions are (0,1), (1,1), (4,1), (4,4). Let's check for example 1:\n\n(0,1) is 2, (1,1) is 2. So first row is 2 2. Then (4,1) is 2, (4,4) is 0. So second row 2 0. Which matches.\n\nExample 2's output is first row 1 0. Let's check:\n\n(0,1) is 0, (1,1) is 1. So first row would be 0 and 1. But the output is 1 and 0. Hmm. Not matching. But maybe the first row is (1,1) and (0,4)? Let's see:\n\nIn example 2, (1,1) is 1, (0,4) is 0 \u2192 first row 1 0. Which matches the output. Then the second row would be (4,1) and (4,4). For example 2, (4,1) is 1, (4,4) is 1. So second row is 1 1. Which matches the output. That seems to fit!\n\nLet me check this hypothesis for example 3.\n\nExample 3 input:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 0 0 8\n\nRow 1: 8 0 0 8 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 8 8 0 8 8\n\nRow 4: 8 0 0 8 0\n\nOutput is 0 8 in first row and 8 0 in second.\n\nAccording to the hypothesis, the first row is (1,1) and (0,4). Let's check:\n\n(1,1) is 0. (0,4) is 8. So first row is 0 and 8. Which matches the output. Second row is (4,1) and (4,4). (4,1) is 0, (4,4) is 0. Wait, but the output is 8 and 0. That doesn't fit. Hmm. Wait, what's (4,1) in example 3? Row 4 is 8 0 0 8 0. So column 1 is 0. (4,4) is 0. So according to the hypothesis, second row would be 0 and 0. But the output is 8 and 0. So that's not matching. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nWait, but maybe the second row is (4,1) and (0,4)? Let me check:\n\nIn example 3, (4,1) is 0, (0,4) is 8. So second row would be 0 and 8. But the output is 8 and 0. So that's not matching either.\n\nHmm. So this approach works for example 1 and 2, but not example 3. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions (1,1) and (0,4) for the first row, and (4,1) and (4,4) for the second row. Let's check example 3 again.\n\nFor example 3, the output is 0 8 and 8 0. According to the previous hypothesis, first row would be (1,1)=0 and (0,4)=8. That's correct. Second row would be (4,1)=0 and (4,4)=0. But the output is 8 0. So that's not matching. So maybe the second row is (1,4) and (4,1)? Let me check:\n\n(1,4) is 0 (row 1, column 4 is 0). (4,1) is 0. So that's 0 and 0. Not matching. Alternatively, maybe the second row is (1,4) and (4,1) but swapped. So 0 and 0. Still no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second row is (4,1) and (1,4). For example 3, that's 0 and 0. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions (0,1), (1,4), (4,1), (4,4). Let's check for example 3:\n\nFirst row: (0,1) is 8, (1,4) is 0. So 8 and 0. But the output is 0 8. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions (0,1), (0,4), (4,1), (4,4) for the first and second rows. But example 3's output is 0 8 and 8 0. Let's check:\n\n(0,1) is 8, (0,4) is 8. So first row would be 8 8. But the output is 0 8. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the three examples:\n\nExample 1 output: 2 2 in first row, 2 0 in second.\n\nExample 2 output: 1 0 in first row, 1 1 in second.\n\nExample 3 output: 0 8 in first row, 8 0 in second.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the first row of output seems to be (something) and (something else), and the second row is (something else) and (something else). Maybe there's a pattern where the first row is the values at (0,1) and (0,4), and the second row is (4,1) and (4,4). But for example 3, that would be:\n\n(0,1) is 8, (0,4) is 8 \u2192 first row 8 8. But the output is 0 8. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, but in example 3, the output is 0 8 and 8 0. Let me check the input for example 3. The input is:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 0 0 8 \u2192 columns 0-4.\n\nRow 1: 8 0 0 8 0 \u2192 columns 0-4.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 8 8 0 8 8.\n\nRow 4: 8 0 0 8 0.\n\nSo (0,1) is 8, (0,4) is 8. So first row of output would be 8 and 8. But the output is 0 and 8. So that's not matching. So this approach is not working.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the output is determined by the positions where the input has the maximum value in certain regions. For example, in example 1, the first row of output is 2 and 2. Maybe those are the maximum values in certain areas.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the positions where the input has a certain value. For example, in example 1, the output is 2 in the first row. Maybe it's the count of 2s in the first row. First row has two 2s. So that's 2. Then the second cell in the first row is the count of 2s in the third row. Third row is all zeros, so zero. But the output is 2 and 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of the 2s. For example, the first row of output is the count of 2s in the first column and third column. Let's check example 1:\n\nFirst column has two 2s. Third column has zero. So first row would be 2 and 0. But the output is 2 and 2. Not matching.\n\nHmm. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the output is determined by the values at positions (1,1) and (1,4) for the first row, and (4,1) and (4,4) for the second row. Let's check:\n\nExample 1:\n\n(1,1) is 2, (1,4) is 2 \u2192 first row 2 2. Second row (4,1) is 2, (4,4) is 0 \u2192 2 0. Which matches.\n\nExample 2:\n\n(1,1) is 1, (1,4) is 1 \u2192 first row 1 1. But the output is 1 0. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nWait, maybe the first row of output is (1,1) and (0,4), and the second row is (4,1) and (1,4). Let's check example 2.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nRow 0: 1 0 0 1 0 \u2192 (0,4) is 0.\n\nRow 1: 0 1 0 0 1 \u2192 (1,1) is 1. So first row would be 1 and 0 \u2192 matches the output of 1 0. Second row: (4,1) is 1, (1,4) is 1 \u2192 1 and 1. Which matches the output of 1 1. That works for example 2.\n\nNow check example 3:\n\nFirst row is (1,1) and (0,4). (1,1) is 0 (row 1, column 1 is 0). (0,4) is 8. So first row is 0 and 8. Which matches the output. Second row is (4,1) and (1,4). (4,1) is 0, (1,4) is 0. So second row would be 0 and 0. But the output is 8 and 0. So that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, in example 3, the output is 0 8 and 8 0. So the second row is 8 and 0. How can we get that?\n\nMaybe the second row is (1,4) and (4,1)? For example 3, (1,4) is 0, (4,1) is 0. So that would be 0 and 0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second row is (4,1) and (0,4). For example 3, (4,1) is 0 and (0,4) is 8 \u2192 0 and 8. But the output is 8 and 0. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at example 3's output, the second row is 8 and 0. Let's look at the input for example 3. Which positions have 8? For example, row 0 has 8 in column 0 and 1, 4. Row 1 has 8 in column 0 and 3. Row 3 has 8 in columns 0,1,3,4. Row 4 has 8 in column 0 and 3.\n\nSo maybe the second row of output is derived from the positions (0,0) and (4,4). But (0,0) is 8, (4,4) is 0. So that would be 8 0. Which matches the output. And the first row is (1,1) and (0,4) \u2192 0 and 8. Which matches. So perhaps the pattern is:\n\nFirst row is (1,1) and (0,4).\n\nSecond row is (0,0) and (4,4).\n\nBut let's check this with example 1 and 2.\n\nExample 1:\n\nFirst row is (1,1) is 2 and (0,4) is 2 \u2192 2 2. Correct.\n\nSecond row is (0,0) is 0 and (4,4) is 0 \u2192 0 0. But the output is 2 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second row is (4,0) and (0,4). For example 1, (4,0) is 2, (0,4) is 2. So 2 2. But output is 2 0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second row is (4,0) and (4,4). For example 1: 2 and 0. Which matches. For example 2: (4,0) is 1, (4,4) is 1. So output would be 1 1. Which matches example 2's second row. For example 3: (4,0) is 8, (4,4) is 0 \u2192 8 0. Which matches the output. And for example 3's first row, (1,1) is 0, (0,4) is 8 \u2192 0 8. Which matches. So this seems to fit all three examples!\n\nLet me check this hypothesis.\n\nFor example 1:\n\nFirst row of output is (1,1) and (0,4) \u2192 2 and 2. Correct.\n\nSecond row is (4,0) and (4,4) \u2192 2 and 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2:\n\nFirst row is (1,1) and (0,4) \u2192 1 and 0. Correct.\n\nSecond row is (4,0) and (4,4) \u2192 1 and 1. Correct.\n\nExample 3:\n\nFirst row is (1,1) and (0,4) \u2192 0 and 8. Correct.\n\nSecond row is (4,0) and (4,4) \u2192 8 and 0. Correct.\n\nYes! This seems to fit all three examples. So the pattern is:\n\nThe output is a 2x2 grid where:\n\n- The first row is the values at (1,1) and (0,4) of the input.\n\n- The second row is the values at (4,0) and (4,4) of the input.\n\nWait, but why are these positions chosen? Let me think. The input is always 5x5, so the indices are from 0 to 4 for rows and columns. The positions (1,1), (0,4), (4,0), (4,4) are specific points in the grid.\n\nSo the transformation is: take the values at these four positions and arrange them into a 2x2 grid. The first row is (1,1) and (0,4), and the second row is (4,0) and (4,4). \n\nBut wait, for example 2, the second row is (4,0) and (4,4), which are 1 and 1. Which matches the output. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nTake the input grid, and get the values at:\n\nrow 1, column 1 \u2192 grid[1][1]\n\nrow 0, column 4 \u2192 grid[0][4]\n\nrow 4, column 0 \u2192 grid[4][0]\n\nrow 4, column 4 \u2192 grid[4][4]\n\nThen, arrange them into a 2x2 grid:\n\nFirst row is [grid[1][1], grid[0][4]]\n\nSecond row is [grid[4][0], grid[4][4]]\n\nSo the output is:\n\n[ [grid[1][1], grid[0][4]], [grid[4][0], grid[4][4]] ]\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\ngrid[1][1] is 2 (row 1, column 1 is 2).\n\ngrid[0][4] is 2 (row 0, column 4 is 2).\n\ngrid[4][0] is 2 (row 4, column 0 is 2).\n\ngrid[4][4] is 0 (row 4, column 4 is 0).\n\nSo output is [[2,2], [2,0]] \u2192 correct.\n\nExample 2:\n\ngrid[1][1] is 1 (row 1, column 1 is 1).\n\ngrid[0][4] is 0 (row 0, column 4 is 0).\n\ngrid[4][0] is 1 (row 4, column 0 is 1).\n\ngrid[4][4] is 1 (row 4, column 4 is 1).\n\nSo output is [[1,0], [1,1]] \u2192 correct.\n\nExample 3:\n\ngrid[1][1] is 0 (row 1, column 1 is 0).\n\ngrid[0][4] is 8 (row 0, column 4 is 8).\n\ngrid[4][0] is 8 (row 4, column 0 is 8).\n\ngrid[4][4] is 0 (row 4, column 4 is 0).\n\nSo output is [[0,8], [8,0]] \u2192 correct.\n\nYes! This seems to work. So the transformation is to take these four specific positions from the input grid and arrange them into the output grid as described.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\n5 5 0 5 0\n\n0 5 0 0 5\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n5 5 0 5 5\n\n0 5 0 0 5\n\nSo the input is a 5x5 grid. Let's compute the four values:\n\ngrid[1][1] is row 1, column 1. Row 1 is [0,5,0,0,5]. So column 1 is 5.\n\ngrid[0][4] is row 0, column 4. Row 0 is [5,5,0,5,0]. Column 4 is 0.\n\ngrid[4][0] is row 4, column 0. Row 4 is [0,5,0,0,5]. Column 0 is 0.\n\ngrid[4][4] is row 4, column 4. Which is 5.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nFirst row: 5 and 0 \u2192 [5,0]\n\nSecond row: 0 and 5 \u2192 [0,5]\n\nSo the output grid is:\n\n5 0\n\n0 5\n\nBut according to the pattern, the output should be [[5,0], [0,5]]. \n\nBut the code should return this as the transformed grid. \n\nSo the Python function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the four values\n    a = grid[1][1]\n    b = grid[0][4]\n    c = grid[4][0]\n    d = grid[4][4]\n    return [[a, b], [c, d]]\n\nThis should work for all the examples. Let me check if there are any edge cases. For example, if the input is not 5x5? But according to the problem statement, the input is a 5x5 grid. The test input is also 5x5. So the code is safe.\n\nSo the final answer is this function.\n"
