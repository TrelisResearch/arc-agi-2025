          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve some form of \"expansion\" or \"spread\" of values from certain positions.\n2. There are patterns where values like 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 4 are spread out in specific ways.\n3. The transformation appears to involve some kind of \"spread\" or \"influence\" from certain cells to their neighbors.\n4. The output grid is always 12x15, so the transformation must ensure this output size.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading values from certain cells to their neighbors in a specific pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Ensure the input is a 12x15 grid\n    if len(grid) != 12 or any(len(row) != 15 for row in grid):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input grid must be 12x15\")\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the spread pattern\n    # This is a hypothetical pattern based on observed behavior\n    # The pattern is a 3x3 grid that spreads values from the center\n    spread_pattern = [\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 1, 1],\n        [0, 1, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(15):\n            # If the cell is not zero, spread its value\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Apply the spread pattern\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        # Check if the new position is within bounds\n                        if 0 <= ni < 12 and 0 <= nj < 15:\n                            # Spread the value to the new position\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Ensure the input is a 12x15 grid\n    if len(grid) != 12 or any(len(row) != 15 for row in grid):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input grid must be 12x15\")\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the spread pattern\n    # This is a hypothetical pattern based on observed behavior\n    # The pattern is a 3x3 grid that spreads values from the center\n    spread_pattern = [\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 1, 1],\n        [0, 1, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(15):\n            # If the cell is not zero, spread its value\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Apply the spread pattern\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        # Check if the new position is within bounds\n                        if 0 <= ni < 12 and 0 <= nj < 15:\n                            # Spread the value to the new position\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed\n```",

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve some form of \"expansion\" or \"spread\" of values from certain positions.\n2. There are patterns where values like 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 4 are spread out in specific ways.\n3. The transformation appears to involve some kind of \"spread\" or \"influence\" from certain cells to their neighbors.\n4. The output grid is always 12x15, so the transformation must ensure this output size.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading values from certain cells to their neighbors in a specific pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Ensure the input is a 12x15 grid\n    if len(grid) != 12 or any(len(row) != 15 for row in grid):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input grid must be 12x15\")\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the spread pattern\n    # This is a hypothetical pattern based on observed behavior\n    # The pattern is a 3x3 grid that spreads values from the center\n    spread_pattern = [\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 1, 1],\n        [0, 1, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(15):\n            # If the cell is not zero, spread its value\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Apply the spread pattern\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        # Check if the new position is within bounds\n                        if 0 <= ni < 12 and 0 <= nj < 15:\n                            # Spread the value to the new position\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Ensure the input is a 12x15 grid\n    if len(grid) != 12 or any(len(row) != 15 for row in grid):\n        raise ValueError(\"Input grid must be 12x15\")\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the spread pattern\n    # This is a hypothetical pattern based on observed behavior\n    # The pattern is a 3x3 grid that spreads values from the center\n    spread_pattern = [\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 1, 1],\n        [0, 1, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(12):\n        for j in range(15):\n            # If the cell is not zero, spread its value\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Apply the spread pattern\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        # Check if the new position is within bounds\n                        if 0 <= ni < 12 and 0 <= nj < 15:\n                            # Spread the value to the new position\n                            transformed[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed\n```",
