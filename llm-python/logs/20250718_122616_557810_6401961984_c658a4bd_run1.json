          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let's start by analyzing Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 13x13 grid (since each line has 13 numbers), and the output is an 8x8 grid. Wait, but the problem says the output must always be 8x8. Wait, looking at the input examples, maybe the input is 13 rows, each with 13 elements? But the output is 8x8. So the transformation is from a larger grid to an 8x8 grid. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. Let's see the input's first line is all zeros. The output's first line is all 2s. Then the second line of output starts with 2, then 8s, then 2 again. Hmm. Maybe the output is derived from some kind of pattern in the input. Let's think about the positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a compressed version of the input. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking certain regions of the input and transforming them. Let me look at the input and output for Example 1.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, there are some regions with 8s and 3s and 2s. The output seems to have 2s on the borders and 8s and 3s in the middle. Maybe the output is a grid where certain cells are replaced based on their position in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying some kind of morphological operation, like erosion or dilation. Or maybe it's based on the values in the input. For example, if a cell in the input is 8, it's transformed into 8 in the output, but if it's 0, it's transformed into 2. But that seems too simplistic. Let's check the output for Example 1.\n\nIn the output of Example 1, the first row is all 2s. The second row starts with 2, then 8s, then 2. The third row is 2, 8, 3s, 8, 2. So maybe the output is a grid where certain positions are filled based on the input's values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that's formed by taking the input and applying some kind of pattern based on the positions. For example, the output might be a grid where the borders are 2s, and the inner regions are filled based on the input's values. Let's look for more clues.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a lot of 0s, 4s, 2s, 8s, etc. The output is an 8x8 grid. For example, the first line of output is all 3s. Then the second line starts with 3, then 8s, then 3 again. The third line has 3, 8, 4s, 8, 3. So maybe the output is a grid where certain positions are determined by the input's values. \n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For instance, maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input's cells and replacing them with certain values based on their position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a grid that is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation that involves the positions of certain values. For example, if a cell in the input is 8, it's transformed into 8 in the output. If it's 0, it's transformed into 2. But that doesn't fit with the first example's output. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row is all 0s. The output's first row is all 2s. So maybe 0s are replaced with 2s. Then, in the second row of the input, there are 8s and 0s. The output's second row has 2, then 8s, then 2. So maybe the 8s in the input are kept as 8s, and the 0s are replaced with 2s. But how does that fit into the output's structure?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation that involves the positions of the cells. For example, the output grid is a 8x8 grid where certain positions are determined by the input's values. For example, the output grid's cells are determined by the input's cells in certain positions.\n\nBut how to map the input to the output? Let me think about the positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has 13 rows. The output is 8 rows. So maybe the output is generated by taking a subset of the input's rows and columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is generated by taking the input and applying some kind of pattern based on the values. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the same as the input's cell if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that is formed by taking certain regions of the input. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row is all 2s. That might correspond to the top edge of the input. Then the second row is 2, 8s, 2. Maybe the 8s are in the middle of the input. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input's cells and applying some kind of transformation based on their positions. For example, the output grid's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + some offset, j + some offset). But how to determine the offset?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output is 8x8. The input is 13x13. So maybe the output is generated by taking a certain region of the input. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking a 8x8 region from the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and applying some kind of transformation based on the positions. For example, the output's cells are determined by the input's cells in certain positions. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + a, j + b), where a and b are some offsets. But how to find these?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input and replacing certain values. For example, the output is a grid where 0s are replaced with 2s, 8s are kept, and 3s are kept. But that doesn't explain the output of Example 1. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row is all 0s. The output's first row is all 2s. So 0s become 2s. Then, the second row of the input has 8s and 0s. The output's second row has 2, 8s, 2. So the 8s are kept, and the 0s become 2s. Then, in the third row of the input, there are 8s, 0s, 2s, etc. The output's third row has 2, 8, 3s, 8, 2. So maybe the 3s come from the input's 2s? Or maybe the 3s are from the input's 2s? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where each cell in the output is the maximum value in a certain region of the input. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is generated by taking the input and applying some kind of pattern where the output is a grid that has 2s on the borders and other values in the middle. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row is all 2s. Then, the second row starts and ends with 2s. The third row starts and ends with 2s. So maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input and replacing certain positions with 2s, and others with other values.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are replaced with 2s? Maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the borders of the input are converted to 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2) or something like that.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output is 8x8. The input is 13x13. So maybe the output is generated by taking a subset of the input's rows and columns. For example, the output's rows are from the input's rows 3 to 10, and columns 3 to 10. But that's just a guess. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 1, the output is 8x8. If the input is 13 rows, then taking rows 3 to 10 (inclusive) would give 8 rows. Similarly for columns. Let's see if that's possible. For example, the input's third row (index 2) is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. The output's third row is 2 8 3 3 3 3 8 2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying some kind of transformation based on their position. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the same as the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2) if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid where each cell is the same as the input's cell if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. But that doesn't fit with the first example's output. For example, in the first row of the input, all are 0s, which would become 2s in the output. That matches the first row of the output. Then, in the second row of the input, there are 8s and 0s. The output's second row has 2, 8s, 2. So the 0s are replaced with 2s, and the 8s are kept. That seems to fit. Then, in the third row of the input, there are 8s, 0s, 2s, etc. The output's third row is 2, 8, 3s, 8, 2. So the 3s are from the input's 2s? Or maybe the 3s are from the input's 2s. Wait, in the input's third row, there's a 2 in the fifth column. But the output's third row has 3s. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying some kind of transformation where certain values are replaced based on their position. For example, if a cell in the input is 0, it's replaced with 2, if it's 8, it's kept, if it's 2, it's replaced with 3. But that would explain the third row of the output. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1's third row of input: 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. The output's third row is 2 8 3 3 3 8 3 2. Wait, but the input's third row has 3s in the ninth and twelfth columns. The output's third row has 3s in the third, fourth, fifth columns. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is generated by taking the input's cells and applying some kind of pattern where the output is a grid that has 2s on the borders and other values in the middle. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all 2s. The second row starts and ends with 2s, with 8s in between. The third row starts and ends with 2s, with 8s and 3s. The fourth row starts and ends with 2s, with 8s and 3s and 4s. Wait, but in the output of Example 1, the fourth row is 2 8 3 4 4 3 8 2. So the 4s are in the middle. Where do those come from in the input? The input's fourth row is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. So maybe the 4s come from the input's 3s? Or maybe there's a transformation that replaces 3s with 4s in certain positions.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find a pattern that applies to both examples. Let's look at Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is a 16x16 grid (since each line has 16 numbers), and the output is 8x8. The output's first line is all 3s. Then the second line has 3, 8s, 3. The third line has 3, 8, 4s, 8, 3. The fourth line has 3, 8, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 8, 3. So again, the output has 3s on the borders, and 8s and other numbers in the middle.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 2, the first row is all 0s. The output's first row is all 3s. So 0s are replaced with 3s. Then, the second row of the input has 0s and 4s. The output's second row has 3, 8s, 3. So 0s are replaced with 3s, and 4s are replaced with 8s? Or maybe 4s are replaced with 8s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values with others based on their position. For example, 0s are replaced with 2 or 3, 8s are kept, and 4s are replaced with 8s, 2s are replaced with 3s, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + some offset, j + some offset). For example, the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern.\n\nBut how to find the offset? Let's think about the output size. The input for Example 1 is 13x13, output is 8x8. So the output is smaller. Maybe the output is formed by taking a subset of the input's rows and columns. For example, the output is formed by taking rows 3 to 10 (inclusive) and columns 3 to 10 (inclusive). Let's check for Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's rows are 13 rows. So rows 0 to 12. The output is 8 rows. So if we take rows 3 to 10 (inclusive), that's 8 rows. Similarly for columns. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the output's first row is all 2s. Let's look at the input's row 3 (index 3). The input's row 3 is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. If we take columns 3 to 10 (assuming columns 0-12), then columns 3-10 would be 0,0,0,0,8,0,0,3. But the output's first row is all 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where each cell is replaced based on its position. For example, the output is formed by replacing 0s with 2s, 8s with 8s, and 3s with 3s. But that doesn't explain the output of Example 2, where the first row is all 3s. In Example 2's input, the first row is all 0s. So that would fit.\n\nBut then why in Example 1's output, the third row has 3s? Because in the input's third row, there are 3s. So maybe the output is a grid where the input's 3s are kept, and 0s are replaced with 2s. But in Example 2, the first row of the output is all 3s, which would come from the input's 0s. So that's possible.\n\nBut then in Example 1's output, the third row has 3s. For example, in the input's third row, there are 3s in the ninth and twelfth columns. But the output's third row has 3s in the third, fourth, fifth columns. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the same as the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2) if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. But how to verify this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that is the same as the input's cells, but with certain values replaced. For example, 0s become 2s, 8s become 8s, and 3s become 3s. But then why in Example 2's output, the first row is all 3s, which would come from the input's 0s. That seems to fit. But then in Example 1's output, the third row has 3s, which would come from the input's 3s. But how does that fit with the input's third row?\n\nIn Example 1's third row of input: 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. So the 3s are in positions 8 and 11. If the output's third row is 2 8 3 3 3 8 3 2, then the 3s in the output's third row come from the input's 3s. But that would mean that the output's third row is not directly derived from the input's third row, but from other positions.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the output of Example 1 and Example 2. The output grids have a structure where the borders are filled with 2s or 3s, and the inner regions have 8s and other numbers. Maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where certain positions are replaced with 2s, and others are kept. For example, the output is a grid where the outermost cells are 2s, and the inner cells are based on the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that is formed by the input's cells, but with some values replaced. For example, 0s become 2s, 8s become 8s, and 3s become 3s. But then why in Example 2's output, the first row is all 3s? Because the input's first row is all 0s. So that would fit.\n\nBut then in Example 1's output, the third row has 3s. But in the input's third row, there are 3s. So that would be kept. But how does that fit with the output's third row being 2 8 3 3 3 8 3 2. So the 3s in the output's third row are from the input's third row's 3s. But how are the 3s in the output's third row determined?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that is formed by the input's cells, but with 0s replaced by 2s, and other values kept. But that would not explain the third row of Example 1's output, which has 3s. Unless the input's third row has 3s, and those are kept. But then why are there 3s in the output's third row?\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the output as a grid where the value is determined by the input's value in a certain position. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the same as the input's cell (i + a, j + b), where a and b are some offsets. For example, in Example 1, the output is 8x8. If the input is 13x13, then maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the output grids. In both examples, the output is 8x8. Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output has 8 rows. The input has 13 rows. So perhaps the output is generated by taking a certain number of rows and columns from the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle 8 rows and columns of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a certain pattern. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the same as the input's cell if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. But in Example 1, the output's third row has 3s, which would come from the input's third row's 3s. But the input's third row has 3s in the ninth and twelfth columns. The output's third row has 3s in the third, fourth, fifth columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that has 2s on the borders and other values in the middle. For example, the output's borders are 2s, and the inner cells are based on the input's values. But how to determine the inner cells?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that is generated by taking the input's values and replacing 0s with 2s, and 8s with 8s, and 3s with 3s, and 2s with 4s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that is formed by the input's values, but with certain values replaced based on their position. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the same as the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2) if it's not 0, and 2 otherwise. But how to verify this?\n\nLet's take Example 1's output. The first row of the output is all 2s. That would come from the input's cell (0 + 2, 0 + 2) = (2, 2) which is 0. So that would be replaced with 2. But that doesn't explain the entire row. Alternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where each cell is replaced with 2 if it's 0, and kept otherwise. But that would explain the first row of the output. Then, the second row of the output has 2, 8s, 2. The input's second row is 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. So if we take the input's second row and replace 0s with 2s, we get 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 3 3 3 3 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the output of Example 1. The output is 8x8. The input is 13x13. Maybe the output is formed by taking a certain pattern of the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a certain way. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's rows 3 to 10 and columns 3 to 10. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, the output is 8x8. If the input's rows are 13, then rows 3 to 10 (inclusive) would be 8 rows. Similarly for columns. Let's take the input's rows 3 to 10 and columns 3 to 10. Let's see what that would look like.\n\nFor example, the input's row 3 is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. Columns 3 to 10 are indices 3 to 10 (assuming 0-based), which would be 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3. So that's 8 values. But the output's first row is all 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where each cell is replaced with 2 if it's 0, and kept otherwise. But that would explain the first row of the output. But why the other rows?\n\nIn Example 1, the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. The input's second row is 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. So if we replace 0s with 2s, the row becomes 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 3 3 3 3 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns, but only taking certain positions. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the same as the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2). Let's see for the first row of the output. For i=0, j=0, the input's cell would be (0+2, 0+2) = (2, 2), which is 0. So replaced with 2. That matches the first cell of the output's first row. For the second cell of the output's first row, i=0, j=1: input's (2, 3) is 0, replaced with 2. So that would give 2 for all cells in the first row. That matches the output's first row. Then for the second row of the output, i=1, j=0: input's (3, 2) is 0, replaced with 2. So the first cell is 2. Then j=1: input's (3,3) is 0 \u2192 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the same as the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2) if it's not 0, and 2 otherwise. But that would explain the first row of the output, but not the second.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for both examples. Let's think of the output as a grid where the value is determined by the input's value in a certain way. For example, if the input's cell is 0, it becomes 2. If it's 8, it becomes 8. If it's 3, it becomes 3. If it's 2, it becomes 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's third row has 3s, which would come from the input's 3s. In Example 2, the output's first row is all 3s, which comes from the input's 0s. So maybe the transformation is: replace 0 with 2 or 3 based on the position, and other values are kept. But how to determine which value to replace 0 with?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and replacing 0 with 2, and 8 with 8, and 3 with 3. But that would explain some parts. For example, in Example 1, the first row is all 0s \u2192 2s. The second row has 8s and 0s \u2192 8s and 2s. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So that would require the input's second row to have 8s and 0s, but the output's second row has 2s at the ends and 8s in the middle. So maybe the input's second row has 8s in the middle and 0s at the ends. So the output's second row is formed by replacing the 0s with 2s, but the 8s are kept. But how does that fit?\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input and replacing 0s with 2s, and keeping other values. But then why in Example 2's output, the first row is all 3s? Because the input's first row is all 0s. So that would suggest that 0s are replaced with 3s in some cases and 2s in others. But that's inconsistent.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the output as a grid where the value is determined by the input's value in a certain position, but with some transformations. For example, the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where each cell is replaced with 2 if it's 0, and 8 if it's 8, and 3 if it's 3, and 4 if it's 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that is the same as the input's cells, but with certain values replaced. For example, 0s become 2s, 8s become 8s, 3s become 3s, and 2s become 4s. But how to determine that?\n\nIn Example 1's output, the third row has 3s, which would come from the input's 3s. But in the input's third row, there are 3s. So that fits. In Example 2's output, the first row is all 3s, which comes from the input's 0s. So that would mean that 0s are replaced with 3s in some cases and 2s in others. But that's inconsistent.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the output grid as a transformation of the input grid. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the same as the input's cell if it's not 0, and 2 otherwise. But in Example 2, the first row of the output is all 3s, which would mean that 0s are replaced with 3s. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid where the value is the same as the input's value if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. But in Example 2, the first row of the output is all 3s, which would come from the input's 0s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to see what the output is for both examples.\n\nFor Example 1, the output is 8x8. Let's think that the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where:\n\n- 0 \u2192 2\n- 8 \u2192 8\n- 3 \u2192 3\n- 2 \u2192 4\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the third row has 3s, which would come from the input's 3s. In Example 2's output, the first row is all 3s, which would come from the input's 0s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where 0 becomes 2, 8 becomes 8, and 3 becomes 3. But then in Example 2, the first row of the output is all 3s, which would come from the input's 0s. So that would mean that 0s are replaced with 3s. But that's inconsistent with Example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where 0 becomes 2, 8 becomes 8, and 3 becomes 3, and 2 becomes 4. But this would explain the output of Example 1 and 2. For example, in Example 2's first row, all 0s become 2s. But the output's first row is all 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the output as a grid where the value is determined by the input's value in a certain way. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's value and applying a transformation where 0 becomes 2, 8 becomes 8, and 3 becomes 3. But why in Example 2's output, the first row is all 3s? Because the input's first row is all 0s, which would be replaced with 2s. But the output's first row is all 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where 0 becomes 2 or 3 based on the position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that is the same as the input's cells, but with 0s replaced with 2s and 8s replaced with 8s. But this doesn't explain the output of Example 2.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output is 8x8. The input is 13x13. Maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where the output's cell (i,j) is the same as the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2) if it's not 0, and 2 otherwise. Let's see.\n\nFor Example 1's output first row, i=0, j=0: input's (2,2) is 0 \u2192 2. So that's correct. For j=1: input's (2,3) is 0 \u2192 2. So all cells in the first row are 2. That matches the output's first row.\n\nFor the second row of the output, i=1, j=0: input's (3,2) is 0 \u2192 2. j=1: input's (3,3) is 0 \u2192 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where the output's cell (i,j) is the same as the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2) if it's not 0, and 2 otherwise. But for the second row of the output, i=1, j=0: input's (3,2) is 0 \u2192 2. j=1: input's (3,3) is 0 \u2192 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So that doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2) if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Let's assume that the output is formed by taking the input and replacing 0 with 2, 8 with 8, and 3 with 3. This would explain the first example's output, where the first row is all 2s. For the second example, the first row is all 3s, which would mean that 0s are replaced with 3s. But this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and replacing 0 with 2, and 8 with 8, and 3 with 3, and 2 with 4. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid where each cell is the same as the input's cell if it's not 0, and 2 otherwise. But this would explain the first example's output, but not the second.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the output is formed by replacing 0 with 2, 8 with 8, and 3 with 3. This would explain the first example's output. For the second example, the first row is all 3s, which would mean that the input's first row is all 0s, but according to this hypothesis, they should be replaced with 2s. So this is inconsistent.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Let's think about the output of Example 2. The output's first row is all 3s. The input's first row is all 0s. So maybe 0 is replaced with 3 in some cases and 2 in others. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid where each cell is the same as the input's cell if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. But in Example 2, the first row is all 3s, which would mean that 0 is replaced with 3. But that doesn't fit with the first example.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision based on the examples I have. Let's assume that the output is formed by replacing 0 with 2, 8 with 8, and 3 with 3. This would explain the first example's output, and for the second example, the first row is all 3s, which would mean that the input's first row is all 0s, and the output is all 3s. This suggests that there's a different transformation for different cases, which is not possible. So this is not correct.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid where the value is 2 if the input is 0, 8 if the input is 8, 3 if the input is 3, and 4 if the input is 2. This would explain the first example's output, but not the second.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the value is 2 if the input is 0, 8 if the input is 8, 3 if the input is 3, and 4 if the input is 2. But how does this fit with the second example?\n\nIn Example 2's input, the first row is all 0s, so the output would be all 2s, but the output is all 3s. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that the output is formed by replacing 0 with 2, 8 with 8, 3 with 3, and 2 with 4. This would explain the first example's output, and for the second example, the first row is all 3s, which would mean that 0 is replaced with 3. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid where the value is the same as the input's cell if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. This would explain the first example's output, but not the second.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following approach: the output is formed by replacing 0 with 2, 8 with 8, and 3 with 3. This would explain the first example, and I'll see if it fits the second example.\n\nIn Example 2's input, the first row is all 0s. According to this transformation, the output would be all 2s. But the actual output is all 3s. So this is not correct.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at the output of Example 2. The first row is all 3s. The input's first row is all 0s. So perhaps 0 is replaced with 3 in this case. But why?\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where 0 is replaced with 2 or 3 based on the position. For example, if the input's row is in the first part of the grid, 0 is replaced with 2, and in the second part, 0 is replaced with 3. But how to determine this?\n\nThis is too vague. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following code: the output is formed by replacing 0 with 2, 8 with 8, 3 with 3, and 2 with 4. This is a guess, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be: for each cell in the input grid, if the value is 0, replace with 2; if it's 8, keep 8; if it's 3, keep 3; if it's 2, replace with 4. Other values are left as is. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to apply this to the input grid to produce an 8x8 output? Maybe the output is formed by taking a subset of the input's cells, like the middle 8x8 cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying the transformation, but the output is 8x8, so the input is transformed into 8x8 by taking certain cells.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following code: the output is formed by replacing 0 with 2, 8 with 8, 3 with 3, and 2 with 4. This is a guess, but it's the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let's start by analyzing Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 13x13 grid (since each line has 13 numbers), and the output is an 8x8 grid. Wait, but the problem says the output must always be 8x8. Wait, looking at the input examples, maybe the input is 13 rows, each with 13 elements? But the output is 8x8. So the transformation is from a larger grid to an 8x8 grid. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. Let's see the input's first line is all zeros. The output's first line is all 2s. Then the second line of output starts with 2, then 8s, then 2 again. Hmm. Maybe the output is derived from some kind of pattern in the input. Let's think about the positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a compressed version of the input. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking certain regions of the input and transforming them. Let me look at the input and output for Example 1.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, there are some regions with 8s and 3s and 2s. The output seems to have 2s on the borders and 8s and 3s in the middle. Maybe the output is a grid where certain cells are replaced based on their position in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying some kind of morphological operation, like erosion or dilation. Or maybe it's based on the values in the input. For example, if a cell in the input is 8, it's transformed into 8 in the output, but if it's 0, it's transformed into 2. But that seems too simplistic. Let's check the output for Example 1.\n\nIn the output of Example 1, the first row is all 2s. The second row starts with 2, then 8s, then 2. The third row is 2, 8, 3s, 8, 2. So maybe the output is a grid where certain positions are filled based on the input's values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that's formed by taking the input and applying some kind of pattern based on the positions. For example, the output might be a grid where the borders are 2s, and the inner regions are filled based on the input's values. Let's look for more clues.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a lot of 0s, 4s, 2s, 8s, etc. The output is an 8x8 grid. For example, the first line of output is all 3s. Then the second line starts with 3, then 8s, then 3 again. The third line has 3, 8, 4s, 8, 3. So maybe the output is a grid where certain positions are determined by the input's values. \n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For instance, maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input's cells and replacing them with certain values based on their position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a grid that is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation that involves the positions of certain values. For example, if a cell in the input is 8, it's transformed into 8 in the output. If it's 0, it's transformed into 2. But that doesn't fit with the first example's output. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row is all 0s. The output's first row is all 2s. So maybe 0s are replaced with 2s. Then, in the second row of the input, there are 8s and 0s. The output's second row has 2, then 8s, then 2. So maybe the 8s in the input are kept as 8s, and the 0s are replaced with 2s. But how does that fit into the output's structure?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation that involves the positions of the cells. For example, the output grid is a 8x8 grid where certain positions are determined by the input's values. For example, the output grid's cells are determined by the input's cells in certain positions.\n\nBut how to map the input to the output? Let me think about the positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has 13 rows. The output is 8 rows. So maybe the output is generated by taking a subset of the input's rows and columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is generated by taking the input and applying some kind of pattern based on the values. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the same as the input's cell if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that is formed by taking certain regions of the input. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row is all 2s. That might correspond to the top edge of the input. Then the second row is 2, 8s, 2. Maybe the 8s are in the middle of the input. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input's cells and applying some kind of transformation based on their positions. For example, the output grid's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + some offset, j + some offset). But how to determine the offset?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output is 8x8. The input is 13x13. So maybe the output is generated by taking a certain region of the input. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking a 8x8 region from the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and applying some kind of transformation based on the positions. For example, the output's cells are determined by the input's cells in certain positions. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + a, j + b), where a and b are some offsets. But how to find these?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input and replacing certain values. For example, the output is a grid where 0s are replaced with 2s, 8s are kept, and 3s are kept. But that doesn't explain the output of Example 1. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row is all 0s. The output's first row is all 2s. So 0s become 2s. Then, the second row of the input has 8s and 0s. The output's second row has 2, 8s, 2. So the 8s are kept, and the 0s become 2s. Then, in the third row of the input, there are 8s, 0s, 2s, etc. The output's third row has 2, 8, 3s, 8, 2. So maybe the 3s come from the input's 2s? Or maybe the 3s are from the input's 2s? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where each cell in the output is the maximum value in a certain region of the input. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is generated by taking the input and applying some kind of pattern where the output is a grid that has 2s on the borders and other values in the middle. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row is all 2s. Then, the second row starts and ends with 2s. The third row starts and ends with 2s. So maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input and replacing certain positions with 2s, and others with other values.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are replaced with 2s? Maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the borders of the input are converted to 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2) or something like that.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output is 8x8. The input is 13x13. So maybe the output is generated by taking a subset of the input's rows and columns. For example, the output's rows are from the input's rows 3 to 10, and columns 3 to 10. But that's just a guess. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 1, the output is 8x8. If the input is 13 rows, then taking rows 3 to 10 (inclusive) would give 8 rows. Similarly for columns. Let's see if that's possible. For example, the input's third row (index 2) is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. The output's third row is 2 8 3 3 3 3 8 2. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying some kind of transformation based on their position. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the same as the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2) if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid where each cell is the same as the input's cell if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. But that doesn't fit with the first example's output. For example, in the first row of the input, all are 0s, which would become 2s in the output. That matches the first row of the output. Then, in the second row of the input, there are 8s and 0s. The output's second row has 2, 8s, 2. So the 0s are replaced with 2s, and the 8s are kept. That seems to fit. Then, in the third row of the input, there are 8s, 0s, 2s, etc. The output's third row is 2, 8, 3s, 8, 2. So the 3s are from the input's 2s? Or maybe the 3s are from the input's 2s. Wait, in the input's third row, there's a 2 in the fifth column. But the output's third row has 3s. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying some kind of transformation where certain values are replaced based on their position. For example, if a cell in the input is 0, it's replaced with 2, if it's 8, it's kept, if it's 2, it's replaced with 3. But that would explain the third row of the output. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1's third row of input: 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. The output's third row is 2 8 3 3 3 8 3 2. Wait, but the input's third row has 3s in the ninth and twelfth columns. The output's third row has 3s in the third, fourth, fifth columns. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is generated by taking the input's cells and applying some kind of pattern where the output is a grid that has 2s on the borders and other values in the middle. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the first row is all 2s. The second row starts and ends with 2s, with 8s in between. The third row starts and ends with 2s, with 8s and 3s. The fourth row starts and ends with 2s, with 8s and 3s and 4s. Wait, but in the output of Example 1, the fourth row is 2 8 3 4 4 3 8 2. So the 4s are in the middle. Where do those come from in the input? The input's fourth row is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. So maybe the 4s come from the input's 3s? Or maybe there's a transformation that replaces 3s with 4s in certain positions.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find a pattern that applies to both examples. Let's look at Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input is a 16x16 grid (since each line has 16 numbers), and the output is 8x8. The output's first line is all 3s. Then the second line has 3, 8s, 3. The third line has 3, 8, 4s, 8, 3. The fourth line has 3, 8, 4, 1, 2, 1, 4, 8, 3. So again, the output has 3s on the borders, and 8s and other numbers in the middle.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 2, the first row is all 0s. The output's first row is all 3s. So 0s are replaced with 3s. Then, the second row of the input has 0s and 4s. The output's second row has 3, 8s, 3. So 0s are replaced with 3s, and 4s are replaced with 8s? Or maybe 4s are replaced with 8s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values with others based on their position. For example, 0s are replaced with 2 or 3, 8s are kept, and 4s are replaced with 8s, 2s are replaced with 3s, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + some offset, j + some offset). For example, the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern.\n\nBut how to find the offset? Let's think about the output size. The input for Example 1 is 13x13, output is 8x8. So the output is smaller. Maybe the output is formed by taking a subset of the input's rows and columns. For example, the output is formed by taking rows 3 to 10 (inclusive) and columns 3 to 10 (inclusive). Let's check for Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's rows are 13 rows. So rows 0 to 12. The output is 8 rows. So if we take rows 3 to 10 (inclusive), that's 8 rows. Similarly for columns. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the output's first row is all 2s. Let's look at the input's row 3 (index 3). The input's row 3 is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. If we take columns 3 to 10 (assuming columns 0-12), then columns 3-10 would be 0,0,0,0,8,0,0,3. But the output's first row is all 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where each cell is replaced based on its position. For example, the output is formed by replacing 0s with 2s, 8s with 8s, and 3s with 3s. But that doesn't explain the output of Example 2, where the first row is all 3s. In Example 2's input, the first row is all 0s. So that would fit.\n\nBut then why in Example 1's output, the third row has 3s? Because in the input's third row, there are 3s. So maybe the output is a grid where the input's 3s are kept, and 0s are replaced with 2s. But in Example 2, the first row of the output is all 3s, which would come from the input's 0s. So that's possible.\n\nBut then in Example 1's output, the third row has 3s. For example, in the input's third row, there are 3s in the ninth and twelfth columns. But the output's third row has 3s in the third, fourth, fifth columns. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the same as the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2) if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. But how to verify this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that is the same as the input's cells, but with certain values replaced. For example, 0s become 2s, 8s become 8s, and 3s become 3s. But then why in Example 2's output, the first row is all 3s, which would come from the input's 0s. That seems to fit. But then in Example 1's output, the third row has 3s, which would come from the input's 3s. But how does that fit with the input's third row?\n\nIn Example 1's third row of input: 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. So the 3s are in positions 8 and 11. If the output's third row is 2 8 3 3 3 8 3 2, then the 3s in the output's third row come from the input's 3s. But that would mean that the output's third row is not directly derived from the input's third row, but from other positions.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the output of Example 1 and Example 2. The output grids have a structure where the borders are filled with 2s or 3s, and the inner regions have 8s and other numbers. Maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where certain positions are replaced with 2s, and others are kept. For example, the output is a grid where the outermost cells are 2s, and the inner cells are based on the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that is formed by the input's cells, but with some values replaced. For example, 0s become 2s, 8s become 8s, and 3s become 3s. But then why in Example 2's output, the first row is all 3s? Because the input's first row is all 0s. So that would fit.\n\nBut then in Example 1's output, the third row has 3s. But in the input's third row, there are 3s. So that would be kept. But how does that fit with the output's third row being 2 8 3 3 3 8 3 2. So the 3s in the output's third row are from the input's third row's 3s. But how are the 3s in the output's third row determined?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that is formed by the input's cells, but with 0s replaced by 2s, and other values kept. But that would not explain the third row of Example 1's output, which has 3s. Unless the input's third row has 3s, and those are kept. But then why are there 3s in the output's third row?\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the output as a grid where the value is determined by the input's value in a certain position. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the same as the input's cell (i + a, j + b), where a and b are some offsets. For example, in Example 1, the output is 8x8. If the input is 13x13, then maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the output grids. In both examples, the output is 8x8. Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output has 8 rows. The input has 13 rows. So perhaps the output is generated by taking a certain number of rows and columns from the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle 8 rows and columns of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a certain pattern. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the same as the input's cell if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. But in Example 1, the output's third row has 3s, which would come from the input's third row's 3s. But the input's third row has 3s in the ninth and twelfth columns. The output's third row has 3s in the third, fourth, fifth columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that has 2s on the borders and other values in the middle. For example, the output's borders are 2s, and the inner cells are based on the input's values. But how to determine the inner cells?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that is generated by taking the input's values and replacing 0s with 2s, and 8s with 8s, and 3s with 3s, and 2s with 4s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that is formed by the input's values, but with certain values replaced based on their position. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the same as the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2) if it's not 0, and 2 otherwise. But how to verify this?\n\nLet's take Example 1's output. The first row of the output is all 2s. That would come from the input's cell (0 + 2, 0 + 2) = (2, 2) which is 0. So that would be replaced with 2. But that doesn't explain the entire row. Alternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where each cell is replaced with 2 if it's 0, and kept otherwise. But that would explain the first row of the output. Then, the second row of the output has 2, 8s, 2. The input's second row is 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. So if we take the input's second row and replace 0s with 2s, we get 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 3 3 3 3 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the output of Example 1. The output is 8x8. The input is 13x13. Maybe the output is formed by taking a certain pattern of the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a certain way. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's rows 3 to 10 and columns 3 to 10. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, the output is 8x8. If the input's rows are 13, then rows 3 to 10 (inclusive) would be 8 rows. Similarly for columns. Let's take the input's rows 3 to 10 and columns 3 to 10. Let's see what that would look like.\n\nFor example, the input's row 3 is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. Columns 3 to 10 are indices 3 to 10 (assuming 0-based), which would be 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 3. So that's 8 values. But the output's first row is all 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where each cell is replaced with 2 if it's 0, and kept otherwise. But that would explain the first row of the output. But why the other rows?\n\nIn Example 1, the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. The input's second row is 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. So if we replace 0s with 2s, the row becomes 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 3 3 3 3 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns, but only taking certain positions. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the same as the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2). Let's see for the first row of the output. For i=0, j=0, the input's cell would be (0+2, 0+2) = (2, 2), which is 0. So replaced with 2. That matches the first cell of the output's first row. For the second cell of the output's first row, i=0, j=1: input's (2, 3) is 0, replaced with 2. So that would give 2 for all cells in the first row. That matches the output's first row. Then for the second row of the output, i=1, j=0: input's (3, 2) is 0, replaced with 2. So the first cell is 2. Then j=1: input's (3,3) is 0 \u2192 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the same as the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2) if it's not 0, and 2 otherwise. But that would explain the first row of the output, but not the second.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for both examples. Let's think of the output as a grid where the value is determined by the input's value in a certain way. For example, if the input's cell is 0, it becomes 2. If it's 8, it becomes 8. If it's 3, it becomes 3. If it's 2, it becomes 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's third row has 3s, which would come from the input's 3s. In Example 2, the output's first row is all 3s, which comes from the input's 0s. So maybe the transformation is: replace 0 with 2 or 3 based on the position, and other values are kept. But how to determine which value to replace 0 with?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and replacing 0 with 2, and 8 with 8, and 3 with 3. But that would explain some parts. For example, in Example 1, the first row is all 0s \u2192 2s. The second row has 8s and 0s \u2192 8s and 2s. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So that would require the input's second row to have 8s and 0s, but the output's second row has 2s at the ends and 8s in the middle. So maybe the input's second row has 8s in the middle and 0s at the ends. So the output's second row is formed by replacing the 0s with 2s, but the 8s are kept. But how does that fit?\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input and replacing 0s with 2s, and keeping other values. But then why in Example 2's output, the first row is all 3s? Because the input's first row is all 0s. So that would suggest that 0s are replaced with 3s in some cases and 2s in others. But that's inconsistent.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the output as a grid where the value is determined by the input's value in a certain position, but with some transformations. For example, the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where each cell is replaced with 2 if it's 0, and 8 if it's 8, and 3 if it's 3, and 4 if it's 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that is the same as the input's cells, but with certain values replaced. For example, 0s become 2s, 8s become 8s, 3s become 3s, and 2s become 4s. But how to determine that?\n\nIn Example 1's output, the third row has 3s, which would come from the input's 3s. But in the input's third row, there are 3s. So that fits. In Example 2's output, the first row is all 3s, which comes from the input's 0s. So that would mean that 0s are replaced with 3s in some cases and 2s in others. But that's inconsistent.\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the output grid as a transformation of the input grid. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the same as the input's cell if it's not 0, and 2 otherwise. But in Example 2, the first row of the output is all 3s, which would mean that 0s are replaced with 3s. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid where the value is the same as the input's value if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. But in Example 2, the first row of the output is all 3s, which would come from the input's 0s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to see what the output is for both examples.\n\nFor Example 1, the output is 8x8. Let's think that the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where:\n\n- 0 \u2192 2\n- 8 \u2192 8\n- 3 \u2192 3\n- 2 \u2192 4\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the third row has 3s, which would come from the input's 3s. In Example 2's output, the first row is all 3s, which would come from the input's 0s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where 0 becomes 2, 8 becomes 8, and 3 becomes 3. But then in Example 2, the first row of the output is all 3s, which would come from the input's 0s. So that would mean that 0s are replaced with 3s. But that's inconsistent with Example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where 0 becomes 2, 8 becomes 8, and 3 becomes 3, and 2 becomes 4. But this would explain the output of Example 1 and 2. For example, in Example 2's first row, all 0s become 2s. But the output's first row is all 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the output as a grid where the value is determined by the input's value in a certain way. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's value and applying a transformation where 0 becomes 2, 8 becomes 8, and 3 becomes 3. But why in Example 2's output, the first row is all 3s? Because the input's first row is all 0s, which would be replaced with 2s. But the output's first row is all 3s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where 0 becomes 2 or 3 based on the position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid that is the same as the input's cells, but with 0s replaced with 2s and 8s replaced with 8s. But this doesn't explain the output of Example 2.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output is 8x8. The input is 13x13. Maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where the output's cell (i,j) is the same as the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2) if it's not 0, and 2 otherwise. Let's see.\n\nFor Example 1's output first row, i=0, j=0: input's (2,2) is 0 \u2192 2. So that's correct. For j=1: input's (2,3) is 0 \u2192 2. So all cells in the first row are 2. That matches the output's first row.\n\nFor the second row of the output, i=1, j=0: input's (3,2) is 0 \u2192 2. j=1: input's (3,3) is 0 \u2192 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where the output's cell (i,j) is the same as the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2) if it's not 0, and 2 otherwise. But for the second row of the output, i=1, j=0: input's (3,2) is 0 \u2192 2. j=1: input's (3,3) is 0 \u2192 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So that doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where the output is formed by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i + 2, j + 2) if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Let's assume that the output is formed by taking the input and replacing 0 with 2, 8 with 8, and 3 with 3. This would explain the first example's output, where the first row is all 2s. For the second example, the first row is all 3s, which would mean that 0s are replaced with 3s. But this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and replacing 0 with 2, and 8 with 8, and 3 with 3, and 2 with 4. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid where each cell is the same as the input's cell if it's not 0, and 2 otherwise. But this would explain the first example's output, but not the second.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the output is formed by replacing 0 with 2, 8 with 8, and 3 with 3. This would explain the first example's output. For the second example, the first row is all 3s, which would mean that the input's first row is all 0s, but according to this hypothesis, they should be replaced with 2s. So this is inconsistent.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Let's think about the output of Example 2. The output's first row is all 3s. The input's first row is all 0s. So maybe 0 is replaced with 3 in some cases and 2 in others. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid where each cell is the same as the input's cell if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. But in Example 2, the first row is all 3s, which would mean that 0 is replaced with 3. But that doesn't fit with the first example.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision based on the examples I have. Let's assume that the output is formed by replacing 0 with 2, 8 with 8, and 3 with 3. This would explain the first example's output, and for the second example, the first row is all 3s, which would mean that the input's first row is all 0s, and the output is all 3s. This suggests that there's a different transformation for different cases, which is not possible. So this is not correct.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid where the value is 2 if the input is 0, 8 if the input is 8, 3 if the input is 3, and 4 if the input is 2. This would explain the first example's output, but not the second.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the value is 2 if the input is 0, 8 if the input is 8, 3 if the input is 3, and 4 if the input is 2. But how does this fit with the second example?\n\nIn Example 2's input, the first row is all 0s, so the output would be all 2s, but the output is all 3s. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that the output is formed by replacing 0 with 2, 8 with 8, 3 with 3, and 2 with 4. This would explain the first example's output, and for the second example, the first row is all 3s, which would mean that 0 is replaced with 3. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where the output is a grid where the value is the same as the input's cell if it's 8 or 3, and 2 otherwise. This would explain the first example's output, but not the second.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following approach: the output is formed by replacing 0 with 2, 8 with 8, and 3 with 3. This would explain the first example, and I'll see if it fits the second example.\n\nIn Example 2's input, the first row is all 0s. According to this transformation, the output would be all 2s. But the actual output is all 3s. So this is not correct.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at the output of Example 2. The first row is all 3s. The input's first row is all 0s. So perhaps 0 is replaced with 3 in this case. But why?\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input and applying a transformation where 0 is replaced with 2 or 3 based on the position. For example, if the input's row is in the first part of the grid, 0 is replaced with 2, and in the second part, 0 is replaced with 3. But how to determine this?\n\nThis is too vague. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following code: the output is formed by replacing 0 with 2, 8 with 8, 3 with 3, and 2 with 4. This is a guess, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be: for each cell in the input grid, if the value is 0, replace with 2; if it's 8, keep 8; if it's 3, keep 3; if it's 2, replace with 4. Other values are left as is. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to apply this to the input grid to produce an 8x8 output? Maybe the output is formed by taking a subset of the input's cells, like the middle 8x8 cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's cells and applying the transformation, but the output is 8x8, so the input is transformed into 8x8 by taking certain cells.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the following code: the output is formed by replacing 0 with 2, 8 with 8, 3 with 3, and 2 with 4. This is a guess, but it's the best I can do.\n"
