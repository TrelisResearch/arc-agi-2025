The nonzero values are 'mirrored' or 'reflected' or 'padded'.\n- Output always has zeros in columns 0 and 5. \n- For rows with contiguous nonzero values, the middle cells (output columns 2-3) are filled.\n- For non-contiguous nonzero values, output positions are determined by their input positions, possibly mirroring or wrapping.\n\nLet's generalize with code:\n\n1. For each row in the input:\n    - If the row has two adjacent nonzero values: in the output row, place them centered (columns 2 and 3), and duplicate to columns 1 and 4, with zeros at 0 and 5.\n    - If the row has a single nonzero value: place at output column(s) depending on position.\n\nAlternatively, based on the examples, it looks like for every 7 in input grid at position (r, c), it is mapped to position(s) in the output row as follows:\n- Column 0 of input \u2192 Output columns 0 and 5 may correspond (mirrored ends)\n- Column 1 of input \u2192 Output columns 1 and 4 (second and second last column)\n- Column 2 of input \u2192 Output columns 2 and 3 (center columns)\nBut not always a direct copy; possibly the output is \"mirrored horizontally\" and repeated into 6 columns.\n\n**So for each input row:**\n- Set output row = [input[row][0], input[row][1], input[row][2], input[row][2], input[row][1], input[row][0]]\n\nThis matches the \"mirrored\" structure seen in training examples!\n\nLet's run this hypothesis on one example:\n\nExample 1, row 1:\nInput row: [0, 7, 0]\nOutput:     [0, 7, 0, 0, 7, 0]\n\nExample 1, row 2:\nInput row: [0, 0, 7]\nOutput:     [0, 0, 7, 7, 0, 0]\n\nExample 1, row 3:\nInput row: [0, 7, 7]\nOutput:     [0, 7, 7, 7, 7, 0]\n\nIt matches perfectly!\n\nAll other examples also fit with this mirrored logic.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Mirror each row of the 3x3 input into a 3x6 output\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # [row[0], row[1], row[2], row[2], row[1], row[0]]\n        transformed_row = [row[0], row[1], row[2], row[2], row[1], row[0]]\n        transformed_grid.append(transformed_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
