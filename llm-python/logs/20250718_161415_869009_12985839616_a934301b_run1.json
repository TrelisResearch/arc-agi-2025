From the examples, I observe that:\n\n1. Values of 1 and 8 seem to be \"activated\" or \"highlighted\" in the output grid\n2. The output grid often has more 0s than the input grid\n3. The output grid seems to have a \"mask\" or \"filter\" that transforms certain patterns in the input\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Leaves 0s unchanged\n- Converts 1s to 0s\n- Converts 8s to 0s\n- Leaves other values unchanged\n\nThis is a simple transformation that seems to match the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 0:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            elif val == 1:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            elif val == 8:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the output grids often have certain values (like 1, 8) that are transformed in specific ways. From the examples, I observe that:\n\n1. Values of 1 and 8 seem to be \"activated\" or \"highlighted\" in the output grid\n2. The output grid often has more 0s than the input grid\n3. The output grid seems to have a \"mask\" or \"filter\" that transforms certain patterns in the input\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Leaves 0s unchanged\n- Converts 1s to 0s\n- Converts 8s to 0s\n- Leaves other values unchanged\n\nThis is a simple transformation that seems to match the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 0:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            elif val == 1:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            elif val == 8:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed_grid.append(new_row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
