The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with others based on their position and value.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain numbers (like 3, 2, 6, 8, 5, 4, etc.) are being replaced with other numbers in a structured way.\n3. The transformation seems to involve some form of propagation or spread of values from certain positions to their neighbors.\n4. There are also patterns where values are being replaced based on their position in the grid, especially in certain rows or columns.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with others in a structured way, based on the patterns observed in the training examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 30x30 grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(30)] for _ in range(30)]\n    \n    # Copy the input grid values to the transformed grid\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Apply transformation based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified version that captures some of the observed patterns\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace 3 with 2 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Replace 6 with 8 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8 with 6 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with 3 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 5 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                # Replace 7 with 8 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                # Replace 9 with 6 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

There appears to be a pattern where certain numbers (like 3, 2, 6, 8, 5, 4, etc.) are being replaced with other numbers in a structured way.\n3. The transformation seems to involve some form of propagation or spread of values from certain positions to their neighbors.\n4. There are also patterns where values are being replaced based on their position in the grid, especially in certain rows or columns.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with others in a structured way, based on the patterns observed in the training examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 30x30 grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(30)] for _ in range(30)]\n    \n    # Copy the input grid values to the transformed grid\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Apply transformation based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified version that captures some of the observed patterns\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace 3 with 2 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Replace 6 with 8 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8 with 6 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with 3 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 5 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                # Replace 7 with 8 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 9:\n                # Replace 9 with 6 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
