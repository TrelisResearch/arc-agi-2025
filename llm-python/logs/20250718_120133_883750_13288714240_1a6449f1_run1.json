          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that maps the input grids to the output grids in the training examples. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 15x7 grid (since each line has 15 numbers, but the output is 6x7). Wait, the output is 6x7. So the input is 15 rows, each with 7 elements? Wait, no. Wait, the input for example 1 is given as lines with 13 numbers each? Wait, looking at the input for example 1:\n\nThe input lines are 15 rows, each with 13 numbers. For example, the first line is \"5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" which is 13 numbers. The output is 6 rows, each with 7 numbers. So the input is 15 rows, each with 7 columns? Wait, no. Wait, maybe the input is 15 rows, each with 7 elements? But the example shows lines with 13 numbers. Wait, maybe the input is 15 rows, each with 13 elements, and the output is 6 rows with 7 elements each. So the transformation is from a 15x13 grid to a 6x7 grid. But the problem says that the output must be 6x7. So the input for each example is a grid of some size, and the output is always 6x7.\n\nBut how to find the transformation? Let's look at the first example's input and output. The input is 15 rows, each with 13 numbers. The output is 6 rows, each with 7 numbers.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the first output line is \"4 0 0 0 0 0 0\" which is 7 elements. The second line is \"0 0 6 0 0 7 5\", etc.\n\nBut how to find the pattern. Let me think about possible transformations. Maybe the output is derived by taking certain rows or columns from the input, or some combination of them. Alternatively, maybe it's a pattern based on the positions of certain numbers, like 8s or 4s.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output. Let's take the first output line: 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Where does this come from? The input's first row is 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output first line is 4, then zeros. Maybe the 4 comes from the input's row 10 (since the output is 6 rows, maybe the first output row is from the 4th input row? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in the first example's output, the first row is 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Looking at the input's row 10 (assuming rows are 0-based or 1-based?), perhaps the 4 is in the input's row 10, column 0. Let me check the input for example 1:\n\nThe input rows are as follows:\n\nRow 0: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 4\nRow 2: 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 9 0\nRow 3: 7 8 0 0 6 0 0 7 5 8 4 8 3\nRow 4: 2 8 4 2 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 8 9 1 9 6 0 0 0 8 0 0 7\nRow 6: 1 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 8 0 0 0 0 4 0 4 8 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 6 0 0 0 3\nRow 10: 5 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 9 4 0 0 6 0 7 7 7 7 7\nRow 12: 0 0 2 2 4 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\nRow 13: 8 8 0 3 0 0 0 1 7 0 8 4 7\nRow 14: 7 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 7 0 6 8 7\nRow 15: 0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\nRow 16: 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\nRow 17: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 9 1\nRow 18: 0 0 0 8 0 8 6 0 0 0 0 0 1\n\nWait, but the input for example 1 is 15 rows. Wait, the first example's input has 15 rows? Let me count. The input lines for example 1 start with 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (row 0), then 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 4 (row 1), and so on. The input has 15 rows. Then the output is 6 rows. So the output is 6x7.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the first output row is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Where is that 4 coming from? Looking at the input rows, maybe row 1 has a 4 in the last column. Let's check row 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 4. The last element is 4. So maybe the first output row is taking that 4 and putting it in the first position of the output row, then zeros. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the output has 7 columns. Let's see: the first output row is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The input's row 1 has 4 in the last column. But how does that translate to the output's first row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking specific positions from the input. For example, in the first example, the output rows might be derived from certain rows in the input. Let me check the output of example 1:\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 6 0 0 7 5\nRow 2: 4 2 0 0 0 8 0\nRow 3: 9 1 9 6 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 4 0 4\n\nLooking at the first output row: 4, then zeros. Maybe this 4 comes from the input's row 1, column 12 (the last element of row 1 is 4). Then the output row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. Let's think about the output's columns. The output has 7 columns. For example, in the first output row, the first element is 4, which is from the input's row 1, column 12. Then the rest are zeros. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output's first row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which could be the first column of the input's row 1, but that's 0. Wait, no. The first element of row 1 is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the output rows might be derived from specific rows in the input. Let's look at the output rows and see if they correspond to certain rows in the input.\n\nLooking at the first output row: 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The 4 is in the first position. Maybe that's from the input's row 1, column 12 (the last element). Then the rest are zeros. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions. For example, the first output row could be the first column of the input's row 1, but that's 0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values. For example, in example 1's input, row 1 has a 4 in the last column. The output's first row starts with 4. Maybe that's the only non-zero element in the first output row.\n\nBut how does that translate to the other rows? Let's look at the second output row: 0 0 6 0 0 7 5. Where does this come from? Looking at the input, maybe the 6 is from row 2, column 2 (row 2 is 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 9 0). The third element is 4, but that's not 6. Wait, maybe row 9 (input row 9) is 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 6 0 0 0 3. The 8th element is 6. So maybe that's where the 6 comes from. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking specific rows from the input. For example, the first output row is from row 1, the second from row 2, etc. But that would be 6 rows, but the input has 15 rows. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows. For example, the first output row is from row 1, the second from row 2, but that doesn't fit the output's second row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns. For example, the output's first row has 4, which is from the last column of row 1. The second output row has 6, which could be from the 9th column of row 9. But this seems too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain patterns. For example, the output rows might be derived by taking the positions where the input has 8s or other numbers. For example, in example 1's input, the first output row has a 4, which is in the input's row 1, column 12. The second output row has 6, which is in the input's row 9, column 8 (assuming 0-based). But how to find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values. For example, the output is a 6x7 grid, and each cell in the output is derived from the input's cell in a specific position. For example, the output's row i, column j is derived from the input's row (i + some offset), column (j + some offset).\n\nBut this is too vague. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input is 15 rows, each with 24 elements. The output is 6 rows, each with 7 elements. So again, the output is 6x7.\n\nLooking at example 2's output, the first output row is 6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0. Wait, no, the output is 6x7. Wait, example 2's output is:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, that can't be. Wait the output for example 2 is given as:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, the output for example 2 is:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, looking back, the output for example 2 is:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, the actual output is:\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, the output is given as:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, looking at the example 2's output:\n\nThe output is:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, the actual output is:\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, the actual output is:\n\nLooking back, example 2's output is:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0\n0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 7 0 5\n4 0 3 4 0 3 0 0 8 0\n0 0 3 7 7 5 0 0 1 0\n3 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n\nWait, but that's 8 rows, but the output is supposed to be 6x7. Oh, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the example 2's output again. The output for example 2 is:\n\nThe output lines are:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, that's 10 elements. Wait, the output is supposed to be 6x7. So each output row has 7 elements. But the example 2's output is written as:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0\n0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 7 0 5\n4 0 3 4 0 3 0 0 8 0\n0 0 3 7 7 5 0 0 1 0\n3 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n\nWait, this can't be right. Because each output row should have 7 elements. But looking at the first line, there are 10 elements. That must be a mistake. Maybe the actual output is different. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the example 2's output is written as:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0\n0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 7 0 5\n4 0 3 4 0 3 0 0 8 0\n0 0 3 7 7 5 0 0 1 0\n3 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n\nBut this is 8 rows, each with 10 elements, which doesn't make sense. Oh, maybe the actual output is 6x7, so each line is 7 elements. So maybe the example is written with line breaks that are not correct. Perhaps the actual output is:\n\nFor example 2, the output is 6 rows, each with 7 elements. So the first line is \"6 0 0 0 1 1 0\" (7 elements), but the example shows more. This suggests that perhaps there's a formatting error in the problem statement. But given that the problem says that the output must be 6x7, I need to focus on that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for example 2 is:\n\nThe first line is \"6 0 0 0 1 1 0\" (7 elements), the second line is \"0 0 6 0 6 0 4\", etc. But the example's output is written with more elements. This is confusing. But perhaps I should focus on the third example, which has a more clear output.\n\nLooking at example 3's output:\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 4 0\n0 0 0 5 6\n0 9 0 0 0\n\nWhich is 4 rows, each with 5 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 6x7. So this suggests that the examples might have different output sizes, but the problem says that the test input must be transformed into a 6x7 grid. So maybe the examples have different input sizes, but the output is always 6x7.\n\nBut this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for patterns in the output of the examples.\n\nAnother approach: looking for possible transformations that could map the input to the output. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the first few columns of the input, or certain rows. Or perhaps the output is derived by some pattern based on the positions of certain numbers.\n\nLooking at example 1's output. The first output row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The 4 is in the first position. Looking at the input's row 1 (the second line of input), which is 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 4. The last element is 4. So maybe the output's first row is taking that 4 and putting it in the first position, then zeros. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input. For example, the output's first row is from row 1 of the input, but only the last element is taken. But that would be 4, then zeros. But that's just one element.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output row is from the last column of the input's row 1, and the rest are zeros. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, like 8s or 4s. For example, in the input, the 8s are in many positions, and the output might be derived from those.\n\nBut this is too vague. Let me think of another approach. Since the output is always 6x7, maybe the transformation is based on taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the first output row could be the first column of the input's rows that have certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking the positions where the input has 8s. For example, in example 1's input, the first output row has a 4, which is in the input's row 1, column 12. The 8s are in many positions, but maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s, and then some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a compressed version of the input. For example, the input is 15 rows, each with 13 columns. The output is 6 rows, each with 7 columns. So the output is a compressed version of the input, possibly by selecting certain rows and columns, or by some pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find the pattern. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the first output row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The 4 is in the first position. The second output row is [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 5]. The 6 is in the third position. The third output row is [4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]. The 4 is in the first position, 2 in the second, 8 in the sixth. The fourth output row is [9, 1, 9, 6, 0, 0, 0]. The fifth is [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]. The sixth is [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4].\n\nLooking for patterns, maybe the output is derived from the input's rows that have certain values. For example, the first output row is from the input's row 1, which has a 4 in the last column. The second output row is from row 9, which has a 6 in column 8 (assuming 0-based indexing). The third output row is from row 2, which has a 4 in column 2. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output row is the last column of the input's rows, but only certain rows. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, like 8s or 4s, and then arranging them in a certain way. For example, the output might be a grid that contains the positions of certain numbers from the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first few rows of the input and compressing them. For example, the first output row is from the first row of the input, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the last column of the input's rows. For example, in example 1, the last column of row 1 is 4, which is the first element of the output row. The last column of row 9 is 3, but that doesn't fit the second output row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s. For example, the input's row 1 has many 8s, and the output's first row is derived from that.\n\nBut this is not leading me anywhere. Maybe I should think of the output as a combination of certain rows and columns. For example, the output is 6 rows and 7 columns. The input is 15 rows and 13 columns. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input and certain columns.\n\nFor example, maybe the first output row is formed by taking the last column of the input's rows that have certain values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input, and then taking certain columns. But the input has 15 rows, so that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: think about the output as a transformation that involves some kind of pattern, like taking the positions where the input has 8s and then arranging them in a certain way. For example, in example 1's input, the first output row has a 4, which is in the last column of row 1. The second output row has 6, which is in row 9's column 8. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain numbers and then applying some transformation. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s and then replacing them with certain values.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find a pattern. Given that, perhaps I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The 4 is in the input's row 1, column 12. The second output row is [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 5]. The 6 is in the input's row 9, column 8. The 7 is in row 9, column 6. The 5 is in row 9, column 8 (no, that's 6). Wait, row 9 is 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 6 0 0 0 3. So column 6 is 8, column 8 is 6. So the 6 is at column 8, 7 is at column 5. So the second output row is [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 5]. So the 6 is from column 8, 7 from column 5, 5 from column 8? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the last column of the input's row 1, then zeros. The second output row is formed by taking certain columns from row 9. But this is not a clear pattern.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a pattern that could work for all examples. For example, the output is 6x7, and the input is 15x13. Maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and taking certain columns. For example, the first output row is the last column of the first row of the input, then zeros. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and taking the first 7 columns. But that would give a 6x7 grid. Let's check example 1's input. The first 6 rows are:\n\nRow 0: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 4\nRow 2: 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 9 0\nRow 3: 7 8 0 0 6 0 0 7 5 8 4 8 3\nRow 4: 2 8 4 2 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 8 9 1 9 6 0 0 0 8 0 0 7\n\nIf we take the first 7 columns of these rows, we would get:\n\nRow 0: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0\nRow 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8\nRow 2: 0 8 4 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 7 8 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 4: 2 8 4 2 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 8 9 1 9 6 0\n\nBut the output of example 1 is:\n\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 0 0 7 5\n4 2 0 0 0 8 0\n9 1 9 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 4\n\nWhich is different from the first 6 rows' first 7 columns. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of the input, but that would give 15 rows, which is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output row is the last column of row 1, and the rest are zeros. The second output row is the 8th column of row 9, and others. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should think of the output as being derived from the positions of certain numbers in the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, like 8s, and then arranging them in a certain way.\n\nFor example, in example 1's input, the first output row has a 4, which is in row 1, column 12. The second output row has a 6, which is in row 9, column 8. The third output row has a 4 in row 2, column 2. The fourth output row has 9 in row 3, column 0. The fifth output row has 8 in row 5, column 5. The sixth output row has 4 in row 18, column 6.\n\nBut this seems too arbitrary. However, if I can find a pattern where the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s, and then arranging them in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s, and then for each output row, taking the first occurrence of 8 in the input's rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the output of example 3. The input is 15 rows, each with 13 elements. The output is 4 rows, each with 5 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 6x7, so this example might not be relevant. However, the output of example 3 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 4 0\n0 0 0 5 6\n0 9 0 0 0\n\nWhich is 4 rows, each with 5 elements. So this suggests that the output is not directly derived from the input's rows and columns in a straightforward way.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern from the examples, I need to make an educated guess. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, and then arranging them in a certain way. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input at a certain position.\n\nBut how to determine which position?\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input, and for each row, taking the first 7 elements. But in example 1, this would give 6 rows, each with 7 elements. Let's check:\n\nFor example 1's first 6 rows:\n\nRow 0: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 \u2192 7 elements.\nRow 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 \u2192 7 elements.\nRow 2: 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements.\nRow 3: 7 8 0 0 6 0 0 \u2192 7 elements.\nRow 4: 2 8 4 2 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements.\nRow 5: 0 8 9 1 9 6 0 \u2192 7 elements.\n\nBut the output of example 1 is different from this. The output's first row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which doesn't match the first row of the input's first 6 rows. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the last 6 rows of the input, and taking certain columns. For example, the last 6 rows of example 1's input are:\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 6 0 0 0 3\nRow 10: 5 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 9 4 0 0 6 0 7 7 7 7 7\nRow 12: 0 0 2 2 4 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\nRow 13: 8 8 0 3 0 0 0 1 7 0 8 4 7\nRow 14: 7 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 7 0 6 8 7\n\nTaking the first 7 columns of these rows:\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 7 8\nRow 10: 5 0 3 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 9 4 0 0 6\nRow 12: 0 0 2 2 4 0 0\nRow 13: 8 8 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 14: 7 0 0 0 0 5 0\n\nBut the output of example 1 is different. So this approach is not working.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns based on the positions of 8s in the input.\n\nFor example, in example 1's input, the first output row has a 4, which is in the last column of row 1. The second output row has a 6, which is in row 9's column 8. The third output row has a 4 in row 2's column 2. The fourth output row has 9 in row 3's column 0. The fifth output row has 8 in row 5's column 5. The sixth output row has 4 in row 18's column 6.\n\nBut this seems like a random selection of positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s and then arranging them in a certain way. For example, the first output row is the first occurrence of 8 in the input's rows.\n\nBut again, this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the last column of certain rows and filling the rest with zeros. For example, in example 1's output, the first row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which is the last column of row 1 (4) and zeros. The second row is [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 5], which could be the 8th column of row 9 (6), 6th column (7), and 8th column (5)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s, and then for each output row, taking the first occurrence of 8 in the input's rows. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write a function that takes the input grid and returns a 6x7 grid, where each row is derived from certain positions in the input. For example, the first output row is the last column of the input's row 1, and the rest are zeros. The second output row is the 8th column of row 9, and so on. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the last column of the input's rows, and then arranging them in a certain way. For example, the first output row is the last column of row 1, the second is the last column of row 9, etc. But this would give 15 elements, but the output is 6 rows.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the last column of the input's rows 1, 9, 2, 3, 5, and 18 (assuming row indices). For example, row 1's last column is 4, row 9's last column is 3, row 2's last column is 0, row 3's last column is 3, row 5's last column is 0, and row 18's last column is 2. But this would give 6 values, which could be the first element of each output row. But the output has 7 elements per row.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nGiven that, I think I have to make a function that takes the input grid and returns a 6x7 grid, but I'm not sure of the exact transformation. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input, and for each row, taking the first 7 elements. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the last 6 rows of the input and taking certain columns. For example, the last 6 rows of example 1's input are rows 9-14. Taking the first 7 columns of these rows gives 6 rows, each with 7 elements. But the output of example 1 is different from this.\n\nIn example 1's input, the last 6 rows are:\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 6 0 0 0 3\nRow 10: 5 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 9 4 0 0 6 0 7 7 7 7 7\nRow 12: 0 0 2 2 4 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\nRow 13: 8 8 0 3 0 0 0 1 7 0 8 4 7\nRow 14: 7 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 7 0 6 8 7\n\nTaking the first 7 columns of these rows:\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 7 8\nRow 10: 5 0 3 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 9 4 0 0 6\nRow 12: 0 0 2 2 4 0 0\nRow 13: 8 8 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 14: 7 0 0 0 0 5 0\n\nBut the output of example 1 is different. So this approach is not correct.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make a function that returns a 6x7 grid, but I'm not sure of the exact transformation. Perhaps the function is to take the first 6 rows of the input and take the first 7 columns, but that doesn't fit the examples. Alternatively, the function could be to take the last 6 rows and take the last 7 columns. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and taking the last 7 columns. For example, for each of the first 6 rows, take the last 7 columns. Let's check:\n\nFor example 1's first 6 rows:\n\nRow 0: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 last 7 columns are 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\nRow 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 4 \u2192 last 7 columns are 8 8 0 0 4 (wait, 13 columns, last 7 would be columns 6-12: 8 8 8 8 0 0 4? Wait, let's count.\n\nRow 1 has 13 elements. Columns 0-12. Last 7 columns are 6-12 (since 13-7=6). So columns 6-12: 8 8 8 8 0 0 4. But the output's first row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut if the function takes the last column of each of the first 6 rows, then the first output row would be [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], but this doesn't match the example's output.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a function that returns a 6x7 grid, but I'm not sure. Perhaps the function is to take the first 6 rows of the input and take the first 7 columns. Even if it doesn't match the examples, it's a possible approach.\n\nSo, the function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(6):\n        row = grid[i][:7]\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would return the first 6 rows of the input, each with the first 7 columns. But in example 1, this would give:\n\nRow 0: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0\nRow 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8\nRow 2: 0 8 4 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 7 8 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 4: 2 8 4 2 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 8 9 1 9 6 0\n\nBut the example's output is different. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and taking the last 7 columns. For example, for each of the first 6 rows, take the last 7 columns.\n\nFor example 1's first 6 rows:\n\nRow 0: last 7 columns are 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: last 7 columns are 8 8 8 8 0 0 4\nRow 2: last 7 columns are 0 0 0 8 0 9 0\nRow 3: last 7 columns are 0 7 5 8 4 8 3\nRow 4: last 7 columns are 0 8 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 5: last 7 columns are 0 0 0 8 0 0 7\n\nBut the example's output is different.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. Perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, in example 1, the first output row is the last column of row 1, and the rest are zeros. The second output row is the 8th column of row 9, and others. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s and then arranging them in a certain way. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the number of 8s in the input's rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll have to proceed with a function that takes the input and returns a 6x7 grid, even if it's not correct. For example, the function could take the first 6 rows of the input and take the first 7 columns, even though it doesn't match the examples. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the last 6 rows of the input and taking the last 7 columns. For example, in example 1, the last 6 rows are rows 9-14. Taking the last 7 columns of each:\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 6 0 0 0 3 \u2192 last 7 columns are 0 0 0 0 0 7 8? No, the last 7 columns would be columns 6-12: 8 0 6 0 0 0 3? Or columns 6-12: 8, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3.\n\nRow 10: 5 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 last 7 columns: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 9 4 0 0 6 0 7 7 7 7 7 \u2192 last 7 columns: 6 0 7 7 7 7 7.\n\nRow 12: 0 0 2 2 4 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7 \u2192 last 7 columns: 0 0 7 0 0 0 7.\n\nRow 13: 8 8 0 3 0 0 0 1 7 0 8 4 7 \u2192 last 7 columns: 0 1 7 0 8 4 7.\n\nRow 14: 7 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 7 0 6 8 7 \u2192 last 7 columns: 0 5 7 0 6 8 7.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 8 0 6 0 0 0 3\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 6 0 7 7 7 7 7\nRow 3: 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\nRow 4: 0 1 7 0 8 4 7\nRow 5: 0 5 7 0 6 8 7\n\nBut this doesn't match the example's output.

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that maps the input grids to the output grids in the training examples. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 15x7 grid (since each line has 15 numbers, but the output is 6x7). Wait, the output is 6x7. So the input is 15 rows, each with 7 elements? Wait, no. Wait, the input for example 1 is given as lines with 13 numbers each? Wait, looking at the input for example 1:\n\nThe input lines are 15 rows, each with 13 numbers. For example, the first line is \"5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" which is 13 numbers. The output is 6 rows, each with 7 numbers. So the input is 15 rows, each with 7 columns? Wait, no. Wait, maybe the input is 15 rows, each with 7 elements? But the example shows lines with 13 numbers. Wait, maybe the input is 15 rows, each with 13 elements, and the output is 6 rows with 7 elements each. So the transformation is from a 15x13 grid to a 6x7 grid. But the problem says that the output must be 6x7. So the input for each example is a grid of some size, and the output is always 6x7.\n\nBut how to find the transformation? Let's look at the first example's input and output. The input is 15 rows, each with 13 numbers. The output is 6 rows, each with 7 numbers.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the first output line is \"4 0 0 0 0 0 0\" which is 7 elements. The second line is \"0 0 6 0 0 7 5\", etc.\n\nBut how to find the pattern. Let me think about possible transformations. Maybe the output is derived by taking certain rows or columns from the input, or some combination of them. Alternatively, maybe it's a pattern based on the positions of certain numbers, like 8s or 4s.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output. Let's take the first output line: 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Where does this come from? The input's first row is 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output first line is 4, then zeros. Maybe the 4 comes from the input's row 10 (since the output is 6 rows, maybe the first output row is from the 4th input row? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in the first example's output, the first row is 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Looking at the input's row 10 (assuming rows are 0-based or 1-based?), perhaps the 4 is in the input's row 10, column 0. Let me check the input for example 1:\n\nThe input rows are as follows:\n\nRow 0: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 4\nRow 2: 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 9 0\nRow 3: 7 8 0 0 6 0 0 7 5 8 4 8 3\nRow 4: 2 8 4 2 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 8 9 1 9 6 0 0 0 8 0 0 7\nRow 6: 1 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 8 0 0 0 0 4 0 4 8 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 6 0 0 0 3\nRow 10: 5 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 9 4 0 0 6 0 7 7 7 7 7\nRow 12: 0 0 2 2 4 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\nRow 13: 8 8 0 3 0 0 0 1 7 0 8 4 7\nRow 14: 7 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 7 0 6 8 7\nRow 15: 0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0 7 7 7 7 7\nRow 16: 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 2\nRow 17: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 9 1\nRow 18: 0 0 0 8 0 8 6 0 0 0 0 0 1\n\nWait, but the input for example 1 is 15 rows. Wait, the first example's input has 15 rows? Let me count. The input lines for example 1 start with 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (row 0), then 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 4 (row 1), and so on. The input has 15 rows. Then the output is 6 rows. So the output is 6x7.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the first output row is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Where is that 4 coming from? Looking at the input rows, maybe row 1 has a 4 in the last column. Let's check row 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 4. The last element is 4. So maybe the first output row is taking that 4 and putting it in the first position of the output row, then zeros. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the output has 7 columns. Let's see: the first output row is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The input's row 1 has 4 in the last column. But how does that translate to the output's first row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking specific positions from the input. For example, in the first example, the output rows might be derived from certain rows in the input. Let me check the output of example 1:\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 6 0 0 7 5\nRow 2: 4 2 0 0 0 8 0\nRow 3: 9 1 9 6 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 4 0 4\n\nLooking at the first output row: 4, then zeros. Maybe this 4 comes from the input's row 1, column 12 (the last element of row 1 is 4). Then the output row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. Let's think about the output's columns. The output has 7 columns. For example, in the first output row, the first element is 4, which is from the input's row 1, column 12. Then the rest are zeros. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output's first row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which could be the first column of the input's row 1, but that's 0. Wait, no. The first element of row 1 is 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the output rows might be derived from specific rows in the input. Let's look at the output rows and see if they correspond to certain rows in the input.\n\nLooking at the first output row: 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The 4 is in the first position. Maybe that's from the input's row 1, column 12 (the last element). Then the rest are zeros. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions. For example, the first output row could be the first column of the input's row 1, but that's 0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values. For example, in example 1's input, row 1 has a 4 in the last column. The output's first row starts with 4. Maybe that's the only non-zero element in the first output row.\n\nBut how does that translate to the other rows? Let's look at the second output row: 0 0 6 0 0 7 5. Where does this come from? Looking at the input, maybe the 6 is from row 2, column 2 (row 2 is 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 9 0). The third element is 4, but that's not 6. Wait, maybe row 9 (input row 9) is 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 6 0 0 0 3. The 8th element is 6. So maybe that's where the 6 comes from. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking specific rows from the input. For example, the first output row is from row 1, the second from row 2, etc. But that would be 6 rows, but the input has 15 rows. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows. For example, the first output row is from row 1, the second from row 2, but that doesn't fit the output's second row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns. For example, the output's first row has 4, which is from the last column of row 1. The second output row has 6, which could be from the 9th column of row 9. But this seems too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain patterns. For example, the output rows might be derived by taking the positions where the input has 8s or other numbers. For example, in example 1's input, the first output row has a 4, which is in the input's row 1, column 12. The second output row has 6, which is in the input's row 9, column 8 (assuming 0-based). But how to find a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values. For example, the output is a 6x7 grid, and each cell in the output is derived from the input's cell in a specific position. For example, the output's row i, column j is derived from the input's row (i + some offset), column (j + some offset).\n\nBut this is too vague. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input is 15 rows, each with 24 elements. The output is 6 rows, each with 7 elements. So again, the output is 6x7.\n\nLooking at example 2's output, the first output row is 6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0. Wait, no, the output is 6x7. Wait, example 2's output is:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, that can't be. Wait the output for example 2 is given as:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, the output for example 2 is:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, looking back, the output for example 2 is:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, the actual output is:\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, the output is given as:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, looking at the example 2's output:\n\nThe output is:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, the actual output is:\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, the actual output is:\n\nLooking back, example 2's output is:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0\n0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 7 0 5\n4 0 3 4 0 3 0 0 8 0\n0 0 3 7 7 5 0 0 1 0\n3 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n\nWait, but that's 8 rows, but the output is supposed to be 6x7. Oh, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the example 2's output again. The output for example 2 is:\n\nThe output lines are:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 no, that's 10 elements. Wait, the output is supposed to be 6x7. So each output row has 7 elements. But the example 2's output is written as:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0\n0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 7 0 5\n4 0 3 4 0 3 0 0 8 0\n0 0 3 7 7 5 0 0 1 0\n3 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n\nWait, this can't be right. Because each output row should have 7 elements. But looking at the first line, there are 10 elements. That must be a mistake. Maybe the actual output is different. Let me check the problem statement again.\n\nWait, the example 2's output is written as:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0\n0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 7 0 5\n4 0 3 4 0 3 0 0 8 0\n0 0 3 7 7 5 0 0 1 0\n3 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n\nBut this is 8 rows, each with 10 elements, which doesn't make sense. Oh, maybe the actual output is 6x7, so each line is 7 elements. So maybe the example is written with line breaks that are not correct. Perhaps the actual output is:\n\nFor example 2, the output is 6 rows, each with 7 elements. So the first line is \"6 0 0 0 1 1 0\" (7 elements), but the example shows more. This suggests that perhaps there's a formatting error in the problem statement. But given that the problem says that the output must be 6x7, I need to focus on that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for example 2 is:\n\nThe first line is \"6 0 0 0 1 1 0\" (7 elements), the second line is \"0 0 6 0 6 0 4\", etc. But the example's output is written with more elements. This is confusing. But perhaps I should focus on the third example, which has a more clear output.\n\nLooking at example 3's output:\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 4 0\n0 0 0 5 6\n0 9 0 0 0\n\nWhich is 4 rows, each with 5 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 6x7. So this suggests that the examples might have different output sizes, but the problem says that the test input must be transformed into a 6x7 grid. So maybe the examples have different input sizes, but the output is always 6x7.\n\nBut this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for patterns in the output of the examples.\n\nAnother approach: looking for possible transformations that could map the input to the output. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the first few columns of the input, or certain rows. Or perhaps the output is derived by some pattern based on the positions of certain numbers.\n\nLooking at example 1's output. The first output row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The 4 is in the first position. Looking at the input's row 1 (the second line of input), which is 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 4. The last element is 4. So maybe the output's first row is taking that 4 and putting it in the first position, then zeros. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input. For example, the output's first row is from row 1 of the input, but only the last element is taken. But that would be 4, then zeros. But that's just one element.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output row is from the last column of the input's row 1, and the rest are zeros. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, like 8s or 4s. For example, in the input, the 8s are in many positions, and the output might be derived from those.\n\nBut this is too vague. Let me think of another approach. Since the output is always 6x7, maybe the transformation is based on taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the first output row could be the first column of the input's rows that have certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking the positions where the input has 8s. For example, in example 1's input, the first output row has a 4, which is in the input's row 1, column 12. The 8s are in many positions, but maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s, and then some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a compressed version of the input. For example, the input is 15 rows, each with 13 columns. The output is 6 rows, each with 7 columns. So the output is a compressed version of the input, possibly by selecting certain rows and columns, or by some pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find the pattern. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the first output row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The 4 is in the first position. The second output row is [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 5]. The 6 is in the third position. The third output row is [4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]. The 4 is in the first position, 2 in the second, 8 in the sixth. The fourth output row is [9, 1, 9, 6, 0, 0, 0]. The fifth is [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]. The sixth is [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4].\n\nLooking for patterns, maybe the output is derived from the input's rows that have certain values. For example, the first output row is from the input's row 1, which has a 4 in the last column. The second output row is from row 9, which has a 6 in column 8 (assuming 0-based indexing). The third output row is from row 2, which has a 4 in column 2. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output row is the last column of the input's rows, but only certain rows. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, like 8s or 4s, and then arranging them in a certain way. For example, the output might be a grid that contains the positions of certain numbers from the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first few rows of the input and compressing them. For example, the first output row is from the first row of the input, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the last column of the input's rows. For example, in example 1, the last column of row 1 is 4, which is the first element of the output row. The last column of row 9 is 3, but that doesn't fit the second output row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s. For example, the input's row 1 has many 8s, and the output's first row is derived from that.\n\nBut this is not leading me anywhere. Maybe I should think of the output as a combination of certain rows and columns. For example, the output is 6 rows and 7 columns. The input is 15 rows and 13 columns. So maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input and certain columns.\n\nFor example, maybe the first output row is formed by taking the last column of the input's rows that have certain values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input, and then taking certain columns. But the input has 15 rows, so that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: think about the output as a transformation that involves some kind of pattern, like taking the positions where the input has 8s and then arranging them in a certain way. For example, in example 1's input, the first output row has a 4, which is in the last column of row 1. The second output row has 6, which is in row 9's column 8. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain numbers and then applying some transformation. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s and then replacing them with certain values.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find a pattern. Given that, perhaps I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The 4 is in the input's row 1, column 12. The second output row is [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 5]. The 6 is in the input's row 9, column 8. The 7 is in row 9, column 6. The 5 is in row 9, column 8 (no, that's 6). Wait, row 9 is 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 6 0 0 0 3. So column 6 is 8, column 8 is 6. So the 6 is at column 8, 7 is at column 5. So the second output row is [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 5]. So the 6 is from column 8, 7 from column 5, 5 from column 8? No, that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the last column of the input's row 1, then zeros. The second output row is formed by taking certain columns from row 9. But this is not a clear pattern.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a pattern that could work for all examples. For example, the output is 6x7, and the input is 15x13. Maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and taking certain columns. For example, the first output row is the last column of the first row of the input, then zeros. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and taking the first 7 columns. But that would give a 6x7 grid. Let's check example 1's input. The first 6 rows are:\n\nRow 0: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 4\nRow 2: 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 9 0\nRow 3: 7 8 0 0 6 0 0 7 5 8 4 8 3\nRow 4: 2 8 4 2 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 8 9 1 9 6 0 0 0 8 0 0 7\n\nIf we take the first 7 columns of these rows, we would get:\n\nRow 0: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0\nRow 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8\nRow 2: 0 8 4 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 7 8 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 4: 2 8 4 2 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 8 9 1 9 6 0\n\nBut the output of example 1 is:\n\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 0 0 7 5\n4 2 0 0 0 8 0\n9 1 9 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 4\n\nWhich is different from the first 6 rows' first 7 columns. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the last 7 columns of the input, but that would give 15 rows, which is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output row is the last column of row 1, and the rest are zeros. The second output row is the 8th column of row 9, and others. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should think of the output as being derived from the positions of certain numbers in the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, like 8s, and then arranging them in a certain way.\n\nFor example, in example 1's input, the first output row has a 4, which is in row 1, column 12. The second output row has a 6, which is in row 9, column 8. The third output row has a 4 in row 2, column 2. The fourth output row has 9 in row 3, column 0. The fifth output row has 8 in row 5, column 5. The sixth output row has 4 in row 18, column 6.\n\nBut this seems too arbitrary. However, if I can find a pattern where the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s, and then arranging them in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s, and then for each output row, taking the first occurrence of 8 in the input's rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the output of example 3. The input is 15 rows, each with 13 elements. The output is 4 rows, each with 5 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 6x7, so this example might not be relevant. However, the output of example 3 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n0 6 0 4 0\n0 0 0 5 6\n0 9 0 0 0\n\nWhich is 4 rows, each with 5 elements. So this suggests that the output is not directly derived from the input's rows and columns in a straightforward way.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern from the examples, I need to make an educated guess. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, and then arranging them in a certain way. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input at a certain position.\n\nBut how to determine which position?\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input, and for each row, taking the first 7 elements. But in example 1, this would give 6 rows, each with 7 elements. Let's check:\n\nFor example 1's first 6 rows:\n\nRow 0: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 \u2192 7 elements.\nRow 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 \u2192 7 elements.\nRow 2: 0 8 4 0 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements.\nRow 3: 7 8 0 0 6 0 0 \u2192 7 elements.\nRow 4: 2 8 4 2 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements.\nRow 5: 0 8 9 1 9 6 0 \u2192 7 elements.\n\nBut the output of example 1 is different from this. The output's first row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which doesn't match the first row of the input's first 6 rows. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the last 6 rows of the input, and taking certain columns. For example, the last 6 rows of example 1's input are:\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 6 0 0 0 3\nRow 10: 5 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 9 4 0 0 6 0 7 7 7 7 7\nRow 12: 0 0 2 2 4 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\nRow 13: 8 8 0 3 0 0 0 1 7 0 8 4 7\nRow 14: 7 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 7 0 6 8 7\n\nTaking the first 7 columns of these rows:\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 7 8\nRow 10: 5 0 3 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 9 4 0 0 6\nRow 12: 0 0 2 2 4 0 0\nRow 13: 8 8 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 14: 7 0 0 0 0 5 0\n\nBut the output of example 1 is different. So this approach is not working.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns based on the positions of 8s in the input.\n\nFor example, in example 1's input, the first output row has a 4, which is in the last column of row 1. The second output row has a 6, which is in row 9's column 8. The third output row has a 4 in row 2's column 2. The fourth output row has 9 in row 3's column 0. The fifth output row has 8 in row 5's column 5. The sixth output row has 4 in row 18's column 6.\n\nBut this seems like a random selection of positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s and then arranging them in a certain way. For example, the first output row is the first occurrence of 8 in the input's rows.\n\nBut again, this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the last column of certain rows and filling the rest with zeros. For example, in example 1's output, the first row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], which is the last column of row 1 (4) and zeros. The second row is [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 5], which could be the 8th column of row 9 (6), 6th column (7), and 8th column (5)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s, and then for each output row, taking the first occurrence of 8 in the input's rows. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write a function that takes the input grid and returns a 6x7 grid, where each row is derived from certain positions in the input. For example, the first output row is the last column of the input's row 1, and the rest are zeros. The second output row is the 8th column of row 9, and so on. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the last column of the input's rows, and then arranging them in a certain way. For example, the first output row is the last column of row 1, the second is the last column of row 9, etc. But this would give 15 elements, but the output is 6 rows.\n\nAnother idea: the output is formed by taking the last column of the input's rows 1, 9, 2, 3, 5, and 18 (assuming row indices). For example, row 1's last column is 4, row 9's last column is 3, row 2's last column is 0, row 3's last column is 3, row 5's last column is 0, and row 18's last column is 2. But this would give 6 values, which could be the first element of each output row. But the output has 7 elements per row.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nGiven that, I think I have to make a function that takes the input grid and returns a 6x7 grid, but I'm not sure of the exact transformation. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input, and for each row, taking the first 7 elements. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the last 6 rows of the input and taking certain columns. For example, the last 6 rows of example 1's input are rows 9-14. Taking the first 7 columns of these rows gives 6 rows, each with 7 elements. But the output of example 1 is different from this.\n\nIn example 1's input, the last 6 rows are:\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 6 0 0 0 3\nRow 10: 5 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 9 4 0 0 6 0 7 7 7 7 7\nRow 12: 0 0 2 2 4 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\nRow 13: 8 8 0 3 0 0 0 1 7 0 8 4 7\nRow 14: 7 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 7 0 6 8 7\n\nTaking the first 7 columns of these rows:\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 7 8\nRow 10: 5 0 3 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 9 4 0 0 6\nRow 12: 0 0 2 2 4 0 0\nRow 13: 8 8 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 14: 7 0 0 0 0 5 0\n\nBut the output of example 1 is different. So this approach is not correct.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make a function that returns a 6x7 grid, but I'm not sure of the exact transformation. Perhaps the function is to take the first 6 rows of the input and take the first 7 columns, but that doesn't fit the examples. Alternatively, the function could be to take the last 6 rows and take the last 7 columns. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and taking the last 7 columns. For example, for each of the first 6 rows, take the last 7 columns. Let's check:\n\nFor example 1's first 6 rows:\n\nRow 0: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 last 7 columns are 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\nRow 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 4 \u2192 last 7 columns are 8 8 0 0 4 (wait, 13 columns, last 7 would be columns 6-12: 8 8 8 8 0 0 4? Wait, let's count.\n\nRow 1 has 13 elements. Columns 0-12. Last 7 columns are 6-12 (since 13-7=6). So columns 6-12: 8 8 8 8 0 0 4. But the output's first row is [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut if the function takes the last column of each of the first 6 rows, then the first output row would be [0, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4], but this doesn't match the example's output.\n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a function that returns a 6x7 grid, but I'm not sure. Perhaps the function is to take the first 6 rows of the input and take the first 7 columns. Even if it doesn't match the examples, it's a possible approach.\n\nSo, the function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(6):\n        row = grid[i][:7]\n        transformed.append(row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would return the first 6 rows of the input, each with the first 7 columns. But in example 1, this would give:\n\nRow 0: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0\nRow 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8\nRow 2: 0 8 4 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 7 8 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 4: 2 8 4 2 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 8 9 1 9 6 0\n\nBut the example's output is different. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and taking the last 7 columns. For example, for each of the first 6 rows, take the last 7 columns.\n\nFor example 1's first 6 rows:\n\nRow 0: last 7 columns are 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: last 7 columns are 8 8 8 8 0 0 4\nRow 2: last 7 columns are 0 0 0 8 0 9 0\nRow 3: last 7 columns are 0 7 5 8 4 8 3\nRow 4: last 7 columns are 0 8 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 5: last 7 columns are 0 0 0 8 0 0 7\n\nBut the example's output is different.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. Perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, in example 1, the first output row is the last column of row 1, and the rest are zeros. The second output row is the 8th column of row 9, and others. But this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s and then arranging them in a certain way. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the number of 8s in the input's rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll have to proceed with a function that takes the input and returns a 6x7 grid, even if it's not correct. For example, the function could take the first 6 rows of the input and take the first 7 columns, even though it doesn't match the examples. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the last 6 rows of the input and taking the last 7 columns. For example, in example 1, the last 6 rows are rows 9-14. Taking the last 7 columns of each:\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 0 6 0 0 0 3 \u2192 last 7 columns are 0 0 0 0 0 7 8? No, the last 7 columns would be columns 6-12: 8 0 6 0 0 0 3? Or columns 6-12: 8, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3.\n\nRow 10: 5 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 last 7 columns: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 9 4 0 0 6 0 7 7 7 7 7 \u2192 last 7 columns: 6 0 7 7 7 7 7.\n\nRow 12: 0 0 2 2 4 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 7 \u2192 last 7 columns: 0 0 7 0 0 0 7.\n\nRow 13: 8 8 0 3 0 0 0 1 7 0 8 4 7 \u2192 last 7 columns: 0 1 7 0 8 4 7.\n\nRow 14: 7 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 7 0 6 8 7 \u2192 last 7 columns: 0 5 7 0 6 8 7.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 8 0 6 0 0 0 3\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 6 0 7 7 7 7 7\nRow 3: 0 0 7 0 0 0 7\nRow 4: 0 1 7 0 8 4 7\nRow 5: 0 5 7 0 6 8 7\n\nBut this doesn't match the example's output.
