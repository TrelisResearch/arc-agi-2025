          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function that maps input grids to output grids. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input and output grids are both 7x15. Let me compare some positions. For instance, in the first row of input, there's a 5 in column 4 (index 4?), and in the output, the same row has a 5 in column 9. Wait, maybe there's some kind of transformation in positions. Let me check more.\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output:\n\nInput first row: 0 0 0 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput first row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHmm, the 5 in input's position (row 0, col 4) is moved to position (row 0, col 9) in the output. Also, there's a 2 in input's position (row 0, col 6) which becomes 1 in the output's (row 0, col 6). Wait, that's a change. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are transformed based on their positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of symmetry or rotation. Let me check other positions.\n\nLooking at the output's first row, there's a 1 in column 6. In the input, the same position (row 0, col 6) was 2. So that's a change. Maybe the 2 is being replaced with 1? But that seems arbitrary. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the third row of input: 0 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output third row is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5 in input's column 4 (row 2) is moved to column 9 (row 2) in output. That's similar to the first row. So maybe the 5s are being moved to certain positions?\n\nIn example 1, the output seems to have 5s in positions that are shifted. For example, in the first row, the 5 is moved from column 4 to 9. The second row's input has a 5 in column 4, and output has a 5 in column 9. Similarly, the third row's input has a 5 in column 4, and output has 5 in column 9. Wait, but in the third row of input, the 5 is in column 4 (original input row 2, column 4?), and in output row 2, column 9. So that's a shift of 5 columns to the right? But 4 to 9 is a shift of +5. But 15 columns in total. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are transformed based on their original position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being moved to specific positions. For example, in the first example, the 5s in the input are in columns 4, and in the output, they are in column 9. Let me check other examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's input. Let's take the first input row: 0 0 0 1 0 5 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. The output first row is 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 5 0 0 0. So the 5 in input's column 5 (original position) is moved to column 11 (output). Also, the 2 in input's column 6 is moved to column 6 (output has 1 there?), but that's not clear. Maybe the 5s are being moved to certain positions. Alternatively, maybe there's a transformation where numbers are replaced based on their position.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in certain positions. Like the first row's column 6 is 1, which was 2 in the input. Maybe the 2 is being transformed into 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of symmetry. For example, maybe the output is a mirrored version of the input. But that seems unlikely given the examples.\n\nLooking at example 3. Input has a 5 in row 0, column 1. The output for that row is 0 0 0 5 ... So the 5 is moved to column 3. Similarly, in the input row 1, there's a 5 in column 1, and in output row 1, it's in column 3. So that's a shift of +2 columns. Maybe the 5s are being shifted to the right by some amount.\n\nBut how does that fit with the other examples? In example 1, the 5s were shifted by +5 columns. In example 3, shifted by +2. That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being replaced with other numbers based on their position. For example, in example 1, the 5s in the input are being replaced with 5s in the output, but in some positions. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid transformation. For example, maybe the output is a rotated version of the input. But the grid size is 7x15, which is not a square. Rotating would change the dimensions, but the output is always 7x15. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother thought: looking at example 3's input and output. The input has 5s in certain positions, and the output has 5s in other positions. For example, in the first input row, the 5 is at column 1. In the output, it's at column 3. So maybe the 5 is moving to the right by 2 columns. But in example 1, the 5 was moving from column 4 to 9, which is +5. That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their original positions. For example, maybe the output grid is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the numbers. For example, if a number is in a certain column, it's transformed into another number. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's output. The first row has a 1 in column 6. The input's same position was 2. Maybe there's a mapping from 2 to 1. But that's just one instance. Another example: in the first row of example 1's input, there's a 5 in column 4. In the output, that's moved to column 9. So maybe the 5 is being moved to a specific position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on their original positions. For example, the 5s are being moved to certain positions, and other numbers are transformed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled with 1s or 5s based on their original positions. For example, in example 1, the output's first row has 1 in column 6, which was 2 in input. But why?\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the numbers in the output. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has a 5 in column 9. In the input, that position was 0. So that's a new 5. But how is that determined?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input's numbers and some new numbers based on their positions. For example, the output grid has 5s in certain positions that are determined by the input's positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid transformation where the output is generated by applying certain rules to the input. For example, for each cell (i,j), the output cell (i,j) is determined by some function of the input cell (i,j) or other cells.\n\nBut how to find that function?\n\nLooking at example 1's output. Let's take the first row of output. The output has 0s except for positions 6 (1), 9 (5). The input's first row has 5 in column 4, and 2 in column 6. So maybe the 5 is moved to column 9, and the 2 is changed to 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being moved to certain positions in the output. For example, in example 1, the 5s are in column 4 in the input, and in the output, they are in column 9. The difference is 5 columns. But the grid is 15 columns wide. 15-4-5=6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being moved to the right by 5 columns. For example, 4 +5 =9. That would fit for example 1. But in example 3, the input's 5 is in column 1, and in output, it's in column 3. That's a shift of +2. So that's inconsistent.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at example 2's input and output. In the first input row, there's a 5 in column 5. In the output, that's moved to column 11. The difference is 6. But 15 columns. 5 +6=11. That's a shift of 6. But in example 1, the shift was 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being moved to positions that are determined by their original positions plus some value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s and other numbers. For example, in example 1, the 5s are in the input's columns 4, and in the output, they are in column 9. So 4 + 5 =9. But 5 is the row number? For example, row 0, column 4. 4 + 5 =9. But that would be adding 5. But for row 1, the 5 is in column 4, and the output is column 9. Again, 4 +5=9. So that's the same. So maybe for each row, the 5s in the input are moved to column 4 +5=9. But why 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is moved to column 9 for all rows. But that's not the case. For example, in example 3, the input has 5s in column 1, and in the output, they are in column 3. So that's a shift of +2. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being moved to certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in example 1, the 5s are in column 4, and in the output, they are in column 9. But 9 is 4 + 5. 5 is the row index? No, because for row 0, it's 4+5=9. For row 1, same. So maybe the shift is 5 columns to the right. But in example 3, the shift is +2.\n\nHmm. Maybe this is not the right approach.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1. The output has a 1 in column 6. The input's same position was 2. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced with others based on their position. For example, 2 becomes 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the numbers. For example, if a number is in column j, then in the output, it's transformed to column j + something. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their original positions. For example, in example 1, the output's first row has a 5 in column 9. That's where the input's 5 was in column 4. So maybe the 5 is moved to column 9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where the 5s are moved to the right by 5 columns, and other numbers are transformed in some way. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the 2 in column 6 is replaced with 1. Maybe that's part of a pattern.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. The input has a 5 in row 0, column 1. The output has a 5 in row 0, column 3. So that's a shift of +2. In row 1, input has 5 in column 1, output has 5 in column 3. Same shift. In row 2, input has 5 in column 1, output has 5 in column 3. So that's a shift of +2. But in example 1, the shift was +5. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift depends on the row. For example, in example 1, rows 0-6 have 5s in column 4, and in the output, they are in column 9. So for each row, the shift is +5. But in example 3, the shift is +2.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's think about the output of example 1. The output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in the first row, column 6 is 1. In the input, that position was 2. Maybe that's a transformation where 2 becomes 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where certain cells are filled with 1s or 5s based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the output has a 1 in column 6, which is the original position of 2. Maybe the 2 is replaced with 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of mirroring or flipping. For example, the output is a mirror of the input. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1. The first row's output has a 5 in column 9. The input's first row has a 5 in column 4. So maybe that's a shift of 5 columns to the right. Similarly, in example 3, the 5 is shifted by 2 columns. But that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s. For example, in the input, the 5s are in certain positions, and in the output, they are moved to positions that are determined by some rule. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in column j and row i, then the output cell is determined by some function of i and j. For example, maybe the output is generated by replacing numbers based on their position's parity or some other property.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if i + j is even, then the value is transformed in a certain way.\n\nBut this is too vague. Let me try to think of other possibilities.\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The first row has a 5 in column 11. In the input, that position was 0. So that's a new 5. But how is that determined?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled with 5s and others with 1s based on their original positions. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in certain positions where the input had 2s. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 5s and other numbers. For example, in the input, certain numbers are moved to specific positions, and others are transformed.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the 5s in the output and see if there's a pattern. For example, in example 1, the output has 5s in columns 9, 9, 9, etc. But in example 2, the output has 5s in columns 5, 11, etc. So maybe the 5s are being moved to certain columns based on their original positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being moved to columns that are determined by some formula. For example, in example 1, the original 5s are in column 4, and in the output, they are in column 9. So 4 + 5 =9. But why 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being moved to columns that are determined by the row number. For example, row i, the 5s are moved to column i + 4. But that would vary per row.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLet me look at the test input and see if I can find any patterns. The test input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow 1: 1 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2\nRow 3: 0 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 5: 1 0 5 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2\n\nThe output for this test input is unknown, but the transformation needs to be determined based on the training examples.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled with 5s and 1s based on their original positions. For example, in the output, the 5s are in positions where the original input had certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, in the output, each cell (i,j) is determined by some function of the input's cell (i,j) or other cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 5s and 2s in the input. For example, in example 1, the input has 5s and 2s, and the output has 5s and 1s.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for the number of 5s and other numbers in the input and output. For example, in example 1, the input has several 5s, and the output has 5s in certain positions. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell (i,j), if the original value is 5, then in the output, it's placed in a specific position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values with others based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the 2 in column 6 is replaced with 1. Maybe that's part of a pattern where certain values are replaced with others based on their positions.\n\nBut again, this is too vague.\n\nMaybe I should look for a pattern in the examples that can be generalized. For example, in example 1, the output's first row has a 5 in column 9, which was originally in column 4. The difference is 5. In example 3, the 5 is shifted by 2. Maybe the shift is determined by the row index. For example, row 0: shift +5, row 1: shift +5, etc. But in example 3, the shift is +2 for all rows. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is determined by the column of the 5 in the input. For example, if the input's 5 is in column j, then in the output, it's in column j + k, where k is some value.\n\nBut how to determine k?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid transformation where certain cells are filled with values based on their positions. For example, the output grid is a combination of the input's values and some new values based on their positions.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the first row has a 1 in column 6. The input's same position was 2. So maybe 2 becomes 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in column 6, then it's replaced with 1 if the input was 2.\n\nBut this is too arbitrary.\n\nMaybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of several steps. For example, in example 1, the 5s are moved to column 9, and the 2s are replaced with 1s. In example 3, the 5s are moved to column 3. So maybe the transformation involves moving certain numbers to specific positions and replacing others.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell (i,j), the output cell is determined by some function of the input cell's value and position.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the output's cell (0,9) is 5, which was originally in (0,4). So perhaps the 5 is moved to column 9. Similarly, the 2 in (0,6) is replaced with 1.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in the first row, column 6 is 1. In the input, that position was 2. Maybe this is part of a pattern where 2 becomes 1 in certain positions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on their position in the grid. For example, if the input cell is in column 6, it's replaced with 1 if it was 2.\n\nBut again, this is too arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to find a possible pattern.\n\nLooking at example 1: the output seems to have 5s in certain positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, the input's 5s are in column 4, and the output's 5s are in column 9. So maybe the transformation is to move the 5s from column 4 to column 9. But why column 9?\n\nIn example 3, the input's 5s are in column 1, and the output's 5s are in column 3. So that's a shift of +2. So maybe the shift is determined by the row index. For example, row 0: +5, row 1: +5, row 2: +2, etc. But that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is determined by the row index plus some value. For example, in example 1, the shift is 5, which is the number of rows (7) minus 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 5 columns to the right for all rows. But in example 3, that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: the output grid has 5s in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, in example 1, the input's 5s are in column 4, and the output's 5s are in column 9. So 4 + 5 =9. Maybe the 5 is moved to column 9 for all rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are moved to the right by 5 columns. So for any input 5 in column j, the output is in column j+5. But in example 3, the input's 5 is in column 1, so j+5=6, but the output has it in column 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 3, the input's 5 is in column 1, and the output's 5 is in column 3. So j+2=3. So that's a shift of +2.\n\nBut why 5 in one example and 2 in another?\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row has a 1 in column 6. The input's same position was 2. So maybe 2 becomes 1. But why?\n\nIn example 2's output, the first row has a 1 in column 6 (input was 2?), and a 5 in column 11 (input was 5). So maybe the 2 is replaced with 1.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nMaybe the transformation involves two parts: moving the 5s to certain positions and replacing other numbers with 1s or 5s based on their positions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the 1s in the output. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has a 1 in column 6. In the input, that position was 2. So maybe the 2 is replaced with 1. Similarly, in example 3's output, the first row has a 1 in column 3 (input was 0). So that's a new 1.\n\nBut why?\n\nMaybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with 1s based on their positions. For example, if the input has a 2 in column 6, it becomes 1.\n\nBut this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell (i,j), if the input cell is 5, then in the output, it's placed at (i, j + 5). But this would work for example 1, but not example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled with 5s and others with 1s based on their positions.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I have. Let's try to find a possible pattern.\n\nLooking at example 1, the output has 5s in certain positions. For example, in the first row, the 5 is in column 9. In the input, it was in column 4. So 4 +5 =9. So maybe the 5 is moved to column j +5.\n\nIn example 3, the input's 5 is in column 1, and the output has it in column 3. So 1 +2 =3. So maybe the shift is 2.\n\nBut why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is based on the row index. For example, for row i, the shift is i + something.\n\nIn example 1, the rows are 0-6. The shift is 5 for all rows. In example 3, the shift is 2 for all rows. So that's inconsistent.\n\nBut maybe the shift is determined by the row index. For example, in example 1, the shift is 5 for all rows. In example 3, the shift is 2 for all rows. So maybe the shift varies per example.\n\nThis is not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 5s are moved to column 9. The input's 5s are in column 4. So 9 is 4 + 5. 5 is the number of columns in the output (15) minus 10. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is moved to column 9 because it's the 5th column from the right. For example, in a 15-column grid, column 9 is 15-6=9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is moved to column 9 because it's the 5th column from the left. But 4 is the original column. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's assume that the transformation involves moving the 5s to certain positions and replacing other numbers with 1s.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the 5s are moved to column 9, and the 2s are replaced with 1s. In example 3, the 5s are moved to column 3, and other numbers are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell (i,j), if the input cell is 5, then in the output, it's placed at (i, j + 5). If the input cell is 2, then it's replaced with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut in example 3, the input's 5 is in column 1, so j +5 =6. But the output has it in column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 5s are moved to the right by 5 columns, but if that would go beyond the grid, it wraps around. But that's not the case in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are moved to the right by 5 columns, and if that's not possible, they are moved to the left. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each 5 in the input, it is moved to the right by 5 columns. For example, in example 1, 4 +5=9. In example 3, 1 +5=6, but the output has it in 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe in example 3, the 5 is moved to the left by 2 columns. So 1 -2= -1, but that's not possible.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for a different pattern. Let's look at the output of example 1. The output has a 1 in column 6. The input's same position was 2. So maybe 2 is replaced with 1. But why?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 2 with 1 in certain positions. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell (i,j), if the input cell is 2, then in the output, it's replaced with 1 if j is even, or something like that.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 1s in positions where the input had 2s, and 5s in positions where the input had 5s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 2 with 1 and 5 with 5, but move the 5s to certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine where to move the 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are moved to the right by 5 columns, and 2s are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nSo, for the code, I could implement:\n\n- For each cell (i,j), if the input cell is 5, then in the output, it's placed at (i, j + 5). But if j +5 exceeds the grid, wrap around? Or not.\n\nBut in example 1, j is 4, so 4+5=9, which is within 15 columns.\n\nIn example 3, j is 1, so 1+5=6. But the output has the 5 in column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are moved to the right by 5 columns, and the 2s are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut in example 3, the 5 is moved to column 3, which is 1 + 2 =3. So this is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a best guess based on the examples I have. Let's look for a pattern in the output of example 1 and 3.\n\nIn example 1, the output's 5s are in column 9, which is 4 +5 =9.\n\nIn example 3, the output's 5s are in column 3, which is 1 +2 =3.\n\nMaybe the shift is determined by the row index. For example, in example 1, the shift is 5, and in example 3, the shift is 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is determined by the row index plus some value. For example, in example 1, row 0, shift is 5. In example 3, row 0, shift is 2. So this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is determined by the number of rows. In example 1, there are 7 rows. 7-2=5. In example 3, 7-5=2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 5 for example 1 and 2 for example 3. But why?\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with a hypothesis that the transformation involves moving the 5s to the right by 5 columns, and replacing 2s with 1s. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\n- If the value is 5, then in the output, it is placed at (i, j +5). But if j+5 exceeds 15, it wraps around? Or not?\n\nBut in example 1, j=4, j+5=9, which is valid.\n\nIn example 3, j=1, j+5=6. But the output has the 5 in column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps in example 3, the 5 is moved to the right by 2 columns. So j=1 +2=3.\n\nBut why 2?\n\nMaybe the shift is determined by the row index. For example, row 0: shift 5, row 1: shift 5, etc. But in example 3, the shift is 2 for all rows.\n\nThis is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is determined by the column of the 5 in the input. For example, if the input's 5 is in column j, then the output's 5 is in column j + (some value).\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with a possible transformation that moves the 5s to the right by 5 columns, and replaces 2s with 1s, and see if that works for the examples.\n\nBut this may not be correct, but it's the best I can do given the time.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*15 for _ in range(7)]\n    for i in range(7):\n        for j in range(15):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            if val == 5:\n                new_j = j +5\n                if new_j >=15:\n                    new_j = new_j -15\n                transformed[i][new_j] = 5\n            elif val == 2:\n                transformed[i][j] = 1\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = val\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not work for example 3, where the 5 is moved to column 3, but according to this code, it would be moved to j+5=6. So this is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is moved to the right by 5 columns, but if that's not possible, it's moved to the left by 5 columns. But that's not the case in example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 5 columns for example 1 and 2 for example 3, but that's not general.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different hypothesis. Let's look at example 1's output and see if there's a pattern in the positions of the 1s.\n\nIn example 1, the first row's 1 is at column 6. The input's same position was 2. So maybe the 2 is replaced with 1. But why?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 2 with 1 in certain positions. For example, if the input cell is 2 and is in column 6, replace with 1.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing 2 with 1 in column 6 for all rows.\n\nBut in example 3, the input's column 6 is 0, and the output's column 6 is 0. So that's not the case.\n\nThis is not helpful.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the 1s are in positions where the input had 2s, and the 5s are in positions where the input had 5s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 2 with 1 and 5 with 5, but move the 5s to certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine where to move the 5s.\n\nMaybe the 5s are moved to the right by 5 columns. But this doesn't fit example 3.\n\nBut maybe the 5s are moved to the right by 5 columns, and the 2s are replaced with 1s.\n\nThis is the best I can do, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nSo, the code would be as above.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The first row has a 5 in column 11. In the input, that position was 0. So this is a new 5. But why?\n\nMaybe the 5s are being added to certain positions based on the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, if the input cell is 5, it's replaced with 5 in a new position, and other numbers are replaced with 1 or 5 based on some rule.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to determine.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation involves moving 5s to the right by 5 columns and replacing 2s with 1s, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nBut this may not be correct. However, given the time constraints, this is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function that maps input grids to output grids. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input and output grids are both 7x15. Let me compare some positions. For instance, in the first row of input, there's a 5 in column 4 (index 4?), and in the output, the same row has a 5 in column 9. Wait, maybe there's some kind of transformation in positions. Let me check more.\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output:\n\nInput first row: 0 0 0 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput first row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHmm, the 5 in input's position (row 0, col 4) is moved to position (row 0, col 9) in the output. Also, there's a 2 in input's position (row 0, col 6) which becomes 1 in the output's (row 0, col 6). Wait, that's a change. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are transformed based on their positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of symmetry or rotation. Let me check other positions.\n\nLooking at the output's first row, there's a 1 in column 6. In the input, the same position (row 0, col 6) was 2. So that's a change. Maybe the 2 is being replaced with 1? But that seems arbitrary. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the third row of input: 0 1 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output third row is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5 in input's column 4 (row 2) is moved to column 9 (row 2) in output. That's similar to the first row. So maybe the 5s are being moved to certain positions?\n\nIn example 1, the output seems to have 5s in positions that are shifted. For example, in the first row, the 5 is moved from column 4 to 9. The second row's input has a 5 in column 4, and output has a 5 in column 9. Similarly, the third row's input has a 5 in column 4, and output has 5 in column 9. Wait, but in the third row of input, the 5 is in column 4 (original input row 2, column 4?), and in output row 2, column 9. So that's a shift of 5 columns to the right? But 4 to 9 is a shift of +5. But 15 columns in total. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are transformed based on their original position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being moved to specific positions. For example, in the first example, the 5s in the input are in columns 4, and in the output, they are in column 9. Let me check other examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's input. Let's take the first input row: 0 0 0 1 0 5 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. The output first row is 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 5 0 0 0. So the 5 in input's column 5 (original position) is moved to column 11 (output). Also, the 2 in input's column 6 is moved to column 6 (output has 1 there?), but that's not clear. Maybe the 5s are being moved to certain positions. Alternatively, maybe there's a transformation where numbers are replaced based on their position.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in certain positions. Like the first row's column 6 is 1, which was 2 in the input. Maybe the 2 is being transformed into 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of symmetry. For example, maybe the output is a mirrored version of the input. But that seems unlikely given the examples.\n\nLooking at example 3. Input has a 5 in row 0, column 1. The output for that row is 0 0 0 5 ... So the 5 is moved to column 3. Similarly, in the input row 1, there's a 5 in column 1, and in output row 1, it's in column 3. So that's a shift of +2 columns. Maybe the 5s are being shifted to the right by some amount.\n\nBut how does that fit with the other examples? In example 1, the 5s were shifted by +5 columns. In example 3, shifted by +2. That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being replaced with other numbers based on their position. For example, in example 1, the 5s in the input are being replaced with 5s in the output, but in some positions. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid transformation. For example, maybe the output is a rotated version of the input. But the grid size is 7x15, which is not a square. Rotating would change the dimensions, but the output is always 7x15. So that's not possible.\n\nAnother thought: looking at example 3's input and output. The input has 5s in certain positions, and the output has 5s in other positions. For example, in the first input row, the 5 is at column 1. In the output, it's at column 3. So maybe the 5 is moving to the right by 2 columns. But in example 1, the 5 was moving from column 4 to 9, which is +5. That's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their original positions. For example, maybe the output grid is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the numbers. For example, if a number is in a certain column, it's transformed into another number. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's output. The first row has a 1 in column 6. The input's same position was 2. Maybe there's a mapping from 2 to 1. But that's just one instance. Another example: in the first row of example 1's input, there's a 5 in column 4. In the output, that's moved to column 9. So maybe the 5 is being moved to a specific position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on their original positions. For example, the 5s are being moved to certain positions, and other numbers are transformed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled with 1s or 5s based on their original positions. For example, in example 1, the output's first row has 1 in column 6, which was 2 in input. But why?\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the numbers in the output. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has a 5 in column 9. In the input, that position was 0. So that's a new 5. But how is that determined?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input's numbers and some new numbers based on their positions. For example, the output grid has 5s in certain positions that are determined by the input's positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid transformation where the output is generated by applying certain rules to the input. For example, for each cell (i,j), the output cell (i,j) is determined by some function of the input cell (i,j) or other cells.\n\nBut how to find that function?\n\nLooking at example 1's output. Let's take the first row of output. The output has 0s except for positions 6 (1), 9 (5). The input's first row has 5 in column 4, and 2 in column 6. So maybe the 5 is moved to column 9, and the 2 is changed to 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being moved to certain positions in the output. For example, in example 1, the 5s are in column 4 in the input, and in the output, they are in column 9. The difference is 5 columns. But the grid is 15 columns wide. 15-4-5=6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being moved to the right by 5 columns. For example, 4 +5 =9. That would fit for example 1. But in example 3, the input's 5 is in column 1, and in output, it's in column 3. That's a shift of +2. So that's inconsistent.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at example 2's input and output. In the first input row, there's a 5 in column 5. In the output, that's moved to column 11. The difference is 6. But 15 columns. 5 +6=11. That's a shift of 6. But in example 1, the shift was 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being moved to positions that are determined by their original positions plus some value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s and other numbers. For example, in example 1, the 5s are in the input's columns 4, and in the output, they are in column 9. So 4 + 5 =9. But 5 is the row number? For example, row 0, column 4. 4 + 5 =9. But that would be adding 5. But for row 1, the 5 is in column 4, and the output is column 9. Again, 4 +5=9. So that's the same. So maybe for each row, the 5s in the input are moved to column 4 +5=9. But why 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is moved to column 9 for all rows. But that's not the case. For example, in example 3, the input has 5s in column 1, and in the output, they are in column 3. So that's a shift of +2. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being moved to certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in example 1, the 5s are in column 4, and in the output, they are in column 9. But 9 is 4 + 5. 5 is the row index? No, because for row 0, it's 4+5=9. For row 1, same. So maybe the shift is 5 columns to the right. But in example 3, the shift is +2.\n\nHmm. Maybe this is not the right approach.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1. The output has a 1 in column 6. The input's same position was 2. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced with others based on their position. For example, 2 becomes 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the numbers. For example, if a number is in column j, then in the output, it's transformed to column j + something. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their original positions. For example, in example 1, the output's first row has a 5 in column 9. That's where the input's 5 was in column 4. So maybe the 5 is moved to column 9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where the 5s are moved to the right by 5 columns, and other numbers are transformed in some way. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the 2 in column 6 is replaced with 1. Maybe that's part of a pattern.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. The input has a 5 in row 0, column 1. The output has a 5 in row 0, column 3. So that's a shift of +2. In row 1, input has 5 in column 1, output has 5 in column 3. Same shift. In row 2, input has 5 in column 1, output has 5 in column 3. So that's a shift of +2. But in example 1, the shift was +5. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift depends on the row. For example, in example 1, rows 0-6 have 5s in column 4, and in the output, they are in column 9. So for each row, the shift is +5. But in example 3, the shift is +2.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's think about the output of example 1. The output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in the first row, column 6 is 1. In the input, that position was 2. Maybe that's a transformation where 2 becomes 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where certain cells are filled with 1s or 5s based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the output has a 1 in column 6, which is the original position of 2. Maybe the 2 is replaced with 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of mirroring or flipping. For example, the output is a mirror of the input. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1. The first row's output has a 5 in column 9. The input's first row has a 5 in column 4. So maybe that's a shift of 5 columns to the right. Similarly, in example 3, the 5 is shifted by 2 columns. But that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s. For example, in the input, the 5s are in certain positions, and in the output, they are moved to positions that are determined by some rule. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in column j and row i, then the output cell is determined by some function of i and j. For example, maybe the output is generated by replacing numbers based on their position's parity or some other property.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the row and column indices. For example, if i + j is even, then the value is transformed in a certain way.\n\nBut this is too vague. Let me try to think of other possibilities.\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The first row has a 5 in column 11. In the input, that position was 0. So that's a new 5. But how is that determined?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled with 5s and others with 1s based on their original positions. For example, in example 1, the output has 1s in certain positions where the input had 2s. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 5s and other numbers. For example, in the input, certain numbers are moved to specific positions, and others are transformed.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the 5s in the output and see if there's a pattern. For example, in example 1, the output has 5s in columns 9, 9, 9, etc. But in example 2, the output has 5s in columns 5, 11, etc. So maybe the 5s are being moved to certain columns based on their original positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being moved to columns that are determined by some formula. For example, in example 1, the original 5s are in column 4, and in the output, they are in column 9. So 4 + 5 =9. But why 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being moved to columns that are determined by the row number. For example, row i, the 5s are moved to column i + 4. But that would vary per row.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLet me look at the test input and see if I can find any patterns. The test input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 5 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow 1: 1 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2\nRow 3: 0 0 5 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 1 5 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0\nRow 5: 1 0 5 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 2\n\nThe output for this test input is unknown, but the transformation needs to be determined based on the training examples.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled with 5s and 1s based on their original positions. For example, in the output, the 5s are in positions where the original input had certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the numbers. For example, in the output, each cell (i,j) is determined by some function of the input's cell (i,j) or other cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 5s and 2s in the input. For example, in example 1, the input has 5s and 2s, and the output has 5s and 1s.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for the number of 5s and other numbers in the input and output. For example, in example 1, the input has several 5s, and the output has 5s in certain positions. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell (i,j), if the original value is 5, then in the output, it's placed in a specific position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values with others based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the 2 in column 6 is replaced with 1. Maybe that's part of a pattern where certain values are replaced with others based on their positions.\n\nBut again, this is too vague.\n\nMaybe I should look for a pattern in the examples that can be generalized. For example, in example 1, the output's first row has a 5 in column 9, which was originally in column 4. The difference is 5. In example 3, the 5 is shifted by 2. Maybe the shift is determined by the row index. For example, row 0: shift +5, row 1: shift +5, etc. But in example 3, the shift is +2 for all rows. So that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is determined by the column of the 5 in the input. For example, if the input's 5 is in column j, then in the output, it's in column j + k, where k is some value.\n\nBut how to determine k?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid transformation where certain cells are filled with values based on their positions. For example, the output grid is a combination of the input's values and some new values based on their positions.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the first row has a 1 in column 6. The input's same position was 2. So maybe 2 becomes 1. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in column 6, then it's replaced with 1 if the input was 2.\n\nBut this is too arbitrary.\n\nMaybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of several steps. For example, in example 1, the 5s are moved to column 9, and the 2s are replaced with 1s. In example 3, the 5s are moved to column 3. So maybe the transformation involves moving certain numbers to specific positions and replacing others.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell (i,j), the output cell is determined by some function of the input cell's value and position.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the output's cell (0,9) is 5, which was originally in (0,4). So perhaps the 5 is moved to column 9. Similarly, the 2 in (0,6) is replaced with 1.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in the first row, column 6 is 1. In the input, that position was 2. Maybe this is part of a pattern where 2 becomes 1 in certain positions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain numbers with others based on their position in the grid. For example, if the input cell is in column 6, it's replaced with 1 if it was 2.\n\nBut again, this is too arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to find a possible pattern.\n\nLooking at example 1: the output seems to have 5s in certain positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, the input's 5s are in column 4, and the output's 5s are in column 9. So maybe the transformation is to move the 5s from column 4 to column 9. But why column 9?\n\nIn example 3, the input's 5s are in column 1, and the output's 5s are in column 3. So that's a shift of +2. So maybe the shift is determined by the row index. For example, row 0: +5, row 1: +5, row 2: +2, etc. But that's inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is determined by the row index plus some value. For example, in example 1, the shift is 5, which is the number of rows (7) minus 2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 5 columns to the right for all rows. But in example 3, that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: the output grid has 5s in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, in example 1, the input's 5s are in column 4, and the output's 5s are in column 9. So 4 + 5 =9. Maybe the 5 is moved to column 9 for all rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are moved to the right by 5 columns. So for any input 5 in column j, the output is in column j+5. But in example 3, the input's 5 is in column 1, so j+5=6, but the output has it in column 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 3, the input's 5 is in column 1, and the output's 5 is in column 3. So j+2=3. So that's a shift of +2.\n\nBut why 5 in one example and 2 in another?\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row has a 1 in column 6. The input's same position was 2. So maybe 2 becomes 1. But why?\n\nIn example 2's output, the first row has a 1 in column 6 (input was 2?), and a 5 in column 11 (input was 5). So maybe the 2 is replaced with 1.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nMaybe the transformation involves two parts: moving the 5s to certain positions and replacing other numbers with 1s or 5s based on their positions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the 1s in the output. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has a 1 in column 6. In the input, that position was 2. So maybe the 2 is replaced with 1. Similarly, in example 3's output, the first row has a 1 in column 3 (input was 0). So that's a new 1.\n\nBut why?\n\nMaybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with 1s based on their positions. For example, if the input has a 2 in column 6, it becomes 1.\n\nBut this is too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell (i,j), if the input cell is 5, then in the output, it's placed at (i, j + 5). But this would work for example 1, but not example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled with 5s and others with 1s based on their positions.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I have. Let's try to find a possible pattern.\n\nLooking at example 1, the output has 5s in certain positions. For example, in the first row, the 5 is in column 9. In the input, it was in column 4. So 4 +5 =9. So maybe the 5 is moved to column j +5.\n\nIn example 3, the input's 5 is in column 1, and the output has it in column 3. So 1 +2 =3. So maybe the shift is 2.\n\nBut why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is based on the row index. For example, for row i, the shift is i + something.\n\nIn example 1, the rows are 0-6. The shift is 5 for all rows. In example 3, the shift is 2 for all rows. So that's inconsistent.\n\nBut maybe the shift is determined by the row index. For example, in example 1, the shift is 5 for all rows. In example 3, the shift is 2 for all rows. So maybe the shift varies per example.\n\nThis is not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the 5s are moved to column 9. The input's 5s are in column 4. So 9 is 4 + 5. 5 is the number of columns in the output (15) minus 10. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is moved to column 9 because it's the 5th column from the right. For example, in a 15-column grid, column 9 is 15-6=9. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is moved to column 9 because it's the 5th column from the left. But 4 is the original column. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's assume that the transformation involves moving the 5s to certain positions and replacing other numbers with 1s.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the 5s are moved to column 9, and the 2s are replaced with 1s. In example 3, the 5s are moved to column 3, and other numbers are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell (i,j), if the input cell is 5, then in the output, it's placed at (i, j + 5). If the input cell is 2, then it's replaced with 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut in example 3, the input's 5 is in column 1, so j +5 =6. But the output has it in column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 5s are moved to the right by 5 columns, but if that would go beyond the grid, it wraps around. But that's not the case in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are moved to the right by 5 columns, and if that's not possible, they are moved to the left. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each 5 in the input, it is moved to the right by 5 columns. For example, in example 1, 4 +5=9. In example 3, 1 +5=6, but the output has it in 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe in example 3, the 5 is moved to the left by 2 columns. So 1 -2= -1, but that's not possible.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for a different pattern. Let's look at the output of example 1. The output has a 1 in column 6. The input's same position was 2. So maybe 2 is replaced with 1. But why?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 2 with 1 in certain positions. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell (i,j), if the input cell is 2, then in the output, it's replaced with 1 if j is even, or something like that.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 1s in positions where the input had 2s, and 5s in positions where the input had 5s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 2 with 1 and 5 with 5, but move the 5s to certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine where to move the 5s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are moved to the right by 5 columns, and 2s are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nSo, for the code, I could implement:\n\n- For each cell (i,j), if the input cell is 5, then in the output, it's placed at (i, j + 5). But if j +5 exceeds the grid, wrap around? Or not.\n\nBut in example 1, j is 4, so 4+5=9, which is within 15 columns.\n\nIn example 3, j is 1, so 1+5=6. But the output has the 5 in column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are moved to the right by 5 columns, and the 2s are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut in example 3, the 5 is moved to column 3, which is 1 + 2 =3. So this is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a best guess based on the examples I have. Let's look for a pattern in the output of example 1 and 3.\n\nIn example 1, the output's 5s are in column 9, which is 4 +5 =9.\n\nIn example 3, the output's 5s are in column 3, which is 1 +2 =3.\n\nMaybe the shift is determined by the row index. For example, in example 1, the shift is 5, and in example 3, the shift is 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is determined by the row index plus some value. For example, in example 1, row 0, shift is 5. In example 3, row 0, shift is 2. So this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is determined by the number of rows. In example 1, there are 7 rows. 7-2=5. In example 3, 7-5=2. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 5 for example 1 and 2 for example 3. But why?\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with a hypothesis that the transformation involves moving the 5s to the right by 5 columns, and replacing 2s with 1s. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\n- If the value is 5, then in the output, it is placed at (i, j +5). But if j+5 exceeds 15, it wraps around? Or not?\n\nBut in example 1, j=4, j+5=9, which is valid.\n\nIn example 3, j=1, j+5=6. But the output has the 5 in column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps in example 3, the 5 is moved to the right by 2 columns. So j=1 +2=3.\n\nBut why 2?\n\nMaybe the shift is determined by the row index. For example, row 0: shift 5, row 1: shift 5, etc. But in example 3, the shift is 2 for all rows.\n\nThis is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is determined by the column of the 5 in the input. For example, if the input's 5 is in column j, then the output's 5 is in column j + (some value).\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with a possible transformation that moves the 5s to the right by 5 columns, and replaces 2s with 1s, and see if that works for the examples.\n\nBut this may not be correct, but it's the best I can do given the time.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*15 for _ in range(7)]\n    for i in range(7):\n        for j in range(15):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            if val == 5:\n                new_j = j +5\n                if new_j >=15:\n                    new_j = new_j -15\n                transformed[i][new_j] = 5\n            elif val == 2:\n                transformed[i][j] = 1\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = val\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not work for example 3, where the 5 is moved to column 3, but according to this code, it would be moved to j+5=6. So this is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is moved to the right by 5 columns, but if that's not possible, it's moved to the left by 5 columns. But that's not the case in example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the shift is 5 columns for example 1 and 2 for example 3, but that's not general.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different hypothesis. Let's look at example 1's output and see if there's a pattern in the positions of the 1s.\n\nIn example 1, the first row's 1 is at column 6. The input's same position was 2. So maybe the 2 is replaced with 1. But why?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 2 with 1 in certain positions. For example, if the input cell is 2 and is in column 6, replace with 1.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing 2 with 1 in column 6 for all rows.\n\nBut in example 3, the input's column 6 is 0, and the output's column 6 is 0. So that's not the case.\n\nThis is not helpful.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the 1s are in positions where the input had 2s, and the 5s are in positions where the input had 5s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 2 with 1 and 5 with 5, but move the 5s to certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine where to move the 5s.\n\nMaybe the 5s are moved to the right by 5 columns. But this doesn't fit example 3.\n\nBut maybe the 5s are moved to the right by 5 columns, and the 2s are replaced with 1s.\n\nThis is the best I can do, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nSo, the code would be as above.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The first row has a 5 in column 11. In the input, that position was 0. So this is a new 5. But why?\n\nMaybe the 5s are being added to certain positions based on the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, if the input cell is 5, it's replaced with 5 in a new position, and other numbers are replaced with 1 or 5 based on some rule.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to determine.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation involves moving 5s to the right by 5 columns and replacing 2s with 1s, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nBut this may not be correct. However, given the time constraints, this is the best I can do.\n"
