          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. Let's start with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some 2s and 1s in certain positions. The output seems to have some changes. For instance, looking at the third row of the input, there are 2s in positions 2 and 7 (assuming 0-based index). The output for that row has 2s in the same positions. But then, looking at the fifth row of the input, there are 1s in positions 3 and 4, and 5 and 6. The output for that row has 1s in positions 3 and 4, but also 1s in positions 5 and 6? Wait, the output row for example 1's fifth row is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. So there's a 1 in positions 4, 9, 10, and 15. Hmm, maybe there's some kind of expansion or pattern where certain cells are replaced or modified based on their neighbors.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has 2s and 1s. The output seems to have some 2s and 0s. For instance, in the input's second row, there are 2s in positions 1 and 6. The output for that row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. So the 2s are in the same positions. But in other rows, like the third row of the input, there are 1s in positions 2 and 3, and the output has 0s there. Wait, maybe there's some kind of transformation where certain patterns are replaced or modified based on their position.\n\nAnother thing to note: the output grids for all examples have the same dimensions as the input. The input is 13x19, and the output is also 13x19. So the function needs to process a 13x19 grid and return a 13x19 grid.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has some 2s and 1s. The output seems to have 2s in the same positions, but some 1s are replaced with 0s. For example, in the input's third row, there's a 1 in position 7, but in the output, that position is 0. So maybe there's a rule where certain cells are turned into 0s if they are in certain positions or surrounded by certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern matching. For example, if a cell is part of a certain shape, it's replaced with another value. Or maybe it's based on the presence of certain numbers in adjacent cells.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 0s in certain positions where the input had 1s. For example, in the fourth row of the input, there's a 1 in position 3 and 4. The output for that row has 0s in those positions. Wait, no. Let me check again. The input's fourth row is 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 1s in positions 3 and 16 are turned into 0s. But in the fifth row of the input, there are 1s in positions 3,4, and then 9,10. The output for that row has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. So maybe there's some kind of expansion or contraction based on the positions of the 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of symmetry or mirroring. For example, in Example 2, the input's third row has 0s and 1s. The output for that row is all 0s. But in the fourth row of the input, there are 1s in positions 2 and 3, and the output has 1s in positions 2 and 3. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again. The input's fourth row is 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0. So the 1s in positions 2,3, and 13 are replaced with 0s in some positions, but others are kept. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in specific positions. For example, if a cell is a 2, it's kept. If it's a 1, it's replaced with 0s in certain positions. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the input has 2s in certain positions, and the output has 2s in the same positions. But the 1s in the input are being replaced with 0s in some cases. But in Example 2, the output has 2s in the same positions as the input, but some 1s are replaced with 0s.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the second row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. So the 2s are in the same positions. But in the third row of the input, the values are 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So all the 1s are turned into 0s. That's interesting. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain patterns. For instance, if a cell is part of a 2x2 square with 1s, then replace them with 0s. Or maybe if there's a horizontal line of 1s, they are replaced with 0s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's turned into 0. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input's third row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 1 in position 7 is turned into 0. But in the fourth row of the input, there are 1s in positions 1 and 2, and the output has 1s in positions 2 and 3. Wait, maybe the transformation is to replace certain patterns. For example, if there's a 1 adjacent to a 2, then it's replaced with 0. Or maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s in certain positions based on their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions relative to other numbers. For example, if a 1 is surrounded by 2s, then it's replaced. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are part of a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row of the input has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. The output for that row has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. So maybe the 1s are being expanded or contracted based on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of erosion or dilation. For example, if a cell is a 1, it's turned into 0 if it's part of a certain shape, but if it's part of a larger shape, it's kept. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 0s in certain positions where the input had 1s. For example, the fourth row of the input has 1s in positions 3 and 16, but the output has 0s there. However, in the fifth row of the input, the 1s are in positions 3,4,9,10, and the output has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. So maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions, but not others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 2s. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 2, it's turned into 0. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row of the output has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. But the input's fifth row had 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. So maybe the 1s are being shifted or modified based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is part of a horizontal line of 1s, they are turned into 0s. But in Example 1's fifth row, there are 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. The output has 1s in 4,9,10, and 15. So maybe the 1s in positions 3 and 15 are replaced with 0s, but the others are kept.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can be generalized across all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the output for the third row is all 0s. The input for that row was 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0. So the 1s are in positions 2,3,13,14. The output is all 0s. So maybe any 1s that are in certain positions (like in the middle of the row) are turned into 0s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are surrounded by 2s. For example, in Example 2's third row, the 1s are between 2s in the input. But in the input, the third row is part of a larger structure. Wait, the input's second row has 2s in positions 1,6,11. The third row has 1s in positions 2,3,13,14. Maybe the 1s are between 2s, so they are replaced with 0s. But in Example 1, the third row has 2s in positions 2 and 7, and the output has the same 2s. So maybe the 2s are kept, but 1s are replaced if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, the output's fifth row has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. But the input's fifth row has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. So maybe the 1s in positions 3 and 15 are replaced with 0s, but the others are kept. How?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from the nearest 2. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 2, it's turned into 0. But in Example 1's third row, there are 2s in positions 2 and 7. The 1s in positions 3 and 7 (wait, no, the third row of the input is 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0. The 2s are in positions 2,7,12,17. The output's third row is the same as the input. So maybe the 2s are kept, and 1s are replaced if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 2, the third row's 1s are replaced with 0s. But in other rows, like the fourth row of the input, the 1s are kept. So maybe the pattern is based on the row number or column number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions relative to the 2s. For example, if a 1 is in a row where there's a 2 in the same row, then it's replaced. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in the same row as a 2. For example, in Example 2's third row, there are 1s, but the second row has 2s. So maybe the third row's 1s are replaced. But in Example 1's third row, there are 2s, and the output has the same 2s. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 2, 7, etc., but that's not clear.\n\nLooking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row of the output has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. But the input's fifth row has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. So the 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0, but the 1 in position 15 is kept. That doesn't fit a simple pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 1s in a row. For example, if a row has more than one 1, then replace them with 0s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows 3, 5, 7, etc. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions relative to the 2s. For example, in the input, if a cell is a 1 and is adjacent to a 2, then it's replaced with 0. Let's check Example 1's fifth row. The input's fifth row has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. The output has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. So the 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0. But why? Maybe because it's adjacent to a 2. Let's look at the input's fifth row: the input is 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. The 1 in position 3 is adjacent to 0s. So that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the 1s in positions 3 and 15 are replaced with 0s. But in the output, the 1 in position 15 is kept. So that's not consistent.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look for patterns in the outputs.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 0s in certain positions where the input had 1s, but some 1s are kept. For example, in the fifth row of the input, the 1s in positions 3,4,9,10 are transformed into 0, 1, 1, 1. So maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions, but not others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 2s in certain positions. For example, if a cell is in the same row as a 2, then it's replaced with 0. But in Example 1's third row, there are 2s, and the output has the same 2s, but the 1s are replaced with 0s. Wait, but the third row of the input has 2s in positions 2,7,12,17. The output for that row is the same. So maybe the 2s are kept, and 1s are replaced if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the 1s in positions 3 and 15 are replaced with 0s. But in the output, the 1 in position 15 is kept. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows 4, 5, 6, etc. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s in certain positions where the cell is part of a horizontal line of 1s. For example, in Example 2's third row, there are 1s in positions 2,3,13,14. The output is all 0s. So maybe if there are two consecutive 1s in a row, they are replaced with 0s. But in Example 1's fifth row, there are 1s in positions 3,4, which are consecutive, and they are replaced with 0 and 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is part of a diagonal line or a certain shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows where the row number is odd. Let's check:\n\nExample 1's output for row 4 is all 0s. The input's row 4 has 1s. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 2, 7, etc. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions based on their coordinates. For example, if the row number is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions relative to the 2s. For example, if a 1 is directly to the left or right of a 2, it's replaced with 0. Let's check Example 1's fifth row. The input's fifth row has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. The output has 1s in 4,9,10, and 15. So maybe the 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0 because it's adjacent to a 2. But in the input, the fifth row is 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. The 1 in position 3 is adjacent to 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of operations. For example, in Example 1, the output has some 1s replaced with 0s, but others are kept. Maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the cell is part of a 2x2 square of 1s. Or maybe it's based on the presence of 2s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, rows where the row index is odd. Let's check Example 1's output: the output has 0s in rows 4, 5, 6, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row of the output has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. The input's fifth row has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. So the 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0, but the 1 in position 15 is kept. So maybe the 1s are replaced if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 3, but not 15. This doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the sum of the row and column indices is even. For example, row 4, column 3: 4+3=7, which is odd. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions based on the presence of 2s in neighboring cells. For example, if a cell is a 1 and has a 2 in the same row or column, it's replaced with 0. Let's check Example 1's fifth row: the input has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. The 2s are in positions 2,7,12,17. So the 1 in position 3 is adjacent to 0s. The 1 in position 4 is adjacent to 1s. So maybe not.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. Maybe I should try to find a transformation that works for at least some of the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output for the third row is the same as the input. So the 2s are kept, and the 1s are replaced with 0s. But in Example 2, the third row's 1s are replaced with 0s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the row is odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows 3, 5, 7, etc. Let's check:\n\nExample 1's output for row 3 is the same as input. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 2, 7, etc. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output in the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's fourth row has 1s in positions 3 and 16. The output has 0s there. The fifth row of input has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. The output has 1s in 4,9,10, and 15. So the 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0, but the 1 in position 15 is kept. This suggests that the transformation is not based on a simple rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the cell is part of a certain pattern. For example, if there's a 2 in the same row, then replace the 1s with 0s. But in Example 1's third row, there are 2s, but the output has the same 2s, and the 1s are replaced with 0s. So maybe that's the case. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are between two 2s in the same row. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the 1s in positions 3 and 4 are between 0s and 0s, so they are replaced. But the 1s in positions 9 and 10 are between 0s and 0s, but they are kept. This doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look for a pattern that could explain some of the transformations.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for the fifth row has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. The input's fifth row has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. So the 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0, and the 1 in position 15 is kept. This suggests that the transformation might be based on the position of the cell relative to other cells.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for the fifth row has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. These positions are in the middle of the row. Maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions, like the first or last few columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows 4,5,6, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 3, 15. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in positions where the row index is even or odd. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is row 4 (assuming 0-based index), which is even. But the output has some 1s and 0s. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the column index is even. For example, column 3 is odd, but the 1 in position 3 is replaced. This is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for at least some of the examples. For example, in Example 2, the third row's 1s are replaced with 0s. The input's third row has 1s in positions 2,3,13,14. The output is all 0s. So maybe any 1s that are in certain rows are replaced. But in Example 1's third row, the 2s are kept, and the 1s are replaced. But in Example 1's third row, there are no 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the cell is part of a vertical line. For example, in Example 2's third row, the 1s are in positions 2 and 3, which are adjacent, and they are replaced. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an assumption. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the cell is adjacent to a 2. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row, the 1 in position 3 is adjacent to 0s, so it's replaced with 0. The 1 in position 4 is adjacent to 1s, so it's kept. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows where the row number is even. Let's check:\n\nExample 1's output for row 4 (0-based index 3) is all 0s. The input's row 4 has 1s. So that's possible. But for row 5 (index 4), the output has 1s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 2, 7, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I think I need to make a hypothesis. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the cell is part of a 2x2 square with 1s. Or maybe it's to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions based on their row and column indices.\n\nAnother idea: in Example 1, the output for the fifth row has 1s in positions 4,9,10,15. These positions are at the middle of the row. Maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in the first half of the row. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is part of a horizontal line of 1s, but not part of a vertical line. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a best guess. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, replace 1s with 0s if they are in rows 3, 5, 7, etc. Or columns 2, 7, 12, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the row number is odd. For example, in Example 1's fifth row (row index 4, which is even), the output has some 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs and see if there's a pattern in the positions where 1s are kept. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the 1s in positions 4,9,10,15 are kept. These positions are at positions where the column index is even or odd. For example, 4 is even, 9 is odd, 10 is even, 15 is odd. So maybe it's not based on that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the column index is divisible by 3. For example, 3, 6, 9, etc. But in Example 1's fifth row, position 3 is replaced, but 9 is kept. So that doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, replace 1s with 0s if they are in columns 2, 7, 12, etc. Let's check Example 1's fifth row. The 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0, but position 9 is kept. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows where the row index is odd. Let's check Example 1's output for row 4 (index 3, which is odd). The output is all 0s. In Example 1's fifth row (index 4, even), the output has some 1s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I'll have to make a hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the cell is part of a 2x2 square with 1s. Or perhaps it's based on the presence of 2s in certain positions.\n\nBut since I can't see the pattern, I'll have to write a function that replaces 1s with 0s in certain positions. For example, replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in the same row as a 2. Let's try this.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, there are 2s, and the output has the same 2s. So the 1s in this row are replaced with 0s. In Example 2's third row, there are 1s, but the second row has 2s. So the third row's 1s are replaced with 0s. This seems to fit.\n\nSo the hypothesis is: replace 1s with 0s if they are in the same row as a 2.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nExample 1's input has 2s in rows 2, 6, 8, 12, etc. So any row that has a 2 will have its 1s replaced with 0s. Let's check Example 1's third row: it has 2s, so the 1s are replaced with 0s. But in the input's third row, there are no 1s. So that's okay.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row, the input has 1s. But the fifth row has no 2s. So the 1s should remain. But in the output, some of the 1s are replaced with 0s. So this hypothesis doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is not working. Maybe the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAnother idea: replace 1s with 0s if they are in the same column as a 2.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row, the 1 in position 3 is in column 3. The input's third row has 2s in column 2, 7, etc. So if the column has a 2, then replace 1s with 0s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 2, 7, 12, etc.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row, the 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0, but position 9 is kept. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that replaces 1s with 0s in certain positions. For example, replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns. Since I can't find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an assumption.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows 3, 5, 7, etc. Let's try this.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for row 3 is the same as input. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 2, 7, 12, etc.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row, the 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0, but position 9 is kept. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a function that replaces 1s with 0s in certain positions based on the examples. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row has 1s replaced in certain positions, but not others. Maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the row is even or odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the row index is even. Let's check.\n\nExample 1's output for row 4 (index 3, which is odd) has 0s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I'll have to write a function that replaces 1s with 0s in certain positions, but I'm not sure. Given that, I'll have to make a guess. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns, and keep them otherwise.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output for the fifth row has 1s in positions 4,9,10,15. These positions are in the middle of the row. Maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the column is not in a certain range.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, this is just a guess. I'll proceed with a function that replaces 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions, like in the middle of the row.\n\nBut how to implement this? Maybe the function checks if the cell is a 1 and if it's in a certain position, like in the middle of the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows 4, 5, 6, etc.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given the time constraints, I'll have to write a function that replaces 1s with 0s in certain positions, based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is the one I need to process, perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s in certain positions. For example, in the test input's fifth row, there are 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. The output for that row would have 0s in those positions, but the example is not provided.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a function that replaces 1s with 0s in certain positions. For example, if the cell is a 1 and is in a row that has a 2, then replace it with 0. Or if the cell is a 1 and is in a column that has a 2.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's try to write a function that replaces 1s with 0s if they are in the same row as a 2.\n\nHere's the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Check if there is a 2 in the same row\n                if any(grid[i][k] == 2 for k in range(len(grid[0]))):\n                    transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, there are 2s. So all 1s in that row would be replaced with 0s. But the input's third row has no 1s, so the output is the same. For the fifth row, there are no 2s in that row, so 1s are not replaced. But in the output, some 1s are replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: replace 1s with 0s if they are in the same column as a 2.\n\nLet's try that.\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Check if there is a 2 in the same column\n                for k in range(len(grid)):\n                    if grid[k][j] == 2:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 0\n                        break\n    return transformed\n\nTesting this with Example 1's fifth row: if there is a 2 in the same column as any 1 in the fifth row.\n\nFor example, in the fifth row, the 1 in position 3 (column 3). Let's check if any row has a 2 in column 3. Looking at the input for Example 1, the third row has 2 in column 2, 7, etc. So column 3 has 0 in the third row. The fifth row's column 3 has 1. So if there is a 2 in column 3, then replace. But in the input, there are no 2s in column 3. So this would not replace the 1. But in the output, it is replaced. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns, and keep them otherwise. For example, in Example 1, the output for the fifth row has 1s in positions 4,9,10,15. These positions are in the middle of the row. Maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the row and column indices are both even or both odd.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the cell is part of a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is part of a diagonal line.\n\nBut without more information, I can't determine this.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a function that replaces 1s with 0s in certain positions. For example, in the test input, the fifth row has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. The output for that row has 0s in those positions. So maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows 4,5,6, etc.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with a function that replaces 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, replace 1s with 0s if they are in rows 4,5,6, etc.\n\nBut this is just a guess. The code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Replace if in certain rows or columns\n                if i in [4,5,6] or j in [2,7,12]:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess and may not work for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 2,7,12.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach, even though it may not be correct.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. Let's start with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some 2s and 1s in certain positions. The output seems to have some changes. For instance, looking at the third row of the input, there are 2s in positions 2 and 7 (assuming 0-based index). The output for that row has 2s in the same positions. But then, looking at the fifth row of the input, there are 1s in positions 3 and 4, and 5 and 6. The output for that row has 1s in positions 3 and 4, but also 1s in positions 5 and 6? Wait, the output row for example 1's fifth row is 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. So there's a 1 in positions 4, 9, 10, and 15. Hmm, maybe there's some kind of expansion or pattern where certain cells are replaced or modified based on their neighbors.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has 2s and 1s. The output seems to have some 2s and 0s. For instance, in the input's second row, there are 2s in positions 1 and 6. The output for that row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. So the 2s are in the same positions. But in other rows, like the third row of the input, there are 1s in positions 2 and 3, and the output has 0s there. Wait, maybe there's some kind of transformation where certain patterns are replaced or modified based on their position.\n\nAnother thing to note: the output grids for all examples have the same dimensions as the input. The input is 13x19, and the output is also 13x19. So the function needs to process a 13x19 grid and return a 13x19 grid.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has some 2s and 1s. The output seems to have 2s in the same positions, but some 1s are replaced with 0s. For example, in the input's third row, there's a 1 in position 7, but in the output, that position is 0. So maybe there's a rule where certain cells are turned into 0s if they are in certain positions or surrounded by certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern matching. For example, if a cell is part of a certain shape, it's replaced with another value. Or maybe it's based on the presence of certain numbers in adjacent cells.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 0s in certain positions where the input had 1s. For example, in the fourth row of the input, there's a 1 in position 3 and 4. The output for that row has 0s in those positions. Wait, no. Let me check again. The input's fourth row is 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 1s in positions 3 and 16 are turned into 0s. But in the fifth row of the input, there are 1s in positions 3,4, and then 9,10. The output for that row has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. So maybe there's some kind of expansion or contraction based on the positions of the 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of symmetry or mirroring. For example, in Example 2, the input's third row has 0s and 1s. The output for that row is all 0s. But in the fourth row of the input, there are 1s in positions 2 and 3, and the output has 1s in positions 2 and 3. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again. The input's fourth row is 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0. The output's fourth row is 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0. So the 1s in positions 2,3, and 13 are replaced with 0s in some positions, but others are kept. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain numbers in specific positions. For example, if a cell is a 2, it's kept. If it's a 1, it's replaced with 0s in certain positions. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the input has 2s in certain positions, and the output has 2s in the same positions. But the 1s in the input are being replaced with 0s in some cases. But in Example 2, the output has 2s in the same positions as the input, but some 1s are replaced with 0s.\n\nWait, in Example 2's input, the second row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. So the 2s are in the same positions. But in the third row of the input, the values are 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So all the 1s are turned into 0s. That's interesting. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain patterns. For instance, if a cell is part of a 2x2 square with 1s, then replace them with 0s. Or maybe if there's a horizontal line of 1s, they are replaced with 0s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's turned into 0. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input's third row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 1 in position 7 is turned into 0. But in the fourth row of the input, there are 1s in positions 1 and 2, and the output has 1s in positions 2 and 3. Wait, maybe the transformation is to replace certain patterns. For example, if there's a 1 adjacent to a 2, then it's replaced with 0. Or maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s in certain positions based on their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions relative to other numbers. For example, if a 1 is surrounded by 2s, then it's replaced. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are part of a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row of the input has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. The output for that row has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. So maybe the 1s are being expanded or contracted based on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of erosion or dilation. For example, if a cell is a 1, it's turned into 0 if it's part of a certain shape, but if it's part of a larger shape, it's kept. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 0s in certain positions where the input had 1s. For example, the fourth row of the input has 1s in positions 3 and 16, but the output has 0s there. However, in the fifth row of the input, the 1s are in positions 3,4,9,10, and the output has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. So maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions, but not others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 2s. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 2, it's turned into 0. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row of the output has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. But the input's fifth row had 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. So maybe the 1s are being shifted or modified based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is part of a horizontal line of 1s, they are turned into 0s. But in Example 1's fifth row, there are 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. The output has 1s in 4,9,10, and 15. So maybe the 1s in positions 3 and 15 are replaced with 0s, but the others are kept.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can be generalized across all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the output for the third row is all 0s. The input for that row was 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0. So the 1s are in positions 2,3,13,14. The output is all 0s. So maybe any 1s that are in certain positions (like in the middle of the row) are turned into 0s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are surrounded by 2s. For example, in Example 2's third row, the 1s are between 2s in the input. But in the input, the third row is part of a larger structure. Wait, the input's second row has 2s in positions 1,6,11. The third row has 1s in positions 2,3,13,14. Maybe the 1s are between 2s, so they are replaced with 0s. But in Example 1, the third row has 2s in positions 2 and 7, and the output has the same 2s. So maybe the 2s are kept, but 1s are replaced if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, the output's fifth row has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. But the input's fifth row has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. So maybe the 1s in positions 3 and 15 are replaced with 0s, but the others are kept. How?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from the nearest 2. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 2, it's turned into 0. But in Example 1's third row, there are 2s in positions 2 and 7. The 1s in positions 3 and 7 (wait, no, the third row of the input is 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0. The 2s are in positions 2,7,12,17. The output's third row is the same as the input. So maybe the 2s are kept, and 1s are replaced if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 2, the third row's 1s are replaced with 0s. But in other rows, like the fourth row of the input, the 1s are kept. So maybe the pattern is based on the row number or column number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions relative to the 2s. For example, if a 1 is in a row where there's a 2 in the same row, then it's replaced. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in the same row as a 2. For example, in Example 2's third row, there are 1s, but the second row has 2s. So maybe the third row's 1s are replaced. But in Example 1's third row, there are 2s, and the output has the same 2s. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 2, 7, etc., but that's not clear.\n\nLooking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row of the output has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. But the input's fifth row has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. So the 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0, but the 1 in position 15 is kept. That doesn't fit a simple pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 1s in a row. For example, if a row has more than one 1, then replace them with 0s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows 3, 5, 7, etc. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions relative to the 2s. For example, in the input, if a cell is a 1 and is adjacent to a 2, then it's replaced with 0. Let's check Example 1's fifth row. The input's fifth row has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. The output has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. So the 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0. But why? Maybe because it's adjacent to a 2. Let's look at the input's fifth row: the input is 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. The 1 in position 3 is adjacent to 0s. So that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the 1s in positions 3 and 15 are replaced with 0s. But in the output, the 1 in position 15 is kept. So that's not consistent.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look for patterns in the outputs.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 0s in certain positions where the input had 1s, but some 1s are kept. For example, in the fifth row of the input, the 1s in positions 3,4,9,10 are transformed into 0, 1, 1, 1. So maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions, but not others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 2s in certain positions. For example, if a cell is in the same row as a 2, then it's replaced with 0. But in Example 1's third row, there are 2s, and the output has the same 2s, but the 1s are replaced with 0s. Wait, but the third row of the input has 2s in positions 2,7,12,17. The output for that row is the same. So maybe the 2s are kept, and 1s are replaced if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the 1s in positions 3 and 15 are replaced with 0s. But in the output, the 1 in position 15 is kept. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows 4, 5, 6, etc. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s in certain positions where the cell is part of a horizontal line of 1s. For example, in Example 2's third row, there are 1s in positions 2,3,13,14. The output is all 0s. So maybe if there are two consecutive 1s in a row, they are replaced with 0s. But in Example 1's fifth row, there are 1s in positions 3,4, which are consecutive, and they are replaced with 0 and 1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions relative to other cells. For example, if a cell is part of a diagonal line or a certain shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows where the row number is odd. Let's check:\n\nExample 1's output for row 4 is all 0s. The input's row 4 has 1s. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 2, 7, etc. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions based on their coordinates. For example, if the row number is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions relative to the 2s. For example, if a 1 is directly to the left or right of a 2, it's replaced with 0. Let's check Example 1's fifth row. The input's fifth row has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. The output has 1s in 4,9,10, and 15. So maybe the 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0 because it's adjacent to a 2. But in the input, the fifth row is 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0. The 1 in position 3 is adjacent to 0s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tricky. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of operations. For example, in Example 1, the output has some 1s replaced with 0s, but others are kept. Maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the cell is part of a 2x2 square of 1s. Or maybe it's based on the presence of 2s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, rows where the row index is odd. Let's check Example 1's output: the output has 0s in rows 4, 5, 6, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row of the output has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. The input's fifth row has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. So the 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0, but the 1 in position 15 is kept. So maybe the 1s are replaced if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 3, but not 15. This doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the sum of the row and column indices is even. For example, row 4, column 3: 4+3=7, which is odd. So maybe that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions based on the presence of 2s in neighboring cells. For example, if a cell is a 1 and has a 2 in the same row or column, it's replaced with 0. Let's check Example 1's fifth row: the input has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. The 2s are in positions 2,7,12,17. So the 1 in position 3 is adjacent to 0s. The 1 in position 4 is adjacent to 1s. So maybe not.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. Maybe I should try to find a transformation that works for at least some of the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output for the third row is the same as the input. So the 2s are kept, and the 1s are replaced with 0s. But in Example 2, the third row's 1s are replaced with 0s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the row is odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows 3, 5, 7, etc. Let's check:\n\nExample 1's output for row 3 is the same as input. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 2, 7, etc. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output in the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's fourth row has 1s in positions 3 and 16. The output has 0s there. The fifth row of input has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. The output has 1s in 4,9,10, and 15. So the 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0, but the 1 in position 15 is kept. This suggests that the transformation is not based on a simple rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the cell is part of a certain pattern. For example, if there's a 2 in the same row, then replace the 1s with 0s. But in Example 1's third row, there are 2s, but the output has the same 2s, and the 1s are replaced with 0s. So maybe that's the case. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are between two 2s in the same row. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the 1s in positions 3 and 4 are between 0s and 0s, so they are replaced. But the 1s in positions 9 and 10 are between 0s and 0s, but they are kept. This doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look for a pattern that could explain some of the transformations.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for the fifth row has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. The input's fifth row has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. So the 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0, and the 1 in position 15 is kept. This suggests that the transformation might be based on the position of the cell relative to other cells.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for the fifth row has 1s in positions 4,9,10, and 15. These positions are in the middle of the row. Maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions, like the first or last few columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows 4,5,6, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 3, 15. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in positions where the row index is even or odd. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row is row 4 (assuming 0-based index), which is even. But the output has some 1s and 0s. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the column index is even. For example, column 3 is odd, but the 1 in position 3 is replaced. This is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for at least some of the examples. For example, in Example 2, the third row's 1s are replaced with 0s. The input's third row has 1s in positions 2,3,13,14. The output is all 0s. So maybe any 1s that are in certain rows are replaced. But in Example 1's third row, the 2s are kept, and the 1s are replaced. But in Example 1's third row, there are no 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the cell is part of a vertical line. For example, in Example 2's third row, the 1s are in positions 2 and 3, which are adjacent, and they are replaced. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an assumption. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the cell is adjacent to a 2. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row, the 1 in position 3 is adjacent to 0s, so it's replaced with 0. The 1 in position 4 is adjacent to 1s, so it's kept. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows where the row number is even. Let's check:\n\nExample 1's output for row 4 (0-based index 3) is all 0s. The input's row 4 has 1s. So that's possible. But for row 5 (index 4), the output has 1s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 2, 7, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I think I need to make a hypothesis. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the cell is part of a 2x2 square with 1s. Or maybe it's to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions based on their row and column indices.\n\nAnother idea: in Example 1, the output for the fifth row has 1s in positions 4,9,10,15. These positions are at the middle of the row. Maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in the first half of the row. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the cell is in a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is part of a horizontal line of 1s, but not part of a vertical line. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a best guess. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, replace 1s with 0s if they are in rows 3, 5, 7, etc. Or columns 2, 7, 12, etc.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the row number is odd. For example, in Example 1's fifth row (row index 4, which is even), the output has some 1s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs and see if there's a pattern in the positions where 1s are kept. For example, in Example 1's fifth row, the 1s in positions 4,9,10,15 are kept. These positions are at positions where the column index is even or odd. For example, 4 is even, 9 is odd, 10 is even, 15 is odd. So maybe it's not based on that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the column index is divisible by 3. For example, 3, 6, 9, etc. But in Example 1's fifth row, position 3 is replaced, but 9 is kept. So that doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, replace 1s with 0s if they are in columns 2, 7, 12, etc. Let's check Example 1's fifth row. The 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0, but position 9 is kept. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows where the row index is odd. Let's check Example 1's output for row 4 (index 3, which is odd). The output is all 0s. In Example 1's fifth row (index 4, even), the output has some 1s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I'll have to make a hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the cell is part of a 2x2 square with 1s. Or perhaps it's based on the presence of 2s in certain positions.\n\nBut since I can't see the pattern, I'll have to write a function that replaces 1s with 0s in certain positions. For example, replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in the same row as a 2. Let's try this.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, there are 2s, and the output has the same 2s. So the 1s in this row are replaced with 0s. In Example 2's third row, there are 1s, but the second row has 2s. So the third row's 1s are replaced with 0s. This seems to fit.\n\nSo the hypothesis is: replace 1s with 0s if they are in the same row as a 2.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nExample 1's input has 2s in rows 2, 6, 8, 12, etc. So any row that has a 2 will have its 1s replaced with 0s. Let's check Example 1's third row: it has 2s, so the 1s are replaced with 0s. But in the input's third row, there are no 1s. So that's okay.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row, the input has 1s. But the fifth row has no 2s. So the 1s should remain. But in the output, some of the 1s are replaced with 0s. So this hypothesis doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is not working. Maybe the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAnother idea: replace 1s with 0s if they are in the same column as a 2.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row, the 1 in position 3 is in column 3. The input's third row has 2s in column 2, 7, etc. So if the column has a 2, then replace 1s with 0s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 2, 7, 12, etc.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row, the 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0, but position 9 is kept. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that replaces 1s with 0s in certain positions. For example, replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns. Since I can't find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an assumption.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows 3, 5, 7, etc. Let's try this.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for row 3 is the same as input. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 2, 7, 12, etc.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row, the 1 in position 3 is replaced with 0, but position 9 is kept. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a function that replaces 1s with 0s in certain positions based on the examples. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row has 1s replaced in certain positions, but not others. Maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the row is even or odd.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the row index is even. Let's check.\n\nExample 1's output for row 4 (index 3, which is odd) has 0s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I'll have to write a function that replaces 1s with 0s in certain positions, but I'm not sure. Given that, I'll have to make a guess. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns, and keep them otherwise.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output for the fifth row has 1s in positions 4,9,10,15. These positions are in the middle of the row. Maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the column is not in a certain range.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, this is just a guess. I'll proceed with a function that replaces 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions, like in the middle of the row.\n\nBut how to implement this? Maybe the function checks if the cell is a 1 and if it's in a certain position, like in the middle of the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows 4, 5, 6, etc.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given the time constraints, I'll have to write a function that replaces 1s with 0s in certain positions, based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is the one I need to process, perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s in certain positions. For example, in the test input's fifth row, there are 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. The output for that row would have 0s in those positions, but the example is not provided.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a function that replaces 1s with 0s in certain positions. For example, if the cell is a 1 and is in a row that has a 2, then replace it with 0. Or if the cell is a 1 and is in a column that has a 2.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's try to write a function that replaces 1s with 0s if they are in the same row as a 2.\n\nHere's the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Check if there is a 2 in the same row\n                if any(grid[i][k] == 2 for k in range(len(grid[0]))):\n                    transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, there are 2s. So all 1s in that row would be replaced with 0s. But the input's third row has no 1s, so the output is the same. For the fifth row, there are no 2s in that row, so 1s are not replaced. But in the output, some 1s are replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: replace 1s with 0s if they are in the same column as a 2.\n\nLet's try that.\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Check if there is a 2 in the same column\n                for k in range(len(grid)):\n                    if grid[k][j] == 2:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 0\n                        break\n    return transformed\n\nTesting this with Example 1's fifth row: if there is a 2 in the same column as any 1 in the fifth row.\n\nFor example, in the fifth row, the 1 in position 3 (column 3). Let's check if any row has a 2 in column 3. Looking at the input for Example 1, the third row has 2 in column 2, 7, etc. So column 3 has 0 in the third row. The fifth row's column 3 has 1. So if there is a 2 in column 3, then replace. But in the input, there are no 2s in column 3. So this would not replace the 1. But in the output, it is replaced. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns, and keep them otherwise. For example, in Example 1, the output for the fifth row has 1s in positions 4,9,10,15. These positions are in the middle of the row. Maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the row and column indices are both even or both odd.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions where the cell is part of a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is part of a diagonal line.\n\nBut without more information, I can't determine this.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a function that replaces 1s with 0s in certain positions. For example, in the test input, the fifth row has 1s in positions 3,4,9,10. The output for that row has 0s in those positions. So maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows. For example, rows 4,5,6, etc.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with a function that replaces 1s with 0s if they are in certain rows or columns. For example, replace 1s with 0s if they are in rows 4,5,6, etc.\n\nBut this is just a guess. The code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Replace if in certain rows or columns\n                if i in [4,5,6] or j in [2,7,12]:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 0\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess and may not work for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 0s if they are in certain columns. For example, columns 2,7,12.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this approach, even though it may not be correct.\n"
