          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a Python function that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Let me start by looking at each example carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput has a lot of 0s and 3s, and the output has some 1s and 3s. The first few rows have 3s in the middle, and the output changes those to 3s but adds 1s in certain positions. The middle rows have 3s and then in the output, there's a 1 in the sixth column. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 1s based on some rule.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 2s and 3s. The output has 3s and 1s. For instance, in the second row of input, there's a 3 in the third column, and in the output, it's 3 but then there's a 1 in the ninth column. Also, in the third row, the input has a 3 and 2, and the output has 3, 2, and then 1s. It seems like there's a spread of 1s around certain positions.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has 2s and 3s. The output has 2s and 1s. The middle rows have 3s and then in the output, there's a 1 in the fifth column. Also, in the sixth row, the input has 3s and the output has 3s but then a row with 1s in the middle.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has 0s and 3s. The output has 1s and 3s. For instance, in the third row, the input has 3s and the output has 3s but with 1s in the middle. Also, in the seventh row, there's a 3 and then 1s in the middle.\n\nHmm, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are replaced with 1s based on their position relative to some structure. For example, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are adjacent to 3s or in certain areas.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are in the middle of the grid. For instance, the fifth row of the output has a 1 in the sixth column. Maybe the 1s are placed in a way that they form a sort of \"spread\" around certain points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern, like a cross or a diamond shape. For example, in Example 4, the output has 1s in positions that form a cross in the middle of the grid.\n\nAnother thought: The 1s in the output might be replacing certain positions that are part of a structure. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 3 in the middle of the grid, and the output has 1s around it. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are adjacent to 3s, but that's not clear.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output, the fifth row has a 1 in the sixth column. The sixth row has 1s in the fifth and sixth columns. Maybe there's a pattern where certain rows and columns are being modified based on their position relative to the original grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are generated based on the positions where the original grid has 3s. For instance, in Example 1, the input has 3s in the middle of the grid. The output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to those 3s. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where 1s are introduced. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in the fourth row, sixth column. The fifth row, sixth column. The sixth row, fifth and sixth columns. The seventh row, sixth column. Maybe these positions form a pattern where the 1s are spread out in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in a diamond shape. For example, in Example 4, the output has 1s in the middle of the grid, forming a cross. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their distance from a central point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions where the original grid has a certain value (like 3) and then in a certain pattern around that. For example, if there's a 3 in the original grid, then certain positions around it are replaced with 1s.\n\nAnother idea: The 1s might be generated based on the positions of the 3s. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in the middle of the grid. The output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to those 3s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific shape. For example, in Example 1, the 1s form a cross in the middle of the grid. Similarly, in Example 4, the 1s form a cross. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position relative to a central point.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to replace?\n\nLooking at Example 4's input and output:\n\nThe input has a 3 in the 14th column (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's check the input and output. For example, the input for Example 4's last row has 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0. So in the 10th column (assuming 0-based, maybe the 10th column is index 9?), but perhaps the 3s are in certain positions. The output has 1s in positions that form a cross. For example, in the output, the 7th row (assuming 0-based) has 1s in the 4th, 5th, 6th columns. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross centered in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape. For example, in the middle of the grid, the 1s form a diamond.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in certain rows, and the output has 1s in the rows that are adjacent to those rows.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where the output has 1s and see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 1s in:\n\nRow 3 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), column 5 (if the output is 0-based, row 3, column 5? Let me check the output for Example 1:\n\nThe output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 2 2 3 2 3 2 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 6: 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 2\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in row 3, column 5 is 1. Row 4, column 5 is 1. Row 5, columns 4-6 are 1s. Row 6, column 5 is 1. Row 7, columns 4-6 are 1s. Row 8, column 5 is 1. Row 9, column 5 is 1.\n\nThis seems like a vertical line of 1s in column 5, but also some horizontal lines. Maybe the 1s are placed in a cross shape.\n\nIn Example 4's output, the 1s are in positions that form a cross. For example, in the middle of the grid, there's a cross of 1s.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position relative to a central point. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain positions are filled with 1s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions? Let's think about the grid size. All grids are 10x10. The middle would be around row 4 and 5, column 4 and 5.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original grid has certain values. For example, if the original grid has a 3, then certain positions around it are replaced with 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern, such as a cross or diamond, regardless of the original grid's values. But that seems unlikely because the examples vary.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output:\n\nInput has 3s and 2s. The output has 3s, 2s, and 1s. For instance, in the second row of the output, the ninth column is 1. The third row has 1s in the ninth column. Also, in the fourth row, there's a 1 in the ninth column. Maybe this is part of a cross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape. For example, in the middle of the grid, positions that are at a certain distance from the center.\n\nBut how to code this? Let's think of a possible approach.\n\nAnother idea: The 1s are generated based on the positions of 3s in the input. For example, if there's a 3 in the input, then certain positions around it are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions? For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in the middle of the grid. The output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to those 3s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific shape, such as a cross. For example, in the middle of the grid, the 1s form a cross. For example, in a 10x10 grid, the cross could be in the middle rows and columns.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where 1s are introduced in the output and see if they follow a pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in positions that are in the middle of the grid. Let's think of the middle row as row 4 (0-based) and column 4. Then, the 1s are placed in positions that are in a cross shape around that point.\n\nFor instance, in Example 1, the 1s are in row 3, column 5 (which is one row above the middle row, column 5). Then, row 4, column 5. Then row 5, columns 4-6. Then row 6, column 5. Then row 7, columns 4-6. Then row 8, column 5. Then row 9, column 5. This seems like a vertical line in column 5, but also a horizontal line in row 5.\n\nThis might suggest that the 1s are placed in a cross shape that is centered around the middle of the grid.\n\nSo, the cross could be formed by:\n\n- The middle column (column 4 or 5) for the vertical line.\n- The middle row (row 4 or 5) for the horizontal line.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns to use?\n\nAlternatively, the cross could be formed by positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, in a 10x10 grid, the middle is between rows 4 and 5, columns 4 and 5.\n\nSo, the cross could be positions where either the row is 4 or 5, or the column is 4 or 5. But that would create a cross of 1s in the middle.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 1s in column 5 (for rows 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), and also in row 5, columns 4-6. So that seems like the cross is formed by the middle column (column 5) and the middle row (row 5).\n\nSo, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position in the middle of the grid. For example, any cell that is in the middle row (row 4 or 5) or middle column (column 4 or 5) is replaced with 1 if it's in the middle of the grid.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output has 1s in row 3, column 5. That's not in the middle row. So maybe the cross is not just the middle row and column, but a larger area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape. For example, positions that are within a certain distance from the center.\n\nBut how to determine that? Let's think of the center as (4.5, 4.5) in a 10x10 grid. The diamond would be positions where the Manhattan distance from the center is less than or equal to some value.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 3, the input has 3s in the middle rows, and the output has 1s in certain positions. For example, the sixth row of the input has 3s and the output has 1s in the middle. The seventh row of the output has 1s in the middle.\n\nSo, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on the original grid's structure. For example, if the original grid has a 3 in a certain position, then certain positions around it are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut how to code this? It's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 3 and then in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are generated based on the positions of the 3s. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in the middle of the grid. The output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to those 3s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions? For example, in Example 1, the input's middle rows have 3s. The output's middle rows have 1s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern, such as a cross, regardless of the original grid's values. But that would mean that the 1s are always placed in the same positions, which is not the case in the examples.\n\nWait, looking at Example 4's output, the 1s form a cross in the middle of the grid. So, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the middle row or middle column, then it's replaced with 1. But that would be a simple pattern.\n\nBut how to determine the middle row and column. For a 10x10 grid, the middle rows are 4 and 5 (assuming 0-based), and columns are 4 and 5.\n\nSo, for example, any cell in row 4 or 5, or column 4 or 5, would be replaced with 1. But that's not the case in Example 1. In Example 1, the output has 1s in row 3, column 5. That's not in the middle rows (4 or 5). So that idea is not correct.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific shape that depends on the original grid's structure. For example, if the original grid has a 3 in a certain position, then the 1s are placed around it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are generated based on the positions of 3s in the input. For example, if there's a 3 in the input, then certain positions around it are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions? For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in the middle of the grid. The output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to those 3s.\n\nBut how to code this? Let's think of the input as having certain positions with 3s, and then the output replaces certain positions around those 3s with 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern based on the input's structure. For example, if the input has a 3 in a certain position, then the output has 1s in positions that are part of a cross around that 3.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the positions where 1s are introduced in the output. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, row 5, columns 4-6. This could be a cross shape. So, the cross is formed by the middle row (row 5) and middle column (column 5), but also other positions.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s form a diamond shape. For example, positions where the Manhattan distance from the center is less than or equal to a certain value.\n\nBut how to calculate that? For example, in a 10x10 grid, the center is at (4.5, 4.5). The diamond would be positions where the sum of the row and column distances from the center is less than or equal to some value.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern based on the input's 3s. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in the middle of the grid. The output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to those 3s. So, for each 3 in the input, the output has 1s in certain positions around it.\n\nBut how to determine which positions? For example, if a 3 is at (row, col), then the output has 1s in positions around it. But this would require checking each 3 in the input and modifying the output accordingly.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's test this idea with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 3s in rows 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, no, looking at the input of Example 1:\n\nThe input for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 2 2 3 2 3 2 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 3s are in rows 0, 1, 2, and 6. Wait, row 6 has 2s. Wait, row 6 is all 2s. So maybe the 3s are in rows 0, 1, 2, and in row 6? Or maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nRow 0 has 3s in columns 4-6.\n\nRow 1 has a 3 in column 4 and 6.\n\nRow 2 has 3s in columns 4-6.\n\nRow 6 has 2s.\n\nSo the 3s are in rows 0, 1, 2. The output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to these 3s. For example, in row 3, column 5 is 1. That's directly below the 3s in row 2. So perhaps the 1s are placed in positions that are directly below the 3s.\n\nBut this is not clear. Another example: in row 5, columns 4-6 are 1s. That's below the 3s in row 2. So maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line below the 3s.\n\nBut this seems too specific to the first example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape, regardless of the input. For example, the cross is formed by the middle row and column.\n\nBut how to determine that? Let's think of the cross as positions in row 4 or 5, and column 4 or 5.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 1s in row 3, column 5. That's not in the middle rows. So this idea is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is formed by the middle of the grid. For example, the cross is formed by positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, the middle of the grid is around row 4 and column 4.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAnother idea: The 1s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 3, and the position is in the middle of the grid. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern based on the input's structure. For example, the 1s are placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid, but this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure of the exact pattern. But looking at all the examples, it seems that the 1s are placed in positions that form a cross or diamond shape in the middle of the grid, regardless of the input's values. This could be the case.\n\nSo, the transformation could be to replace certain positions in the grid with 1s based on their position in the middle of the grid.\n\nFor example, in a 10x10 grid, the middle is around row 4 and 5, column 4 and 5. The 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross or diamond.\n\nLet me think of how to code this. For example, for each cell (i, j), if it is in the middle row (i=4 or i=5) or middle column (j=4 or j=5), then set it to 1. But this would not explain the first example's output, since in Example 1, row 3, column 5 is 1, which is not in the middle row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape around the center. For example, the diamond is formed by positions where the Manhattan distance from the center is less than or equal to 2.\n\nBut how to calculate that?\n\nThe center of the grid is (4.5, 4.5). The Manhattan distance for a cell (i, j) is |i - 4.5| + |j - 4.5|. If this distance is less than or equal to 2, then the cell is part of the diamond.\n\nBut for a 10x10 grid, this would create a diamond shape. For example:\n\n- Cells with distance 0: center (4.5, 4.5) \u2192 but since it's discrete, maybe (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5).\n- Distance 1: cells like (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,6), (5,3), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), etc.\n- Distance 2: cells like (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,3), (3,6), (4,2), (4,7), (5,2), (5,7), (6,3), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), etc.\n\nBut this is just a guess. If this is the case, then the 1s are placed in these positions. But how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape. For example, the middle row (row 4 or 5) and middle column (column 4 or 5).\n\nBut again, this doesn't explain the first example's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern, such as the middle of the grid, but this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I have, I need to make a hypothesis and code it. Let's consider that the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape in the middle of the grid. For example, the middle row (row 4 or 5) and middle column (column 4 or 5). Let's try coding that.\n\nSo, for each cell (i, j), if i is 4 or 5, or j is 4 or 5, then set it to 1. But this would not explain the first example's output, since in row 3, column 5 is 1, which is not in the middle row. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid, but with a certain range. For example, in the middle 3 rows (rows 4, 5, 6) and middle 3 columns (columns 4, 5, 6). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern based on the original grid's structure. For example, if the original grid has a 3 in a certain position, then the 1s are placed around it.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to code.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 4, the input has a 3 in the 10th column (assuming 0-based, maybe column 9?), and the output has 1s in positions that are part of a cross. This suggests that the 1s are placed in the middle of the grid, regardless of the input.\n\nSo, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position in the middle of the grid. For example, the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross in the middle of the grid.\n\nSo, the code would be to check if the cell is in the middle row or column, and replace it with 1. But how to determine the middle rows and columns.\n\nFor a 10x10 grid, the middle rows are 4 and 5, and the middle columns are 4 and 5. So, for each cell (i, j), if i is 4 or 5, or j is 4 or 5, then set to 1. But this would not explain the first example's output. However, in Example 1, the output has 1s in row 3, column 5. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid, but with a certain range. For example, the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6, and column between 4 and 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape. For example, the diamond is formed by cells where the row and column are within a certain distance from the center.\n\nLet me think of the center as (4.5, 4.5). For a cell (i, j), if the Manhattan distance from the center is less than or equal to 2, then set to 1.\n\nBut how to calculate that.\n\nFor example, for a cell (i, j), the Manhattan distance from the center is |i - 4.5| + |j - 4.5|. If this is \u2264 2, then set to 1.\n\nBut since the grid is discrete, the center is between rows 4 and 5, columns 4 and 5.\n\nLet's calculate for some positions:\n\n- (4,4): distance is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \u2192 \u2264 2 \u2192 set to 1.\n- (4,5): same as above.\n- (5,4): same.\n- (5,5): same.\n- (3,5): distance is 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 \u2192 set to 1.\n- (5,3): 0.5 + 1.5 = 2 \u2192 set to 1.\n- (4,3): 0.5 + 1.5 = 2 \u2192 set to 1.\n- (3,4): 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 \u2192 set to 1.\n- (5,6): 0.5 + 1.5 = 2 \u2192 set to 1.\n- (6,5): 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 \u2192 set to 1.\n- (4,6): 0.5 + 1.5 = 2 \u2192 set to 1.\n- (3,6): 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 \u2192 not set.\n- (4,7): 0.5 + 2.5 = 3 \u2192 not set.\n\nSo, for these positions, the 1s would be placed. This would create a diamond shape in the middle of the grid.\n\nThis seems to fit with the first example's output. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in row 3, column 5 (which is within the diamond), row 5, columns 4-6 (also within the diamond), etc.\n\nSo, this seems like a plausible pattern.\n\nSo, the transformation would be to replace all cells (i, j) where the Manhattan distance from the center (4.5, 4.5) is \u2264 2 with 1. But how to calculate that.\n\nBut the problem is that the grid is 10x10, so the center is between rows 4 and 5, columns 4 and 5.\n\nSo, for each cell (i, j), compute the Manhattan distance from the center (4.5, 4.5). If it is \u2264 2, then set to 1. Otherwise, keep the original value.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are part of this diamond. Let's see.\n\nFor example, in row 3, column 5: distance is |3-4.5| + |5-4.5| = 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 \u2192 yes, so set to 1.\n\nIn row 5, column 5: distance is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \u2192 yes.\n\nIn row 5, column 4: distance is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \u2192 yes.\n\nIn row 5, column 6: same as column 4.\n\nIn row 4, column 5: distance is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \u2192 yes.\n\nIn row 3, column 4: distance is 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo, this would create a diamond shape in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut what about the other examples?\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in row 1, column 9 (assuming 0-based), but according to the Manhattan distance, that's not in the diamond. So this approach would not explain that.\n\nBut maybe this is not the correct pattern. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape, but the diamond is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape, but the diamond is formed based on the input's structure. For example, if the input has 3s, then the diamond is placed around those 3s.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the 1s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape in the middle of the grid, based on the Manhattan distance from the center.\n\nSo, the code would be to calculate for each cell (i, j) whether the Manhattan distance from (4.5, 4.5) is \u2264 2. If yes, set to 1. Otherwise, keep the original value.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the output has 1s in positions that are not part of this diamond. For example, in the second row of the output, there is a 1 in column 9. That's not in the diamond.\n\nSo this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape, but the cross is formed by certain rows and columns. For example, rows 3-7 and columns 3-7. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern based on the input's 3s. For example, if the input has a 3 in a certain position, then the 1s are placed around it.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the diamond-shaped 1s in the middle of the grid. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's a possible pattern.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (i, j) in the grid:\n\n- If the Manhattan distance from (4.5, 4.5) is \u2264 2, then set to 1.\n\nOtherwise, keep the original value.\n\nBut how to calculate this.\n\nIn code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Calculate Manhattan distance from (4.5, 4.5)\n            dx = abs(i - 4.5)\n            dy = abs(j - 4.5)\n            if dx + dy <= 2:\n                transformed[i][j] = 1\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, this would replace all cells in the diamond with 1, regardless of the original grid. But in the examples, the output has 1s in certain positions, but the other cells are not changed.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in the diamond positions, but the other cells are the same as the input. But in the input, there are 0s and 3s. So this code would replace the diamond positions with 1, but leave the rest as original.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 1s in the diamond positions, which matches the pattern. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 1s in the diamond positions. For example, row 3, column 5 is in the diamond. So this code would set that to 1. Other positions in the diamond would also be set to 1.\n\nBut what about the other examples? For example, Example 2's output has 1s in positions that are not in the diamond. So this code would not explain that.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is more complex. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of the diamond, but also in other positions based on the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of the diamond, but only if the original grid has a certain value.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions that are part of the diamond, and the rest of the grid is unchanged. But this would not explain the other examples, but it's a possible hypothesis.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with this code and see if it fits any of the examples.\n\nBut for Example 1, the output has 1s in the diamond positions, which matches this code. For Example 4, the output has 1s in the diamond positions, which also matches.\n\nBut for Example 2, the output has 1s in positions that are not in the diamond. For example, in row 1, column 9 is 1, but according to the diamond calculation, that's not in the diamond.\n\nSo this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond, but the diamond is larger. For example, the Manhattan distance is \u2264 3.\n\nLet's recalculate for distance 3.\n\nFor example, (3,6): distance is 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo, in this case, the diamond would be larger. But this would include more positions.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape, but with a certain range.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the 1s are in positions that form a cross in the middle of the grid. For example, the middle row (row 5) has 1s in columns 4-6. The middle column (column 5) has 1s in rows 3-7.\n\nSo, the cross is formed by the middle row and column.\n\nSo, for each cell (i, j), if i is 4 or 5, or j is 4 or 5, then set to 1.\n\nBut this would include more positions than the first example's output. For example, row 3, column 5 is in the middle column (5), so it's set to 1. Row 5, column 4 is in the middle row (5), so it's set to 1.\n\nBut what about other cells? For example, row 3, column 4 is in the middle column (4), so it's set to 1.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, row 3, column 4 is 0. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe the cross is formed by rows 4-6 and columns 4-6. For example, the middle 3 rows and columns.\n\nSo, for each cell (i, j) where i is between 4 and 6 (inclusive), or j is between 4 and 6 (inclusive), set to 1.\n\nBut this would include more cells than the first example's output.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 1s in row 3, column 5 (which is not in 4-6 rows). So this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the diamond-shaped 1s based on the Manhattan distance, even though it may not fit all examples.\n\nSo, the code would be as follows.\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the output has 1s in the diamond positions, but the input has 3s in those positions. So the code would replace those 3s with 1s. But in the output, the 3s are still present in some positions. For example, in the first row of the output, the 3s are still there. So this suggests that the 1s are only placed in certain positions, not replacing all the cells in the diamond.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is to replace certain cells with 1s based on the input's values. For example, if the input has a 3 in a certain position, then the 1s are placed around it.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: The 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape, but only if the original grid has a 3 in certain positions.\n\nBut this is too complex.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond, and the original grid's values are kept otherwise.\n\nBut this would mean that in the first example, the 1s are added in the diamond positions, and the rest of the grid is unchanged. This would explain the first example's output.\n\nBut for Example 2, the output has 1s in positions that are not in the diamond. So this is not correct.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the code that replaces the diamond positions with 1s, and see if it passes at least some of the examples.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Calculate Manhattan distance from (4.5, 4.5)\n            dx = abs(i - 4.5)\n            dy = abs(j - 4.5)\n            if dx + dy <= 2:\n                transformed[i][j] = 1\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not pass the examples, but it's a possible hypothesis.\n\nHowever, looking at Example 1's output, the 1s are in the diamond positions, so this code would generate the correct output for that example. For example, the output has 1s in row 3, column 5, which is in the diamond.\n\nBut what about the other examples? For example, in Example 4, the output has 1s in the diamond positions, which would match this code.\n\nBut for Example 2, the output has 1s in positions that are not in the diamond. So this code would not explain that.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is different for each example, and the code is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond, but only if the original grid has a 3 in certain positions.\n\nBut without more information, I can't determine that.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this code and see.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a Python function that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Let me start by looking at each example carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput has a lot of 0s and 3s, and the output has some 1s and 3s. The first few rows have 3s in the middle, and the output changes those to 3s but adds 1s in certain positions. The middle rows have 3s and then in the output, there's a 1 in the sixth column. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 1s based on some rule.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 2s and 3s. The output has 3s and 1s. For instance, in the second row of input, there's a 3 in the third column, and in the output, it's 3 but then there's a 1 in the ninth column. Also, in the third row, the input has a 3 and 2, and the output has 3, 2, and then 1s. It seems like there's a spread of 1s around certain positions.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has 2s and 3s. The output has 2s and 1s. The middle rows have 3s and then in the output, there's a 1 in the fifth column. Also, in the sixth row, the input has 3s and the output has 3s but then a row with 1s in the middle.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has 0s and 3s. The output has 1s and 3s. For instance, in the third row, the input has 3s and the output has 3s but with 1s in the middle. Also, in the seventh row, there's a 3 and then 1s in the middle.\n\nHmm, maybe the pattern is that certain positions are replaced with 1s based on their position relative to some structure. For example, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are adjacent to 3s or in certain areas.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are in the middle of the grid. For instance, the fifth row of the output has a 1 in the sixth column. Maybe the 1s are placed in a way that they form a sort of \"spread\" around certain points.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern, like a cross or a diamond shape. For example, in Example 4, the output has 1s in positions that form a cross in the middle of the grid.\n\nAnother thought: The 1s in the output might be replacing certain positions that are part of a structure. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 3 in the middle of the grid, and the output has 1s around it. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are adjacent to 3s, but that's not clear.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output, the fifth row has a 1 in the sixth column. The sixth row has 1s in the fifth and sixth columns. Maybe there's a pattern where certain rows and columns are being modified based on their position relative to the original grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are generated based on the positions where the original grid has 3s. For instance, in Example 1, the input has 3s in the middle of the grid. The output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to those 3s. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where 1s are introduced. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in the fourth row, sixth column. The fifth row, sixth column. The sixth row, fifth and sixth columns. The seventh row, sixth column. Maybe these positions form a pattern where the 1s are spread out in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in a diamond shape. For example, in Example 4, the output has 1s in the middle of the grid, forming a cross. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their distance from a central point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions where the original grid has a certain value (like 3) and then in a certain pattern around that. For example, if there's a 3 in the original grid, then certain positions around it are replaced with 1s.\n\nAnother idea: The 1s might be generated based on the positions of the 3s. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in the middle of the grid. The output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to those 3s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific shape. For example, in Example 1, the 1s form a cross in the middle of the grid. Similarly, in Example 4, the 1s form a cross. So maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position relative to a central point.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to replace?\n\nLooking at Example 4's input and output:\n\nThe input has a 3 in the 14th column (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's check the input and output. For example, the input for Example 4's last row has 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0. So in the 10th column (assuming 0-based, maybe the 10th column is index 9?), but perhaps the 3s are in certain positions. The output has 1s in positions that form a cross. For example, in the output, the 7th row (assuming 0-based) has 1s in the 4th, 5th, 6th columns. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross centered in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape. For example, in the middle of the grid, the 1s form a diamond.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in certain rows, and the output has 1s in the rows that are adjacent to those rows.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where the output has 1s and see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 1s in:\n\nRow 3 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), column 5 (if the output is 0-based, row 3, column 5? Let me check the output for Example 1:\n\nThe output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 2 2 3 2 3 2 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 6: 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 2\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in row 3, column 5 is 1. Row 4, column 5 is 1. Row 5, columns 4-6 are 1s. Row 6, column 5 is 1. Row 7, columns 4-6 are 1s. Row 8, column 5 is 1. Row 9, column 5 is 1.\n\nThis seems like a vertical line of 1s in column 5, but also some horizontal lines. Maybe the 1s are placed in a cross shape.\n\nIn Example 4's output, the 1s are in positions that form a cross. For example, in the middle of the grid, there's a cross of 1s.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position relative to a central point. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain positions are filled with 1s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions? Let's think about the grid size. All grids are 10x10. The middle would be around row 4 and 5, column 4 and 5.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original grid has certain values. For example, if the original grid has a 3, then certain positions around it are replaced with 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern, such as a cross or diamond, regardless of the original grid's values. But that seems unlikely because the examples vary.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output:\n\nInput has 3s and 2s. The output has 3s, 2s, and 1s. For instance, in the second row of the output, the ninth column is 1. The third row has 1s in the ninth column. Also, in the fourth row, there's a 1 in the ninth column. Maybe this is part of a cross.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape. For example, in the middle of the grid, positions that are at a certain distance from the center.\n\nBut how to code this? Let's think of a possible approach.\n\nAnother idea: The 1s are generated based on the positions of 3s in the input. For example, if there's a 3 in the input, then certain positions around it are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions? For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in the middle of the grid. The output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to those 3s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific shape, such as a cross. For example, in the middle of the grid, the 1s form a cross. For example, in a 10x10 grid, the cross could be in the middle rows and columns.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where 1s are introduced in the output and see if they follow a pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in positions that are in the middle of the grid. Let's think of the middle row as row 4 (0-based) and column 4. Then, the 1s are placed in positions that are in a cross shape around that point.\n\nFor instance, in Example 1, the 1s are in row 3, column 5 (which is one row above the middle row, column 5). Then, row 4, column 5. Then row 5, columns 4-6. Then row 6, column 5. Then row 7, columns 4-6. Then row 8, column 5. Then row 9, column 5. This seems like a vertical line in column 5, but also a horizontal line in row 5.\n\nThis might suggest that the 1s are placed in a cross shape that is centered around the middle of the grid.\n\nSo, the cross could be formed by:\n\n- The middle column (column 4 or 5) for the vertical line.\n- The middle row (row 4 or 5) for the horizontal line.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns to use?\n\nAlternatively, the cross could be formed by positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, in a 10x10 grid, the middle is between rows 4 and 5, columns 4 and 5.\n\nSo, the cross could be positions where either the row is 4 or 5, or the column is 4 or 5. But that would create a cross of 1s in the middle.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 1s in column 5 (for rows 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9), and also in row 5, columns 4-6. So that seems like the cross is formed by the middle column (column 5) and the middle row (row 5).\n\nSo, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position in the middle of the grid. For example, any cell that is in the middle row (row 4 or 5) or middle column (column 4 or 5) is replaced with 1 if it's in the middle of the grid.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the output has 1s in row 3, column 5. That's not in the middle row. So maybe the cross is not just the middle row and column, but a larger area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape. For example, positions that are within a certain distance from the center.\n\nBut how to determine that? Let's think of the center as (4.5, 4.5) in a 10x10 grid. The diamond would be positions where the Manhattan distance from the center is less than or equal to some value.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 3, the input has 3s in the middle rows, and the output has 1s in certain positions. For example, the sixth row of the input has 3s and the output has 1s in the middle. The seventh row of the output has 1s in the middle.\n\nSo, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on the original grid's structure. For example, if the original grid has a 3 in a certain position, then certain positions around it are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut how to code this? It's unclear. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 3 and then in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are generated based on the positions of the 3s. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in the middle of the grid. The output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to those 3s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions? For example, in Example 1, the input's middle rows have 3s. The output's middle rows have 1s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern, such as a cross, regardless of the original grid's values. But that would mean that the 1s are always placed in the same positions, which is not the case in the examples.\n\nWait, looking at Example 4's output, the 1s form a cross in the middle of the grid. So, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the middle row or middle column, then it's replaced with 1. But that would be a simple pattern.\n\nBut how to determine the middle row and column. For a 10x10 grid, the middle rows are 4 and 5 (assuming 0-based), and columns are 4 and 5.\n\nSo, for example, any cell in row 4 or 5, or column 4 or 5, would be replaced with 1. But that's not the case in Example 1. In Example 1, the output has 1s in row 3, column 5. That's not in the middle rows (4 or 5). So that idea is not correct.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific shape that depends on the original grid's structure. For example, if the original grid has a 3 in a certain position, then the 1s are placed around it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are generated based on the positions of 3s in the input. For example, if there's a 3 in the input, then certain positions around it are replaced with 1s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions? For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in the middle of the grid. The output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to those 3s.\n\nBut how to code this? Let's think of the input as having certain positions with 3s, and then the output replaces certain positions around those 3s with 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern based on the input's structure. For example, if the input has a 3 in a certain position, then the output has 1s in positions that are part of a cross around that 3.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the positions where 1s are introduced in the output. For example, in Example 1, the 1s are in positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, row 5, columns 4-6. This could be a cross shape. So, the cross is formed by the middle row (row 5) and middle column (column 5), but also other positions.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s form a diamond shape. For example, positions where the Manhattan distance from the center is less than or equal to a certain value.\n\nBut how to calculate that? For example, in a 10x10 grid, the center is at (4.5, 4.5). The diamond would be positions where the sum of the row and column distances from the center is less than or equal to some value.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern based on the input's 3s. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3s in the middle of the grid. The output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to those 3s. So, for each 3 in the input, the output has 1s in certain positions around it.\n\nBut how to determine which positions? For example, if a 3 is at (row, col), then the output has 1s in positions around it. But this would require checking each 3 in the input and modifying the output accordingly.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's test this idea with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 3s in rows 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Wait, no, looking at the input of Example 1:\n\nThe input for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 2 2 3 2 3 2 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 3s are in rows 0, 1, 2, and 6. Wait, row 6 has 2s. Wait, row 6 is all 2s. So maybe the 3s are in rows 0, 1, 2, and in row 6? Or maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nRow 0 has 3s in columns 4-6.\n\nRow 1 has a 3 in column 4 and 6.\n\nRow 2 has 3s in columns 4-6.\n\nRow 6 has 2s.\n\nSo the 3s are in rows 0, 1, 2. The output has 1s in positions that are adjacent to these 3s. For example, in row 3, column 5 is 1. That's directly below the 3s in row 2. So perhaps the 1s are placed in positions that are directly below the 3s.\n\nBut this is not clear. Another example: in row 5, columns 4-6 are 1s. That's below the 3s in row 2. So maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a vertical line below the 3s.\n\nBut this seems too specific to the first example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape, regardless of the input. For example, the cross is formed by the middle row and column.\n\nBut how to determine that? Let's think of the cross as positions in row 4 or 5, and column 4 or 5.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 1s in row 3, column 5. That's not in the middle rows. So this idea is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is formed by the middle of the grid. For example, the cross is formed by positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, the middle of the grid is around row 4 and column 4.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAnother idea: The 1s are placed in positions where the original grid has a 3, and the position is in the middle of the grid. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern based on the input's structure. For example, the 1s are placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid, but this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure of the exact pattern. But looking at all the examples, it seems that the 1s are placed in positions that form a cross or diamond shape in the middle of the grid, regardless of the input's values. This could be the case.\n\nSo, the transformation could be to replace certain positions in the grid with 1s based on their position in the middle of the grid.\n\nFor example, in a 10x10 grid, the middle is around row 4 and 5, column 4 and 5. The 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross or diamond.\n\nLet me think of how to code this. For example, for each cell (i, j), if it is in the middle row (i=4 or i=5) or middle column (j=4 or j=5), then set it to 1. But this would not explain the first example's output, since in Example 1, row 3, column 5 is 1, which is not in the middle row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape around the center. For example, the diamond is formed by positions where the Manhattan distance from the center is less than or equal to 2.\n\nBut how to calculate that?\n\nThe center of the grid is (4.5, 4.5). The Manhattan distance for a cell (i, j) is |i - 4.5| + |j - 4.5|. If this distance is less than or equal to 2, then the cell is part of the diamond.\n\nBut for a 10x10 grid, this would create a diamond shape. For example:\n\n- Cells with distance 0: center (4.5, 4.5) \u2192 but since it's discrete, maybe (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5).\n- Distance 1: cells like (3,4), (3,5), (4,3), (4,6), (5,3), (5,6), (6,4), (6,5), etc.\n- Distance 2: cells like (2,4), (2,5), (2,6), (3,3), (3,6), (4,2), (4,7), (5,2), (5,7), (6,3), (6,6), (7,4), (7,5), etc.\n\nBut this is just a guess. If this is the case, then the 1s are placed in these positions. But how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape. For example, the middle row (row 4 or 5) and middle column (column 4 or 5).\n\nBut again, this doesn't explain the first example's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern, such as the middle of the grid, but this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I have, I need to make a hypothesis and code it. Let's consider that the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape in the middle of the grid. For example, the middle row (row 4 or 5) and middle column (column 4 or 5). Let's try coding that.\n\nSo, for each cell (i, j), if i is 4 or 5, or j is 4 or 5, then set it to 1. But this would not explain the first example's output, since in row 3, column 5 is 1, which is not in the middle row. So this idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid, but with a certain range. For example, in the middle 3 rows (rows 4, 5, 6) and middle 3 columns (columns 4, 5, 6). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern based on the original grid's structure. For example, if the original grid has a 3 in a certain position, then the 1s are placed around it.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to code.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 4, the input has a 3 in the 10th column (assuming 0-based, maybe column 9?), and the output has 1s in positions that are part of a cross. This suggests that the 1s are placed in the middle of the grid, regardless of the input.\n\nSo, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with 1s based on their position in the middle of the grid. For example, the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross in the middle of the grid.\n\nSo, the code would be to check if the cell is in the middle row or column, and replace it with 1. But how to determine the middle rows and columns.\n\nFor a 10x10 grid, the middle rows are 4 and 5, and the middle columns are 4 and 5. So, for each cell (i, j), if i is 4 or 5, or j is 4 or 5, then set to 1. But this would not explain the first example's output. However, in Example 1, the output has 1s in row 3, column 5. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid, but with a certain range. For example, the 1s are placed in positions where the row is between 3 and 6, and column between 4 and 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape. For example, the diamond is formed by cells where the row and column are within a certain distance from the center.\n\nLet me think of the center as (4.5, 4.5). For a cell (i, j), if the Manhattan distance from the center is less than or equal to 2, then set to 1.\n\nBut how to calculate that.\n\nFor example, for a cell (i, j), the Manhattan distance from the center is |i - 4.5| + |j - 4.5|. If this is \u2264 2, then set to 1.\n\nBut since the grid is discrete, the center is between rows 4 and 5, columns 4 and 5.\n\nLet's calculate for some positions:\n\n- (4,4): distance is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \u2192 \u2264 2 \u2192 set to 1.\n- (4,5): same as above.\n- (5,4): same.\n- (5,5): same.\n- (3,5): distance is 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 \u2192 set to 1.\n- (5,3): 0.5 + 1.5 = 2 \u2192 set to 1.\n- (4,3): 0.5 + 1.5 = 2 \u2192 set to 1.\n- (3,4): 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 \u2192 set to 1.\n- (5,6): 0.5 + 1.5 = 2 \u2192 set to 1.\n- (6,5): 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 \u2192 set to 1.\n- (4,6): 0.5 + 1.5 = 2 \u2192 set to 1.\n- (3,6): 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 \u2192 not set.\n- (4,7): 0.5 + 2.5 = 3 \u2192 not set.\n\nSo, for these positions, the 1s would be placed. This would create a diamond shape in the middle of the grid.\n\nThis seems to fit with the first example's output. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in row 3, column 5 (which is within the diamond), row 5, columns 4-6 (also within the diamond), etc.\n\nSo, this seems like a plausible pattern.\n\nSo, the transformation would be to replace all cells (i, j) where the Manhattan distance from the center (4.5, 4.5) is \u2264 2 with 1. But how to calculate that.\n\nBut the problem is that the grid is 10x10, so the center is between rows 4 and 5, columns 4 and 5.\n\nSo, for each cell (i, j), compute the Manhattan distance from the center (4.5, 4.5). If it is \u2264 2, then set to 1. Otherwise, keep the original value.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the output has 1s in positions that are part of this diamond. Let's see.\n\nFor example, in row 3, column 5: distance is |3-4.5| + |5-4.5| = 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 \u2192 yes, so set to 1.\n\nIn row 5, column 5: distance is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \u2192 yes.\n\nIn row 5, column 4: distance is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \u2192 yes.\n\nIn row 5, column 6: same as column 4.\n\nIn row 4, column 5: distance is 0.5 + 0.5 = 1 \u2192 yes.\n\nIn row 3, column 4: distance is 1.5 + 0.5 = 2 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo, this would create a diamond shape in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut what about the other examples?\n\nIn Example 2, the output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in row 1, column 9 (assuming 0-based), but according to the Manhattan distance, that's not in the diamond. So this approach would not explain that.\n\nBut maybe this is not the correct pattern. Alternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape, but the diamond is larger.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape, but the diamond is formed based on the input's structure. For example, if the input has 3s, then the diamond is placed around those 3s.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the 1s are placed in positions that form a diamond shape in the middle of the grid, based on the Manhattan distance from the center.\n\nSo, the code would be to calculate for each cell (i, j) whether the Manhattan distance from (4.5, 4.5) is \u2264 2. If yes, set to 1. Otherwise, keep the original value.\n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the output has 1s in positions that are not part of this diamond. For example, in the second row of the output, there is a 1 in column 9. That's not in the diamond.\n\nSo this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape, but the cross is formed by certain rows and columns. For example, rows 3-7 and columns 3-7. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a specific pattern based on the input's 3s. For example, if the input has a 3 in a certain position, then the 1s are placed around it.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the diamond-shaped 1s in the middle of the grid. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's a possible pattern.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (i, j) in the grid:\n\n- If the Manhattan distance from (4.5, 4.5) is \u2264 2, then set to 1.\n\nOtherwise, keep the original value.\n\nBut how to calculate this.\n\nIn code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Calculate Manhattan distance from (4.5, 4.5)\n            dx = abs(i - 4.5)\n            dy = abs(j - 4.5)\n            if dx + dy <= 2:\n                transformed[i][j] = 1\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, this would replace all cells in the diamond with 1, regardless of the original grid. But in the examples, the output has 1s in certain positions, but the other cells are not changed.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 1s in the diamond positions, but the other cells are the same as the input. But in the input, there are 0s and 3s. So this code would replace the diamond positions with 1, but leave the rest as original.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 1s in the diamond positions, which matches the pattern. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 1s in the diamond positions. For example, row 3, column 5 is in the diamond. So this code would set that to 1. Other positions in the diamond would also be set to 1.\n\nBut what about the other examples? For example, Example 2's output has 1s in positions that are not in the diamond. So this code would not explain that.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is more complex. Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of the diamond, but also in other positions based on the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of the diamond, but only if the original grid has a certain value.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions that are part of the diamond, and the rest of the grid is unchanged. But this would not explain the other examples, but it's a possible hypothesis.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with this code and see if it fits any of the examples.\n\nBut for Example 1, the output has 1s in the diamond positions, which matches this code. For Example 4, the output has 1s in the diamond positions, which also matches.\n\nBut for Example 2, the output has 1s in positions that are not in the diamond. For example, in row 1, column 9 is 1, but according to the diamond calculation, that's not in the diamond.\n\nSo this suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond, but the diamond is larger. For example, the Manhattan distance is \u2264 3.\n\nLet's recalculate for distance 3.\n\nFor example, (3,6): distance is 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 \u2192 yes.\n\nSo, in this case, the diamond would be larger. But this would include more positions.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a cross shape, but with a certain range.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the 1s are in positions that form a cross in the middle of the grid. For example, the middle row (row 5) has 1s in columns 4-6. The middle column (column 5) has 1s in rows 3-7.\n\nSo, the cross is formed by the middle row and column.\n\nSo, for each cell (i, j), if i is 4 or 5, or j is 4 or 5, then set to 1.\n\nBut this would include more positions than the first example's output. For example, row 3, column 5 is in the middle column (5), so it's set to 1. Row 5, column 4 is in the middle row (5), so it's set to 1.\n\nBut what about other cells? For example, row 3, column 4 is in the middle column (4), so it's set to 1.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, row 3, column 4 is 0. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe the cross is formed by rows 4-6 and columns 4-6. For example, the middle 3 rows and columns.\n\nSo, for each cell (i, j) where i is between 4 and 6 (inclusive), or j is between 4 and 6 (inclusive), set to 1.\n\nBut this would include more cells than the first example's output.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 1s in row 3, column 5 (which is not in 4-6 rows). So this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the diamond-shaped 1s based on the Manhattan distance, even though it may not fit all examples.\n\nSo, the code would be as follows.\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the output has 1s in the diamond positions, but the input has 3s in those positions. So the code would replace those 3s with 1s. But in the output, the 3s are still present in some positions. For example, in the first row of the output, the 3s are still there. So this suggests that the 1s are only placed in certain positions, not replacing all the cells in the diamond.\n\nSo, perhaps the code is to replace certain cells with 1s based on the input's values. For example, if the input has a 3 in a certain position, then the 1s are placed around it.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: The 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond shape, but only if the original grid has a 3 in certain positions.\n\nBut this is too complex.\n\nAlternatively, the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond, and the original grid's values are kept otherwise.\n\nBut this would mean that in the first example, the 1s are added in the diamond positions, and the rest of the grid is unchanged. This would explain the first example's output.\n\nBut for Example 2, the output has 1s in positions that are not in the diamond. So this is not correct.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the code that replaces the diamond positions with 1s, and see if it passes at least some of the examples.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Calculate Manhattan distance from (4.5, 4.5)\n            dx = abs(i - 4.5)\n            dy = abs(j - 4.5)\n            if dx + dy <= 2:\n                transformed[i][j] = 1\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not pass the examples, but it's a possible hypothesis.\n\nHowever, looking at Example 1's output, the 1s are in the diamond positions, so this code would generate the correct output for that example. For example, the output has 1s in row 3, column 5, which is in the diamond.\n\nBut what about the other examples? For example, in Example 4, the output has 1s in the diamond positions, which would match this code.\n\nBut for Example 2, the output has 1s in positions that are not in the diamond. So this code would not explain that.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is different for each example, and the code is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 1s are placed in positions that are part of a diamond, but only if the original grid has a 3 in certain positions.\n\nBut without more information, I can't determine that.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this code and see.\n"
