          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe that the output grid is always 6x6, and the transformation seems to involve some kind of pattern expansion or repetition based on the input grid.\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that:\n1. The output grid seems to be a combination of the input grid and some kind of pattern that repeats or expands it\n2. The pattern appears to be related to the values in the input grid, with some kind of transformation that involves repeating or expanding values\n3. There seems to be a pattern where certain values are repeated or transformed in specific ways\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that expands each cell in the input grid into a 2x2 block in the output grid, with the value of the cell repeated in the block.\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 6x6 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(6)] for _ in range(6)]\n    \n    # Expand each cell in the input grid into a 2x2 block\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            # Fill the 2x2 block starting at (i*2, j*2)\n            for x in range(2):\n                for y in range(2):\n                    transformed_grid[i*2 + x][j*2 + y] = value\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 6x6 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(6)] for _ in range(6)]\n    \n    # Expand each cell in the input grid into a 2x2 block\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            # Fill the 2x2 block starting at (i*2, j*2)\n            for x in range(2):\n                for y in range(2):\n                    transformed_grid[i*2 + x][j*2 + y] = value\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid is always 6x6\n2. The input grid is 3x3\n3. The output seems to be a replication or expansion of the input grid in some pattern\n4.
