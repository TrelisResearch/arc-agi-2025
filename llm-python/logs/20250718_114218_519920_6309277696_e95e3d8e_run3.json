The output grid appears to be a transformation of the input grid that preserves the structure but with some modifications:\n   - The first few rows seem to be repeated or transformed versions of later rows.\n   - There are patterns of repetition and symmetry.\n   - Some values are repeated or modified in a structured way.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Repeating or mirroring patterns from the input grid.\n- Preserving the structure but modifying values in a structured way.\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 22x22 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(22)] for _ in range(22)]\n    \n    # Copy the first 11 rows from the input grid\n    for i in range(11):\n        for j in range(22):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Copy the next 11 rows from the input grid\n    for i in range(11, 22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Mirror the first 11 rows to fill the second half\n    for i in range(11):\n        for j in range(22):\n            transformed_grid[22 - i - 1][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 22x22 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(22)] for _ in range(22)]\n    \n    # Copy the first 11 rows from the input grid\n    for i in range(11):\n        for j in range(22):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Copy the next 11 rows from the input grid\n    for i in range(11, 22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Mirror the first 11 rows to fill the second half\n    for i in range(11):\n        for j in range(22):\n            transformed_grid[22 - i - 1][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid appears to be a transformation of the input grid that preserves the structure but with some modifications:\n   - The first few rows seem to be repeated or transformed versions of later rows.\n   - There are patterns of repetition and symmetry.\n   - Some values are repeated or modified in a structured way.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Repeating or mirroring patterns from the input grid.\n- Preserving the structure but modifying values in a structured way.\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 22x22 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(22)] for _ in range(22)]\n    \n    # Copy the first 11 rows from the input grid\n    for i in range(11):\n        for j in range(22):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Copy the next 11 rows from the input grid\n    for i in range(11, 22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Mirror the first 11 rows to fill the second half\n    for i in range(11):\n        for j in range(22):\n            transformed_grid[22 - i - 1][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 22x22 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(22)] for _ in range(22)]\n    \n    # Copy the first 11 rows from the input grid\n    for i in range(11):\n        for j in range(22):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Copy the next 11 rows from the input grid\n    for i in range(11, 22):\n        for j in range(22):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Mirror the first 11 rows to fill the second half\n    for i in range(11):\n        for j in range(22):\n            transformed_grid[22 - i - 1][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
