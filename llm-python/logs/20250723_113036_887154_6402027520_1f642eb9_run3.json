              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the examples. Let's take Example 1 first. The input has a 9 in column 4, and in rows 3-5, columns 4 and 5 are 8, 8. The output moves the 9 to row 3, column 4. Then in row 4, columns 4 and 5 become 8 and 9, but wait no, in the output, row 4 has 8 and 8 again. Wait, maybe I need to check more carefully.\n\nWait, in Example 1's input, row 3, columns 4 and 5 are 8 and 8. In the output, row 3's column 4 is 8 and column 5 is 9. Then in row 4, column 4 is 8 and column 5 is 8. Hmm. Wait, the output of Example 1 is different in some rows. For instance, row 6 in the output has 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. Wait, original input for row 6 is 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0, but output is 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0. So no change there. But row 7 in input is 6 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0, and output row 7 is 6 0 0 0 6 4 0 0 0 0. So in row 7, the 8 and 8 are replaced by 6 and 4. Wait, but in the output of Example 1, row 7 is 6, 0, 0, 0, 6, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the original input for row 7 was 6, 0, 0, 0, 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the 8s are moved to different positions. The 8 in column 5 is moved to column 3? Wait, not sure. Let me see the output for row 7: the first non-zero element is 6 (column 0), then 0, 0, 0, then 6 (column 4), 4 (column 5). Wait, the input row 7 has 8 in column 4 and 5. The output has 6 in column 4 and 4 in column 5. So where did the 6 and 4 come from? The input row 0 (first row) has a 9, and the last row has a 4. But the 4 is in column 6. So maybe these numbers are being moved to different positions based on some rules.\n\nLooking at Example 2: input has a 7 in row 0, column 4. Output row 3, column 4 is 6, and column 5 is 7. Wait, original input row 3 is 6 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0. The output row 3 is 6 0 0 6 7 8 0 0 0 0. So the 7 moves from row 0 to row 3, column 5. The 6 remains in column 0. So maybe the 8s are being replaced by other numbers based on their position.\n\nIn Example 3: input row 0 has 4 in column 3 (original input row 0: 0 0 0 4 0 ...). Output row 3 has 4 in column 3. But input row 3 is 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 6. Output row 3 is 0 0 0 4 8 6 0 0 0 6. So the 4 moves from row 0 to row 3. Similarly, the 6 in input row 3 (column 9) moves to column 9 in output. Wait, but in row 3 of Example 3's input, the 8s are in columns 3,4,5. The output has 4 in column 3, then 8, 6 in columns 4 and 5. So the 4 and 6 are swapped with the 8s? Or maybe the numbers are being moved in certain positions.\n\nSo possible pattern: for each row, if a number is in a certain position (like column 4), it's moved to a different column based on the row number. For example, in Example 1, the 9 in row 0, column 4 moves to row 3, column 4. The 8s in rows 3-5, columns 4-5 are moved to row 4, column 4 is 8 and column 5 is 9. Wait, but that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved based on their original row and column. For example, in Example 1, row 7, columns 4 and 5 are 8, 8. In the output, they are 6 and 4. The original input row 0 has a 9 in column 4, and the output row 3 has a 9 in column 4. So the 9 is moved down by 3 rows. Similarly, the 4 in row 9 is moved to row 3's column 5. But that's not consistent. Wait, the 4 is in row 9, column 6. In the output, it's in column 5 of row 9. So maybe the columns are shifted?\n\nAlternatively, think of it as a transformation where for each row, the non-zero values are moved to certain positions based on their original row. For example:\n\n- For row 0: the 9 moves to column 4 of row 3.\n- For row 3: the 6 is moved to column 0, and the 8s are moved to columns 4 and 5 (but in the output of Example 1, row 3 is 6, 0, 0, 0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0. Wait, in row 3 of Example 1's output, columns 4 and 5 are 9 and 8. But original input for row 3 is 0 0 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 0. So the 9 is moved to column 4, and the 8s are moved to columns 4 and 5. Wait, but that's not possible unless there's a swap between 9 and 8. That seems like a possible pattern.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2, the 7 is moved to row 3, column 5. The 6 in row 3 is moved to column 0. The 8s in row 3 are moved to columns 3 and 4 (original input row 3: 6 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0). Output row 3: 6 0 0 6 7 8 0 0 0 0. So the 8s in columns 3,4,5 of input are now in columns 4,5,6 of output? Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the non-zero numbers are being shifted left or right based on their row. For example, in row 0, the 9 moves to column 4 of row 3. In row 3, the 6 moves to column 0. In row 7, the 6 moves to column 4. In row 9, the 4 moves to column 5.\n\nAlternatively, think of the numbers as being moved to specific positions based on their row and column. For example:\n\n- The number 9 in row 0, column 4 moves to row 3, column 4.\n- The number 8 in row 3, column 4 moves to row 4, column 5.\n- The number 8 in row 3, column 5 moves to row 4, column 4.\n- The number 8 in row 4, column 4 moves to row 5, column 5.\n- The number 8 in row 4, column 5 moves to row 5, column 4.\n- The number 8 in row 5, column 4 moves to row 6, column 5.\n- The number 8 in row 5, column 5 moves to row 6, column 4.\n- The number 6 in row 6, column 0 moves to row 7, column 4.\n- The number 6 in row 6, column 5 moves to row 7, column 5.\n- The number 2 in row 6, column 9 moves to row 7, column 5.\n- The number 3 in row 7, column 0 moves to row 8, column 3.\n- The number 3 in row 7, column 3 moves to"
