          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from input to output. Let's start by comparing Example 1's input and output.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 4 is: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\nOutput row 4 is: 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 2 0 0\nSo in the input, the 13th column (index 12?) has a 2. In the output, the 5th and 6th columns (indices 4 and 5?) are 5s, and then 5s again in positions 6-8? Wait, maybe I need to check the exact positions. Let me think: the input row 4 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output row 4 is 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the 5th column (index 4) to 8th (index 8) are all 5s. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with 5s based on some rule.\n\nLooking at other rows. For example, in Example 1's output row 5, the input was all zeros except for the 13th column (index 12) which was 2. The output row 5 is 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So again, the same pattern: positions 4-8 (columns 4 to 8) are 5s. Wait, but in the input, the 13th column (index 12) was 2. In the output, that's still 2. So maybe the 5s are being inserted in certain positions based on some rule.\n\nAnother example: in Example 1's input row 7: 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output row 7 is 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 5 7 0 3 0 0 0. So the 5th column (index 4) is 5, and the 9th column (index 8) is 5. Also, the 6th column (index 5) is 7, which was present in the input. Hmm, maybe some positions are being filled with 5s based on their position.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's row 8: 0 9 0 0 5 0 9 0 5 7 0 0 0 0 0. The input row 8 was 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 8 7 0 0 0 0 0. So in the output, the 5th column (index 4) is 5, and the 9th column (index 8) is 5. Also, the 5th column (index 4) was 0 in input, but now 5. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being set to 5s based on their row or column.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's output, row 5 (original input row 5) has 5s in columns 4-8. Similarly, row 6 in output has 5s in columns 4-8. Wait, looking at the output of Example 1's row 5: 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So columns 4-8 (indices 4 to 8) are 5s. Similarly, row 6 in output is 2 3 6 0 5 0 7 6 5 0 9 4 0 0 4. Wait, that's row 6. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, certain columns are being set to 5s. For example, in Example 1's output, row 4 (original input row 4) has 5s in columns 4-8. Similarly, row 5 in output (original input row 5) has 5s in columns 4-8. Wait, but in the output of Example 1's row 5, the 5s are in columns 4-8. So maybe for rows 4 and 5, columns 4-8 are set to 5s. But that's not the case for all rows. Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output row 7: 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 5 7 0 3 0 0 0. So columns 4 (index 4) is 5, and column 8 (index 8) is 5. So maybe in some rows, the 5th and 9th columns are being set to 5s. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with 5s based on their position. For example, in the output of Example 1's row 4, columns 4-8 are 5s. Similarly, in row 5, columns 4-8 are 5s. But in row 6 of output, columns 4-8 are 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. Wait, row 6 in output is 2 3 6 0 5 0 7 6 5 0 9 4 0 0 4. So columns 4-8 are 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. So maybe not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with 5s based on their position in the grid. For example, in the output of Example 1, rows 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, etc., have 5s in certain columns. Maybe the 5s are being added in a way that depends on the row and column indices.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's row 8: 0 9 0 0 5 0 9 0 5 7 0 0 0 0 0. The 5 is in column 4 (index 4), and column 8 (index 8). So that's the same as in row 4 and 5.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's output, rows 4-8 (original input rows 4-8) have 5s in columns 4-8. But in row 4, the 5s are in columns 4-8. In row 5, same. In row 6, columns 4-8 have 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. Wait, that's not all 5s. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with 5s based on the original input. For example, in Example 1's input row 4, the 13th column (index 12) is 2. In the output, that's still 2. But in the output, the 5th column (index 4) to 8th (index 8) are 5s. So maybe for each row, if there's a 2 in column 12, then in that row, columns 4-8 are 5s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being inserted in certain positions based on the original grid's values. For example, in Example 1's input row 4, the 13th column is 2, and in the output, columns 4-8 are 5s. So maybe whenever there's a 2 in column 12, the 5s are added in columns 4-8.\n\nBut looking at other examples, maybe this is not the case. Let's check Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2's input, the output has some 5s. For example, in the output row 9, the input was 1 0 0 0 1 0 3 7 0 0 0 7 0 0 3. The output is 1 0 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 5 0 7 0 0 3. So columns 5-8 (indices 5-8) are 5s. So maybe for certain rows, columns 5-8 are being set to 5s.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input row 9: the original input row 9 is 1 0 0 0 1 0 3 7 0 0 0 7 0 0 3. The output row 9 is 1 0 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 5 0 7 0 0 3. So columns 5-8 (indices 5 to 8) are 5s. So that's a pattern where for row 9, columns 5-8 are 5s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2's output row 10: the input was 0 0 1 2 0 9 3 4 0 0 1 0 0 2 9. The output is 0 0 1 2 0 5 3 4 0 5 1 0 0 2 9. So columns 5 (index 5) is 5, and column 9 (index 9) is 5. So that's not the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in certain rows, specific columns are being filled with 5s. For example, in Example 2's output, row 9 has 5s in columns 5-8. Row 10 has 5 in column 5 and 9. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. For example, in Example 3's input row 4: 5 5 5 5 8 0 1 9 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output row 4 is 5 5 5 5 8 0 1 9 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. So no change here. But in Example 3's output row 8: 3 0 0 2 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0. The input row 8 was 3 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0. So in the output, columns 6-9 (indices 6-9) are 5s, and column 11 (index 10?) is 8. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with 5s based on their row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in certain positions based on the original input's values. For example, if a cell is 0, then it's replaced with 5. But that doesn't fit with the examples. For example, in Example 1's input row 4, the 13th column is 2, and in the output it's still 2. But the other columns are 5s. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 5s are added. For example, in Example 1's output, row 4 has 5s in columns 4-8. Row 5 has 5s in columns 4-8. Row 6 has 5 in column 4 and 8. Row 7 has 5 in column 4 and 8. Row 8 has 5 in columns 4 and 8. Row 9 has 5 in columns 4-8. Hmm. Maybe the 5s are being added in a certain pattern based on the row number. For example, rows 4-9 have 5s in columns 4-8, but that's not the case for all rows. For example, in Example 1's output row 10, the input was 1 0 5 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 6. The output is 1 0 5 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 6. So no 5s added here. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in certain columns based on their row. For example, for rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But that's not the case for all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in certain positions based on the original input's value. For example, if a cell in the input is 0, then in the output, it's replaced with 5. But in Example 1's input row 4, the 13th column is 2, and in the output it's still 2. So that's not the case. However, in the input row 4, other columns are 0, which are replaced with 5s. So that's possible.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's input row 4: the input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the first 5 columns (indices 4-8) are 5s. So maybe for rows where the 13th column (index 12) is 2, then columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But how does that fit with other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, specific columns are filled with 5s. For example, rows 4-8 have 5s in columns 4-8. But that's not the case for all rows.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 1's row 5. The input row 5 was 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output row 5 is 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So again, columns 4-8 are 5s. Similarly, row 6 in output is 2 3 6 0 5 0 7 6 5 0 9 4 0 0 4. So columns 4 (index 4) is 5, column 8 (index 8) is 5. So maybe for rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But for row 6, the 5s are in positions 4 and 8, not all 5s. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in certain positions based on the original input's value. For example, in Example 1's input row 4, the 13th column is 2. In the output, that's still 2. But columns 4-8 are 5s. So maybe the 5s are being added in columns 4-8 for rows where the 13th column is 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in certain positions based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is between 4 and 8, then columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But that's not the case for all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in the output grid, certain positions are filled with 5s based on the original grid's values. For example, if the original grid has a 2 in column 12 (index 12), then in the output, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's output, row 7 has 5s in columns 4 and 8. The input row 7 was 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So the 6th column (index 5) is 7. In the output, that's still 7. But columns 4 and 8 are 5s. So maybe for rows where the 6th column is 7, then columns 4 and 8 are 5s.\n\nBut this seems too specific and not applicable to all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in a way that depends on the row number. For example, for rows 4 to 8, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But in Example 1's output row 6, the 5s are in columns 4 and 8, but not all columns between them. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in certain positions based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell in the original grid is 0, then in the output, it's replaced with 5. But in Example 1's input row 4, the 13th column is 2, which is not 0, so it remains 2. The other columns are 0, so they are replaced with 5s. That seems to fit. Let's check Example 2's input and output.\n\nIn Example 2's input row 9: 1 0 0 0 1 0 3 7 0 0 0 7 0 0 3. The output row 9 is 1 0 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 5 0 7 0 0 3. So the original input has 0s in positions 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. In the output, these are filled with 5s. So that seems to fit. So maybe the pattern is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 5 in the output. But wait, in Example 1's input row 4, the 13th column is 2, which is not 0. But in the output, that's still 2. However, the other columns (which were 0) are replaced with 5s. So that seems to fit. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 2's input row 10: the input is 0 0 1 2 0 9 3 4 0 0 1 0 0 2 9. The output is 0 0 1 2 0 5 3 4 0 5 1 0 0 2 9. So the 5th column (index 5) is 0 in input, replaced with 5. The 9th column (index 9) is 0 in input, replaced with 5. So that fits. But what about the original input row 10's 5th column (index 5) was 0, and in output it's 5. So this seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3's input row 4: 5 5 5 5 8 0 1 9 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 5 5 5 5 8 0 1 9 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. So the input has 0s in columns 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Wait, no, the input row 4 is 5 5 5 5 8 0 1 9 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. So columns 5 (index 5) is 0, column 6 (index 6) is 1, column 7 (index 7) is 9, column 8 (index 8) is 0, column 9 (index 9) is 0, column 10 (index 10) is 0, column 11 (index 11) is 0. So in the output, these are 0, 1, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the 0s in the input are not all replaced with 5s. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nSo the previous idea is not correct. So there's something else going on.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3's input row 8: 3 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0. The output is 3 0 0 2 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0. So the 0s in columns 6-10 (indices 6-10) are replaced with 5s. But in the input row 8, the 6th column (index 5) is 0, and in the output, that's 5. So that's a pattern. But why?\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the 0s are replaced with 5s. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's row 4: columns 4-8 are 5s. In Example 2's row 9: columns 5-8 are 5s. In Example 3's row 8: columns 6-10 are 5s. So it seems that for each row, certain ranges of columns are being filled with 5s. But how to determine which ranges?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in a way that depends on the row index. For example, for row i, the columns from (i mod 5) to (i mod 5 + 4) are filled with 5s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in a way that depends on the row and column indices. For example, in Example 1's row 4, columns 4-8 are 5s. Row 5, same. Row 6, columns 4 and 8. Row 7, columns 4 and 8. Row 8, columns 4 and 8. Row 9, columns 4-8. So for rows 4-9, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But in row 6, it's not all 5s. So that's not consistent.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the 5s are being added in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like a diagonal or a line. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in the output grid, any cell that is in a certain position (like row i, column j) is replaced with 5 if it's in a certain area. For example, in the output of Example 1's row 4, columns 4-8 are 5s. So maybe for rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But in Example 1's row 6, the 5s are in columns 4 and 8, not all. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in certain positions based on the original grid's values. For example, if the original grid has a 0 in column 5, then replace with 5. But this is not consistent with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in the output grid, the 5s are added in positions where the original grid has a 0, but only in certain columns. For example, in Example 1's row 4, columns 4-8 are 5s, which were 0s in the input. So maybe for certain columns, the 0s are replaced with 5s.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input row 4: the 0s are in columns 0-3, 5-11, 12-14. But the output replaces columns 4-8 with 5s. So maybe for certain rows, the 0s in columns 4-8 are replaced with 5s.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns 4-8 are replaced with 5s if the original row has a 2 in column 12. For example, in Example 1's input row 4, column 12 is 2. So columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. In Example 1's input row 5, column 12 is 0. So maybe not. Wait, in Example 1's input row 5, the input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. So column 12 is 2. So in the output, columns 4-8 are 5s. So that fits. So for rows where column 12 is 2, columns 4-8 are 5s. But what about other rows?\n\nIn Example 1's input row 6, column 12 is 4. So no. But in the output row 6, columns 4 and 8 are 5s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the output of the examples. In all three examples, the output seems to have 5s in certain positions, but the exact pattern is not clear. Perhaps the transformation involves replacing certain cells with 5s based on their position.\n\nAnother idea: the 5s are being added in positions that are part of a certain shape or pattern. For example, in the output of Example 1, rows 4-8 have 5s in columns 4-8, but that's not consistent. Alternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in a way that forms a diagonal or a certain shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in positions where the row and column indices are between certain values. For example, in the output, for rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But this is not the case for all rows.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's output row 4, the 5s are in columns 4-8. In Example 2's output row 9, the 5s are in columns 5-8. In Example 3's output row 8, the 5s are in columns 6-10. So it seems that for each row, the 5s are in a range of columns that starts at a certain position and spans 5 columns. For example, row 4: 4-8 (5 columns), row 9: 5-8 (4 columns?), but that doesn't fit. Or maybe it's based on the row index.\n\nLet me think of row numbers. For example, row 4: columns 4-8 (start at 4, length 5). Row 5: same. Row 6: columns 4 and 8. Row 7: same. Row 8: same. Row 9: columns 5-8. Hmm, this doesn't fit a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each row, the 5s are added in a way that depends on the row number modulo something. For example, row 4: 4 mod 5 = 4, so columns 4-8. Row 5: 5 mod 5 = 0, so columns 0-4? But that doesn't fit. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are added in certain columns based on the row number. For example, for row i, the 5s are in columns (i-4) to (i-4 +4). But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the output of the examples and see if there's a pattern in the positions of the 5s.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 5s are in the following positions:\n\nRow 4: columns 4-8 (indices 4-8)\nRow 5: columns 4-8\nRow 6: columns 4 and 8\nRow 7: columns 4 and 8\nRow 8: columns 4 and 8\nRow 9: columns 4-8\nRow 10: columns 4-8 (input row 10 is 1 0 5 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 6. Output is 1 0 5 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 6. So no 5s added here. Wait, maybe not.)\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing certain cells with 5s based on their position. For example, in the output grid, any cell that is in row i and column j where i is between 4 and 8 and j is between 4 and 8 is replaced with 5. But that would mean that all those cells are 5s, but in the examples, it's not the case. For example, in Example 1's row 6, the 5s are in columns 4 and 8, but not all columns in between.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are added in a way that depends on the original input's value. For example, if the original input has a 0 in a certain position, then the output has 5. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s, but in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's input row 4, all the 0s are replaced with 5s in columns 4-8. But in other rows, only some 0s are replaced.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's input, the output for row 4 is 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the 5s are in columns 4-8. In the input row 4, the 0s are in columns 0-3, 5-11, 12-14. So the 5s are in columns 4-8, which were 0s in the input. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s in certain columns with 5s.\n\nBut what columns? For example, in row 4, columns 4-8 are replaced. In row 5, same. In row 6, columns 4 and 8 are replaced. In row 7, same as row 6. In row 8, same as row 6.\n\nSo maybe for rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are replaced with 5s if they were 0 in the input. But in row 6, the input row 6 was 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. So columns 4-8 are 0, and they are replaced with 5s. But in the output row 6, it's 2 3 6 0 5 0 7 6 5 0 9 4 0 0 4. So columns 4-8 are 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. So that's not all 5s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's row 7: 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 5 7 0 3 0 0 0. The input row 7 was 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So the 5 is in column 4 (index 4), and 5 in column 8 (index 8). So maybe for rows 4-8, columns 4 and 8 are replaced with 5s if they were 0 in the input. But in row 7, column 4 was 0, so replaced with 5. Column 8 was 0, replaced with 5. So that fits.\n\nIn row 6, columns 4 and 8 were 0 in the input, so replaced with 5. But in the output, column 4 is 5, column 8 is 5. So that fits.\n\nIn row 5, columns 4-8 were 0, replaced with 5s. So that fits.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is: for rows 4-8, replace columns 4 and 8 with 5 if they were 0 in the input. But what about columns 5-7? In row 5, columns 5-7 are 5s. So why are they 5s?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the pattern is that in the output, for rows 4-8, columns 4 and 8 are replaced with 5s if they were 0 in the input. But in other rows, it's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 5s based on their position. For example, in the output grid, any cell in row 4-8 and column 4 or 8 is replaced with 5 if it was 0 in the input. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nLet me check this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 4, columns 4 and 8 are 0. So in the output, they are 5. But in the output, columns 4-8 are 5s. So this would mean that columns 4-8 are replaced with 5s. But this is not consistent with other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s in the input with 5s, but only for certain columns. For example, columns 4-8 in rows 4-8.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s in the input with 5s, but only in certain positions. For example, in columns 4-8 for rows 4-8.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s in the input with 5s, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in the output, any cell that is in row 4-8 and column 4-8 is replaced with 5 if it was 0.\n\nBut this would mean that in Example 1's input row 4, columns 4-8 are 0, so they are replaced with 5s. In row 5, same. In row 6, columns 4-8 are 0, so replaced with 5s. But in the output, row 6 has 5 in columns 4 and 8, but not all. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLet me look at the output of Example 1's row 4: 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the 5s are in columns 4-8. So the first 5 is in column 4, then 5s in columns 5-8, then 5 in column 8. So maybe the pattern is that for rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s.\n\nBut in Example 1's output row 6: 2 3 6 0 5 0 7 6 5 0 9 4 0 0 4. So columns 4-8 are 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in a way that depends on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is between 4 and 8, then the column is between 4 and 8, and if the cell was 0, it's replaced with 5. But this would mean that in row 6, columns 4-8 are 5s. But in the output, it's 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. So this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, it seems that in rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But in some cases, it's not. Maybe the pattern is that for rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s, but in some cases, the 5s are added only if the original cell was 0. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s in the input with 5s, but only in certain positions. For example, in columns 4-8 for rows 4-8.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in 4-8 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), replace columns 4-8 with 5 if they were 0.\n\nBut how to determine if it's 0-based or 1-based.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input row 4 (assuming 0-based index):\n\nInput row 4 is: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. So columns 0-14.\n\nIn the output, columns 4-8 are 5s. So if the row is 4 (0-based), then columns 4-8 are replaced with 5s.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor rows 4 to 8 (inclusive), for columns 4 to 8 (inclusive), set the value to 5 if it was 0.\n\nBut in Example 1's input row 4, the 5s are added in columns 4-8, which were 0. In the output row 6, columns 4-8 are 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. So this doesn't fit. But maybe the code is to set to 5 only if the original value was 0. So in row 6, columns 4-8 are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 in the input. So in the output, they should be 5s. But in the output, it's 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see. Perhaps the transformation involves replacing certain cells with 5s based on their position, but I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are replaced with 5s if they were 0 in the input.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor i in range(4, 9):  # rows 4 to 8 (0-based)\n    for j in range(4, 9):  # columns 4 to 8 (0-based)\n        if grid[i][j] == 0:\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n\nBut this would replace all 0s in those positions with 5s. Let's see if this fits the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's input row 4, columns 4-8 are 0, so replaced with 5s. This matches the output.\n\nFor Example 1's input row 5, same. For row 6, columns 4-8 are 0, so replaced with 5s. But in the output, row 6 has 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. So this would not match. But perhaps the example is not perfect, and this is the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is to replace all 0s in the input with 5s, but only in certain columns. For example, columns 4-8 for rows 4-8.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(4, 9):  # rows 4-8 (0-based)\n        for j in range(4, 9):  # columns 4-8 (0-based)\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                transformed[i][j] = 5\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in Example 1's input row 6, the original value in column 4 is 0, so it's replaced with 5. In the output, it is 5. Column 5 is 0, replaced with 5. But in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace all 0s in the input with 5s, but only in certain positions. For example, in columns 4-8 for rows 4-8, and in columns 4 and 8 for other rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace all 0s in the input with 5s in certain positions, and implement the code that replaces 0s in columns 4-8 for rows 4-8.\n\nEven if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do based on the observations.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from input to output. Let's start by comparing Example 1's input and output.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 4 is: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\nOutput row 4 is: 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 2 0 0\nSo in the input, the 13th column (index 12?) has a 2. In the output, the 5th and 6th columns (indices 4 and 5?) are 5s, and then 5s again in positions 6-8? Wait, maybe I need to check the exact positions. Let me think: the input row 4 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output row 4 is 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the 5th column (index 4) to 8th (index 8) are all 5s. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with 5s based on some rule.\n\nLooking at other rows. For example, in Example 1's output row 5, the input was all zeros except for the 13th column (index 12) which was 2. The output row 5 is 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So again, the same pattern: positions 4-8 (columns 4 to 8) are 5s. Wait, but in the input, the 13th column (index 12) was 2. In the output, that's still 2. So maybe the 5s are being inserted in certain positions based on some rule.\n\nAnother example: in Example 1's input row 7: 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output row 7 is 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 5 7 0 3 0 0 0. So the 5th column (index 4) is 5, and the 9th column (index 8) is 5. Also, the 6th column (index 5) is 7, which was present in the input. Hmm, maybe some positions are being filled with 5s based on their position.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's row 8: 0 9 0 0 5 0 9 0 5 7 0 0 0 0 0. The input row 8 was 0 9 0 0 0 0 9 0 8 7 0 0 0 0 0. So in the output, the 5th column (index 4) is 5, and the 9th column (index 8) is 5. Also, the 5th column (index 4) was 0 in input, but now 5. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being set to 5s based on their row or column.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's output, row 5 (original input row 5) has 5s in columns 4-8. Similarly, row 6 in output has 5s in columns 4-8. Wait, looking at the output of Example 1's row 5: 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So columns 4-8 (indices 4 to 8) are 5s. Similarly, row 6 in output is 2 3 6 0 5 0 7 6 5 0 9 4 0 0 4. Wait, that's row 6. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, certain columns are being set to 5s. For example, in Example 1's output, row 4 (original input row 4) has 5s in columns 4-8. Similarly, row 5 in output (original input row 5) has 5s in columns 4-8. Wait, but in the output of Example 1's row 5, the 5s are in columns 4-8. So maybe for rows 4 and 5, columns 4-8 are set to 5s. But that's not the case for all rows. Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output row 7: 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 5 7 0 3 0 0 0. So columns 4 (index 4) is 5, and column 8 (index 8) is 5. So maybe in some rows, the 5th and 9th columns are being set to 5s. But that seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with 5s based on their position. For example, in the output of Example 1's row 4, columns 4-8 are 5s. Similarly, in row 5, columns 4-8 are 5s. But in row 6 of output, columns 4-8 are 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. Wait, row 6 in output is 2 3 6 0 5 0 7 6 5 0 9 4 0 0 4. So columns 4-8 are 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. So maybe not. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with 5s based on their position in the grid. For example, in the output of Example 1, rows 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, etc., have 5s in certain columns. Maybe the 5s are being added in a way that depends on the row and column indices.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's row 8: 0 9 0 0 5 0 9 0 5 7 0 0 0 0 0. The 5 is in column 4 (index 4), and column 8 (index 8). So that's the same as in row 4 and 5.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's output, rows 4-8 (original input rows 4-8) have 5s in columns 4-8. But in row 4, the 5s are in columns 4-8. In row 5, same. In row 6, columns 4-8 have 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. Wait, that's not all 5s. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled with 5s based on the original input. For example, in Example 1's input row 4, the 13th column (index 12) is 2. In the output, that's still 2. But in the output, the 5th column (index 4) to 8th (index 8) are 5s. So maybe for each row, if there's a 2 in column 12, then in that row, columns 4-8 are 5s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being inserted in certain positions based on the original grid's values. For example, in Example 1's input row 4, the 13th column is 2, and in the output, columns 4-8 are 5s. So maybe whenever there's a 2 in column 12, the 5s are added in columns 4-8.\n\nBut looking at other examples, maybe this is not the case. Let's check Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2's input, the output has some 5s. For example, in the output row 9, the input was 1 0 0 0 1 0 3 7 0 0 0 7 0 0 3. The output is 1 0 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 5 0 7 0 0 3. So columns 5-8 (indices 5-8) are 5s. So maybe for certain rows, columns 5-8 are being set to 5s.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input row 9: the original input row 9 is 1 0 0 0 1 0 3 7 0 0 0 7 0 0 3. The output row 9 is 1 0 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 5 0 7 0 0 3. So columns 5-8 (indices 5 to 8) are 5s. So that's a pattern where for row 9, columns 5-8 are 5s.\n\nSimilarly, in Example 2's output row 10: the input was 0 0 1 2 0 9 3 4 0 0 1 0 0 2 9. The output is 0 0 1 2 0 5 3 4 0 5 1 0 0 2 9. So columns 5 (index 5) is 5, and column 9 (index 9) is 5. So that's not the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in certain rows, specific columns are being filled with 5s. For example, in Example 2's output, row 9 has 5s in columns 5-8. Row 10 has 5 in column 5 and 9. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. For example, in Example 3's input row 4: 5 5 5 5 8 0 1 9 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output row 4 is 5 5 5 5 8 0 1 9 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. So no change here. But in Example 3's output row 8: 3 0 0 2 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0. The input row 8 was 3 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0. So in the output, columns 6-9 (indices 6-9) are 5s, and column 11 (index 10?) is 8. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with 5s based on their row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in certain positions based on the original input's values. For example, if a cell is 0, then it's replaced with 5. But that doesn't fit with the examples. For example, in Example 1's input row 4, the 13th column is 2, and in the output it's still 2. But the other columns are 5s. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 5s are added. For example, in Example 1's output, row 4 has 5s in columns 4-8. Row 5 has 5s in columns 4-8. Row 6 has 5 in column 4 and 8. Row 7 has 5 in column 4 and 8. Row 8 has 5 in columns 4 and 8. Row 9 has 5 in columns 4-8. Hmm. Maybe the 5s are being added in a certain pattern based on the row number. For example, rows 4-9 have 5s in columns 4-8, but that's not the case for all rows. For example, in Example 1's output row 10, the input was 1 0 5 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 6. The output is 1 0 5 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 6. So no 5s added here. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in certain columns based on their row. For example, for rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But that's not the case for all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in certain positions based on the original input's value. For example, if a cell in the input is 0, then in the output, it's replaced with 5. But in Example 1's input row 4, the 13th column is 2, and in the output it's still 2. So that's not the case. However, in the input row 4, other columns are 0, which are replaced with 5s. So that's possible.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's input row 4: the input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the first 5 columns (indices 4-8) are 5s. So maybe for rows where the 13th column (index 12) is 2, then columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But how does that fit with other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, specific columns are filled with 5s. For example, rows 4-8 have 5s in columns 4-8. But that's not the case for all rows.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 1's row 5. The input row 5 was 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output row 5 is 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So again, columns 4-8 are 5s. Similarly, row 6 in output is 2 3 6 0 5 0 7 6 5 0 9 4 0 0 4. So columns 4 (index 4) is 5, column 8 (index 8) is 5. So maybe for rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But for row 6, the 5s are in positions 4 and 8, not all 5s. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in certain positions based on the original input's value. For example, in Example 1's input row 4, the 13th column is 2. In the output, that's still 2. But columns 4-8 are 5s. So maybe the 5s are being added in columns 4-8 for rows where the 13th column is 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in certain positions based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is between 4 and 8, then columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But that's not the case for all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in the output grid, certain positions are filled with 5s based on the original grid's values. For example, if the original grid has a 2 in column 12 (index 12), then in the output, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's output, row 7 has 5s in columns 4 and 8. The input row 7 was 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So the 6th column (index 5) is 7. In the output, that's still 7. But columns 4 and 8 are 5s. So maybe for rows where the 6th column is 7, then columns 4 and 8 are 5s.\n\nBut this seems too specific and not applicable to all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in a way that depends on the row number. For example, for rows 4 to 8, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But in Example 1's output row 6, the 5s are in columns 4 and 8, but not all columns between them. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in certain positions based on the original grid's values. For example, if a cell in the original grid is 0, then in the output, it's replaced with 5. But in Example 1's input row 4, the 13th column is 2, which is not 0, so it remains 2. The other columns are 0, so they are replaced with 5s. That seems to fit. Let's check Example 2's input and output.\n\nIn Example 2's input row 9: 1 0 0 0 1 0 3 7 0 0 0 7 0 0 3. The output row 9 is 1 0 0 0 1 5 5 5 5 5 0 7 0 0 3. So the original input has 0s in positions 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. In the output, these are filled with 5s. So that seems to fit. So maybe the pattern is that any 0 in the input is replaced with 5 in the output. But wait, in Example 1's input row 4, the 13th column is 2, which is not 0. But in the output, that's still 2. However, the other columns (which were 0) are replaced with 5s. So that seems to fit. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 2's input row 10: the input is 0 0 1 2 0 9 3 4 0 0 1 0 0 2 9. The output is 0 0 1 2 0 5 3 4 0 5 1 0 0 2 9. So the 5th column (index 5) is 0 in input, replaced with 5. The 9th column (index 9) is 0 in input, replaced with 5. So that fits. But what about the original input row 10's 5th column (index 5) was 0, and in output it's 5. So this seems to fit.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3's input row 4: 5 5 5 5 8 0 1 9 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 5 5 5 5 8 0 1 9 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. So the input has 0s in columns 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. Wait, no, the input row 4 is 5 5 5 5 8 0 1 9 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. So columns 5 (index 5) is 0, column 6 (index 6) is 1, column 7 (index 7) is 9, column 8 (index 8) is 0, column 9 (index 9) is 0, column 10 (index 10) is 0, column 11 (index 11) is 0. So in the output, these are 0, 1, 9, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the 0s in the input are not all replaced with 5s. So that contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nSo the previous idea is not correct. So there's something else going on.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3's input row 8: 3 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0. The output is 3 0 0 2 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 8 0 0 0. So the 0s in columns 6-10 (indices 6-10) are replaced with 5s. But in the input row 8, the 6th column (index 5) is 0, and in the output, that's 5. So that's a pattern. But why?\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the 0s are replaced with 5s. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's row 4: columns 4-8 are 5s. In Example 2's row 9: columns 5-8 are 5s. In Example 3's row 8: columns 6-10 are 5s. So it seems that for each row, certain ranges of columns are being filled with 5s. But how to determine which ranges?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in a way that depends on the row index. For example, for row i, the columns from (i mod 5) to (i mod 5 + 4) are filled with 5s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in a way that depends on the row and column indices. For example, in Example 1's row 4, columns 4-8 are 5s. Row 5, same. Row 6, columns 4 and 8. Row 7, columns 4 and 8. Row 8, columns 4 and 8. Row 9, columns 4-8. So for rows 4-9, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But in row 6, it's not all 5s. So that's not consistent.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the 5s are being added in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like a diagonal or a line. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in the output grid, any cell that is in a certain position (like row i, column j) is replaced with 5 if it's in a certain area. For example, in the output of Example 1's row 4, columns 4-8 are 5s. So maybe for rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But in Example 1's row 6, the 5s are in columns 4 and 8, not all. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in certain positions based on the original grid's values. For example, if the original grid has a 0 in column 5, then replace with 5. But this is not consistent with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in the output grid, the 5s are added in positions where the original grid has a 0, but only in certain columns. For example, in Example 1's row 4, columns 4-8 are 5s, which were 0s in the input. So maybe for certain columns, the 0s are replaced with 5s.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input row 4: the 0s are in columns 0-3, 5-11, 12-14. But the output replaces columns 4-8 with 5s. So maybe for certain rows, the 0s in columns 4-8 are replaced with 5s.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the columns 4-8 are replaced with 5s if the original row has a 2 in column 12. For example, in Example 1's input row 4, column 12 is 2. So columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. In Example 1's input row 5, column 12 is 0. So maybe not. Wait, in Example 1's input row 5, the input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. So column 12 is 2. So in the output, columns 4-8 are 5s. So that fits. So for rows where column 12 is 2, columns 4-8 are 5s. But what about other rows?\n\nIn Example 1's input row 6, column 12 is 4. So no. But in the output row 6, columns 4 and 8 are 5s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to find a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the output of the examples. In all three examples, the output seems to have 5s in certain positions, but the exact pattern is not clear. Perhaps the transformation involves replacing certain cells with 5s based on their position.\n\nAnother idea: the 5s are being added in positions that are part of a certain shape or pattern. For example, in the output of Example 1, rows 4-8 have 5s in columns 4-8, but that's not consistent. Alternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in a way that forms a diagonal or a certain shape.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in positions where the row and column indices are between certain values. For example, in the output, for rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But this is not the case for all rows.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's output row 4, the 5s are in columns 4-8. In Example 2's output row 9, the 5s are in columns 5-8. In Example 3's output row 8, the 5s are in columns 6-10. So it seems that for each row, the 5s are in a range of columns that starts at a certain position and spans 5 columns. For example, row 4: 4-8 (5 columns), row 9: 5-8 (4 columns?), but that doesn't fit. Or maybe it's based on the row index.\n\nLet me think of row numbers. For example, row 4: columns 4-8 (start at 4, length 5). Row 5: same. Row 6: columns 4 and 8. Row 7: same. Row 8: same. Row 9: columns 5-8. Hmm, this doesn't fit a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each row, the 5s are added in a way that depends on the row number modulo something. For example, row 4: 4 mod 5 = 4, so columns 4-8. Row 5: 5 mod 5 = 0, so columns 0-4? But that doesn't fit. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are added in certain columns based on the row number. For example, for row i, the 5s are in columns (i-4) to (i-4 +4). But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the output of the examples and see if there's a pattern in the positions of the 5s.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 5s are in the following positions:\n\nRow 4: columns 4-8 (indices 4-8)\nRow 5: columns 4-8\nRow 6: columns 4 and 8\nRow 7: columns 4 and 8\nRow 8: columns 4 and 8\nRow 9: columns 4-8\nRow 10: columns 4-8 (input row 10 is 1 0 5 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 6. Output is 1 0 5 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 6. So no 5s added here. Wait, maybe not.)\n\nBut this is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing certain cells with 5s based on their position. For example, in the output grid, any cell that is in row i and column j where i is between 4 and 8 and j is between 4 and 8 is replaced with 5. But that would mean that all those cells are 5s, but in the examples, it's not the case. For example, in Example 1's row 6, the 5s are in columns 4 and 8, but not all columns in between.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are added in a way that depends on the original input's value. For example, if the original input has a 0 in a certain position, then the output has 5. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s with 5s, but in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's input row 4, all the 0s are replaced with 5s in columns 4-8. But in other rows, only some 0s are replaced.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1's input, the output for row 4 is 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the 5s are in columns 4-8. In the input row 4, the 0s are in columns 0-3, 5-11, 12-14. So the 5s are in columns 4-8, which were 0s in the input. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s in certain columns with 5s.\n\nBut what columns? For example, in row 4, columns 4-8 are replaced. In row 5, same. In row 6, columns 4 and 8 are replaced. In row 7, same as row 6. In row 8, same as row 6.\n\nSo maybe for rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are replaced with 5s if they were 0 in the input. But in row 6, the input row 6 was 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. So columns 4-8 are 0, and they are replaced with 5s. But in the output row 6, it's 2 3 6 0 5 0 7 6 5 0 9 4 0 0 4. So columns 4-8 are 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. So that's not all 5s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's row 7: 0 0 0 0 5 7 0 0 5 7 0 3 0 0 0. The input row 7 was 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So the 5 is in column 4 (index 4), and 5 in column 8 (index 8). So maybe for rows 4-8, columns 4 and 8 are replaced with 5s if they were 0 in the input. But in row 7, column 4 was 0, so replaced with 5. Column 8 was 0, replaced with 5. So that fits.\n\nIn row 6, columns 4 and 8 were 0 in the input, so replaced with 5. But in the output, column 4 is 5, column 8 is 5. So that fits.\n\nIn row 5, columns 4-8 were 0, replaced with 5s. So that fits.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is: for rows 4-8, replace columns 4 and 8 with 5 if they were 0 in the input. But what about columns 5-7? In row 5, columns 5-7 are 5s. So why are they 5s?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the pattern is that in the output, for rows 4-8, columns 4 and 8 are replaced with 5s if they were 0 in the input. But in other rows, it's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with 5s based on their position. For example, in the output grid, any cell in row 4-8 and column 4 or 8 is replaced with 5 if it was 0 in the input. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nLet me check this hypothesis with the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's input row 4, columns 4 and 8 are 0. So in the output, they are 5. But in the output, columns 4-8 are 5s. So this would mean that columns 4-8 are replaced with 5s. But this is not consistent with other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s in the input with 5s, but only for certain columns. For example, columns 4-8 in rows 4-8.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s in the input with 5s, but only in certain positions. For example, in columns 4-8 for rows 4-8.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s in the input with 5s, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in the output, any cell that is in row 4-8 and column 4-8 is replaced with 5 if it was 0.\n\nBut this would mean that in Example 1's input row 4, columns 4-8 are 0, so they are replaced with 5s. In row 5, same. In row 6, columns 4-8 are 0, so replaced with 5s. But in the output, row 6 has 5 in columns 4 and 8, but not all. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLet me look at the output of Example 1's row 4: 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the 5s are in columns 4-8. So the first 5 is in column 4, then 5s in columns 5-8, then 5 in column 8. So maybe the pattern is that for rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s.\n\nBut in Example 1's output row 6: 2 3 6 0 5 0 7 6 5 0 9 4 0 0 4. So columns 4-8 are 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being added in a way that depends on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is between 4 and 8, then the column is between 4 and 8, and if the cell was 0, it's replaced with 5. But this would mean that in row 6, columns 4-8 are 5s. But in the output, it's 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. So this is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, it seems that in rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s. But in some cases, it's not. Maybe the pattern is that for rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are filled with 5s, but in some cases, the 5s are added only if the original cell was 0. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 0s in the input with 5s, but only in certain positions. For example, in columns 4-8 for rows 4-8.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in 4-8 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), replace columns 4-8 with 5 if they were 0.\n\nBut how to determine if it's 0-based or 1-based.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input row 4 (assuming 0-based index):\n\nInput row 4 is: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0. So columns 0-14.\n\nIn the output, columns 4-8 are 5s. So if the row is 4 (0-based), then columns 4-8 are replaced with 5s.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor rows 4 to 8 (inclusive), for columns 4 to 8 (inclusive), set the value to 5 if it was 0.\n\nBut in Example 1's input row 4, the 5s are added in columns 4-8, which were 0. In the output row 6, columns 4-8 are 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. So this doesn't fit. But maybe the code is to set to 5 only if the original value was 0. So in row 6, columns 4-8 are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 in the input. So in the output, they should be 5s. But in the output, it's 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see. Perhaps the transformation involves replacing certain cells with 5s based on their position, but I'm not sure. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for rows 4-8, columns 4-8 are replaced with 5s if they were 0 in the input.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor i in range(4, 9):  # rows 4 to 8 (0-based)\n    for j in range(4, 9):  # columns 4 to 8 (0-based)\n        if grid[i][j] == 0:\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n\nBut this would replace all 0s in those positions with 5s. Let's see if this fits the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's input row 4, columns 4-8 are 0, so replaced with 5s. This matches the output.\n\nFor Example 1's input row 5, same. For row 6, columns 4-8 are 0, so replaced with 5s. But in the output, row 6 has 5, 0, 7, 6, 5. So this would not match. But perhaps the example is not perfect, and this is the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is to replace all 0s in the input with 5s, but only in certain columns. For example, columns 4-8 for rows 4-8.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(4, 9):  # rows 4-8 (0-based)\n        for j in range(4, 9):  # columns 4-8 (0-based)\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                transformed[i][j] = 5\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in Example 1's input row 6, the original value in column 4 is 0, so it's replaced with 5. In the output, it is 5. Column 5 is 0, replaced with 5. But in the output, it's 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace all 0s in the input with 5s, but only in certain positions. For example, in columns 4-8 for rows 4-8, and in columns 4 and 8 for other rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clarity, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace all 0s in the input with 5s in certain positions, and implement the code that replaces 0s in columns 4-8 for rows 4-8.\n\nEven if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do based on the observations.\n"
