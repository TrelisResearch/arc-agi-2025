          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a Python function that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Let me look at each example carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has a 0 in most positions except for the fourth row (index 3) which has an 8 in the fourth column (index 3). The output has that 8 expanded into a 3x3 block in the top-left, but wait, looking at the output, the first three rows have 8s in the fourth column. Then, the fourth row has 8s in the first three columns? Wait, the output for example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: 8 8 8 8 0 0 ... etc.\nThen row 3 onwards are zeros except for the 10th row (index 9) which has 3s in columns 9, 10, 11. Wait, the input for example 1 has a 3 in column 9 (the 10th column, since indexes start at 0?), but in the output, that 3 is expanded into three 3s in columns 9, 10, 11. So maybe the rule is that when there's a number in the input, it's expanded into a square or some shape around it?\n\nLooking at example 2. The input has a 3 in row 4 (index 4?), column 9 (assuming 0-based). The output has that 3 spread across multiple rows and columns. The output for example 2 shows that in rows 0-3, the 3 is in column 9, but then in row 4, it's spread across columns 9-14 (but the output is 15 columns? Wait, the input for example 2 is 15 columns? Wait, the input for example 2 is 15 columns? Because the input lines have 15 elements each. But the output is 15 columns? Wait, the output for example 2 is 15 columns. Let me check the example 2 input and output.\n\nExample 2 input has 15 columns (each line has 15 elements). The output has 15 columns as well. For example, the input has a 3 in row 4 (index 4?), column 9. The output shows that in rows 0-3, the 3 is in column 9, but then in row 4, it's spread across columns 9-14 (but the output for row 4 is 0s except for the 5th row? Wait, the output for example 2 shows that in row 4 (the fifth row?), the 3 is spread across columns 9-14? Or maybe the 3 is spread in a way that it's expanding into a horizontal line. But the output for example 2's row 4 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, but in the output for example 2, the fifth row (row 4) has a 3 in column 9, but then in the next rows (rows 5-8?), there are 3s in column 9. Then in row 9, there's a 5 in column 5 (original input has a 5 in row 11, column 5?), and the output for that row is 5s in columns 0-4 and 5? Or maybe the 5 is expanded into a vertical line?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero value in the input is expanded into a square or rectangle. For example, in example 1, the 8 in the input is expanded into a 3x3 square in the output. But looking at example 1's output, the 8 is in the fourth column (index 3) of the first three rows, and then in row 2, the first three columns are 8s. So maybe the 8 is expanded into a square that starts at (row, col) and spreads in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 in the input is expanded into a square that is 3x3. For example, in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3) (assuming rows and columns are 0-based). The output has 8s in positions (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), etc. Wait, the output for example 1's first three rows have 8 in column 3. Then in row 2, columns 0-3 are 8s. So maybe the 8 is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but in a way that it's spread out in a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3. The input has an 8 in row 3 (index 3?), column 2 (index 2?), and a 4 in row 4 (index 4?), column 6 (index 6?), and a 5 in row 8 (index 8?), column 7 (index 7?). The output for example 3 has the 8 expanded into a 3x3 square in the top-left. The 4 is expanded into a 3x3 square in the middle. The 5 is expanded into a 3x3 square in the bottom-right. So maybe the rule is that each non-zero value in the input is expanded into a square of 3x3, but the position depends on where the original value is.\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the 8 is in row 3 (index 3) and column 3 (index 3). The output for example 1 has the 8 in row 0-2, column 3, and row 2, columns 0-3. So maybe the 8 is expanded into a square that starts at (row - 2, col - 2) to (row + 0, col + 0)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is centered around the original position. For example, in example 1, the 8 is at (3,3). The output for example 1 has 8s in positions (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). That seems like a square that's 3 rows high and 3 columns wide. But the original position is (3,3), so maybe the square is 3 rows high and 3 columns wide, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the original position is the center of that square. For example, if the original value is at (row, col), then the square would be from (row-1, col-1) to (row+1, col+1). But in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). The output has 8s in row 0-2, column 3. That's three rows. So maybe the square is 3 rows high, but how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the original position is the top-left corner of the square. For example, in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). The output has 8s in row 0-2 (three rows) and column 3. But that's only one column. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the original position is the center. For example, in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). The output has 8s in rows 0-2 (three rows) and columns 0-3 (four columns?), but that's not a 3x3 square.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me look at example 3 again. The input for example 3 has an 8 in row 3, column 2. The output for example 3 has 8s in rows 0-2, columns 2, and row 3, columns 0-2. So that's a 3x3 square? Wait, row 0-2 (three rows) and columns 0-2 (three columns?), but in the output, the first three rows have 8 in column 2, and row 3 has 8s in columns 0-2. So that's a 3x3 square centered at (row 1.5, column 1.5)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the original position is the top-left corner. So for example, in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). The output has 8s in rows 0-2 (three rows) and columns 3 (only one column). That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nLooking at example 4. The input has a 9 in row 4 (index 4?), column 5 (index 5?), and the output has that 9 expanded into a 4x4 square. The output for example 4 has the 9 in row 4, column 5, and then in row 4, columns 5-8 (four columns) are 9s. Then in rows 0-3, column 5 is 9. And in row 4, columns 5-8 are 9s. Also, row 4, columns 5-8 are 9s. Then in row 5, columns 5-8 are 9s? Wait, the output for example 4 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: same\nRow 3: same\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n... and so on.\n\nSo the 9 is in column 5 (index 5) of row 4. The output has 9s in column 5 of rows 0-4, and in row 4, columns 5-8 (four columns). So that's a vertical line of 5 rows (rows 0-4) and a horizontal line of 4 columns (columns 5-8). So maybe the rule is that when a number is present in the input, it's expanded into a vertical line of length equal to the row index plus something, and a horizontal line of length equal to the column index plus something. Or maybe the number is expanded into a square that is determined by the position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the original position is the center. For example, in example 4, the original 9 is at (4,5). The output has 9s in rows 0-4 (5 rows) and columns 5-8 (4 columns). So that's not a square. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is determined by the value itself. For example, the 8 in example 1 is expanded into a 3x3 square. The 3 in example 1 is expanded into 3 columns. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3, the 8 is in row 3, column 2. The output has 8s in rows 0-2, column 2, and row 3, columns 0-2. So that's a 3x3 square. The 4 is in row 4, column 6. The output has 4s in rows 3-5 (three rows) and columns 5-7 (three columns). So that's a 3x3 square. The 5 is in row 8, column 7. The output has 5s in rows 7-9 (three rows) and columns 6-8 (three columns). So that's a 3x3 square. So maybe the rule is that each non-zero value in the input is expanded into a 3x3 square centered at that position. But how?\n\nWait, in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). The output has 8s in rows 0-2 (three rows) and columns 0-3 (four columns?), but that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the square is 3x3, but the original position is the top-left corner of the square. For example, if the original position is (row, col), then the square starts at (row, col) and spans 3 rows and 3 columns. But that would mean that the square would be 3x3. But in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). So the square would start at (3,3) and go to (5,5), but the output is 12x12. But the output for example 1 has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. That's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square is 3x3, but the original position is the center. For example, the original position (3,3) is the center of a 3x3 square. So the square would be from (2,2) to (4,4). But in the output, the 8s are in rows 0-2 and column 3. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that for each non-zero value in the input, it's expanded into a square of size 3x3, but the square is placed such that the original cell is the top-left corner of the square. For example, in example 3, the 8 is at (3,2). The square would be from (3,2) to (5,4). But the output for example 3 has 8s in rows 0-2, column 2, and row 3, columns 0-2. That's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the original position is the top-left corner. So, for example, if the original value is at (row, col), then in the output, the square from (row, col) to (row+2, col+2) is filled with the value. But in example 1, the original value is at (3,3). The output has 8s in (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). That's not matching. So this approach seems incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns. For example, in example 1, the 8 is in (3,3). The output has 8s in column 3 for rows 0-2, and in row 2, columns 0-3. That would be a vertical line of 3 rows (rows 0-2) and a horizontal line of 4 columns (columns 0-3). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value is expanded into a square that is determined by the value's position. For example, if the value is in a certain row or column, it's expanded into a certain shape. But this seems too vague.\n\nLooking at example 4 again. The input has a 9 in row 4, column 5. The output has 9s in column 5 for rows 0-4 (5 rows) and in row 4, columns 5-8 (4 columns). So that's a vertical line of 5 rows and a horizontal line of 4 columns. Maybe the number of rows and columns depends on the position. For example, if the value is in row r and column c, then the vertical line is from row 0 to r, and the horizontal line is from column c to c + 3. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value is expanded into a vertical line of length (row + 1) and a horizontal line of length (column + 1). For example, in example 1, the original 8 is at row 3, column 3. So vertical line would be 4 rows (0-3?), but the output has 3 rows (0-2). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the original position is the top-left corner. So for example, in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). The square would be from (3,3) to (5,5), but the output for example 1 has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to look for another pattern. Maybe the transformation is that any non-zero value in the input is expanded into a square of 3x3, but the square is placed such that the original position is the center. For example, in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). The center of a 3x3 square is (3,3). So the square would be from (2,2) to (4,4). But in the output, the 8s are in rows 0-2 and column 3, which doesn't fit. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the square is placed such that the original position is the top-left corner. For example, the original position is (row, col), and the square is filled with the value in positions (row, col), (row, col+1), (row, col+2), (row+1, col), etc. But this would require that the original position is in the top-left corner of the square. For example, in example 3, the original 8 is at (3,2). The square would be from (3,2) to (5,4). But in the output, the 8 is in rows 0-2 and column 2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value is expanded into a square that is determined by the value's position. For example, if the value is in row r and column c, then the square is filled in the region from row max(0, r-2) to row min(r+2, 11), and column max(0, c-2) to min(c+2, 11). But that would mean that the 8 in example 1 is at (3,3), so the square is from row 1 to 5 (since 3-2=1, 3+2=5) and column 1 to 5. But the output for example 1 has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a vertical line of length 3 and a horizontal line of length 3. For example, in example 1, the 8 is in row 3, column 3. The vertical line is from row 0-2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 3-5 (3 columns). But in the output, the 8 is in column 3 for rows 0-2, and in row 2, columns 0-3. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really difficult. Let me look at the outputs for all examples and see if there's a common pattern.\n\nExample 1: The original 8 is at (3,3). The output has 8s in rows 0-2, column 3, and row 2, columns 0-3. So that's a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 4 columns. The 3 in the input is at (9,9), and the output has 3s in (9,9), (9,10), (9,11) and in row 10, column 9. So that's a horizontal line of 3 columns and a vertical line of 1 row.\n\nExample 2: The original 3 is at (4,9). The output has 3s in rows 0-3, column 9, and in row 4, columns 9-14. So that's a vertical line of 4 rows and a horizontal line of 6 columns.\n\nExample 3: The original 8 is at (3,2), and the output has 8s in rows 0-2, column 2, and row 3, columns 0-2. So vertical line of 3 rows and horizontal line of 3 columns.\n\nExample 4: The original 9 is at (4,5). The output has 9s in rows 0-4, column 5, and in row 4, columns 5-8. So vertical line of 5 rows and horizontal line of 4 columns.\n\nHmm. It seems that for each non-zero value in the input, the output has a vertical line of length (r + 1) rows and a horizontal line of length (c + 1) columns. But that's not consistent. For example, in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). The vertical line is 3 rows (0-2), which is r=3, but 3+1 is 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is from row 0 to row r, and the horizontal line is from column c to column c + 2. For example, in example 1, the vertical line is 3 rows (0-2), which is r=3. So row 0-2 is 3 rows. The horizontal line is column 3-5 (3 columns), but the output has 8 in column 3 for rows 0-2 and in row 2, columns 0-3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a vertical line of length 3 and a horizontal line of length 3. But that doesn't fit with example 4 where the vertical line is 5 rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is 3 rows and the horizontal line is 3 columns, but the original position is the top-left corner of the square. For example, in example 1, the original position is (3,3), and the square is from (3,3) to (5,5). But the output has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows: for each non-zero cell in the input, it is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns, but the lines are placed such that the original cell is the intersection point of the lines. For example, the vertical line is from row r-2 to row r+0, and the horizontal line is from column c-2 to column c+0. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the original cell is the center. So for example, the original cell (r,c) is the center of the 3x3 square. Then, the square would be from (r-1, c-1) to (r+1, c+1). But in example 1, the original cell is (3,3), so the square would be from (2,2) to (4,4). The output for example 1 has 8s in (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the square is placed such that the original cell is the top-left corner. For example, if the original cell is at (r,c), then the square is from (r, c) to (r+2, c+2). But in example 1, the original cell is at (3,3), so the square would be from (3,3) to (5,5). But the output for example 1 has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the test input and what the output might be. The test input has a 3 in row 1 (assuming 0-based), column 13 (since the input has 16 columns?), but the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n... and so on.\n\nSo the 3 is in row 1 (index 1?), column 13 (index 13?), and the 8 is in row 2, column 4 (index 4). The 6 is in row 6, column 5 (index 5?), and the 5 is in row 8, column 5 (index 5?).\n\nAssuming that the transformation is similar to the examples, the output for the test input would have the 3 expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns. The 8 would be expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns. The 6 would be expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns, and the 5 would be expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns.\n\nBut how to determine the exact transformation.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3), and the output has 8s in (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So that's a vertical line of 3 rows (rows 0-2) and a horizontal line of 3 columns (columns 0-2) in row 2. This seems like the original position is the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines.\n\nSo the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column 2 (3 columns). The original position is at (3,3), but the vertical line is in column 3 and the horizontal line is in row 2. This seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is from the original row minus 2 to original row, and the horizontal line is from original column minus 2 to original column. For example, in example 1, original row is 3, so vertical line is rows 1 to 3. But the output has rows 0-2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is from the original row to original row + 2, but that would be rows 3-5, but the output has rows 0-2.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows: for each non-zero cell in the input, it is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the square is placed such that the original cell is the top-left corner. But in example 1, that would mean the square is from (3,3) to (5,5). But the output has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square is placed such that the original cell is the top-left corner, but the square is clipped to the grid. For example, if the original cell is at (3,3), the square is from (3,3) to (5,5). But the output has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of example 1. The original 8 is at (3,3). The output has 8s in rows 0-2, column 3, and in row 2, columns 0-3. This suggests that the 8 is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows (rows 0-2) and a horizontal line of 4 columns (columns 0-3). But how is that determined?\n\nMaybe the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column 3 (4 columns). The original position is (3,3), but the vertical line is in column 3, and the horizontal line is in row 2. This seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 3 to column 3 (1 column). But that doesn't explain the 8s in row 2, columns 0-3.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the square is placed such that the original cell is the center of the square. So, for example, the original cell (r,c) is the center of a 3x3 square. So the square would be from (r-1, c-1) to (r+1, c+1). But in example 1, the original cell is (3,3), so the square would be from (2,2) to (4,4). But the output for example 1 has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. This doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square is placed such that the original cell is the top-left corner of the square, but the square is only 3x3. So for example, if the original cell is (r,c), then the square is from (r, c) to (r+2, c+2). But in example 1, this would be (3,3) to (5,5). But the output has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's look at example 3 again. The input has an 8 in (3,2), and the output has 8s in rows 0-2, column 2, and in row 3, columns 0-2. So that's a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns. The original cell is (3,2), and the vertical line is in column 2, and the horizontal line is in row 3.\n\nThis suggests that for a cell at (r,c), the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column 2 (3 columns). But how does that relate to the original position?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column 2 (3 columns), regardless of the original position. But that can't be, since the original position varies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column 2 (3 columns), but only if the original cell is in a certain area. But this is unclear.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the 8 is at (3,3), and the output has 8s in column 3 for rows 0-2, and in row 2, columns 0-3. So that's a vertical line of 3 rows (rows 0-2) and a horizontal line of 4 columns (columns 0-3). In example 3, the 8 is at (3,2), and the output has 8s in column 2 for rows 0-2 and in row 3, columns 0-2. So that's a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns. In example 4, the 9 is at (4,5), and the output has 9s in column 5 for rows 0-4 (5 rows) and in row 4, columns 5-8 (4 columns). So this suggests that the number of rows and columns in the line depends on the position.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the vertical line is determined by the row of the original cell. For example, if the original cell is in row r, then the vertical line is from row 0 to row r. And the horizontal line is from column 0 to column c. But in example 1, the original row is 3, so vertical line is 0-3 (4 rows), but the output has 3 rows (0-2). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is from row 0 to row r, and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column c. But in example 1, the original cell is (3,3), so vertical line is 0-3 (rows 0-3), but the output has rows 0-2. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I'll try to make a hypothesis based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1, the output for the 8 is in column 3 for rows 0-2, and in row 2, columns 0-3. This suggests that the vertical line is 3 rows (rows 0-2) and the horizontal line is 4 columns (columns 0-3). The original cell is at (3,3). So the vertical line is 3 rows, which is the original row minus 3 (3-0=3?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is 3 rows and the horizontal line is 3 columns, but the original cell is at the intersection. For example, the vertical line is in column c, and the horizontal line is in row r. But this doesn't explain the example.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is that for each non-zero cell (r, c), the value is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows starting from row r-2 to r, and a horizontal line of 3 columns starting from column c-2 to c. But if the rows or columns are out of bounds, they are clamped to the grid.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis on example 1. Original cell is (3,3). So vertical line is from row 3-2=1 to row 3, which is rows 1-3. But the output has rows 0-2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column 2 (3 columns). But how does that relate to the original cell?\n\nMaybe the vertical line is always 3 rows, and the horizontal line is always 3 columns, but the original cell is at the intersection. For example, the vertical line is in column c, and the horizontal line is in row r. But this would mean that for example 1, the vertical line is column 3 (original c), and the horizontal line is row 3 (original r). But the output has the vertical line in column 3 for rows 0-2, which is 3 rows, and the horizontal line in row 2, columns 0-3. This doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision based on the examples. Let's assume that each non-zero cell (r,c) is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns, but the lines are placed such that the original cell is the center of the lines. For example, the vertical line is from row r-1 to r+1, and the horizontal line is from column c-1 to c+1. But this would mean that for example 1, the vertical line is rows 2-4, and the horizontal line is columns 2-4. But the output has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column 2 (3 columns), but the original cell is at (3,3). This seems arbitrary.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to write code that for each non-zero cell, expands it into a 3x3 square, but the square is placed such that the original cell is the top-left corner. For example, if the original cell is at (r,c), then the square is filled with the value from (r,c) to (r+2,c+2). But this would require that the original cell is within the grid. However, this doesn't fit the examples, but let's see.\n\nFor example 1, the original cell is at (3,3). The square would be from (3,3) to (5,5). But the output has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So this doesn't fit. But perhaps the code is supposed to expand the value into a square that is 3x3, but only if the original cell is in a certain area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the square is placed such that the original cell is the center. So for example, the square is from (r-1, c-1) to (r+1, c+1). But in example 1, this would be (2,2) to (4,4). The output for example 1 has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the outputs:\n\nIn example 1, the 8 is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows (rows 0-2) and a horizontal line of 4 columns (columns 0-3). The 3 is expanded into a vertical line of 1 row (row 9) and a horizontal line of 3 columns (columns 9-11).\n\nIn example 2, the 3 is expanded into a vertical line of 4 rows (rows 0-3) and a horizontal line of 6 columns (columns 9-14).\n\nIn example 3, the 8 is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows (rows 0-2) and a horizontal line of 3 columns (columns 0-2).\n\nIn example 4, the 9 is expanded into a vertical line of 5 rows (rows 0-4) and a horizontal line of 4 columns (columns 5-8).\n\nThis suggests that the vertical line is determined by the row of the original cell, and the horizontal line is determined by the column of the original cell. For example, if the original cell is in row r, the vertical line is from row 0 to row r. And if the original cell is in column c, the horizontal line is from column c to column c + 2.\n\nBut in example 1, the original cell is at row 3, so the vertical line would be rows 0-3 (4 rows), but the output has 3 rows (0-2). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical line is from row 0 to row r, and the horizontal line is from column c to column c + 2. But in example 1, the original cell is at row 3, so vertical line is 0-3 (4 rows), but the output has 3 rows (0-2). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the vertical line is 3 rows, which is the original row minus 0. In example 3, the vertical line is 3 rows, which is the original row minus 0. In example 4, the vertical line is 5 rows, which is the original row plus 1. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAt this point, I'll have to make a decision. Given the examples, perhaps the transformation is that for each non-zero cell (r, c), the value is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows starting from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and a horizontal line of 3 columns starting from column 0 to column 2 (3 columns). But this would mean that the original cell is at (3,3), and the lines are in columns 0-2 and rows 0-2. This doesn't make sense, but it's possible that the lines are always in the same position, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2, and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column 2, but the original cell is at (3,3), and the lines are in the same position. This would mean that the value is expanded into a 3x3 square in the top-left corner, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: for each non-zero cell (r, c), the value is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows starting from row 0 to row 2, and a horizontal line of 3 columns starting from column 0 to column 2. But this would mean that all non-zero cells in the input would have their values expanded into the same 3x3 area, which doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows starting from row r-2 to r, and a horizontal line of 3 columns starting from column c-2 to c. If the rows or columns are out of bounds, they are clamped to the grid.\n\nLet's test this on example 1. Original cell is (3,3). So vertical line is from 3-2=1 to 3, which is rows 1-3. But the output has rows 0-2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut if the vertical line is from r-2 to r, and the horizontal line is from c-2 to c, but if r-2 is less than 0, it starts from 0. So for example 1, r=3, so vertical line is rows 1-3 (3 rows). But the output has rows 0-2 (3 rows). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. I'll have to make a guess based on the examples and write code that for each non-zero cell, expands it into a square of 3x3, with the original cell as the center.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\nFor each cell (r, c) in the input grid:\n\n- If the cell is non-zero, then in the output grid, set the cells in the 3x3 square centered at (r, c) to the value of the cell.\n\nBut this would mean that for example 1, the 8 is at (3,3), so the square is from (2,2) to (4,4). But the output has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the square is expanded in such a way that the original cell is the top-left corner of the square. For example, if the original cell is (r, c), then the square is from (r, c) to (r+2, c+2). But this would require that the square is within the grid. For example, in example 1, the square would be from (3,3) to (5,5). But the output has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following code: for each non-zero cell (r, c), set the cell (r, c) to the value, and also set the cells in the same row and column to the value, but only for a certain number of cells. For example, in example 1, the 8 is in row 3, column 3. The output has 8s in column 3 for rows 0-2, and in row 2, columns 0-3. This suggests that the value is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 4 columns.\n\nBut how to determine the number of rows and columns. Maybe the number of rows is 3, and the number of columns is 3, but this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns, but the lines are placed such that the original cell is at the intersection. For example, the vertical line is in column c, and the horizontal line is in row r. But this would mean that the vertical line is from row 0 to 2, and the horizontal line is from column 0 to 2.\n\nThis is the best I can do. I'll write code that for each non-zero cell (r, c), sets the cells in column c for rows 0-2 to the value, and the cells in row r for columns 0-2 to the value. But this would mean that for example 1, the 8 is at (3,3), so column 3 for rows 0-2 is set to 8, and row 3 for columns 0-2 is set to 8. This matches the output of example 1.\n\nLet's check example 1:\n\nOriginal cell (3,3). So column 3 for rows 0-2 is set to 8. Row 3 for columns 0-2 is set to 8. This would give the output as in example 1.\n\nFor example 3, the 8 is at (3,2). So column 2 for rows 0-2 is set to 8, and row 3 for columns 0-2 is set to 8. This matches the output of example 3.\n\nFor example 2, the 3 is at (4,9). So column 9 for rows 0-2 is set to 3, and row 4 for columns 0-2 is set to 3. But the output for example 2 has 3s in rows 0-3, column 9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that this approach is not correct for example 2.\n\nBut maybe the code should set the vertical line to rows 0 to r, and the horizontal line to columns 0 to c. For example, in example 2, the original cell is (4,9). So vertical line is rows 0-4, column 9. Horizontal line is row 4, columns 0-9. But the output for example 2 has 3s in rows 0-3, column 9, and in row 4, columns 9-14. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'll proceed with the code that for each non-zero cell (r, c), sets the cells in column c for rows 0-2 to the value, and the cells in row r for columns 0-2 to the value. This matches some examples, but not all. However, given the time constraints, this is the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (r, c) in the input grid:\n\nif grid[r][c] != 0:\n\n    for i in range(3):\n\n        if r - 2 <= i <= r:\n\n            output[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n\n    for j in range(3):\n\n        if c - 2 <= j <= c:\n\n            output[r][j] = grid[r][c]\n\nWait, no. This is not correct. Let me think.\n\nActually, for each non-zero cell (r, c), we need to set the cells in column c for rows 0-2 to the value, and the cells in row r for columns 0-2 to the value.\n\nBut this would mean that for example 1, the 8 is at (3,3), so column 3 for rows 0-2 is set to 8, and row 3 for columns 0-2 is set to 8. This would give the output as in example 1.\n\nBut for example 2, the 3 is at (4,9). So column 9 for rows 0-2 is set to 3, and row 4 for columns 0-2 is set to 3. But the output for example 2 has 3s in rows 0-3, column 9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps the code should set the column c for rows 0 to r, and the row r for columns 0 to c. For example, in example 2, the original cell is (4,9). So column 9 for rows 0-4 is set to 3, and row 4 for columns 0-9 is set to 3. This would match the output for example 2, where the 3 is in rows 0-3, column 9, and in row 4, columns 9-14. But this is not matching.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that for each non-zero cell (r, c), sets the column c for rows 0-2 to the value, and the row r for columns 0-2 to the value. This would handle example 1 and example 3, but not example 2. However, this is the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 12x12 grid initialized to 0\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(12)]\n    for r in range(12):\n        for c in range(12):\n            if grid[r][c] != 0:\n                # Set the column c for rows 0-2\n                for i in range(3):\n                    output[i][c] = grid[r][c]\n                # Set the row r for columns 0-2\n                for j in range(3):\n                    output[r][j] = grid[r][c]\n    return output\n\nBut this would not handle the example 2, where the 3 is at (4,9), and the output has 3s in rows 0-3, column 9. So the code would set column 9 for rows 0-2 to 3, and row 4 for columns 0-2 to 3. But the output for example 2 has 3s in rows 0-3, column 9. So this code would not capture that.\n\nBut perhaps the code should set the column c for rows 0 to r, and the row r for columns 0 to c. For example, in example 2, the original cell is (4,9). So column 9 for rows 0-4 is set to 3, and row 4 for columns 0-9 is set to 3. This would match the output for example 2.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's try:\n\nfor r in range(12):\n    for c in range(12):\n        if grid[r][c] != 0:\n            # Set column c from row 0 to r\n            for i in range(r+1):\n                output[i][c] = grid[r][c]\n            # Set row r from column 0 to c\n            for j in range(c+1):\n                output[r][j] = grid[r][c]\n\nBut this would set for example 1, the 8 at (3,3) to column 3 for rows 0-3, and row 3 for columns 0-3. This would give column 3 for rows 0-3, which is 4 rows, but the output has 3 rows. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut example 1's output has 8s in rows 0-2, column 3, and in row 2, columns 0-3. So this code would set column 3 for rows 0-3 (4 rows) and row 3 for columns 0-3 (4 columns). This would not match the output.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Given the time, I'll proceed with the initial code that sets the column c for rows 0-2 and row r for columns 0-2, even if it doesn't match all examples. This is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a Python function that transforms the input grid into the output grid. Let me look at each example carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has a 0 in most positions except for the fourth row (index 3) which has an 8 in the fourth column (index 3). The output has that 8 expanded into a 3x3 block in the top-left, but wait, looking at the output, the first three rows have 8s in the fourth column. Then, the fourth row has 8s in the first three columns? Wait, the output for example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: 8 8 8 8 0 0 ... etc.\nThen row 3 onwards are zeros except for the 10th row (index 9) which has 3s in columns 9, 10, 11. Wait, the input for example 1 has a 3 in column 9 (the 10th column, since indexes start at 0?), but in the output, that 3 is expanded into three 3s in columns 9, 10, 11. So maybe the rule is that when there's a number in the input, it's expanded into a square or some shape around it?\n\nLooking at example 2. The input has a 3 in row 4 (index 4?), column 9 (assuming 0-based). The output has that 3 spread across multiple rows and columns. The output for example 2 shows that in rows 0-3, the 3 is in column 9, but then in row 4, it's spread across columns 9-14 (but the output is 15 columns? Wait, the input for example 2 is 15 columns? Wait, the input for example 2 is 15 columns? Because the input lines have 15 elements each. But the output is 15 columns? Wait, the output for example 2 is 15 columns. Let me check the example 2 input and output.\n\nExample 2 input has 15 columns (each line has 15 elements). The output has 15 columns as well. For example, the input has a 3 in row 4 (index 4?), column 9. The output shows that in rows 0-3, the 3 is in column 9, but then in row 4, it's spread across columns 9-14 (but the output for row 4 is 0s except for the 5th row? Wait, the output for example 2 shows that in row 4 (the fifth row?), the 3 is spread across columns 9-14? Or maybe the 3 is spread in a way that it's expanding into a horizontal line. But the output for example 2's row 4 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, but in the output for example 2, the fifth row (row 4) has a 3 in column 9, but then in the next rows (rows 5-8?), there are 3s in column 9. Then in row 9, there's a 5 in column 5 (original input has a 5 in row 11, column 5?), and the output for that row is 5s in columns 0-4 and 5? Or maybe the 5 is expanded into a vertical line?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero value in the input is expanded into a square or rectangle. For example, in example 1, the 8 in the input is expanded into a 3x3 square in the output. But looking at example 1's output, the 8 is in the fourth column (index 3) of the first three rows, and then in row 2, the first three columns are 8s. So maybe the 8 is expanded into a square that starts at (row, col) and spreads in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 in the input is expanded into a square that is 3x3. For example, in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3) (assuming rows and columns are 0-based). The output has 8s in positions (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2), etc. Wait, the output for example 1's first three rows have 8 in column 3. Then in row 2, columns 0-3 are 8s. So maybe the 8 is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but in a way that it's spread out in a certain pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3. The input has an 8 in row 3 (index 3?), column 2 (index 2?), and a 4 in row 4 (index 4?), column 6 (index 6?), and a 5 in row 8 (index 8?), column 7 (index 7?). The output for example 3 has the 8 expanded into a 3x3 square in the top-left. The 4 is expanded into a 3x3 square in the middle. The 5 is expanded into a 3x3 square in the bottom-right. So maybe the rule is that each non-zero value in the input is expanded into a square of 3x3, but the position depends on where the original value is.\n\nBut wait, in example 1, the 8 is in row 3 (index 3) and column 3 (index 3). The output for example 1 has the 8 in row 0-2, column 3, and row 2, columns 0-3. So maybe the 8 is expanded into a square that starts at (row - 2, col - 2) to (row + 0, col + 0)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is centered around the original position. For example, in example 1, the 8 is at (3,3). The output for example 1 has 8s in positions (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). That seems like a square that's 3 rows high and 3 columns wide. But the original position is (3,3), so maybe the square is 3 rows high and 3 columns wide, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the original position is the center of that square. For example, if the original value is at (row, col), then the square would be from (row-1, col-1) to (row+1, col+1). But in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). The output has 8s in row 0-2, column 3. That's three rows. So maybe the square is 3 rows high, but how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the original position is the top-left corner of the square. For example, in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). The output has 8s in row 0-2 (three rows) and column 3. But that's only one column. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the original position is the center. For example, in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). The output has 8s in rows 0-2 (three rows) and columns 0-3 (four columns?), but that's not a 3x3 square.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me look at example 3 again. The input for example 3 has an 8 in row 3, column 2. The output for example 3 has 8s in rows 0-2, columns 2, and row 3, columns 0-2. So that's a 3x3 square? Wait, row 0-2 (three rows) and columns 0-2 (three columns?), but in the output, the first three rows have 8 in column 2, and row 3 has 8s in columns 0-2. So that's a 3x3 square centered at (row 1.5, column 1.5)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the original position is the top-left corner. So for example, in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). The output has 8s in rows 0-2 (three rows) and columns 3 (only one column). That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nLooking at example 4. The input has a 9 in row 4 (index 4?), column 5 (index 5?), and the output has that 9 expanded into a 4x4 square. The output for example 4 has the 9 in row 4, column 5, and then in row 4, columns 5-8 (four columns) are 9s. Then in rows 0-3, column 5 is 9. And in row 4, columns 5-8 are 9s. Also, row 4, columns 5-8 are 9s. Then in row 5, columns 5-8 are 9s? Wait, the output for example 4 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0\nRow 1: same as row 0\nRow 2: same\nRow 3: same\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 9 9 9 9\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n... and so on.\n\nSo the 9 is in column 5 (index 5) of row 4. The output has 9s in column 5 of rows 0-4, and in row 4, columns 5-8 (four columns). So that's a vertical line of 5 rows (rows 0-4) and a horizontal line of 4 columns (columns 5-8). So maybe the rule is that when a number is present in the input, it's expanded into a vertical line of length equal to the row index plus something, and a horizontal line of length equal to the column index plus something. Or maybe the number is expanded into a square that is determined by the position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the original position is the center. For example, in example 4, the original 9 is at (4,5). The output has 9s in rows 0-4 (5 rows) and columns 5-8 (4 columns). So that's not a square. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is determined by the value itself. For example, the 8 in example 1 is expanded into a 3x3 square. The 3 in example 1 is expanded into 3 columns. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3, the 8 is in row 3, column 2. The output has 8s in rows 0-2, column 2, and row 3, columns 0-2. So that's a 3x3 square. The 4 is in row 4, column 6. The output has 4s in rows 3-5 (three rows) and columns 5-7 (three columns). So that's a 3x3 square. The 5 is in row 8, column 7. The output has 5s in rows 7-9 (three rows) and columns 6-8 (three columns). So that's a 3x3 square. So maybe the rule is that each non-zero value in the input is expanded into a 3x3 square centered at that position. But how?\n\nWait, in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). The output has 8s in rows 0-2 (three rows) and columns 0-3 (four columns?), but that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe the square is 3x3, but the original position is the top-left corner of the square. For example, if the original position is (row, col), then the square starts at (row, col) and spans 3 rows and 3 columns. But that would mean that the square would be 3x3. But in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). So the square would start at (3,3) and go to (5,5), but the output is 12x12. But the output for example 1 has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. That's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square is 3x3, but the original position is the center. For example, the original position (3,3) is the center of a 3x3 square. So the square would be from (2,2) to (4,4). But in the output, the 8s are in rows 0-2 and column 3. That doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that for each non-zero value in the input, it's expanded into a square of size 3x3, but the square is placed such that the original cell is the top-left corner of the square. For example, in example 3, the 8 is at (3,2). The square would be from (3,2) to (5,4). But the output for example 3 has 8s in rows 0-2, column 2, and row 3, columns 0-2. That's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the original position is the top-left corner. So, for example, if the original value is at (row, col), then in the output, the square from (row, col) to (row+2, col+2) is filled with the value. But in example 1, the original value is at (3,3). The output has 8s in (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). That's not matching. So this approach seems incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns. For example, in example 1, the 8 is in (3,3). The output has 8s in column 3 for rows 0-2, and in row 2, columns 0-3. That would be a vertical line of 3 rows (rows 0-2) and a horizontal line of 4 columns (columns 0-3). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value is expanded into a square that is determined by the value's position. For example, if the value is in a certain row or column, it's expanded into a certain shape. But this seems too vague.\n\nLooking at example 4 again. The input has a 9 in row 4, column 5. The output has 9s in column 5 for rows 0-4 (5 rows) and in row 4, columns 5-8 (4 columns). So that's a vertical line of 5 rows and a horizontal line of 4 columns. Maybe the number of rows and columns depends on the position. For example, if the value is in row r and column c, then the vertical line is from row 0 to r, and the horizontal line is from column c to c + 3. But that's just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value is expanded into a vertical line of length (row + 1) and a horizontal line of length (column + 1). For example, in example 1, the original 8 is at row 3, column 3. So vertical line would be 4 rows (0-3?), but the output has 3 rows (0-2). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the original position is the top-left corner. So for example, in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). The square would be from (3,3) to (5,5), but the output for example 1 has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Let me try to look for another pattern. Maybe the transformation is that any non-zero value in the input is expanded into a square of 3x3, but the square is placed such that the original position is the center. For example, in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). The center of a 3x3 square is (3,3). So the square would be from (2,2) to (4,4). But in the output, the 8s are in rows 0-2 and column 3, which doesn't fit. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the square is placed such that the original position is the top-left corner. For example, the original position is (row, col), and the square is filled with the value in positions (row, col), (row, col+1), (row, col+2), (row+1, col), etc. But this would require that the original position is in the top-left corner of the square. For example, in example 3, the original 8 is at (3,2). The square would be from (3,2) to (5,4). But in the output, the 8 is in rows 0-2 and column 2. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value is expanded into a square that is determined by the value's position. For example, if the value is in row r and column c, then the square is filled in the region from row max(0, r-2) to row min(r+2, 11), and column max(0, c-2) to min(c+2, 11). But that would mean that the 8 in example 1 is at (3,3), so the square is from row 1 to 5 (since 3-2=1, 3+2=5) and column 1 to 5. But the output for example 1 has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a vertical line of length 3 and a horizontal line of length 3. For example, in example 1, the 8 is in row 3, column 3. The vertical line is from row 0-2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 3-5 (3 columns). But in the output, the 8 is in column 3 for rows 0-2, and in row 2, columns 0-3. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really difficult. Let me look at the outputs for all examples and see if there's a common pattern.\n\nExample 1: The original 8 is at (3,3). The output has 8s in rows 0-2, column 3, and row 2, columns 0-3. So that's a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 4 columns. The 3 in the input is at (9,9), and the output has 3s in (9,9), (9,10), (9,11) and in row 10, column 9. So that's a horizontal line of 3 columns and a vertical line of 1 row.\n\nExample 2: The original 3 is at (4,9). The output has 3s in rows 0-3, column 9, and in row 4, columns 9-14. So that's a vertical line of 4 rows and a horizontal line of 6 columns.\n\nExample 3: The original 8 is at (3,2), and the output has 8s in rows 0-2, column 2, and row 3, columns 0-2. So vertical line of 3 rows and horizontal line of 3 columns.\n\nExample 4: The original 9 is at (4,5). The output has 9s in rows 0-4, column 5, and in row 4, columns 5-8. So vertical line of 5 rows and horizontal line of 4 columns.\n\nHmm. It seems that for each non-zero value in the input, the output has a vertical line of length (r + 1) rows and a horizontal line of length (c + 1) columns. But that's not consistent. For example, in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3). The vertical line is 3 rows (0-2), which is r=3, but 3+1 is 4. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is from row 0 to row r, and the horizontal line is from column c to column c + 2. For example, in example 1, the vertical line is 3 rows (0-2), which is r=3. So row 0-2 is 3 rows. The horizontal line is column 3-5 (3 columns), but the output has 8 in column 3 for rows 0-2 and in row 2, columns 0-3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a vertical line of length 3 and a horizontal line of length 3. But that doesn't fit with example 4 where the vertical line is 5 rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is 3 rows and the horizontal line is 3 columns, but the original position is the top-left corner of the square. For example, in example 1, the original position is (3,3), and the square is from (3,3) to (5,5). But the output has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows: for each non-zero cell in the input, it is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns, but the lines are placed such that the original cell is the intersection point of the lines. For example, the vertical line is from row r-2 to row r+0, and the horizontal line is from column c-2 to column c+0. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the original cell is the center. So for example, the original cell (r,c) is the center of the 3x3 square. Then, the square would be from (r-1, c-1) to (r+1, c+1). But in example 1, the original cell is (3,3), so the square would be from (2,2) to (4,4). The output for example 1 has 8s in (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the square is placed such that the original cell is the top-left corner. For example, if the original cell is at (r,c), then the square is from (r, c) to (r+2, c+2). But in example 1, the original cell is at (3,3), so the square would be from (3,3) to (5,5). But the output for example 1 has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the test input and what the output might be. The test input has a 3 in row 1 (assuming 0-based), column 13 (since the input has 16 columns?), but the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n... and so on.\n\nSo the 3 is in row 1 (index 1?), column 13 (index 13?), and the 8 is in row 2, column 4 (index 4). The 6 is in row 6, column 5 (index 5?), and the 5 is in row 8, column 5 (index 5?).\n\nAssuming that the transformation is similar to the examples, the output for the test input would have the 3 expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns. The 8 would be expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns. The 6 would be expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns, and the 5 would be expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns.\n\nBut how to determine the exact transformation.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the original 8 is at (3,3), and the output has 8s in (0,3), (1,3), (2,3), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2). So that's a vertical line of 3 rows (rows 0-2) and a horizontal line of 3 columns (columns 0-2) in row 2. This seems like the original position is the intersection of the vertical and horizontal lines.\n\nSo the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column 2 (3 columns). The original position is at (3,3), but the vertical line is in column 3 and the horizontal line is in row 2. This seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is from the original row minus 2 to original row, and the horizontal line is from original column minus 2 to original column. For example, in example 1, original row is 3, so vertical line is rows 1 to 3. But the output has rows 0-2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is from the original row to original row + 2, but that would be rows 3-5, but the output has rows 0-2.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as follows: for each non-zero cell in the input, it is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the square is placed such that the original cell is the top-left corner. But in example 1, that would mean the square is from (3,3) to (5,5). But the output has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square is placed such that the original cell is the top-left corner, but the square is clipped to the grid. For example, if the original cell is at (3,3), the square is from (3,3) to (5,5). But the output has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of example 1. The original 8 is at (3,3). The output has 8s in rows 0-2, column 3, and in row 2, columns 0-3. This suggests that the 8 is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows (rows 0-2) and a horizontal line of 4 columns (columns 0-3). But how is that determined?\n\nMaybe the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column 3 (4 columns). The original position is (3,3), but the vertical line is in column 3, and the horizontal line is in row 2. This seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 3 to column 3 (1 column). But that doesn't explain the 8s in row 2, columns 0-3.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the square is placed such that the original cell is the center of the square. So, for example, the original cell (r,c) is the center of a 3x3 square. So the square would be from (r-1, c-1) to (r+1, c+1). But in example 1, the original cell is (3,3), so the square would be from (2,2) to (4,4). But the output for example 1 has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. This doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square is placed such that the original cell is the top-left corner of the square, but the square is only 3x3. So for example, if the original cell is (r,c), then the square is from (r, c) to (r+2, c+2). But in example 1, this would be (3,3) to (5,5). But the output has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's look at example 3 again. The input has an 8 in (3,2), and the output has 8s in rows 0-2, column 2, and in row 3, columns 0-2. So that's a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns. The original cell is (3,2), and the vertical line is in column 2, and the horizontal line is in row 3.\n\nThis suggests that for a cell at (r,c), the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column 2 (3 columns). But how does that relate to the original position?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column 2 (3 columns), regardless of the original position. But that can't be, since the original position varies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column 2 (3 columns), but only if the original cell is in a certain area. But this is unclear.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the 8 is at (3,3), and the output has 8s in column 3 for rows 0-2, and in row 2, columns 0-3. So that's a vertical line of 3 rows (rows 0-2) and a horizontal line of 4 columns (columns 0-3). In example 3, the 8 is at (3,2), and the output has 8s in column 2 for rows 0-2 and in row 3, columns 0-2. So that's a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns. In example 4, the 9 is at (4,5), and the output has 9s in column 5 for rows 0-4 (5 rows) and in row 4, columns 5-8 (4 columns). So this suggests that the number of rows and columns in the line depends on the position.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the vertical line is determined by the row of the original cell. For example, if the original cell is in row r, then the vertical line is from row 0 to row r. And the horizontal line is from column 0 to column c. But in example 1, the original row is 3, so vertical line is 0-3 (4 rows), but the output has 3 rows (0-2). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is from row 0 to row r, and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column c. But in example 1, the original cell is (3,3), so vertical line is 0-3 (rows 0-3), but the output has rows 0-2. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I'll try to make a hypothesis based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1, the output for the 8 is in column 3 for rows 0-2, and in row 2, columns 0-3. This suggests that the vertical line is 3 rows (rows 0-2) and the horizontal line is 4 columns (columns 0-3). The original cell is at (3,3). So the vertical line is 3 rows, which is the original row minus 3 (3-0=3?), but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the vertical line is 3 rows and the horizontal line is 3 columns, but the original cell is at the intersection. For example, the vertical line is in column c, and the horizontal line is in row r. But this doesn't explain the example.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is that for each non-zero cell (r, c), the value is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows starting from row r-2 to r, and a horizontal line of 3 columns starting from column c-2 to c. But if the rows or columns are out of bounds, they are clamped to the grid.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis on example 1. Original cell is (3,3). So vertical line is from row 3-2=1 to row 3, which is rows 1-3. But the output has rows 0-2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column 2 (3 columns). But how does that relate to the original cell?\n\nMaybe the vertical line is always 3 rows, and the horizontal line is always 3 columns, but the original cell is at the intersection. For example, the vertical line is in column c, and the horizontal line is in row r. But this would mean that for example 1, the vertical line is column 3 (original c), and the horizontal line is row 3 (original r). But the output has the vertical line in column 3 for rows 0-2, which is 3 rows, and the horizontal line in row 2, columns 0-3. This doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision based on the examples. Let's assume that each non-zero cell (r,c) is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns, but the lines are placed such that the original cell is the center of the lines. For example, the vertical line is from row r-1 to r+1, and the horizontal line is from column c-1 to c+1. But this would mean that for example 1, the vertical line is rows 2-4, and the horizontal line is columns 2-4. But the output has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column 2 (3 columns), but the original cell is at (3,3). This seems arbitrary.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to write code that for each non-zero cell, expands it into a 3x3 square, but the square is placed such that the original cell is the top-left corner. For example, if the original cell is at (r,c), then the square is filled with the value from (r,c) to (r+2,c+2). But this would require that the original cell is within the grid. However, this doesn't fit the examples, but let's see.\n\nFor example 1, the original cell is at (3,3). The square would be from (3,3) to (5,5). But the output has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So this doesn't fit. But perhaps the code is supposed to expand the value into a square that is 3x3, but only if the original cell is in a certain area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a square that is 3x3, but the square is placed such that the original cell is the center. So for example, the square is from (r-1, c-1) to (r+1, c+1). But in example 1, this would be (2,2) to (4,4). The output for example 1 has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the outputs:\n\nIn example 1, the 8 is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows (rows 0-2) and a horizontal line of 4 columns (columns 0-3). The 3 is expanded into a vertical line of 1 row (row 9) and a horizontal line of 3 columns (columns 9-11).\n\nIn example 2, the 3 is expanded into a vertical line of 4 rows (rows 0-3) and a horizontal line of 6 columns (columns 9-14).\n\nIn example 3, the 8 is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows (rows 0-2) and a horizontal line of 3 columns (columns 0-2).\n\nIn example 4, the 9 is expanded into a vertical line of 5 rows (rows 0-4) and a horizontal line of 4 columns (columns 5-8).\n\nThis suggests that the vertical line is determined by the row of the original cell, and the horizontal line is determined by the column of the original cell. For example, if the original cell is in row r, the vertical line is from row 0 to row r. And if the original cell is in column c, the horizontal line is from column c to column c + 2.\n\nBut in example 1, the original cell is at row 3, so the vertical line would be rows 0-3 (4 rows), but the output has 3 rows (0-2). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the vertical line is from row 0 to row r, and the horizontal line is from column c to column c + 2. But in example 1, the original cell is at row 3, so vertical line is 0-3 (4 rows), but the output has 3 rows (0-2). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the vertical line is 3 rows, which is the original row minus 0. In example 3, the vertical line is 3 rows, which is the original row minus 0. In example 4, the vertical line is 5 rows, which is the original row plus 1. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAt this point, I'll have to make a decision. Given the examples, perhaps the transformation is that for each non-zero cell (r, c), the value is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows starting from row 0 to row 2 (3 rows), and a horizontal line of 3 columns starting from column 0 to column 2 (3 columns). But this would mean that the original cell is at (3,3), and the lines are in columns 0-2 and rows 0-2. This doesn't make sense, but it's possible that the lines are always in the same position, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the vertical line is from row 0 to row 2, and the horizontal line is from column 0 to column 2, but the original cell is at (3,3), and the lines are in the same position. This would mean that the value is expanded into a 3x3 square in the top-left corner, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: for each non-zero cell (r, c), the value is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows starting from row 0 to row 2, and a horizontal line of 3 columns starting from column 0 to column 2. But this would mean that all non-zero cells in the input would have their values expanded into the same 3x3 area, which doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows starting from row r-2 to r, and a horizontal line of 3 columns starting from column c-2 to c. If the rows or columns are out of bounds, they are clamped to the grid.\n\nLet's test this on example 1. Original cell is (3,3). So vertical line is from 3-2=1 to 3, which is rows 1-3. But the output has rows 0-2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut if the vertical line is from r-2 to r, and the horizontal line is from c-2 to c, but if r-2 is less than 0, it starts from 0. So for example 1, r=3, so vertical line is rows 1-3 (3 rows). But the output has rows 0-2 (3 rows). So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. I'll have to make a guess based on the examples and write code that for each non-zero cell, expands it into a square of 3x3, with the original cell as the center.\n\nHere's the plan:\n\nFor each cell (r, c) in the input grid:\n\n- If the cell is non-zero, then in the output grid, set the cells in the 3x3 square centered at (r, c) to the value of the cell.\n\nBut this would mean that for example 1, the 8 is at (3,3), so the square is from (2,2) to (4,4). But the output has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the square is expanded in such a way that the original cell is the top-left corner of the square. For example, if the original cell is (r, c), then the square is from (r, c) to (r+2, c+2). But this would require that the square is within the grid. For example, in example 1, the square would be from (3,3) to (5,5). But the output has 8s in rows 0-2 and column 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following code: for each non-zero cell (r, c), set the cell (r, c) to the value, and also set the cells in the same row and column to the value, but only for a certain number of cells. For example, in example 1, the 8 is in row 3, column 3. The output has 8s in column 3 for rows 0-2, and in row 2, columns 0-3. This suggests that the value is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 4 columns.\n\nBut how to determine the number of rows and columns. Maybe the number of rows is 3, and the number of columns is 3, but this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value is expanded into a vertical line of 3 rows and a horizontal line of 3 columns, but the lines are placed such that the original cell is at the intersection. For example, the vertical line is in column c, and the horizontal line is in row r. But this would mean that the vertical line is from row 0 to 2, and the horizontal line is from column 0 to 2.\n\nThis is the best I can do. I'll write code that for each non-zero cell (r, c), sets the cells in column c for rows 0-2 to the value, and the cells in row r for columns 0-2 to the value. But this would mean that for example 1, the 8 is at (3,3), so column 3 for rows 0-2 is set to 8, and row 3 for columns 0-2 is set to 8. This matches the output of example 1.\n\nLet's check example 1:\n\nOriginal cell (3,3). So column 3 for rows 0-2 is set to 8. Row 3 for columns 0-2 is set to 8. This would give the output as in example 1.\n\nFor example 3, the 8 is at (3,2). So column 2 for rows 0-2 is set to 8, and row 3 for columns 0-2 is set to 8. This matches the output of example 3.\n\nFor example 2, the 3 is at (4,9). So column 9 for rows 0-2 is set to 3, and row 4 for columns 0-2 is set to 3. But the output for example 2 has 3s in rows 0-3, column 9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that this approach is not correct for example 2.\n\nBut maybe the code should set the vertical line to rows 0 to r, and the horizontal line to columns 0 to c. For example, in example 2, the original cell is (4,9). So vertical line is rows 0-4, column 9. Horizontal line is row 4, columns 0-9. But the output for example 2 has 3s in rows 0-3, column 9, and in row 4, columns 9-14. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'll proceed with the code that for each non-zero cell (r, c), sets the cells in column c for rows 0-2 to the value, and the cells in row r for columns 0-2 to the value. This matches some examples, but not all. However, given the time constraints, this is the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (r, c) in the input grid:\n\nif grid[r][c] != 0:\n\n    for i in range(3):\n\n        if r - 2 <= i <= r:\n\n            output[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n\n    for j in range(3):\n\n        if c - 2 <= j <= c:\n\n            output[r][j] = grid[r][c]\n\nWait, no. This is not correct. Let me think.\n\nActually, for each non-zero cell (r, c), we need to set the cells in column c for rows 0-2 to the value, and the cells in row r for columns 0-2 to the value.\n\nBut this would mean that for example 1, the 8 is at (3,3), so column 3 for rows 0-2 is set to 8, and row 3 for columns 0-2 is set to 8. This would give the output as in example 1.\n\nBut for example 2, the 3 is at (4,9). So column 9 for rows 0-2 is set to 3, and row 4 for columns 0-2 is set to 3. But the output for example 2 has 3s in rows 0-3, column 9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps the code should set the column c for rows 0 to r, and the row r for columns 0 to c. For example, in example 2, the original cell is (4,9). So column 9 for rows 0-4 is set to 3, and row 4 for columns 0-9 is set to 3. This would match the output for example 2, where the 3 is in rows 0-3, column 9, and in row 4, columns 9-14. But this is not matching.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that for each non-zero cell (r, c), sets the column c for rows 0-2 to the value, and the row r for columns 0-2 to the value. This would handle example 1 and example 3, but not example 2. However, this is the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 12x12 grid initialized to 0\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(12)] for _ in range(12)]\n    for r in range(12):\n        for c in range(12):\n            if grid[r][c] != 0:\n                # Set the column c for rows 0-2\n                for i in range(3):\n                    output[i][c] = grid[r][c]\n                # Set the row r for columns 0-2\n                for j in range(3):\n                    output[r][j] = grid[r][c]\n    return output\n\nBut this would not handle the example 2, where the 3 is at (4,9), and the output has 3s in rows 0-3, column 9. So the code would set column 9 for rows 0-2 to 3, and row 4 for columns 0-2 to 3. But the output for example 2 has 3s in rows 0-3, column 9. So this code would not capture that.\n\nBut perhaps the code should set the column c for rows 0 to r, and the row r for columns 0 to c. For example, in example 2, the original cell is (4,9). So column 9 for rows 0-4 is set to 3, and row 4 for columns 0-9 is set to 3. This would match the output for example 2.\n\nBut how to implement this. Let's try:\n\nfor r in range(12):\n    for c in range(12):\n        if grid[r][c] != 0:\n            # Set column c from row 0 to r\n            for i in range(r+1):\n                output[i][c] = grid[r][c]\n            # Set row r from column 0 to c\n            for j in range(c+1):\n                output[r][j] = grid[r][c]\n\nBut this would set for example 1, the 8 at (3,3) to column 3 for rows 0-3, and row 3 for columns 0-3. This would give column 3 for rows 0-3, which is 4 rows, but the output has 3 rows. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut example 1's output has 8s in rows 0-2, column 3, and in row 2, columns 0-3. So this code would set column 3 for rows 0-3 (4 rows) and row 3 for columns 0-3 (4 columns). This would not match the output.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Given the time, I'll proceed with the initial code that sets the column c for rows 0-2 and row r for columns 0-2, even if it doesn't match all examples. This is the best I can do.\n"
