          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the transformation seems to involve expanding or propagating the value 8 in certain patterns. In Example 1, the 8s in the input are expanded to form a horizontal line of 8s. In Example 2, the 8s are expanded in a more complex pattern. In Example 3, the 8s are expanded in a more complex pattern as well.\n\nFrom these examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves expanding the value 8 in a way that connects all adjacent 8s and propagates them to neighboring cells.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Create a queue for BFS\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    # Find all positions with value 8\n    queue = deque()\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Directions: up, right, down, left\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]\n    \n    # Perform BFS to propagate 8s\n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check all four directions\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            \n            # Check if the new position is within bounds\n            if 0 <= nx < 10 and 0 <= ny < 10:\n                # If the new position is 0, set it to 8 and add to queue\n                if transformed[nx][ny] == 0:\n                    transformed[nx][ny] = 8\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Create a queue for BFS\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    # Find all positions with value 8\n    queue = deque()\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Directions: up, right, down, left\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]\n    \n    # Perform BFS to propagate 8s\n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check all four directions\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            \n            # Check if the new position is within bounds\n            if 0 <= nx < 10 and 0 <= ny < 10:\n                # If the new position is 0, set it to 8 and add to queue\n                if transformed[nx][ny] == 0:\n                    transformed[nx][ny] = 8\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n    \n    return transformed\n```",
