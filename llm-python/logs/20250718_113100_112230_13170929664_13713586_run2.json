The number 6 in Example 3 spreads to the right and down\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that non-zero values spread to the right and down, filling in adjacent cells with the same value.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for row in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for col in range(len(transformed_grid[row])):\n            # If the cell is not zero, spread it to the right and down\n            if transformed_grid[row][col] != 0:\n                # Spread to the right\n                for c in range(col + 1, len(transformed_grid[row])):\n                    if transformed_grid[row][c] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[row][c] = transformed_grid[row][col]\n                    else:\n                        break  # Stop if a non-zero value is encountered\n                # Spread down\n                for r in range(row + 1, len(transformed_grid)):\n                    if transformed_grid[r][col] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[r][col] = transformed_grid[row][col]\n                    else:\n                        break  # Stop if a non-zero value is encountered\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for row in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        for col in range(len(transformed_grid[row])):\n            # If the cell is not zero, spread it to the right and down\n            if transformed_grid[row][col] != 0:\n                # Spread to the right\n                for c in range(col + 1, len(transformed_grid[row])):\n                    if transformed_grid[row][c] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[row][c] = transformed_grid[row][col]\n                    else:\n                        break  # Stop if a non-zero value is encountered\n                # Spread down\n                for r in range(row + 1, len(transformed_grid)):\n                    if transformed_grid[r][col] == 0:\n                        transformed_grid[r][col] = transformed_grid[row][col]\n                    else:\n                        break  # Stop if a non-zero value is encountered\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
