          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function that maps input grids to output grids. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput has a 11x11 grid. The output seems to have some changes. Let's look at the first few rows. The input has a 1 in the second row, second column, and some 0s. The output has 1s in the same positions but also some 3s and 8s. Wait, looking at the output for example 1, the last row of input is 8 followed by zeros. The output's last row has 8s in the first three positions and then zeros. So maybe the 8 is being expanded or replicated in some way?\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 8 in the input (row 10, column 0) becomes 8 in the output's row 8, columns 0-2. Wait, the input's row 10 is [8, 0, 0, ...], and the output's row 8 is [0, 8, 8, 8, ...]. So maybe the 8 is being spread out in a certain way. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input: there's a 1 in row 5, column 1, and a 6 in row 6, column 10. The output for example 2 has those values copied to other positions. For instance, in row 5, column 1 is 1, and in the output, row 5, column 1 is 1, but column 10 is 6. Then in row 6, column 10 is 6, and in the output, row 6, column 10 is 6, but also in row 7, column 10 is 6. Wait, the output for example 2's row 7 is all zeros except for column 10? No, looking at the output for example 2: row 6, column 10 is 6, and row 7's column 10 is 0. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nIn example 2's input, the sixth row (row index 5?) is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0. The output for that row is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6. Then the next row (row 6 in input) is 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 6. So the 6 in the input's row 5, column 10 (assuming rows are 0-based) is copied to row 5, column 10 and then in row 6, column 10 and beyond? Or maybe the 6 is being spread to the right? But in example 2's output, row 5 has 6 in column 10 and 6 in column 11? Wait, the output for example 2's row 5 is 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6. Wait, the input's row 5 is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0. The output row 5 is 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6. So the 6 in column 10 is copied to column 10 and 11. But the input's row 5, column 10 is 6, and the output row 5, column 10 is 6, and column 11 is 6. Then in the next row (row 6), the output is 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 6. So the 6 is in column 7 (assuming 0-based) and then columns 7-10? Wait, the output row 6 for example 2 is 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 6. So the 6s start at column 7 and go to column 10. So perhaps the 6 in the input is being expanded to the right, and then the same for other numbers?\n\nLooking at example 3: the input has a 2 in row 9, column 5. The output for that row is 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is spread to the left and right? Wait, in the input, row 9 is 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output row 9 is 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is expanded to the left and right? But how? It's spread to the left and right, but not sure why. Also, in example 3's input, there's a 1 in row 1, column 4, and in the output, that 1 is preserved. But in row 2, column 4, it's 1, and in the output, it's 1. But in row 3, column 4, it's 1, and the output has 1. So maybe the 1s are preserved, but the 2 is spread?\n\nIn example 4, the input has a 8 in row 9, column 2. The output for that row is 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Then in the next rows, the 8 is spread to the right. For example, row 10 of input is 0 6 0 ... and the output for row 10 is 0 6 0 ... but in row 8, column 3 is 8, and in row 9, column 3 is 8. Then in row 10, column 3 is 8. Then in row 11, column 3 is 8. So the 8 is spread in a horizontal line?\n\nLooking for patterns, perhaps numbers are being expanded in certain directions. For example, in example 1, the 8 in the input is spread to the left and right? Or maybe it's being expanded in a certain way. Alternatively, maybe numbers are being replicated in a certain pattern based on their position.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the transformation that maps the input to output. Let's look at example 1's input and output. The input has a 3 in row 2, column 7. The output has a 3 in the same position, but also in row 2, column 8. Wait, the input's row 2 is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output row 2 is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. So the 3 is duplicated to the right. Similarly, in example 1's row 3, the input is 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 1 1 1 0 3 3 3 0 0 0. So the 3 is introduced in column 5 and 6, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are being spread to the right when they are in certain positions. For example, in example 1's input, the 3 is in row 2, column 7. The output has 3 in row 2, column 7 and 8. Then in row 3, the input has 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output has 0 1 1 1 0 3 3 3 0 0 0. So the 3 is introduced in column 5 and 6. So maybe the 3 is being spread to the right when it's in a certain area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are being spread to the right when they are in certain positions, like when there's a 1 in the same row. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking for a general rule. Let's think about the transformation steps. For example, in example 1, the 8 in the input is in row 10, column 0. The output for row 8 has 8 in columns 0-2. Then in row 9, columns 0-2 are 8. Then in row 10, columns 0-2 are 8. Then in row 11, columns 0-2 are 8. So the 8 is being spread to the left and right? Or maybe the 8 is being expanded in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being copied to adjacent cells if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a value, then the next cell to the right or left is also that value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread the numbers in certain directions. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to the left and right. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output has values that are not in the input. For example, in example 1, the output has 3s where the input had 0s. So the 3s are introduced in certain positions. Maybe the 3s are in positions where there's a 1 in the input, and then they are spread?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with their neighbors. For example, in example 1, the input has a 3 in row 2, column 7. The output has 3s in that position and to the right. Then in row 3, the input has 0s in columns 5-7, but the output has 3s in columns 5-7. So maybe the 3s are being spread to the right when there's a 1 in the same row?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to expand numbers in certain directions based on their value. For example, 3s are spread to the right, 8s are spread to the left and right, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left or right, but that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nLooking at example 4's input and output:\n\nInput row 1 (assuming 0-based) is 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0. So the 1 is duplicated to the right, and the 3 is duplicated to the right. Wait, the input row 1 has a 1 in column 3. The output has 1 in column 3 and 4. Then in row 2, the input has 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0. The output for row 2 is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0. Wait, but the output for row 2 has the 1s in column 2 and 3? Or maybe not. Wait, the input row 2 is 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0. The output for row 2 is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0. So the 1s in columns 2 and 3 are now in column 2 only. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the 1s are being replaced with 0s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to spread numbers in certain directions based on their value. For example, in example 4, the 1s are spread to the right. The 3 is spread to the right. The 8 is spread to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread numbers to the right if they are in a certain pattern. For example, if there's a 1 in the input, then the next cell to the right is also 1. But in example 1, the 1s in the input are spread to the right in the output. For example, the input row 1 is 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output row 1 is 0 1 1 1 0 3 3 3 0 0 0. So the 1s are preserved, but the 3s are introduced. Maybe the 3s are introduced where there are 1s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left or right if there's a certain condition. For example, in example 1, the 3 is introduced in the output where the input has 0s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking for the positions where the output has values that are not in the input. For example, in example 1's output, the 3s are in positions that were 0 in the input. But where do these 3s come from? Maybe the 3s are in the input's row 2, column 7. Then in the output, that 3 is spread to the right. Also, in row 3, the 3 is introduced. So perhaps the 3 is being spread to the right when there's a 1 in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread the numbers in the input to the right and left if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a value, then the adjacent cells are filled with that value. But that would not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's a certain value. For example, in example 4's input, the 1 in column 3 is copied to the right. The 3 in column 11 is copied to the right. The 8 in column 2 is copied to the right. So maybe the numbers are being spread to the right if they are in certain positions.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for the positions where the output has values that are not in the input. For example, in example 1's output, the 3s are in positions that were 0 in the input. So maybe the 3s are being introduced where the input has 0s, but only if there's a 1 in the same row. For example, in row 2 of example 1, the input has a 3 in column 7. The output has 3 in column 7 and 8. Then in row 3, the input has 0s in columns 5-7, but the output has 3s there. So maybe the 3 is being spread to the right when there's a 1 in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread the 3s to the right if there's a 1 in the same row. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are being spread to the right when there's a 1 in the same row. For example, in row 2 of example 1, there's a 1 in column 1. Then the 3 is spread to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are being introduced where there's a 1 in the same row and the cell to the right is 0. Then the 3 is copied to the right. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother observation: in example 3, the input has a 2 in row 9, column 5. The output has 2s spread to the left and right. So maybe the 2 is expanded to the left and right. Similarly, in example 4, the 8 is spread to the right. But how?\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to spread the numbers to the right if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a value, then the next cell to the right is also that value. But how to determine when this happens?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to expand numbers in the same row to the right if they are in a certain pattern. For example, if there's a group of 1s, then the 3s are introduced to the right of them. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the 8 in the input (row 10, column 0) is spread to the left and right. For example, in the output, row 8 has 8s in columns 0-2, row 9 has 8s in columns 0-2, row 10 has 8s in columns 0-2, and row 11 has 8s in columns 0-2. So the 8 is being spread to the left and right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is being expanded in a certain way based on its position. For example, if a cell has an 8, then the next cell to the left and right is also 8. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread the numbers in certain directions based on their value. For example, 3s are spread to the right, 8s are spread to the left and right, etc. But how to determine which values are spread where.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern where numbers are being expanded to the right in certain conditions.\n\nLooking at example 4's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output row 1: 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0. So the 1 is spread to the right, and the 3 is spread to the right. The 3 is in column 11 of the input. The output has 2s in columns 9 and 10. So maybe the 3 is spread to the right, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread numbers to the right if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a value, then the next cell to the right is also that value. But this would not fit all examples. For example, in example 1's input, the 3 in row 2 is in column 7. The output has 3 in column 7 and 8. So the 3 is spread to the right. Then in row 3, the input has 0s in columns 5-7, but the output has 3s there. So maybe the 3 is being introduced based on the previous row's 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread the 3s to the right when there's a 1 in the same row. For example, in row 2 of example 1, the 3 is in column 7. The input row 2 has 1s in columns 1-3. The output row 2 has 3s in columns 5-7. So perhaps the 3 is being introduced where there are 1s in the same row.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation might involve replacing certain values in the input with other values based on their position and neighboring cells. For example, if a cell has a 3, then the next cell to the right is also 3. Or if a cell has a 1, then the next cell to the right is 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to expand the numbers in the input to the right if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a non-zero value, then the next cell to the right is also that value. But how to determine when this happens.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the 3 in row 2, column 7 is spread to the right. In the input, the same cell is 3. So maybe the 3 is spread to the right. Similarly, in row 3 of example 1, the input has 0s in columns 5-7, but the output has 3s there. So maybe the 3 is being introduced based on the previous row's 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are being spread to the right when there is a 1 in the same row. For example, in row 2, there are 1s in columns 1-3. Then the 3 is introduced in columns 5-7. So perhaps the 3 is being introduced to the right of the 1s.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of spreading certain values to the right and left based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's a certain value. For example, in example 4's input row 1, the 1 is in column 3. The output has 1 in column 4. So the 1 is spread to the right. Similarly, the 3 in column 11 is spread to the right.\n\nBut how to determine which cells to spread.\n\nAnother observation: in example 3, the 2 is in row 9, column 5. The output has 2s spread to the left and right. So maybe the 2 is expanded to the left and right. For example, in row 9, columns 5-9 are 2s. Then in row 10, columns 5-9 are 2s. So the 2 is spread to the left and right in certain directions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to expand numbers to the left and right if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a value, then the next cell to the left and right is also that value. But this would not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to expand numbers in certain directions based on their value. For example, 3s are spread to the right, 8s are spread to the left and right, etc.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern. Perhaps the key is to find that certain values are being spread to the right or left based on their presence in the input.\n\nAnother approach: look for the transformation in terms of how the output is generated from the input. For example, in example 1, the 3 in the input is in row 2, column 7. The output has 3 in that position and the next column. Then in row 3, the input has 0s in columns 5-7, but the output has 3s there. So maybe the 3 is being spread to the right when there's a 1 in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3 is being spread to the right if the cell to the left is a 1. For example, in row 2 of example 1, the cell to the left of the 3 is a 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3 is being spread to the right if the cell to the left is a 1. But in row 2, the 3 is at column 7, and the cell to the left is column 6, which is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of spreading certain values to the right and left, and replacing 0s with certain values.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation might involve expanding certain values to the right and left based on their value. For example, if a cell has a value, then the next cell to the right is also that value. But this would not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread the numbers to the right if they are in a certain row or column.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 4's input and output: the 8 is in row 9, column 2. The output for row 8 has 8 in column 3. Then in row 9, column 3 is 8. In row 10, column 3 is 8. In row 11, column 3 is 8. So the 8 is spread to the right. But how?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to spread the numbers to the right if they are in a certain position. For example, if a cell has a value, then the next cell to the right is also that value. But how to determine when this happens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if the cell to the left is non-zero. For example, in example 1's input row 2, column 7 is 3. The output row 2, column 8 is 3. So the 3 is spread to the right. Similarly, in example 4's input row 1, column 3 is 1. The output row 1, column 4 is 1. So the 1 is spread to the right.\n\nBut then in example 3's input row 9, column 5 is 2. The output row 9, columns 5-9 are 2. So the 2 is spread to the right. So maybe the transformation is to spread non-zero values to the right, replacing 0s with the value of the cell to the left.\n\nBut how to handle this in code. For example, for each row, we can iterate from left to right, and if the current cell is non-zero, then the next cell is set to the same value. But this would not explain the examples where the 3 is spread to the right in row 3 of example 1.\n\nWait, in example 1's row 3, the input is 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 1 1 1 0 3 3 3 0 0 0. So the 3s are introduced in columns 5-7. But according to the previous idea, the 3s would be spread to the right from their original position. But in the input, the 3 is in row 2, column 7. So maybe the 3 is spread to the right in the next row.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe the transformation is to spread numbers to the right if they are in certain positions, like if there's a 1 in the same row. For example, in example 1's row 2, there are 1s in columns 1-3. The 3 is in column 7, and it's spread to the right. So maybe the 3 is being introduced where there are 1s in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread the 3s to the right when there's a 1 in the same row. But how to determine this.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the 3s are in positions where there are 1s in the same row. For example, in row 2, the 1s are in columns 1-3. The 3s are in columns 5-7. So perhaps the 3s are being introduced to the right of the 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if the cell to the left is a 1. But this would not explain all examples.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure of the exact pattern. However, based on the examples, I can try to write a function that spreads certain values to the right and left based on their positions.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the 3 is spread to the right. In example 4, the 1 is spread to the right, and the 3 is spread to the right. In example 3, the 2 is spread to the left and right. So maybe the transformation is to spread non-zero values to the right and left based on their value.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero. For example, for each row, iterate from left to right, and if the current cell is 0, set it to the value of the previous cell. This would explain some examples, like in example 1's row 2, the 3 is spread to the right. But this would not explain the example 3's 2 being spread to the left and right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread the values to the right and left if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a value, then the next cell to the right is also that value. But this would require checking for each cell.\n\nLet's try to implement this idea. For each row, iterate from left to right, and for each cell, if it's non-zero, set the next cell to the same value. But this would not explain the example 3's 2 being spread to the left and right.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell, if it's non-zero, set the next cell to the same value. This would spread the values to the right. But in example 1's row 2, the 3 is in column 7, and the next cell is 0, so it would be set to 3. Then in row 3, the input has 0s in columns 5-7, but the output has 3s there. So this would require that the 3 from row 2 is spread to row 3. But this is not covered by the previous idea.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation involves both horizontal and vertical spreading.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to code. Perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern where certain values are spread to the right and left based on their value.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll try to implement a function that spreads non-zero values to the right, and also spreads certain values to the left and right based on their value.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero. This would spread values to the right. Let's see if this works with the examples.\n\nExample 1's input row 2: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 \u2192 after spreading to the right, it would become 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3. But the output for row 2 is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1's output, the 3 is spread to the right in row 2, but not all the way. So maybe the spreading stops after a certain condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spreading is only done for certain values. For example, 3 is spread to the right, and 8 is spread to the left and right.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if the cell to the left is a 1. This would explain example 1's row 2, where the 3 is in column 7, and the 0s to the right are replaced with 3. But this would require that the 3 is in the same row.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll try to implement a function that spreads non-zero values to the right and left based on their value. For example, for each cell, if it's non-zero, then the next cell to the right is also that value, and the previous cell to the left is also that value. But this would not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell, if it's non-zero, then the next cell to the right is also that value. This would spread the values to the right. Let's try this.\n\nFor example, in example 1's row 2, the 3 is in column 7. The next cell is 0, so it becomes 3. Then the next cell is 0, becomes 3. So the row 2 becomes 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0. But the output is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut the output for row 2 has 3 in columns 7 and 8, but not 9. So maybe the spreading stops after a certain condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spreading is only done for certain values. For example, 3 is spread to the right, but 8 is spread to the left and right.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother approach: look for the transformation in terms of the output being a combination of the input and some expansion of certain values.\n\nIn example 1, the 3 in the input is expanded to the right, and the 8 in the input is expanded to the left and right. In example 4, the 1 is expanded to the right, and the 3 is expanded to the right. In example 3, the 2 is expanded to the left and right.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to expand certain values based on their value. For example, 3 is expanded to the right, 8 is expanded to the left and right, and 2 is expanded to the left and right.\n\nBut how to determine which values to expand and in which directions.\n\nGiven the time, I'll try to write a function that for each cell, if it's non-zero, then the next cell to the right is also that value. This would spread values to the right. Let's see:\n\nFor example, in example 1's row 2, the 3 is in column 7. The next cell is 0, so it becomes 3. The next cell is 0, becomes 3. But the output has 3 in column 8, but not 9. So this might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spreading is done only for certain values. For example, 3 is spread to the right, and 8 is spread to the left and right.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code. Given the time, I'll proceed with a function that for each row, spreads non-zero values to the right, and for certain values, spreads to the left and right.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and also replace 0s with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero.\n\nBut this would spread values in both directions.\n\nLet's try this. For each row, for each cell, if it's 0, set it to the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, or the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero. But this would require checking both directions.\n\nBut this is not clear. For example, in example 1's row 2, the cell to the left of column 7 is 0, so it's not set. The cell to the right is 0, so it's set to 3. So the cell becomes 3. Then the next cell to the right is 0, set to 3, and so on.\n\nThis would explain the spreading to the right in example 1's row 2. But for example 3's row 9, the 2 is in column 5. The cell to the left is 0, so it's not set. The cell to the right is 0, so it's set to 2. Then the next cell to the right is 0, set to 2, and so on. This would spread the 2 to the right, which matches example 3's output.\n\nBut how to handle the spreading to the left in example 3's row 9. For example, the 2 in column 5 is spread to the left and right. So this approach would only spread to the right, not the left.\n\nBut in example 3, the 2 is spread to the left and right. So this approach would not explain that.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this approach and see.\n\nThe code would be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n    for each column from 0 to 10:\n        if grid[row][col] is 0:\n            if grid[row][col-1] is not 0:\n                grid[row][col] = grid[row][col-1]\n            elif grid[row][col+1] is not 0:\n                grid[row][col] = grid[row][col+1]\n\nBut this is not correct, because it would set the cell to the value of the left or right cell, but it would overwrite the cell to the right. For example, if a cell is 0 and the right cell is non-zero, then the left cell would be set to the right cell's value, but this would not spread to the right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should spread to the right first, then to the left.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with a function that for each row, spreads non-zero values to the right, and for certain values, spreads to the left and right. But this is a guess.\n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Make a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row in range(11):\n        for col in range(11):\n            if transformed[row][col] != 0:\n                # Spread to the right\n                for c in range(col+1, 11):\n                    if transformed[row][c] == 0:\n                        transformed[row][c] = transformed[row][col]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Spread to the left\n                for c in range(col-1, -1, -1):\n                    if transformed[row][c] == 0:\n                        transformed[row][c] = transformed[row][col]\n                    else:\n                        break\n    return transformed\n\nBut this code would spread non-zero values to the left and right, replacing 0s. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nExample 1's input row 2: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. The code would process this row. The 3 is at column 7. It would spread to the right, setting columns 8 and 9 to 3. Then spread to the left, setting columns 6, 5, 4, etc. But in the input, the 3 is at column 7, and the left cells are 0. So the code would set columns 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 to 3. But the output for this row is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. So this code would not match the example.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is to spread certain values to the right based on their presence in the input.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the 3 is spread to the right in the same row, and in the next row, the 3 is spread to the right. So maybe the 3 is spread to the right in the same row and the next row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero. This would spread values to the right. Let's code this.\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row in range(11):\n        for col in range(11):\n            if transformed[row][col] == 0:\n                if col > 0 and transformed[row][col-1] != 0:\n                    transformed[row][col] = transformed[row][col-1]\n    return transformed\n\nTesting this on example 1's input row 2: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. The code would process this row. For column 0, it's 0, and the left cell is 0, so no change. For column 1, it's 1, no change. For column 2, it's 0, and the left cell is 1, so set to 1. Column 3 is 0, left cell is 0, so no. Column 4 is 0, left cell is 0. Column 5 is 0, left cell is 0. Column 6 is 0, left cell is 0. Column 7 is 3, no change. Column 8 is 0, left cell is 3, so set to 3. Column 9 is 0, left cell is 3, set to 3. Column 10 is 0, left cell is 3, set to 3. So the transformed row would be [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]. But the example's output for row 2 is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]. So this code would not match the example.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a different guess. Perhaps the transformation is to spread the values to the right and left based on the value's presence in the input.\n\nBut without more time, I'll have to proceed with a function that spreads non-zero values to the right and left, but only for certain values.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code, even though it may not be correct, but it's the best I can do under time pressure.\n\nFinal answer:\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function that maps input grids to output grids. Let's look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput has a 11x11 grid. The output seems to have some changes. Let's look at the first few rows. The input has a 1 in the second row, second column, and some 0s. The output has 1s in the same positions but also some 3s and 8s. Wait, looking at the output for example 1, the last row of input is 8 followed by zeros. The output's last row has 8s in the first three positions and then zeros. So maybe the 8 is being expanded or replicated in some way?\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 8 in the input (row 10, column 0) becomes 8 in the output's row 8, columns 0-2. Wait, the input's row 10 is [8, 0, 0, ...], and the output's row 8 is [0, 8, 8, 8, ...]. So maybe the 8 is being spread out in a certain way. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input: there's a 1 in row 5, column 1, and a 6 in row 6, column 10. The output for example 2 has those values copied to other positions. For instance, in row 5, column 1 is 1, and in the output, row 5, column 1 is 1, but column 10 is 6. Then in row 6, column 10 is 6, and in the output, row 6, column 10 is 6, but also in row 7, column 10 is 6. Wait, the output for example 2's row 7 is all zeros except for column 10? No, looking at the output for example 2: row 6, column 10 is 6, and row 7's column 10 is 0. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nIn example 2's input, the sixth row (row index 5?) is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0. The output for that row is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6. Then the next row (row 6 in input) is 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 6. So the 6 in the input's row 5, column 10 (assuming rows are 0-based) is copied to row 5, column 10 and then in row 6, column 10 and beyond? Or maybe the 6 is being spread to the right? But in example 2's output, row 5 has 6 in column 10 and 6 in column 11? Wait, the output for example 2's row 5 is 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6. Wait, the input's row 5 is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0. The output row 5 is 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 6. So the 6 in column 10 is copied to column 10 and 11. But the input's row 5, column 10 is 6, and the output row 5, column 10 is 6, and column 11 is 6. Then in the next row (row 6), the output is 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 6. So the 6 is in column 7 (assuming 0-based) and then columns 7-10? Wait, the output row 6 for example 2 is 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 6 6 6 6. So the 6s start at column 7 and go to column 10. So perhaps the 6 in the input is being expanded to the right, and then the same for other numbers?\n\nLooking at example 3: the input has a 2 in row 9, column 5. The output for that row is 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is spread to the left and right? Wait, in the input, row 9 is 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output row 9 is 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is expanded to the left and right? But how? It's spread to the left and right, but not sure why. Also, in example 3's input, there's a 1 in row 1, column 4, and in the output, that 1 is preserved. But in row 2, column 4, it's 1, and in the output, it's 1. But in row 3, column 4, it's 1, and the output has 1. So maybe the 1s are preserved, but the 2 is spread?\n\nIn example 4, the input has a 8 in row 9, column 2. The output for that row is 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Then in the next rows, the 8 is spread to the right. For example, row 10 of input is 0 6 0 ... and the output for row 10 is 0 6 0 ... but in row 8, column 3 is 8, and in row 9, column 3 is 8. Then in row 10, column 3 is 8. Then in row 11, column 3 is 8. So the 8 is spread in a horizontal line?\n\nLooking for patterns, perhaps numbers are being expanded in certain directions. For example, in example 1, the 8 in the input is spread to the left and right? Or maybe it's being expanded in a certain way. Alternatively, maybe numbers are being replicated in a certain pattern based on their position.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the transformation that maps the input to output. Let's look at example 1's input and output. The input has a 3 in row 2, column 7. The output has a 3 in the same position, but also in row 2, column 8. Wait, the input's row 2 is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output row 2 is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. So the 3 is duplicated to the right. Similarly, in example 1's row 3, the input is 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 1 1 1 0 3 3 3 0 0 0. So the 3 is introduced in column 5 and 6, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are being spread to the right when they are in certain positions. For example, in example 1's input, the 3 is in row 2, column 7. The output has 3 in row 2, column 7 and 8. Then in row 3, the input has 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output has 0 1 1 1 0 3 3 3 0 0 0. So the 3 is introduced in column 5 and 6. So maybe the 3 is being spread to the right when it's in a certain area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are being spread to the right when they are in certain positions, like when there's a 1 in the same row. But this is getting complicated.\n\nLooking for a general rule. Let's think about the transformation steps. For example, in example 1, the 8 in the input is in row 10, column 0. The output for row 8 has 8 in columns 0-2. Then in row 9, columns 0-2 are 8. Then in row 10, columns 0-2 are 8. Then in row 11, columns 0-2 are 8. So the 8 is being spread to the left and right? Or maybe the 8 is being expanded in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being copied to adjacent cells if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a value, then the next cell to the right or left is also that value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread the numbers in certain directions. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to the left and right. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output has values that are not in the input. For example, in example 1, the output has 3s where the input had 0s. So the 3s are introduced in certain positions. Maybe the 3s are in positions where there's a 1 in the input, and then they are spread?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with their neighbors. For example, in example 1, the input has a 3 in row 2, column 7. The output has 3s in that position and to the right. Then in row 3, the input has 0s in columns 5-7, but the output has 3s in columns 5-7. So maybe the 3s are being spread to the right when there's a 1 in the same row?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to expand numbers in certain directions based on their value. For example, 3s are spread to the right, 8s are spread to the left and right, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left or right, but that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nLooking at example 4's input and output:\n\nInput row 1 (assuming 0-based) is 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0. So the 1 is duplicated to the right, and the 3 is duplicated to the right. Wait, the input row 1 has a 1 in column 3. The output has 1 in column 3 and 4. Then in row 2, the input has 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0. The output for row 2 is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0. Wait, but the output for row 2 has the 1s in column 2 and 3? Or maybe not. Wait, the input row 2 is 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0. The output for row 2 is 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0. So the 1s in columns 2 and 3 are now in column 2 only. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe the 1s are being replaced with 0s?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to spread numbers in certain directions based on their value. For example, in example 4, the 1s are spread to the right. The 3 is spread to the right. The 8 is spread to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread numbers to the right if they are in a certain pattern. For example, if there's a 1 in the input, then the next cell to the right is also 1. But in example 1, the 1s in the input are spread to the right in the output. For example, the input row 1 is 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output row 1 is 0 1 1 1 0 3 3 3 0 0 0. So the 1s are preserved, but the 3s are introduced. Maybe the 3s are introduced where there are 1s in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left or right if there's a certain condition. For example, in example 1, the 3 is introduced in the output where the input has 0s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking for the positions where the output has values that are not in the input. For example, in example 1's output, the 3s are in positions that were 0 in the input. But where do these 3s come from? Maybe the 3s are in the input's row 2, column 7. Then in the output, that 3 is spread to the right. Also, in row 3, the 3 is introduced. So perhaps the 3 is being spread to the right when there's a 1 in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread the numbers in the input to the right and left if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a value, then the adjacent cells are filled with that value. But that would not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's a certain value. For example, in example 4's input, the 1 in column 3 is copied to the right. The 3 in column 11 is copied to the right. The 8 in column 2 is copied to the right. So maybe the numbers are being spread to the right if they are in certain positions.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for the positions where the output has values that are not in the input. For example, in example 1's output, the 3s are in positions that were 0 in the input. So maybe the 3s are being introduced where the input has 0s, but only if there's a 1 in the same row. For example, in row 2 of example 1, the input has a 3 in column 7. The output has 3 in column 7 and 8. Then in row 3, the input has 0s in columns 5-7, but the output has 3s there. So maybe the 3 is being spread to the right when there's a 1 in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread the 3s to the right if there's a 1 in the same row. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are being spread to the right when there's a 1 in the same row. For example, in row 2 of example 1, there's a 1 in column 1. Then the 3 is spread to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are being introduced where there's a 1 in the same row and the cell to the right is 0. Then the 3 is copied to the right. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother observation: in example 3, the input has a 2 in row 9, column 5. The output has 2s spread to the left and right. So maybe the 2 is expanded to the left and right. Similarly, in example 4, the 8 is spread to the right. But how?\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to spread the numbers to the right if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a value, then the next cell to the right is also that value. But how to determine when this happens?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to expand numbers in the same row to the right if they are in a certain pattern. For example, if there's a group of 1s, then the 3s are introduced to the right of them. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the 8 in the input (row 10, column 0) is spread to the left and right. For example, in the output, row 8 has 8s in columns 0-2, row 9 has 8s in columns 0-2, row 10 has 8s in columns 0-2, and row 11 has 8s in columns 0-2. So the 8 is being spread to the left and right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is being expanded in a certain way based on its position. For example, if a cell has an 8, then the next cell to the left and right is also 8. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread the numbers in certain directions based on their value. For example, 3s are spread to the right, 8s are spread to the left and right, etc. But how to determine which values are spread where.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern where numbers are being expanded to the right in certain conditions.\n\nLooking at example 4's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output row 1: 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0. So the 1 is spread to the right, and the 3 is spread to the right. The 3 is in column 11 of the input. The output has 2s in columns 9 and 10. So maybe the 3 is spread to the right, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread numbers to the right if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a value, then the next cell to the right is also that value. But this would not fit all examples. For example, in example 1's input, the 3 in row 2 is in column 7. The output has 3 in column 7 and 8. So the 3 is spread to the right. Then in row 3, the input has 0s in columns 5-7, but the output has 3s there. So maybe the 3 is being introduced based on the previous row's 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread the 3s to the right when there's a 1 in the same row. For example, in row 2 of example 1, the 3 is in column 7. The input row 2 has 1s in columns 1-3. The output row 2 has 3s in columns 5-7. So perhaps the 3 is being introduced where there are 1s in the same row.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation might involve replacing certain values in the input with other values based on their position and neighboring cells. For example, if a cell has a 3, then the next cell to the right is also 3. Or if a cell has a 1, then the next cell to the right is 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to expand the numbers in the input to the right if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a non-zero value, then the next cell to the right is also that value. But how to determine when this happens.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the 3 in row 2, column 7 is spread to the right. In the input, the same cell is 3. So maybe the 3 is spread to the right. Similarly, in row 3 of example 1, the input has 0s in columns 5-7, but the output has 3s there. So maybe the 3 is being introduced based on the previous row's 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3s are being spread to the right when there is a 1 in the same row. For example, in row 2, there are 1s in columns 1-3. Then the 3 is introduced in columns 5-7. So perhaps the 3 is being introduced to the right of the 1s.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of spreading certain values to the right and left based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's a certain value. For example, in example 4's input row 1, the 1 is in column 3. The output has 1 in column 4. So the 1 is spread to the right. Similarly, the 3 in column 11 is spread to the right.\n\nBut how to determine which cells to spread.\n\nAnother observation: in example 3, the 2 is in row 9, column 5. The output has 2s spread to the left and right. So maybe the 2 is expanded to the left and right. For example, in row 9, columns 5-9 are 2s. Then in row 10, columns 5-9 are 2s. So the 2 is spread to the left and right in certain directions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to expand numbers to the left and right if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a value, then the next cell to the left and right is also that value. But this would not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to expand numbers in certain directions based on their value. For example, 3s are spread to the right, 8s are spread to the left and right, etc.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern. Perhaps the key is to find that certain values are being spread to the right or left based on their presence in the input.\n\nAnother approach: look for the transformation in terms of how the output is generated from the input. For example, in example 1, the 3 in the input is in row 2, column 7. The output has 3 in that position and the next column. Then in row 3, the input has 0s in columns 5-7, but the output has 3s there. So maybe the 3 is being spread to the right when there's a 1 in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3 is being spread to the right if the cell to the left is a 1. For example, in row 2 of example 1, the cell to the left of the 3 is a 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3 is being spread to the right if the cell to the left is a 1. But in row 2, the 3 is at column 7, and the cell to the left is column 6, which is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of spreading certain values to the right and left, and replacing 0s with certain values.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation might involve expanding certain values to the right and left based on their value. For example, if a cell has a value, then the next cell to the right is also that value. But this would not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread the numbers to the right if they are in a certain row or column.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 4's input and output: the 8 is in row 9, column 2. The output for row 8 has 8 in column 3. Then in row 9, column 3 is 8. In row 10, column 3 is 8. In row 11, column 3 is 8. So the 8 is spread to the right. But how?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to spread the numbers to the right if they are in a certain position. For example, if a cell has a value, then the next cell to the right is also that value. But how to determine when this happens.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if the cell to the left is non-zero. For example, in example 1's input row 2, column 7 is 3. The output row 2, column 8 is 3. So the 3 is spread to the right. Similarly, in example 4's input row 1, column 3 is 1. The output row 1, column 4 is 1. So the 1 is spread to the right.\n\nBut then in example 3's input row 9, column 5 is 2. The output row 9, columns 5-9 are 2. So the 2 is spread to the right. So maybe the transformation is to spread non-zero values to the right, replacing 0s with the value of the cell to the left.\n\nBut how to handle this in code. For example, for each row, we can iterate from left to right, and if the current cell is non-zero, then the next cell is set to the same value. But this would not explain the examples where the 3 is spread to the right in row 3 of example 1.\n\nWait, in example 1's row 3, the input is 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 1 1 1 0 3 3 3 0 0 0. So the 3s are introduced in columns 5-7. But according to the previous idea, the 3s would be spread to the right from their original position. But in the input, the 3 is in row 2, column 7. So maybe the 3 is spread to the right in the next row.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Maybe the transformation is to spread numbers to the right if they are in certain positions, like if there's a 1 in the same row. For example, in example 1's row 2, there are 1s in columns 1-3. The 3 is in column 7, and it's spread to the right. So maybe the 3 is being introduced where there are 1s in the same row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread the 3s to the right when there's a 1 in the same row. But how to determine this.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the 3s are in positions where there are 1s in the same row. For example, in row 2, the 1s are in columns 1-3. The 3s are in columns 5-7. So perhaps the 3s are being introduced to the right of the 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if the cell to the left is a 1. But this would not explain all examples.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure of the exact pattern. However, based on the examples, I can try to write a function that spreads certain values to the right and left based on their positions.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the 3 is spread to the right. In example 4, the 1 is spread to the right, and the 3 is spread to the right. In example 3, the 2 is spread to the left and right. So maybe the transformation is to spread non-zero values to the right and left based on their value.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero. For example, for each row, iterate from left to right, and if the current cell is 0, set it to the value of the previous cell. This would explain some examples, like in example 1's row 2, the 3 is spread to the right. But this would not explain the example 3's 2 being spread to the left and right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to spread the values to the right and left if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell has a value, then the next cell to the right is also that value. But this would require checking for each cell.\n\nLet's try to implement this idea. For each row, iterate from left to right, and for each cell, if it's non-zero, set the next cell to the same value. But this would not explain the example 3's 2 being spread to the left and right.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell, if it's non-zero, set the next cell to the same value. This would spread the values to the right. But in example 1's row 2, the 3 is in column 7, and the next cell is 0, so it would be set to 3. Then in row 3, the input has 0s in columns 5-7, but the output has 3s there. So this would require that the 3 from row 2 is spread to row 3. But this is not covered by the previous idea.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation involves both horizontal and vertical spreading.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to code. Perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern where certain values are spread to the right and left based on their value.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll try to implement a function that spreads non-zero values to the right, and also spreads certain values to the left and right based on their value.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero. This would spread values to the right. Let's see if this works with the examples.\n\nExample 1's input row 2: 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 \u2192 after spreading to the right, it would become 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3. But the output for row 2 is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1's output, the 3 is spread to the right in row 2, but not all the way. So maybe the spreading stops after a certain condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spreading is only done for certain values. For example, 3 is spread to the right, and 8 is spread to the left and right.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if the cell to the left is a 1. This would explain example 1's row 2, where the 3 is in column 7, and the 0s to the right are replaced with 3. But this would require that the 3 is in the same row.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll try to implement a function that spreads non-zero values to the right and left based on their value. For example, for each cell, if it's non-zero, then the next cell to the right is also that value, and the previous cell to the left is also that value. But this would not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell, if it's non-zero, then the next cell to the right is also that value. This would spread the values to the right. Let's try this.\n\nFor example, in example 1's row 2, the 3 is in column 7. The next cell is 0, so it becomes 3. Then the next cell is 0, becomes 3. So the row 2 becomes 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0. But the output is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut the output for row 2 has 3 in columns 7 and 8, but not 9. So maybe the spreading stops after a certain condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spreading is only done for certain values. For example, 3 is spread to the right, but 8 is spread to the left and right.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAnother approach: look for the transformation in terms of the output being a combination of the input and some expansion of certain values.\n\nIn example 1, the 3 in the input is expanded to the right, and the 8 in the input is expanded to the left and right. In example 4, the 1 is expanded to the right, and the 3 is expanded to the right. In example 3, the 2 is expanded to the left and right.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to expand certain values based on their value. For example, 3 is expanded to the right, 8 is expanded to the left and right, and 2 is expanded to the left and right.\n\nBut how to determine which values to expand and in which directions.\n\nGiven the time, I'll try to write a function that for each cell, if it's non-zero, then the next cell to the right is also that value. This would spread values to the right. Let's see:\n\nFor example, in example 1's row 2, the 3 is in column 7. The next cell is 0, so it becomes 3. The next cell is 0, becomes 3. But the output has 3 in column 8, but not 9. So this might not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spreading is done only for certain values. For example, 3 is spread to the right, and 8 is spread to the left and right.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to code. Given the time, I'll proceed with a function that for each row, spreads non-zero values to the right, and for certain values, spreads to the left and right.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, and also replace 0s with the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero.\n\nBut this would spread values in both directions.\n\nLet's try this. For each row, for each cell, if it's 0, set it to the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero, or the value of the cell to the right if it's non-zero. But this would require checking both directions.\n\nBut this is not clear. For example, in example 1's row 2, the cell to the left of column 7 is 0, so it's not set. The cell to the right is 0, so it's set to 3. So the cell becomes 3. Then the next cell to the right is 0, set to 3, and so on.\n\nThis would explain the spreading to the right in example 1's row 2. But for example 3's row 9, the 2 is in column 5. The cell to the left is 0, so it's not set. The cell to the right is 0, so it's set to 2. Then the next cell to the right is 0, set to 2, and so on. This would spread the 2 to the right, which matches example 3's output.\n\nBut how to handle the spreading to the left in example 3's row 9. For example, the 2 in column 5 is spread to the left and right. So this approach would only spread to the right, not the left.\n\nBut in example 3, the 2 is spread to the left and right. So this approach would not explain that.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this approach and see.\n\nThe code would be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n    for each column from 0 to 10:\n        if grid[row][col] is 0:\n            if grid[row][col-1] is not 0:\n                grid[row][col] = grid[row][col-1]\n            elif grid[row][col+1] is not 0:\n                grid[row][col] = grid[row][col+1]\n\nBut this is not correct, because it would set the cell to the value of the left or right cell, but it would overwrite the cell to the right. For example, if a cell is 0 and the right cell is non-zero, then the left cell would be set to the right cell's value, but this would not spread to the right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the code should spread to the right first, then to the left.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with a function that for each row, spreads non-zero values to the right, and for certain values, spreads to the left and right. But this is a guess.\n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Make a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row in range(11):\n        for col in range(11):\n            if transformed[row][col] != 0:\n                # Spread to the right\n                for c in range(col+1, 11):\n                    if transformed[row][c] == 0:\n                        transformed[row][c] = transformed[row][col]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Spread to the left\n                for c in range(col-1, -1, -1):\n                    if transformed[row][c] == 0:\n                        transformed[row][c] = transformed[row][col]\n                    else:\n                        break\n    return transformed\n\nBut this code would spread non-zero values to the left and right, replacing 0s. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nExample 1's input row 2: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. The code would process this row. The 3 is at column 7. It would spread to the right, setting columns 8 and 9 to 3. Then spread to the left, setting columns 6, 5, 4, etc. But in the input, the 3 is at column 7, and the left cells are 0. So the code would set columns 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0 to 3. But the output for this row is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 0 0. So this code would not match the example.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven the time, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. Perhaps the transformation is to spread certain values to the right based on their presence in the input.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the 3 is spread to the right in the same row, and in the next row, the 3 is spread to the right. So maybe the 3 is spread to the right in the same row and the next row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the left if it's non-zero. This would spread values to the right. Let's code this.\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row in range(11):\n        for col in range(11):\n            if transformed[row][col] == 0:\n                if col > 0 and transformed[row][col-1] != 0:\n                    transformed[row][col] = transformed[row][col-1]\n    return transformed\n\nTesting this on example 1's input row 2: [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0, 0]. The code would process this row. For column 0, it's 0, and the left cell is 0, so no change. For column 1, it's 1, no change. For column 2, it's 0, and the left cell is 1, so set to 1. Column 3 is 0, left cell is 0, so no. Column 4 is 0, left cell is 0. Column 5 is 0, left cell is 0. Column 6 is 0, left cell is 0. Column 7 is 3, no change. Column 8 is 0, left cell is 3, so set to 3. Column 9 is 0, left cell is 3, set to 3. Column 10 is 0, left cell is 3, set to 3. So the transformed row would be [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 3, 3]. But the example's output for row 2 is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0]. So this code would not match the example.\n\nThus, this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a different guess. Perhaps the transformation is to spread the values to the right and left based on the value's presence in the input.\n\nBut without more time, I'll have to proceed with a function that spreads non-zero values to the right and left, but only for certain values.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code, even though it may not be correct, but it's the best I can do under time pressure.\n\nFinal answer:\n"
