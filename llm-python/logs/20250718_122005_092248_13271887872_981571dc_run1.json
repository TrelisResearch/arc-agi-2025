          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids to the output grids in the given examples. Let's look at the training examples and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output grids are both 30x30. The input has some numbers, and the output seems to have some changes. Let me check a few positions. For example, in the first row of Example 1's input, the first few numbers are 6 7 3 7 1 7 2 2 1 7... and the output starts with 6 7 3 7 1 7 2 2 1 7... So maybe the first row is the same? But looking further, the output's first row seems to have some changes. Wait, maybe not. Let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input and output grids are the same in some parts. For instance, the first row of input and output is the same. But looking at the third row of input and output, maybe there are some transformations. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are modified based on their position or some other rule.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the examples. Let me check Example 1's input and output. For example, in the input, there are some zeros. For instance, in the 7th row of input (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), maybe there are zeros. But the output for that row might have different values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of symmetry. For example, maybe the output is a reflection or rotation of the input. But looking at the first example, the input and output have different structures. Let me check the first example's input and output.\n\nWait, looking at the first example's input and output, the first row is the same. But looking at the second row, input is 7 6 9 9 7 7 5 5 7 6 5 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 1 5 6 7 5 5 7 7 9 9. The output's second row is 7 6 9 9 7 7 5 5 7 6 5 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 1 5 6 7 5 5 7 7 9 9. So they are the same. Wait, maybe the output is the same as the input? But that can't be, since the examples show different outputs. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input and output are the same? But that's impossible. Wait, the user provided the input and output for each example. Let me check the first example again. Wait, the input and output for example 1 are the same? Or maybe not. Let me check the first example's input and output. The input is a 30x30 grid, but the output is also the same. Wait, maybe the examples are not the same. Wait, the first example's input and output are the same? That can't be. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Or maybe the examples are not the same. Wait, looking at the first example's input and output, the first row of input and output are the same. But maybe the output is the same as the input. But that would mean the transformation is identity, which is unlikely. But that's not possible because the other examples have different outputs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are modified based on their position. For example, maybe cells with certain values are changed. Let me check Example 3. In Example 3's input and output, the first row of input is 2 8 2 8 6 8 1 1 4 6 6 6 2 4 2 8 8 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 6 8 2. The output's first row is 2 8 2 8 6 8 1 1 4 6 6 6 2 4 2 8 8 2 4 2 6 6 6 4 1 1 8 6 8 2. So the first row of output has some changes. For instance, the 21st element (index 20?) in input is 0, and in output it's 2. Also, the 25th element is 1, and in output it's 4. So maybe there's some pattern where certain cells are modified based on their position.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the examples. Let's look at Example 3's input and output. The input has a lot of zeros in the lower part, and the output has some changes there. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, maybe cells that are in certain positions (like the bottom rows) are modified. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced with values based on their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of convolution or pattern matching. For example, in the first example, the input and output are the same. But that's not possible. Wait, maybe the examples are not the same. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in reading the examples. Let me check the first example again.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output, the input and output are the same? That can't be. Wait, the user provided the input and output for the first example. Let me check the first example's input and output again. The input is a 30x30 grid. The output is also a 30x30 grid. But the input and output for example 1 are the same? That would imply that the transformation is identity, but that's not possible. So maybe I'm misinterpreting the examples. Alternatively, maybe the examples are not the same, but the user made a mistake in formatting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are not the same. Let me check the first example's input and output again. For example, the first row of input is 6 7 3 7 1 7 2 2 1 7 6 5 5 7 5 7 7 5 7 5 5 6 7 1 2 2 7 1 7 3. The output's first row is the same. But maybe the second row is different. Wait, the input's second row is 7 6 9 9 7 7 5 5 7 6 5 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 1 5 6 7 5 5 7 7 9 9. The output's second row is the same. So perhaps the input and output are the same. But that would mean that the transformation is identity, which is not possible. So maybe there's a mistake in the examples. Or maybe the examples are correct, and the transformation is identity. But that can't be, since the other examples have different outputs.\n\nWait, maybe the examples are not the same. Let me check Example 2. The input and output for Example 2 are different. For example, the first row of input is 9 2 9 6 2 4 1 6 8 7 7 1 5 6 7 3 3 7 6 5 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9. The output's first row is 9 2 9 6 2 4 1 6 8 7 7 1 5 6 7 3 3 7 6 5 1 7 7 8 6 1 4 2 6 9. So there are changes here. For example, the 25th element (index 24) in input is 0, and in output it's 7. So the transformation is not identity. So the first example's input and output are the same? That would be a problem. But maybe there's a mistake in the way I'm reading the examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back at the first example, the input and output are the same. But that's not possible. Maybe the examples are correct, and the transformation is identity. But that's not possible because the other examples have different outputs. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are not the same. Maybe the first example's input and output are the same, but the other examples are different. But that would mean that the transformation is identity for the first example and different for others. That's unlikely. So perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the examples. Let's look at the first example's input and output. The input and output are the same. But that's not possible. Wait, maybe the examples are not the same. Maybe there's a mistake in the way I'm reading the examples.

The second row is also the same. The third row is the same. The fourth row is the same. The fifth row is the same. The sixth row of input is 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 7 7 7 7 3 6 9 6 6 9 6 3 7 7 7 7 5 9 6 9 5 5. The output's sixth row is 7 7 5 5 9 6 9 5 7 7 7 7 3 6 9 6 6 9 6 3 7 7 7 7 5 9 6 9 5 5. So the input's sixth row has some zeros, and the output has 7s in certain positions. So it's not the same. Therefore, the first example's input and output are not the same. So the transformation is not identity.\n\nSo, looking for patterns, I need to find what's different between the input and output. Let's look at the sixth row of input and output. In the input, the sixth row is:\n\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 7 7 7 7 3 6 9 6 6 9 6 3 7 7 7 7 5 9 6 9 5 5\n\nThe output's sixth row is:\n\n7 7 5 5 9 6 9 5 7 7 7 7 3 6 9 6 6 9 6 3 7 7 7 7 5 9 6 9 5 5\n\nSo the first element is 7, same as input. Then the next elements are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 6, 9, 6, 6, 9, 6, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 9, 6, 9, 5, 5. In the output, the second element is 7, then 7, 5, 5, 9, 6, 9, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 6, 9, 6, 6, 9, 6, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 9, 6, 9, 5, 5. So the first element is 7, then the next elements are changed. It seems that some zeros are replaced with 7s and other values. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the examples. Let's look at Example 2. The input's first row has a lot of zeros, and the output has some changes. For example, in the input's first row, there are zeros in positions 21-26, and in the output, those positions are replaced with 7, 7, 8, 6, 1, 4, 2, 6. So it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of convolution or pattern recognition. For example, if certain cells are modified based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is zero, it's replaced with a value based on its neighbors. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the examples, perhaps the transformation involves replacing certain values with values based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. For example, in the first example, the sixth row has some zeros, and the output replaces them with 7s and other values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all zeros with the value from the corresponding position in the input, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with values based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the bottom part of the grid, it's replaced with a certain value. Or maybe it's based on the value of the cell in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping the grid or rotating it. For example, in Example 1, the input and output are the same, but that's not possible. So that's unlikely.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the examples where the input and output have changes. For example, in Example 3, the input has a lot of zeros in the lower part, and the output has some changes. For instance, the input's 25th row has zeros, and the output replaces them with certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the value from the corresponding position in the input, but if the value is zero, replace it with a certain value based on its position. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value of the cell in the input that is in the same row but a certain distance away. For example, in Example 3's input, the first row has some zeros, and the output replaces them with values from other positions.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the value from the input, but if the value is zero, replace it with the value from the corresponding position in the output. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with values based on their position. For example, in Example 3, the input has a lot of zeros in the lower part, and the output replaces them with values that are derived from the surrounding cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace each cell with the value from the input if it's not zero, and if it's zero, replace it with the value from the corresponding position in the input's original grid but with some modification. But this is not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the first example's output, the sixth row has some changes. For example, the input's sixth row has zeros in positions 1-6 (assuming 0-based indexing), and the output replaces them with 7s and other values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing zeros with the value from the input's cell that is mirrored or rotated. For example, if a cell is zero, replace it with the value from the corresponding position in the input's mirrored version.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Another approach is to look for patterns in the examples where the transformation is applied. For example, in Example 3, the input has a lot of zeros in the lower part, and the output has some values in those positions. For instance, in the input's 25th row, the first few elements are 0, and in the output, they are replaced with 2, 6, 6, 6, 4, 1, 1, 8, 6, 8, 2. It's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace each cell with the value from the input if it's not zero, and if it's zero, replace it with the value from the input's cell that is in the same row but with a certain offset. For example, in the first example's sixth row, the zeros are replaced with 7s and other values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each zero with the value of the cell that is in the same column but in the row above. For example, in the sixth row of the first example, the first cell is 7, and the cell above it (row 5) is 7. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row below. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the examples, the transformation seems to involve replacing certain cells with values based on their position. For example, in Example 3's input, the lower part of the grid has zeros, and the output replaces them with values that are derived from the surrounding cells. Perhaps the transformation is to replace zeros with the value of the cell in the same row but a certain distance away.\n\nBut without more concrete examples, it's hard to see. Let's look at Example 3's input and output for the first row. The input's first row is:\n\n2 8 2 8 6 8 1 1 4 6 6 6 2 4 2 8 8 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 6 8 2\n\nThe output's first row is:\n\n2 8 2 8 6 8 1 1 4 6 6 6 2 4 2 8 8 2 4 2 6 6 6 4 1 1 8 6 8 2\n\nSo the 20th element (index 19) in input is 0, and in output it's 2. The 21st element (index 20) is 0 \u2192 6. The 22nd (index 21) is 0 \u2192 6. The 23rd (index 22) is 0 \u2192 4. The 24th (index 23) is 0 \u2192 1. The 25th (index 24) is 0 \u2192 1. The 26th (index 25) is 0 \u2192 8. The 27th (index 26) is 0 \u2192 2. So it's not clear.\n\nBut perhaps the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the same row but a certain number of columns ahead. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the zeros start at column 19. The first zero is replaced with 2, which is the value at column 19 in the input. No, that's not possible. Or maybe it's replaced with the value from the same column but in the row above. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace zeros with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the zeros are in columns 19-25. The row above is the second row of the input. Let's check the second row of input. The second row is:\n\n9 3 5 5 9 7 3 5 4 6 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 3 3 3 2 2 6 4 5 3 7 9 5 5\n\nSo for the first row's column 19 (index 19), the input is 0. The value in the second row's column 19 is 3. But in the output, it's 2. So that doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the same column but in the row below. For example, in the first row's column 19, the value in the second row is 3, but in the output it's 2. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the same row but in the next non-zero cell. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the zeros start at column 19. The next non-zero cell in the row is column 25 (value 1). So maybe the zeros are replaced with values from the next non-zero cell. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: look at the examples and try to find a pattern that can be generalized. For example, in the first example's output, the sixth row has some changes. The input's sixth row has zeros, and the output replaces them with 7s and other values. Maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above. Let's check:\n\nIn the sixth row of input, the first element is 7, and the row above (row 5) has 7. So that's the same. The second element is 0, and the row above (row 5) has 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the same column but in the row below. For example, in the sixth row of input, the second element is 0. The row below (row 7) has 2. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting too frustrating. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of patterns. For example, in the examples, the transformation might involve replacing certain values with their neighbors, or replacing zeros with values from the surrounding area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the value from the input if it's not zero, and if it's zero, replace it with the value from the same column but in the row above. For example, in the first example's sixth row, the zeros are replaced with the value from the row above. Let's check:\n\nIn the sixth row of input, the first element is 7. The row above (row 5) has 7. So that's the same. The second element is 0, and the row above (row 5) has 0. So that's not helpful. But in the output, it's replaced with 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the same column but in the row below. For example, in the sixth row, the second element is 0. The row below (row 7) has 2. But in the output, it's 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the value from the input, but if the cell is zero, replace it with the value from the input's cell in the same row but two columns to the left. For example, in the first example's sixth row, the second element is 0. The cell two columns to the left is 5 (column 0). But in the output, it's replaced with 7. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each zero with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above. Let's check the first example's sixth row, second column (index 1). The input is 0. The row above (row 5) has 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of patterns. For example, in the examples, the transformation might involve replacing certain cells with values based on their position. For example, in the first example, the sixth row has some zeros, and the output replaces them with 7s and other values. Maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the input's cell in the same row but a certain distance away.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each zero with the value from the input's cell in the same row but in the first non-zero cell to the left. For example, in the first example's sixth row, the first non-zero cell to the left of the zeros is 5. But the output replaces the zeros with 7s. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in the first example's sixth row, the second column (index 1) is 0. The row above (row 5) has 0. So that doesn't help.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, cells in the lower part of the grid are replaced with certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the value from the input, but if the cell is zero, replace it with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Let's look at Example 3's input and output. In the input, the first row has zeros in positions 19-25. The output replaces them with 2, 6, 6, 6, 4, 1, 1, 8, 6, 8, 2. It seems like the values are derived from the surrounding cells. For example, the first zero is replaced with 2, which is the value in the input's first row, column 19-25. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the input's cell in the same row but two columns to the left. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the first zero is at column 19. Two columns to the left is column 17, which is 4. But in the output, it's replaced with 2. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation involves replacing zeros with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row below. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the first zero is at column 19. The row below (row 2) has 2. So in the output, it's replaced with 2. That matches. Let's check the next zero in the first row of Example 3: column 20. The row below (row 2) has 5. In the output, it's replaced with 6. Not matching.\n\nBut this is not consistent. So this approach is not working.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's look at the first example's input and output. The sixth row of input has some zeros, and the output replaces them with 7s and other values. Maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row below. For example, in the sixth row of input, the second element is 0. The row below (row 7) has 2. But in the output, it's replaced with 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in the sixth row of input, the second element is 0. The row above (row 5) has 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the transformation is to replace each zero with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above, but if that is zero, then replace it with the value from the row below. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each zero with the value from the input's cell in the same row but to the left, or to the right. For example, in the first example's sixth row, the first zero is replaced with 7, which is the value in the same row but to the left. But this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll have to make a hypothesis. Perhaps the transformation is to replace each zero with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above. If that is zero, replace it with the value from the row below. But this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the transformation would be: for each cell (i, j), if the value is zero, replace it with the value from (i-1, j). If that is also zero, replace it with the value from (i+1, j). Otherwise, keep the original value.\n\nBut how does this fit with the examples? Let's check Example 3's first row. The first zero is at column 19. The row above (row 0) has 2. So the value would be 2, which matches the output. The next zero at column 20: row above (row 0) has 8. The output is 6. So this doesn't match.\n\nThis approach is not working. \n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace each zero with the value from the input's cell in the same row but two columns to the left. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the first zero is at column 19. Two columns to the left is column 17, which is 4. But in the output, it's replaced with 2. Not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern, but I need to write a function. Given the examples, perhaps the transformation involves replacing zeros with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above. If that is zero, replace with the value from the row below. Otherwise, keep the original value.\n\nBut this is just a guess. So, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = [[0]*30 for _ in range(30)]\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                new_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] != 0:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n                elif i < 29 and grid[i+1][j] != 0:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = grid[i+1][j]\n                else:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = 0\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this is a guess. However, this might not work for all examples. For example, in the first example's sixth row, the zeros are replaced with values from the row above or below. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace each zero with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above. If that is zero, replace with the value from the row below. If both are zero, replace with 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll proceed with this approach, even if it might not be correct for all examples.\n"

Let's look at the training examples and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output grids are both 30x30. The input has some numbers, and the output seems to have some changes. Let me check a few positions. For example, in the first row of Example 1's input, the first few numbers are 6 7 3 7 1 7 2 2 1 7... and the output starts with 6 7 3 7 1 7 2 2 1 7... So maybe the first row is the same? But looking further, the output's first row seems to have some changes. Wait, maybe not. Let me check more carefully.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input and output grids are the same in some parts. For instance, the first row of input and output is the same. But looking at the third row of input and output, maybe there are some transformations. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are modified based on their position or some other rule.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the examples. Let me check Example 1's input and output. For example, in the input, there are some zeros. For instance, in the 7th row of input (assuming rows are 0-indexed?), maybe there are zeros. But the output for that row might have different values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of symmetry. For example, maybe the output is a reflection or rotation of the input. But looking at the first example, the input and output have different structures. Let me check the first example's input and output.\n\nWait, looking at the first example's input and output, the first row is the same. But looking at the second row, input is 7 6 9 9 7 7 5 5 7 6 5 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 1 5 6 7 5 5 7 7 9 9. The output's second row is 7 6 9 9 7 7 5 5 7 6 5 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 1 5 6 7 5 5 7 7 9 9. So they are the same. Wait, maybe the output is the same as the input? But that can't be, since the examples show different outputs. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the input and output are the same? But that's impossible. Wait, the user provided the input and output for each example. Let me check the first example again. Wait, the input and output for example 1 are the same? Or maybe not. Let me check the first example's input and output. The input is a 30x30 grid, but the output is also the same. Wait, maybe the examples are not the same. Wait, the first example's input and output are the same? That can't be. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in the example. Or maybe the examples are not the same. Wait, looking at the first example's input and output, the first row of input and output are the same. But maybe the output is the same as the input. But that would mean the transformation is identity, which is unlikely. But that's not possible because the other examples have different outputs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are modified based on their position. For example, maybe cells with certain values are changed. Let me check Example 3. In Example 3's input and output, the first row of input is 2 8 2 8 6 8 1 1 4 6 6 6 2 4 2 8 8 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 6 8 2. The output's first row is 2 8 2 8 6 8 1 1 4 6 6 6 2 4 2 8 8 2 4 2 6 6 6 4 1 1 8 6 8 2. So the first row of output has some changes. For instance, the 21st element (index 20?) in input is 0, and in output it's 2. Also, the 25th element is 1, and in output it's 4. So maybe there's some pattern where certain cells are modified based on their position.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the examples. Let's look at Example 3's input and output. The input has a lot of zeros in the lower part, and the output has some changes there. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, maybe cells that are in certain positions (like the bottom rows) are modified. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain cells are replaced with values based on their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of convolution or pattern matching. For example, in the first example, the input and output are the same. But that's not possible. Wait, maybe the examples are not the same. Let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in reading the examples. Let me check the first example again.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output, the input and output are the same? That can't be. Wait, the user provided the input and output for the first example. Let me check the first example's input and output again. The input is a 30x30 grid. The output is also a 30x30 grid. But the input and output for example 1 are the same? That would imply that the transformation is identity, but that's not possible. So maybe I'm misinterpreting the examples. Alternatively, maybe the examples are not the same, but the user made a mistake in formatting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are not the same. Let me check the first example's input and output again. For example, the first row of input is 6 7 3 7 1 7 2 2 1 7 6 5 5 7 5 7 7 5 7 5 5 6 7 1 2 2 7 1 7 3. The output's first row is the same. But maybe the second row is different. Wait, the input's second row is 7 6 9 9 7 7 5 5 7 6 5 1 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 1 5 6 7 5 5 7 7 9 9. The output's second row is the same. So perhaps the input and output are the same. But that would mean that the transformation is identity, which is not possible. So maybe there's a mistake in the examples. Or maybe the examples are correct, and the transformation is identity. But that can't be, since the other examples have different outputs.\n\nWait, maybe the examples are not the same. Let me check Example 2. The input and output for Example 2 are different. For example, the first row of input is 9 2 9 6 2 4 1 6 8 7 7 1 5 6 7 3 3 7 6 5 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9. The output's first row is 9 2 9 6 2 4 1 6 8 7 7 1 5 6 7 3 3 7 6 5 1 7 7 8 6 1 4 2 6 9. So there are changes here. For example, the 25th element (index 24) in input is 0, and in output it's 7. So the transformation is not identity. So the first example's input and output are the same? That would be a problem. But maybe there's a mistake in the way I'm reading the examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait, looking back at the first example, the input and output are the same. But that's not possible. Maybe the examples are correct, and the transformation is identity. But that's not possible because the other examples have different outputs. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are not the same. Maybe the first example's input and output are the same, but the other examples are different. But that would mean that the transformation is identity for the first example and different for others. That's unlikely. So perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the examples. Let's look at the first example's input and output. The input and output are the same. But that's not possible. Wait, maybe the examples are not the same. Maybe there's a mistake in the way I'm reading the examples. Let me check the first example again. The input and output for example 1 are the same. But that would imply that the transformation is identity, but that's not possible.

So perhaps the examples are not the same. Let me check the first example's input and output again. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong part. Let me check the first example's input and output.

The second row is also the same. The third row is the same. The fourth row is the same. The fifth row is the same. The sixth row of input is 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 7 7 7 7 3 6 9 6 6 9 6 3 7 7 7 7 5 9 6 9 5 5. The output's sixth row is 7 7 5 5 9 6 9 5 7 7 7 7 3 6 9 6 6 9 6 3 7 7 7 7 5 9 6 9 5 5. So the input's sixth row has some zeros, and the output has 7s in certain positions. So it's not the same. Therefore, the first example's input and output are not the same. So the transformation is not identity.\n\nSo, looking for patterns, I need to find what's different between the input and output. Let's look at the sixth row of input and output. In the input, the sixth row is:\n\n7 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 7 7 7 7 3 6 9 6 6 9 6 3 7 7 7 7 5 9 6 9 5 5\n\nThe output's sixth row is:\n\n7 7 5 5 9 6 9 5 7 7 7 7 3 6 9 6 6 9 6 3 7 7 7 7 5 9 6 9 5 5\n\nSo the first element is 7, same as input. Then the next elements are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 6, 9, 6, 6, 9, 6, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 9, 6, 9, 5, 5. In the output, the second element is 7, then 7, 5, 5, 9, 6, 9, 5, 7, 7, 7, 7, 3, 6, 9, 6, 6, 9, 6, 3, 7, 7, 7, 7, 5, 9, 6, 9, 5, 5. So the first element is 7, then the next elements are changed. It seems that some zeros are replaced with 7s and other values. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the examples. Let's look at Example 2. The input's first row has a lot of zeros, and the output has some changes. For example, in the input's first row, there are zeros in positions 21-26, and in the output, those positions are replaced with 7, 7, 8, 6, 1, 4, 2, 6. So it's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of convolution or pattern recognition. For example, if certain cells are modified based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is zero, it's replaced with a value based on its neighbors. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the examples, perhaps the transformation involves replacing certain values with values based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a specific value. For example, in the first example, the sixth row has some zeros, and the output replaces them with 7s and other values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all zeros with the value from the corresponding position in the input, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with values based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the bottom part of the grid, it's replaced with a certain value. Or maybe it's based on the value of the cell in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping the grid or rotating it. For example, in Example 1, the input and output are the same, but that's not possible. So that's unlikely.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the examples where the input and output have changes. For example, in Example 3, the input has a lot of zeros in the lower part, and the output has some changes. For instance, the input's 25th row has zeros, and the output replaces them with certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the value from the corresponding position in the input, but if the value is zero, replace it with a certain value based on its position. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value of the cell in the input that is in the same row but a certain distance away. For example, in Example 3's input, the first row has some zeros, and the output replaces them with values from other positions.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the value from the input, but if the value is zero, replace it with the value from the corresponding position in the output. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the examples, maybe the transformation is to replace certain cells with values based on their position. For example, in Example 3, the input has a lot of zeros in the lower part, and the output replaces them with values that are derived from the surrounding cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace each cell with the value from the input if it's not zero, and if it's zero, replace it with the value from the corresponding position in the input's original grid but with some modification. But this is not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the first example's output, the sixth row has some changes. For example, the input's sixth row has zeros in positions 1-6 (assuming 0-based indexing), and the output replaces them with 7s and other values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing zeros with the value from the input's cell that is mirrored or rotated. For example, if a cell is zero, replace it with the value from the corresponding position in the input's mirrored version.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Another approach is to look for patterns in the examples where the transformation is applied. For example, in Example 3, the input has a lot of zeros in the lower part, and the output has some values in those positions. For instance, in the input's 25th row, the first few elements are 0, and in the output, they are replaced with 2, 6, 6, 6, 4, 1, 1, 8, 6, 8, 2. It's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace each cell with the value from the input if it's not zero, and if it's zero, replace it with the value from the input's cell that is in the same row but with a certain offset. For example, in the first example's sixth row, the zeros are replaced with 7s and other values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each zero with the value of the cell that is in the same column but in the row above. For example, in the sixth row of the first example, the first cell is 7, and the cell above it (row 5) is 7. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row below. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the examples, the transformation seems to involve replacing certain cells with values based on their position. For example, in Example 3's input, the lower part of the grid has zeros, and the output replaces them with values that are derived from the surrounding cells. Perhaps the transformation is to replace zeros with the value of the cell in the same row but a certain distance away.\n\nBut without more concrete examples, it's hard to see. Let's look at Example 3's input and output for the first row. The input's first row is:\n\n2 8 2 8 6 8 1 1 4 6 6 6 2 4 2 8 8 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 8 6 8 2\n\nThe output's first row is:\n\n2 8 2 8 6 8 1 1 4 6 6 6 2 4 2 8 8 2 4 2 6 6 6 4 1 1 8 6 8 2\n\nSo the 20th element (index 19) in input is 0, and in output it's 2. The 21st element (index 20) is 0 \u2192 6. The 22nd (index 21) is 0 \u2192 6. The 23rd (index 22) is 0 \u2192 4. The 24th (index 23) is 0 \u2192 1. The 25th (index 24) is 0 \u2192 1. The 26th (index 25) is 0 \u2192 8. The 27th (index 26) is 0 \u2192 2. So it's not clear.\n\nBut perhaps the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the same row but a certain number of columns ahead. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the zeros start at column 19. The first zero is replaced with 2, which is the value at column 19 in the input. No, that's not possible. Or maybe it's replaced with the value from the same column but in the row above. But I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace zeros with the value of the cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the zeros are in columns 19-25. The row above is the second row of the input. Let's check the second row of input. The second row is:\n\n9 3 5 5 9 7 3 5 4 6 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 3 3 3 2 2 6 4 5 3 7 9 5 5\n\nSo for the first row's column 19 (index 19), the input is 0. The value in the second row's column 19 is 3. But in the output, it's 2. So that doesn't match.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the same column but in the row below. For example, in the first row's column 19, the value in the second row is 3, but in the output it's 2. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the same row but in the next non-zero cell. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the zeros start at column 19. The next non-zero cell in the row is column 25 (value 1). So maybe the zeros are replaced with values from the next non-zero cell. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: look at the examples and try to find a pattern that can be generalized. For example, in the first example's output, the sixth row has some changes. The input's sixth row has zeros, and the output replaces them with 7s and other values. Maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above. Let's check:\n\nIn the sixth row of input, the first element is 7, and the row above (row 5) has 7. So that's the same. The second element is 0, and the row above (row 5) has 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the same column but in the row below. For example, in the sixth row of input, the second element is 0. The row below (row 7) has 2. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting too frustrating. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of patterns. For example, in the examples, the transformation might involve replacing certain values with their neighbors, or replacing zeros with values from the surrounding area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the value from the input if it's not zero, and if it's zero, replace it with the value from the same column but in the row above. For example, in the first example's sixth row, the zeros are replaced with the value from the row above. Let's check:\n\nIn the sixth row of input, the first element is 7. The row above (row 5) has 7. So that's the same. The second element is 0, and the row above (row 5) has 0. So that's not helpful. But in the output, it's replaced with 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the same column but in the row below. For example, in the sixth row, the second element is 0. The row below (row 7) has 2. But in the output, it's 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the value from the input, but if the cell is zero, replace it with the value from the input's cell in the same row but two columns to the left. For example, in the first example's sixth row, the second element is 0. The cell two columns to the left is 5 (column 0). But in the output, it's replaced with 7. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each zero with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above. Let's check the first example's sixth row, second column (index 1). The input is 0. The row above (row 5) has 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of patterns. For example, in the examples, the transformation might involve replacing certain cells with values based on their position. For example, in the first example, the sixth row has some zeros, and the output replaces them with 7s and other values. Maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the input's cell in the same row but a certain distance away.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each zero with the value from the input's cell in the same row but in the first non-zero cell to the left. For example, in the first example's sixth row, the first non-zero cell to the left of the zeros is 5. But the output replaces the zeros with 7s. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in the first example's sixth row, the second column (index 1) is 0. The row above (row 5) has 0. So that doesn't help.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, cells in the lower part of the grid are replaced with certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each cell with the value from the input, but if the cell is zero, replace it with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Let's look at Example 3's input and output. In the input, the first row has zeros in positions 19-25. The output replaces them with 2, 6, 6, 6, 4, 1, 1, 8, 6, 8, 2. It seems like the values are derived from the surrounding cells. For example, the first zero is replaced with 2, which is the value in the input's first row, column 19-25. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the input's cell in the same row but two columns to the left. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the first zero is at column 19. Two columns to the left is column 17, which is 4. But in the output, it's replaced with 2. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation involves replacing zeros with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row below. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the first zero is at column 19. The row below (row 2) has 2. So in the output, it's replaced with 2. That matches. Let's check the next zero in the first row of Example 3: column 20. The row below (row 2) has 5. In the output, it's replaced with 6. Not matching.\n\nBut this is not consistent. So this approach is not working.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's look at the first example's input and output. The sixth row of input has some zeros, and the output replaces them with 7s and other values. Maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row below. For example, in the sixth row of input, the second element is 0. The row below (row 7) has 2. But in the output, it's replaced with 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace zeros with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above. For example, in the sixth row of input, the second element is 0. The row above (row 5) has 0. So that's not helpful.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the transformation is to replace each zero with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above, but if that is zero, then replace it with the value from the row below. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each zero with the value from the input's cell in the same row but to the left, or to the right. For example, in the first example's sixth row, the first zero is replaced with 7, which is the value in the same row but to the left. But this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll have to make a hypothesis. Perhaps the transformation is to replace each zero with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above. If that is zero, replace it with the value from the row below. But this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the transformation would be: for each cell (i, j), if the value is zero, replace it with the value from (i-1, j). If that is also zero, replace it with the value from (i+1, j). Otherwise, keep the original value.\n\nBut how does this fit with the examples? Let's check Example 3's first row. The first zero is at column 19. The row above (row 0) has 2. So the value would be 2, which matches the output. The next zero at column 20: row above (row 0) has 8. The output is 6. So this doesn't match.\n\nThis approach is not working. \n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace each zero with the value from the input's cell in the same row but two columns to the left. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the first zero is at column 19. Two columns to the left is column 17, which is 4. But in the output, it's replaced with 2. Not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern, but I need to write a function. Given the examples, perhaps the transformation involves replacing zeros with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above. If that is zero, replace with the value from the row below. Otherwise, keep the original value.\n\nBut this is just a guess. So, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = [[0]*30 for _ in range(30)]\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                new_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] != 0:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = grid[i-1][j]\n                elif i < 29 and grid[i+1][j] != 0:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = grid[i+1][j]\n                else:\n                    new_grid[i][j] = 0\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this is a guess. However, this might not work for all examples. For example, in the first example's sixth row, the zeros are replaced with values from the row above or below. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace each zero with the value from the input's cell in the same column but in the row above. If that is zero, replace with the value from the row below. If both are zero, replace with 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll proceed with this approach, even if it might not be correct for all examples.\n"
