          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe several patterns that seem to be involved in the transformation:\n\n1. **Numerical Patterns**: Numbers like 2, 3, 6, 8, and 5 appear to be spread out in specific patterns.\n2. **Symmetry**: Some patterns seem to be symmetric or have mirrored structures.\n3. **Propagation**: Certain numbers seem to propagate from their initial positions in specific directions.\n4. **Boundary Effects**: Numbers seem to be more prominent near the edges or in specific regions of the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading numbers from their initial positions in a way that creates patterns, possibly with some symmetry and propagation.\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to store the transformed values\n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the transformation logic\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # We propagate numbers from their initial positions in a specific pattern\n    \n    # For each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                # Propagate the value in specific directions\n                # This is a simplified pattern based on observations\n                # We spread the value in a diamond shape around the cell\n                for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if abs(dx) + abs(dy) <= 2:  # Limit to a diamond shape\n                            ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                            if 0 <= ni < 30 and 0 <= nj < 30:\n                                transformed[ni][nj] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if abs(dx) + abs(dy) <= 2:\n                            ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                            if 0 <= ni < 30 and 0 <= nj < 30:\n                                transformed[ni][nj] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed.tolist()\n```",

The transformation seems to involve propagating values from certain positions to their neighbors.\n2. There are patterns where specific values (like 3, 2, 6, 8) are spread out in a particular way.\n3. Some values seem to be replaced or modified based on their neighbors.\n4. There's a pattern where certain values are expanded or replaced with other values in a grid-like fashion.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that propagates values from certain positions to their neighbors, and replaces values based on their neighbors.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = np.copy(grid_np)\n    \n    # Define the transformation logic\n    # This is a simplified version that propagates values from certain positions\n    # and replaces values based on their neighbors\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            # If the current cell is 0, check its neighbors\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check all 8 neighbors\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 30 and 0 <= nj < 30:\n                            # If a neighbor has a non-zero value, propagate it\n                            if grid_np[ni][nj] != 0:\n                                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid_np[ni][nj]\n    \n    # Replace certain values based on their neighbors\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check all 8 neighbors again\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 30 and 0 <= nj < 30:\n                            # If a neighbor has a non-zero value, propagate it\n                            if transformed_grid[ni][nj] != 0:\n                                transformed_grid[i][j] = transformed_grid[ni][nj]\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = np.copy(grid_np)\n    \n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 0:\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 30 and 0 <= nj < 30:\n                            if grid_np[ni][nj] != 0:\n                                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid_np[ni][nj]\n    \n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 0:\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 30 and 0 <= nj < 30:\n                            if transformed_grid[ni][nj] != 0:\n                                transformed_grid[i][j] = transformed_grid[ni][nj]\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with others based on their position and value.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain numbers (like 3, 5, 8) are replaced with other numbers (like 2, 6, 8) in specific patterns.\n3. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"spread\" or \"propagation\" of values, where certain values influence their neighbors.\n4. There are also patterns where certain values are replaced with others in a grid-based way, possibly based on their position relative to other values.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with others based on their position and value, with some propagation logic.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
