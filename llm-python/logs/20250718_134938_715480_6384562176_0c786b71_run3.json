          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nThe input for Example 1 is a 3x4 grid, and the output is a 6x8 grid. So the input is 3 rows, each with 4 elements. The output is 6 rows, each with 8 elements. So the output is twice as tall and twice as wide as the input. Wait, maybe the output is generated by some kind of expansion or repetition of the input?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\nRow 0: 6 2 4 2\nRow 1: 2 2 6 6\nRow 2: 6 4 2 4\n\nThe output has 6 rows. Let me check the output rows:\n\nFirst output row: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\nSecond: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6\nThird: 2 4 2 6 6 2 4 2\nFourth: 2 4 2 6 6 2 4 2\nFifth: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6\nSixth: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\n\nHmm. So the output seems to have the input rows duplicated. Like, the first two output rows might be based on the first input row, then the next two on the second input row, and the last two on the third input row. But how?\n\nLooking at the first input row (6 2 4 2). The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Wait, that's 8 elements. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Maybe each input element is expanded into two elements? Or maybe some transformation applied.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is split into two parts, and each part is repeated. For example, the first input row is 6 2 4 2. Maybe each element is duplicated? But 6 becomes 6 6, but in the output, the first row starts with 4 2 4 6... which doesn't seem to match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying some kind of mirroring or transformation. Let's look at the first input row. Let's see the output rows. The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. The second output row is 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6. The third is 2 4 2 6 6 2 4 2. The fourth is same as third. Then fifth is same as second, sixth same as first.\n\nSo the output seems to have the first two rows as the first input row transformed in some way, then the next two rows as the second input row transformed, then the last two as the third input row transformed.\n\nBut how? Let's look at the first input row. Let's think about the first output row. The first input row is 6 2 4 2. The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Hmm. Let me check the positions. Maybe each element is replaced by two elements, but with some pattern. For example, 6 becomes 4 and 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying some kind of transformation that's mirrored or rotated. Let's see. For example, the first input row is 6 2 4 2. The first output row starts with 4 2 4 6... which is similar to the original elements but in a different order. Wait, maybe the first output row is a combination of the original elements and their neighbors? Or maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where each element is expanded into two elements, but with some rule.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output rows, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 2x2 block for each input cell. For example, each input cell is transformed into a 2x2 block. But since the output is 6x8, which is 3x4 input multiplied by 2 in each direction, that would fit. So for each input cell, it's expanded into 2 rows and 2 columns. But how?\n\nLet me think. The input is 3 rows by 4 columns. The output is 6 rows by 8 columns. So each input row is split into two rows, and each input column is split into two columns. So for each input cell, there's a 2x2 block in the output. But how is that block structured?\n\nLooking at the first input row (6 2 4 2). The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Let's see the first four elements of the first output row: 4, 2, 4, 6. Then next four: 6, 4, 2, 4. So maybe the first input row is transformed into two rows of four elements each. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each input row and creating two rows by some transformation. For example, the first input row is transformed into two rows, each of which is a combination of the original elements and their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first input row and the first two output rows. The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. The second output row is 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6. Then the third output row is 2 4 2 6 6 2 4 2. The fourth is same as third. Then fifth is same as second, sixth same as first.\n\nSo for the first input row, the first two output rows are different. Let me check the first input row. Let's think of the output rows as being generated by some transformation that applies to each input row. Maybe the first input row is transformed into two rows, each of which is a combination of the original elements and some mirrored or rotated version.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation that's similar to a 2x2 grid. For example, each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block where the top-left is the original value, and the rest are derived from it. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first input row and the first two output rows. Let me check the first input row's elements: 6, 2, 4, 2. The first output row is 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4. The second output row is 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6.\n\nWait, maybe the first two output rows are generated by taking the input row and applying a transformation that alternates between two different patterns. For example, the first output row is 4, 2, 4, 6 followed by 6, 4, 2, 4. The second output row is 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 2x2 grid for each input cell. For example, each input cell is transformed into a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for each input row. For example, the first input row is 6 2 4 2. The output rows for this input row are the first two output rows. Let me look at the first output row: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. The second output row is 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6. So maybe the first output row is a combination of the original elements and some mirrored elements, and the second output row is a combination of the original elements in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each input row and creating two rows where each element is duplicated, but with some pattern. For example, the first input row's elements are 6, 2, 4, 2. The first output row is 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4. Wait, that's 8 elements. Let me see:\n\nIf the original row is 6 2 4 2, maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original elements and inserting some values between them. For example, inserting 2 between 6 and 2, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each input row and applying a transformation that creates two rows. For example, the first input row is transformed into two rows by some pattern. Let's take the first input row and see what the first two output rows are. The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. The second is 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6.\n\nLooking at the first output row, maybe the first two elements are 4 and 2, which are the second and first elements of the input row? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the first output row is the original row transformed in some way. For example, the first input row is 6 2 4 2. The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Let me split this into two parts: 4 2 4 6 and 6 4 2 4. The first part is 4, 2, 4, 6. The second part is 6, 4, 2, 4. So maybe the first part is the original row with some transformation. For example, the original row is 6, 2, 4, 2. If we take the first element (6) and replace it with 4 and 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input row and creating a new row where each element is duplicated, but with some pattern. For example, the first input row is 6 2 4 2. If each element is duplicated, that would be 6 6 2 2 4 4 2 2. But the first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each input row and creating two rows where each row is a combination of the original row and some mirrored version. For example, the first output row is the original row mirrored in some way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first input row and the first output row. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input row: 6 2 4 2.\n\nFirst output row: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4.\n\nIf we look at the first four elements: 4 2 4 6. The original row's elements are 6, 2, 4, 2. So maybe the first four elements are 4, 2, 4, 6. That's the original row's elements in reverse order, but with some changes. Wait, original row is 6, 2, 4, 2. Reverse is 2,4,2,6. Not matching the first four elements of the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is the original row's elements in a certain order. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row elements: 6, 2, 4, 2.\n\nFirst output row elements: 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4.\n\nLooking at the first four elements: 4, 2, 4, 6. That's 4, 2, 4, 6. If we take the original row and split it into two parts: first two elements (6, 2) and last two (4, 2). Then maybe the first part is transformed into 4, 2, and the second part into 4, 6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 2x2 grid for each cell. For example, each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nLet me think about the first input row. Each cell is 6, 2, 4, 2. If each is expanded into a 2x2 block, then for the first cell (6), the block would be:\n\nRow 1: 4 2\n\nRow 2: 6 6\n\nBut then for the second cell (2), the block would be:\n\nRow 1: 2 4\n\nRow 2: 2 2\n\nBut this is just a guess. Then combining these blocks for the first row would create a 2x4 block, which would be expanded into 4 rows. But the output is 6 rows. Hmm, this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 2x2 grid for each cell, and then repeating that for each row. For example, each input row is split into two rows, and each input column into two columns.\n\nBut how to get from the input to the output. Let's think of the output as being generated by taking the input and applying a transformation that creates a 2x2 grid for each cell, then repeating that for each row. But this is getting too vague.\n\nLooking at the second example. Input is 3x4:\n\n5 5 9 9\n\n9 5 5 5\n\n5 7 5 7\n\nOutput is 6x8. Let's look at the first output row: 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. The second row is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. Third row is 9 9 5 5 5 5 9 9. Fourth same as third. Fifth same as second. Sixth same as first.\n\nSo the first input row is 5 5 9 9. The first two output rows are 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7 and 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. So the first output row seems to be a combination of 7 and 5, then 5 and 7, etc. The second output row is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. So perhaps the first input row is transformed into two rows where the first row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7, which is the original elements with some pattern. For example, 7 and 5 alternating, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying some kind of pattern where each element is mirrored or repeated. For example, the first input row is 5 5 9 9. The first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. Which is 7, 5, 7, 5, 5, 7, 5, 7. So maybe the first row is generated by taking the original elements and inserting some values between them. Like 5 is replaced by 7 and 5, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first input row and the first two output rows. The first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. The second is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. So maybe the first output row is generated by taking the first input row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, but with some pattern. For example, 5 becomes 7 5, and 9 becomes 5 7? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 2x2 grid for each cell, but the pattern depends on the cell's value. For example, if a cell is 5, it becomes a 2x2 block with 7 and 5 in some way. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: looking for a pattern in the output rows. For example, in Example 1, the output has the first two rows as the first input row transformed, then the next two as the second input row, then the last two as the third input row. So for each input row, there are two output rows. So maybe each input row is transformed into two output rows, and the same for each input column.\n\nBut how to generate those two rows from the input row.\n\nLooking at the first input row (6 2 4 2) and the first two output rows:\n\nFirst output row: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\n\nSecond output row: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6\n\nHmm. Let's split the first output row into two parts: first four elements and next four. The first four are 4 2 4 6. The next four are 6 4 2 4. The second output row is 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6. So maybe the first output row is the original row transformed in some way, and the second is another transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is the original row with some pattern applied, and the second is the original row with another pattern. For example, the first output row could be the original row with each element replaced by two elements, but the second row is the same as the first but with some changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is the original row's elements with some transformation applied, and the second is the same as the first but with a different pattern. For example, the first row could be the original row's elements mirrored in some way, and the second row is the same as the first but with some changes.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first input row and the first output row. The first input row is 6, 2, 4, 2. The first output row is 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4. Let's see if there's a pattern in the first four elements. 4, 2, 4, 6. The original elements are 6, 2, 4, 2. So maybe the first element of the first output row is 4, which is the second element of the original row. Then the second element is 2, which is the original first element. Then third is 4 (original third), fourth is 6 (original first). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and inserting some values between the elements. For example, between 6 and 2, insert 2, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first output row and the second output row. The first output row starts with 4 2 4 6, and the second starts with 6 6 2 2. The original row is 6 2 4 2. So maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, but the second output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a different transformation.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block. For example, each input cell is transformed into a 2x2 block. Then, the entire input grid is transformed into a 2x2 grid for each cell, resulting in a larger grid. But how?\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input is 3 rows by 4 columns. If each cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, the output would be 6 rows by 8 columns, which matches the required output size. So this seems promising.\n\nSo for each cell in the input grid, we generate a 2x2 block in the output grid. But how to determine the values of these blocks?\n\nLet's look at the first input cell (6,2,4,2) in the first row. Let's take the first input cell, which is 6. If this is expanded into a 2x2 block, what would the values be?\n\nIn the first output row, the first four elements are 4, 2, 4, 6. The second output row is 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6. So the first two output rows are the first two rows of the expanded blocks for the first input row.\n\nIf the first input row's first cell (6) is expanded into a 2x2 block, then the first two output rows for this cell would be:\n\nRow 1: 4 2\n\nRow 2: 6 6\n\nBut then the next cell in the input row is 2. Expanding that into a 2x2 block would give:\n\nRow 1: 2 4\n\nRow 2: 2 2\n\nThen the third cell is 4, which would expand into:\n\nRow 1: 4 6\n\nRow 2: 4 4\n\nAnd the fourth cell is 2, which would expand into:\n\nRow 1: 6 4\n\nRow 2: 2 2\n\nBut combining these blocks for the first input row would give the first two output rows as:\n\nRow 1: 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4\n\nRow 2: 6 6 2 2 4 4 2 2\n\nBut this doesn't match the actual output. The actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this approach may not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is different. For example, the first input cell (6) is expanded into:\n\nRow 1: 4 2\n\nRow 2: 6 6\n\nThen the second input cell (2) is expanded into:\n\nRow 1: 2 4\n\nRow 2: 2 2\n\nThird input cell (4) is expanded into:\n\nRow 1: 4 6\n\nRow 2: 4 4\n\nFourth input cell (2) is expanded into:\n\nRow 1: 6 4\n\nRow 2: 2 2\n\nCombining these blocks for the first input row would give:\n\nRow 1: 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4\n\nRow 2: 6 6 2 2 4 4 2 2\n\nBut the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion for each cell is different. For example, the first cell (6) is expanded into:\n\nRow 1: 4 2\n\nRow 2: 4 6\n\nBut then the second cell (2) is expanded into:\n\nRow 1: 2 4\n\nRow 2: 2 2\n\nThird cell (4) is expanded into:\n\nRow 1: 4 6\n\nRow 2: 4 4\n\nFourth cell (2) is expanded into:\n\nRow 1: 6 4\n\nRow 2: 2 2\n\nCombining these gives for row 1: 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4. Still not matching the actual output.\n\nThis suggests that the expansion is not straightforward. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the first output row for the first input row: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Let's split this into two parts: 4 2 4 6 and 6 4 2 4. So the first part is 4 2 4 6, and the second part is 6 4 2 4. The original input row is 6 2 4 2. So perhaps the first part is generated by taking the original elements and applying some transformation, and the second part is another transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, but the first element is the original element's value, and the second is something else. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the first input row and the first output row. The first input row is 6 2 4 2. The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Let's look at the first two elements of the output row: 4 and 2. These are the second and first elements of the input row. Then the next two are 4 and 6, which are the third and first elements of the input row. Then the next two are 6 and 4, which are the first and third elements of the input row. Then the next two are 2 and 4, which are the fourth and second elements of the input row.\n\nHmm, this seems like a pattern. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row: 6 (index 0), 2 (index 1), 4 (index 2), 2 (index 3).\n\nFirst two elements of output row: 4 (index 2), 2 (index 1).\n\nNext two: 4 (index 2), 6 (index 0).\n\nNext two: 6 (index 0), 4 (index 2).\n\nNext two: 2 (index 3), 4 (index 2).\n\nThis seems arbitrary. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and creating a new row where each element is the original element's value at a certain position, but in a different order.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first output row for the first input row: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Let's split this into two parts: the first four elements and the next four. The first four are 4, 2, 4, 6. The next four are 6, 4, 2, 4. So maybe the first four elements are derived from the original row in a certain way, and the next four are derived from another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is a combination of the original row and its reverse. For example, the original row is 6 2 4 2. Reverse is 2 4 2 6. But the first four elements of the output row are 4 2 4 6, which is not directly related.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the output for the first example, the output has two rows for each input row. The first two output rows for the first input row are:\n\nRow 1: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\n\nRow 2: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6\n\nNow, looking at the second output row for the first input row: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6. This seems like a pattern where the first two elements are 6, then two 2s, then two 2s again, then 6 again. So it's 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6. This could be generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two copies of itself, but with some pattern. For example, the original row is 6 2 4 2. If each element is replaced by two copies, it would be 6 6 2 2 4 4 2 2. But the second output row is 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, but with some changes. For example, the original row's elements are 6, 2, 4, 2. The second output row is 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6. So the first two elements are 6 6, which is the original first element repeated twice. Then the next two are 2 2, which is the original second element repeated twice. Then the next two are 2 2 again, and then 6 6 again. So this could be a pattern where each element is replaced by two copies of itself, but the third element (4) is replaced by two 2s. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a pattern where each element is replaced by two copies of the same value, but with the third element replaced by 2. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n\nInput:\n5 5 9 9\n9 5 5 5\n\nOutput:\n7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7\n5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5\n9 9 5 5 5 5 9 9\n9 9 5 5 5 5 9 9\n5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5\n7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7\n\nThe first input row is 5 5 9 9. The first two output rows are 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7 and 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. So the first output row for the first input row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. This seems like a pattern where each element is replaced by two elements, but with alternating values.\n\nFor example, the first input row is 5 5 9 9. The first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. So the first element is 7, then 5, then 7, then 5, then 5, then 7, then 5, then 7. This looks like a pattern where the first element is 7, then alternating between 5 and 7, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and inserting a 7 between the 5s and 9s. For example, the first input row is 5 5 9 9. The first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. This could be generated by inserting a 7 between the 5s and 9s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and creating a new row where each element is replaced by two elements: the first is 7 if the original element is 5, or 5 if it's 9. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, but the values in the block depend on the cell's value and its neighbors. For example, if the cell is 5, the block is 7 5 5 7, and if it's 9, it's 5 9 9 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nLooking at the first output row for the first input row in Example 2: 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. This could be generated by taking the original row's elements and inserting 7 between them. For example, 5 5 9 9 becomes 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. This seems to be the case. So between each pair of elements, insert a 7. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the first input row is 5 5 9 9. The first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. This could be generated by inserting 7 between each element. For example, the original row is 5,5,9,9. Inserting 7 between each pair gives 5 7 5 7 9 7 9 7. But that's not matching the first output row. Alternatively, inserting 7 at the beginning and end. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and creating a new row where each element is replaced by two elements: for 5, it's 7 and 5, and for 9, it's 5 and 7. So for 5 5 9 9, the new row would be 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. Which matches the first output row.\n\nAh! This seems promising. Let's check:\n\nFor each element in the input row, replace it with two elements: if the element is 5, then 7 and 5; if it's 9, then 5 and 7. So for the first input row 5 5 9 9, the first output row would be 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. Which matches the first output row. Then the second output row is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. This could be generated by replacing each element with two copies of itself. For example, 5 becomes 5 5, 9 becomes 9 9. So for 5 5 9 9, the second output row would be 5 5 5 5 9 9 9 9. But the actual second output row is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, but the second output row in Example 2 is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. This seems like it's not generated by simply repeating the elements. So perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by replacing each element with two elements, where the first is 7 if the element is 5, and 5 if it's 9. The second element is the original element. For example, 5 becomes 7 5, 9 becomes 5 9. So for the first input row 5 5 9 9, the first output row would be 7 5 7 5 5 9 9 9. But the actual first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by replacing each element with two elements, where the first is 7 if the element is 5, and 5 if it's 9. The second element is the original element. But for the first input row 5 5 9 9, the first output row would be 7 5 7 5 5 9 9 9. But the actual first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first output row is generated by replacing each element with two elements, where the first is 7 if the element is 5, and 5 if it's 9, and the second is the same as the first. For example, 5 becomes 7 7, 9 becomes 5 5. But then the first output row would be 7 7 7 7 5 5 5 5. Which doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the first example's output for the first input row: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Let's split this into two parts: 4 2 4 6 and 6 4 2 4. The original input row is 6 2 4 2. If I take the first element (6) and replace it with 4 and 2, then the second element (2) replaced with 2 and 4, third element (4) replaced with 4 and 6, fourth element (2) replaced with 6 and 4. This would give:\n\n4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4. But the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the first element (6) is replaced with 4 and 2, the second (2) with 2 and 4, third (4) with 4 and 6, fourth (2) with 6 and 4. Then combining them gives 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4. Still not matching.\n\nBut the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So maybe the first element is replaced with 4 and 2, the second with 2 and 4, third with 4 and 6, fourth with 6 and 4. Then the first part is 4 2 2 4, and the second part is 4 6 6 4. But this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, but the first element is the original element's value, and the second is the next element's value. For example, 6 2 4 2 becomes 6 2 2 4 4 2 2 4. But this doesn't match the actual output.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: the output for each input row is generated by taking the input row and creating two rows, where each row is a combination of the input row and some transformation. For example, the first output row is the input row with some pattern applied, and the second output row is the input row with another pattern.\n\nLooking at the first input row of Example 1: 6 2 4 2.\n\nFirst output row: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4.\n\nSecond output row: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6.\n\nNow, if I look at the first output row, it starts with 4 2 4 6, which could be the original row's elements in a certain order. Let's see: 6, 2, 4, 2. If I take the elements in the order 2, 4, 6, 2, that gives 2 4 6 2. Not matching. Alternatively, 4, 2, 4, 6. This could be the original elements in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, but the first is the original element, and the second is the next element. For example:\n\nOriginal row: 6, 2, 4, 2.\n\nFirst output row: 6, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2, 2, 4. But this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and creating a new row where each element is the original element's value at a certain position, but with some pattern. For example, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements: the first is the original element, and the second is the next element. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and creating a new row where each element is the original element's value at a certain position, but with some pattern. For example, the first output row is the original row with each element replaced by two elements, where the first is the original element, and the second is the original element's value from the next position.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nMaybe I should look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nTest input is:\n\n8 5 7 8\n\n7 7 8 8\n\n5 5 8 5\n\nSo the input is 3 rows, each with 4 elements. The output should be 6x8.\n\nLooking at the test input, if I can find a pattern, it might help.\n\nBut since I don't have the output for the test input, I have to rely on the training examples.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, and the values in the block depend on the cell's value and its position. For example, if the cell is in the first row, the block is a certain pattern, and if it's in the second row, another pattern.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's first input row, the first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. This could be the first row of a 2x2 block for each input cell. For example, the first input cell is 6, and its block is:\n\n4 2\n\n6 6\n\nThen the second input cell is 2, and its block is:\n\n2 4\n\n2 2\n\nThird input cell is 4, block:\n\n4 6\n\n4 4\n\nFourth input cell is 2, block:\n\n6 4\n\n2 2\n\nCombining these blocks for the first input row would give:\n\nRow 1: 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4\n\nRow 2: 6 6 2 2 4 4 2 2\n\nBut the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So maybe the first block for the first input cell is:\n\n4 2\n\n6 4\n\nThen the second block is:\n\n2 4\n\n2 2\n\nThird block:\n\n4 6\n\n4 4\n\nFourth block:\n\n6 4\n\n2 2\n\nCombining these would give:\n\nRow 1: 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4\n\nRow 2: 6 4 2 2 4 4 2 2\n\nStill not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLet me think about the output for each input row in Example 1. The first input row is 6 2 4 2. The first two output rows are:\n\nRow 1: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\n\nRow 2: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6\n\nNow, let's look at the first output row. If I split it into two parts, the first four elements are 4 2 4 6, and the next four are 6 4 2 4. This looks like the original row's elements are 6, 2, 4, 2. The first part is 4 2 4 6, which is the original elements in a certain order. Maybe it's the original elements with some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and creating a new row where each element is the original element's value at a certain position. For example, the first element is 4, which is the second element of the original row. The second is 2, which is the first element. The third is 4, which is the third element. The fourth is 6, which is the first element. Then the next four elements are 6, 4, 2, 4, which are the first, third, second, third elements. This seems arbitrary.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that each input row is transformed into two output rows, where each output row is a combination of the original row and its reverse. For example, the first output row is the original row and its reverse combined in some way.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each input cell is replaced by a 2x2 block that depends on the cell's value and its neighbors. For example, if the cell is 6, the block is 4 2, 6 6. If the cell is 2, the block is 2 4, 2 2. If the cell is 4, the block is 4 6, 4 4. If the cell is 2, the block is 6 4, 2 2.\n\nThis would give for the first input row:\n\nRow 1: 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4\n\nRow 2: 6 6 2 2 4 4 2 2\n\nBut the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut if the block for the first input cell (6) is 4 2, 6 4, then the first output row would be 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4. Still not matching.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput:\n3 3 5 5\n5 8 5 8\n8 8 5 8\n\nOutput:\n8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8\n8 5 8 5 5 8 5 8\n5 5 3 3 3 3 5 5\n5 5 3 3 3 3 5 5\n8 5 8 5 5 8 5 8\n8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8\n\nLet's look at the first input row: 3 3 5 5. The first two output rows are:\n\nRow 1: 8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8\n\nRow 2: 8 5 8 5 5 8 5 8\n\nSo for the first input row, the first output row is 8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8. This seems like a pattern where each element is replaced by two elements. For example, 3 becomes 8 5, 3 becomes 8 8, 5 becomes 8 8, 5 becomes 5 8. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, where the first is 8 if the original element is 3 or 5, and the second is 5 or 8 depending on the original element. But this is just a guess.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should try to find a general pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at the first example, the output for each input row is generated by taking the input row and creating two output rows. For example, the first input row is 6 2 4 2, and the first two output rows are:\n\nRow 1: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\n\nRow 2: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6\n\nNow, if I look at the first output row, it starts with 4 2 4 6, which is the original row's elements in a certain order. The second output row is 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6, which is the original row's elements with each replaced by two copies.\n\nMaybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements: for 6, it's 4 and 2; for 2, it's 2 and 4; for 4, it's 4 and 6; for 2, it's 6 and 4. This would give:\n\n4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4. But the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut if the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, but the first is the original element's value, and the second is the next element's value. For example, 6 2 4 2 becomes 6 2 2 4 4 2 2 4. But this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, where the first is the original element's value, and the second is the original element's value from the next position. For example, 6 2 4 2 becomes 6 2 2 4 4 2 2 4. But this doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output rows for each example.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first input row is 6 2 4 2. The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. This could be generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements: 4 2, 2 4, 4 6, 6 4. So the first two elements are 4 2, next two are 2 4, next two are 4 6, next two are 6 4. This would give the first output row as 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4. But the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut if the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements: 4 2, 4 6, 6 4, 2 4. This would give 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4, which matches the first output row. So this seems to be the pattern.\n\nSo for each element in the input row, it is replaced by two elements: the first is 4 if the element is 6, 2 if it's 2, 4 if it's 4, and 6 if it's 2. Wait, this is not consistent. For example, the first element is 6, replaced by 4 and 2. The second element is 2, replaced by 4 and 6. The third element is 4, replaced by 6 and 4. The fourth element is 2, replaced by 2 and 4. This seems arbitrary, but it matches the first output row.\n\nBut this is just for the first input row. How does this apply to other examples?\n\nIn Example 2, the first input row is 5 5 9 9. The first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. If each element is replaced by two elements: 7 and 5 for 5, 5 and 7 for 9. So 5 becomes 7 5, 5 becomes 7 5, 9 becomes 5 7, 9 becomes 5 7. This would give 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7, which matches the first output row.\n\nThe second output row for the first input row is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. This could be generated by replacing each element with two copies of itself. So 5 becomes 5 5, 5 becomes 5 5, 9 becomes 9 9, 9 becomes 9 9. But the actual second output row is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. So this doesn't match. But maybe the second output row is generated by taking the original row and replacing each element with two copies of itself, but with some changes.\n\nAlternatively, the second output row is generated by taking the original row and replacing each element with two copies of itself, but with the third element replaced by 5. But this is not clear.\n\nBut if the first output row is generated by replacing each element with two elements based on its value, and the second output row is generated by replacing each element with two copies of itself, then this might be the pattern.\n\nFor example, for the first input row in Example 2, the first output row is generated by replacing each 5 with 7 5 and each 9 with 5 7. The second output row is generated by replacing each element with two copies of itself. But this would give for the first input row 5 5 9 9: 5 5 5 5 9 9 9 9. But the actual second output row is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the second output row is generated by taking the original row and replacing each element with two copies of itself, but with the third element replaced by 5. This is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a different transformation. For example, for each element, replace it with two elements: if it's 5, replace with 5 5; if it's 9, replace with 9 9. But this would give 5 5 5 5 9 9 9 9, which doesn't match the actual second output row.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to find a general pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at the first example, the first output row for the first input row is generated by replacing each element with two elements, where the first element is 4 if the original is 6, 2 if it's 2, 4 if it's 4, and 6 if it's 2. This seems arbitrary, but it works for the first example.\n\nFor the second example, the first output row is generated by replacing each 5 with 7 5 and each 9 with 5 7.\n\nFor the third example, the first input row is 3 3 5 5. The first output row is 8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8. This could be generated by replacing each 3 with 8 5 and each 5 with 8 8. So for 3 3 5 5, it becomes 8 5 8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8. Wait, but the first output row is 8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row for the third example is generated by replacing each 3 with 8 5, each 3 with 8 8, each 5 with 8 8, and each 5 with 5 8. This would give 8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8, which matches the first output row.\n\nSo this suggests that each element is replaced by two elements, but the replacement depends on the element's value. For example:\n\n- 3 \u2192 8 5\n- 3 \u2192 8 8\n- 5 \u2192 8 8\n- 5 \u2192 5 8\n\nBut this is inconsistent. However, this seems to work for the third example.\n\nBut how to generalize this? It seems like there's a pattern where each element is replaced by two elements based on its value, but the replacement rules vary.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is to replace each element in the input with two elements, where the first element is determined by the original value, and the second element is determined by the original value or its position.\n\nBut this is too vague. Maybe the pattern is that each element is replaced by two elements, and the first element is the original value, and the second element is the next element in the input row. But this would be for the first output row.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and creating a new row where each element is the original element followed by the next element. For example, for 6 2 4 2, the first output row would be 6 2 2 4 4 2 2 4. But the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the patterns I've observed.\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that each input row is transformed into two output rows. The first output row for each input row is generated by replacing each element with two elements, where the first is a certain value and the second is another. The second output row is generated by replacing each element with two copies of itself.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first input row is 6 2 4 2. The first output row is generated by replacing each element with two elements: 4 2, 2 4, 4 6, 6 4. This gives the first output row as 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4, but the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut if I look at the first output row of Example 1, it's 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. This could be generated by replacing each element with two elements, where the first is 4 if the original is 6, 2 if it's 2, 4 if it's 4, and 6 if it's 2. This seems arbitrary, but it works for the first example.\n\nFor Example 2, the first input row is 5 5 9 9. The first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7, which is generated by replacing each 5 with 7 5 and each 9 with 5 7.\n\nFor Example 3, the first input row is 3 3 5 5. The first output row is 8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8. This could be generated by replacing each 3 with 8 5 and each 5 with 8 8.\n\nThis suggests that the first output row is generated by replacing each element with two elements based on its value, and the second output row is generated by replacing each element with two copies of itself.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nMaybe the first output row is generated by replacing each element with two elements, where the first is a certain value and the second is the original element. For example, for 5, it's 7 and 5; for 9, it's 5 and 7; for 6, it's 4 and 2; for 2, it's 2 and 4; for 4, it's 4 and 6; for 3, it's 8 and 5; for 5, it's 8 and 8.\n\nBut this is too specific to the examples and doesn't generalize.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and creating a new row where each element is the original element's value and the next element's value. For example, for 6 2 4 2, the first output row would be 6 2 2 4 4 2 2 4. But this doesn't match the actual first output row.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that takes the input grid and generates the output grid by expanding each input row into two output rows, where the first output row is generated by some transformation and the second is generated by another.\n\nBut since I'm not sure of the exact pattern, I'll have to make a guess.\n\nBased on the examples, it seems that each input row is transformed into two output rows. The first output row for each input row is generated by replacing each element with two elements, where the first is a certain value and the second is the original element. The second output row is generated by replacing each element with two copies of itself.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first input row is 6 2 4 2. The first output row is generated by replacing each element with two elements: 4 2, 2 4, 4 6, 6 4. The second output row is generated by replacing each element with two copies of itself: 6 6, 2 2, 4 4, 2 2.\n\nThis would give the first output row as 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4 and the second as 6 6 2 2 4 4 2 2. But the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4, which doesn't match.\n\nBut this is the best I can do. So I'll try to implement this pattern, even if it doesn't match all examples.\n\nThe function would take the input grid, and for each row in the input, generate two rows in the output. For the first output row, replace each element with two elements, where the first is a certain value and the second is the original element. For the second output row, replace each element with two copies of itself.\n\nBut how to determine the first part of the replacement.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nExample 1: 6 \u2192 4 2, 2 \u2192 2 4, 4 \u2192 4 6, 2 \u2192 6 4.\n\nExample 2: 5 \u2192 7 5, 9 \u2192 5 7.\n\nExample 3: 3 \u2192 8 5, 5 \u2192 8 8.\n\nThis suggests that the first part of the replacement is determined by the element's value. But how?\n\nMaybe the first part of the replacement is determined by the element's value and its position in the input row.\n\nAlternatively, it's a fixed pattern for each value. For example:\n\n- 6 \u2192 4 2\n- 2 \u2192 2 4\n- 4 \u2192 4 6\n- 5 \u2192 7 5\n- 9 \u2192 5 7\n- 3 \u2192 8 5\n- 5 \u2192 8 8\n\nBut this is arbitrary and specific to the examples.\n\nGiven that, the function could be written as follows:\n\nFor each input row, generate two output rows.\n\nFor the first output row, replace each element with two elements based on a lookup table.\n\nFor the second output row, replace each element with two copies of itself.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThe lookup table could be:\n\n{\n    6: [4, 2],\n    2: [2, 4],\n    4: [4, 6],\n    5: [7, 5],\n    9: [5, 7],\n    3: [8, 5],\n    8: [8, 5],  # assuming 8 is replaced with 8 5?\n    7: [8, 5],  # assuming 7 is replaced with 8 5?\n}\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nHowever, this approach might not work for all cases, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the function would:\n\n- For each input row, generate two output rows.\n\n- For the first output row, replace each element with the pair from the lookup table.\n\n- For the second output row, replace each element with two copies of itself.\n\nBut how to handle elements not in the lookup table. For example, if the input has a 1, what to do?\n\nBut since the training examples don't include such cases, perhaps this is the best approach.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a lookup table for the first output row\n    lookup = {\n        6: [4, 2],\n        2: [2, 4],\n        4: [4, 6],\n        5: [7, 5],\n        9: [5, 7],\n        3: [8, 5],\n        8: [8, 5],\n        7: [8, 5]\n    }\n    \n    output = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Generate first output row\n        first_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            first_row.extend(lookup[val])\n        # Generate second output row\n        second_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            second_row.extend([val, val])\n        # Add both rows to the output\n        output.append(first_row)\n        output.append(second_row)\n    # Now, the output is 2 * len(grid) rows, each of length 2 * len(row)\n    # But the required output is 6x8, which is 3x4 input. So for input of 3 rows, output has 6 rows.\n    # But this code would generate 2 * len(grid) rows, each of length 2 * len(row).\n    # However, the required output is 6x8, which is 3 rows * 2 = 6 rows, and each row is 4 * 2 = 8 columns.\n    # So this code would work for the training examples.\n    return output\n\nBut this code would generate the first output rows based on the lookup table, and the second rows as duplicates.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nInput row: 6 2 4 2\n\nFirst_row: [4, 2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6, 4] \u2192 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4\n\nSecond_row: 6 6 2 2 4 4 2 2\n\nBut the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut this is the best I can do given the time constraints. Maybe the lookup table is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by replacing each element with the pair [val, next_val], but this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: for the first output row, each element is replaced by two elements, where the first is the original element and the second is the next element. For example, for 6 2 4 2, the first output row would be 6 2 2 4 4 2 2 4. But this doesn't match the actual first output row.\n\nBut the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I have to proceed with the code that generates the first output row based on the lookup table and the second output row as duplicates. Even if it doesn't match all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the final code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a lookup table for the first output row\n    lookup = {\n        6: [4, 2],\n        2: [2, 4],\n        4: [4, 6],\n        5: [7, 5],\n        9: [5, 7],\n        3: [8, 5],\n        8: [8, 5],\n        7: [8, 5]\n    }\n    \n    output = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Generate first output row\n        first_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            first_row.extend(lookup[val])\n        # Generate second output row\n        second_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            second_row.extend([val, val])\n        # Add both rows to the output\n        output.append(first_row)\n        output.append(second_row)\n    return output\n\nBut this code may not work for all examples. For example, in Example 1, the first output row is not matching, but it's the best I can do based on the examples provided.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nThe input for Example 1 is a 3x4 grid, and the output is a 6x8 grid. So the input is 3 rows, each with 4 elements. The output is 6 rows, each with 8 elements. So the output is twice as tall and twice as wide as the input. Wait, maybe the output is generated by some kind of expansion or repetition of the input?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\nRow 0: 6 2 4 2\nRow 1: 2 2 6 6\nRow 2: 6 4 2 4\n\nThe output has 6 rows. Let me check the output rows:\n\nFirst output row: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\nSecond: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6\nThird: 2 4 2 6 6 2 4 2\nFourth: 2 4 2 6 6 2 4 2\nFifth: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6\nSixth: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\n\nHmm. So the output seems to have the input rows duplicated. Like, the first two output rows might be based on the first input row, then the next two on the second input row, and the last two on the third input row. But how?\n\nLooking at the first input row (6 2 4 2). The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Wait, that's 8 elements. Let me see if there's a pattern here. Maybe each input element is expanded into two elements? Or maybe some transformation applied.\n\nAlternatively, maybe each input row is split into two parts, and each part is repeated. For example, the first input row is 6 2 4 2. Maybe each element is duplicated? But 6 becomes 6 6, but in the output, the first row starts with 4 2 4 6... which doesn't seem to match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying some kind of mirroring or transformation. Let's look at the first input row. Let's see the output rows. The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. The second output row is 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6. The third is 2 4 2 6 6 2 4 2. The fourth is same as third. Then fifth is same as second, sixth same as first.\n\nSo the output seems to have the first two rows as the first input row transformed in some way, then the next two rows as the second input row transformed, then the last two as the third input row transformed.\n\nBut how? Let's look at the first input row. Let's think about the first output row. The first input row is 6 2 4 2. The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Hmm. Let me check the positions. Maybe each element is replaced by two elements, but with some pattern. For example, 6 becomes 4 and 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying some kind of transformation that's mirrored or rotated. Let's see. For example, the first input row is 6 2 4 2. The first output row starts with 4 2 4 6... which is similar to the original elements but in a different order. Wait, maybe the first output row is a combination of the original elements and their neighbors? Or maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where each element is expanded into two elements, but with some rule.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output rows, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 2x2 block for each input cell. For example, each input cell is transformed into a 2x2 block. But since the output is 6x8, which is 3x4 input multiplied by 2 in each direction, that would fit. So for each input cell, it's expanded into 2 rows and 2 columns. But how?\n\nLet me think. The input is 3 rows by 4 columns. The output is 6 rows by 8 columns. So each input row is split into two rows, and each input column is split into two columns. So for each input cell, there's a 2x2 block in the output. But how is that block structured?\n\nLooking at the first input row (6 2 4 2). The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Let's see the first four elements of the first output row: 4, 2, 4, 6. Then next four: 6, 4, 2, 4. So maybe the first input row is transformed into two rows of four elements each. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each input row and creating two rows by some transformation. For example, the first input row is transformed into two rows, each of which is a combination of the original elements and their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first input row and the first two output rows. The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. The second output row is 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6. Then the third output row is 2 4 2 6 6 2 4 2. The fourth is same as third. Then fifth is same as second, sixth same as first.\n\nSo for the first input row, the first two output rows are different. Let me check the first input row. Let's think of the output rows as being generated by some transformation that applies to each input row. Maybe the first input row is transformed into two rows, each of which is a combination of the original elements and some mirrored or rotated version.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying a transformation that's similar to a 2x2 grid. For example, each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block where the top-left is the original value, and the rest are derived from it. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first input row and the first two output rows. Let me check the first input row's elements: 6, 2, 4, 2. The first output row is 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4. The second output row is 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6.\n\nWait, maybe the first two output rows are generated by taking the input row and applying a transformation that alternates between two different patterns. For example, the first output row is 4, 2, 4, 6 followed by 6, 4, 2, 4. The second output row is 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 2x2 grid for each input cell. For example, each input cell is transformed into a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for each input row. For example, the first input row is 6 2 4 2. The output rows for this input row are the first two output rows. Let me look at the first output row: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. The second output row is 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6. So maybe the first output row is a combination of the original elements and some mirrored elements, and the second output row is a combination of the original elements in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each input row and creating two rows where each element is duplicated, but with some pattern. For example, the first input row's elements are 6, 2, 4, 2. The first output row is 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4. Wait, that's 8 elements. Let me see:\n\nIf the original row is 6 2 4 2, maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original elements and inserting some values between them. For example, inserting 2 between 6 and 2, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each input row and applying a transformation that creates two rows. For example, the first input row is transformed into two rows by some pattern. Let's take the first input row and see what the first two output rows are. The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. The second is 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6.\n\nLooking at the first output row, maybe the first two elements are 4 and 2, which are the second and first elements of the input row? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the first output row is the original row transformed in some way. For example, the first input row is 6 2 4 2. The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Let me split this into two parts: 4 2 4 6 and 6 4 2 4. The first part is 4, 2, 4, 6. The second part is 6, 4, 2, 4. So maybe the first part is the original row with some transformation. For example, the original row is 6, 2, 4, 2. If we take the first element (6) and replace it with 4 and 2? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input row and creating a new row where each element is duplicated, but with some pattern. For example, the first input row is 6 2 4 2. If each element is duplicated, that would be 6 6 2 2 4 4 2 2. But the first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking each input row and creating two rows where each row is a combination of the original row and some mirrored version. For example, the first output row is the original row mirrored in some way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first input row and the first output row. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input row: 6 2 4 2.\n\nFirst output row: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4.\n\nIf we look at the first four elements: 4 2 4 6. The original row's elements are 6, 2, 4, 2. So maybe the first four elements are 4, 2, 4, 6. That's the original row's elements in reverse order, but with some changes. Wait, original row is 6, 2, 4, 2. Reverse is 2,4,2,6. Not matching the first four elements of the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is the original row's elements in a certain order. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row elements: 6, 2, 4, 2.\n\nFirst output row elements: 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4.\n\nLooking at the first four elements: 4, 2, 4, 6. That's 4, 2, 4, 6. If we take the original row and split it into two parts: first two elements (6, 2) and last two (4, 2). Then maybe the first part is transformed into 4, 2, and the second part into 4, 6? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 2x2 grid for each cell. For example, each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block. But how?\n\nLet me think about the first input row. Each cell is 6, 2, 4, 2. If each is expanded into a 2x2 block, then for the first cell (6), the block would be:\n\nRow 1: 4 2\n\nRow 2: 6 6\n\nBut then for the second cell (2), the block would be:\n\nRow 1: 2 4\n\nRow 2: 2 2\n\nBut this is just a guess. Then combining these blocks for the first row would create a 2x4 block, which would be expanded into 4 rows. But the output is 6 rows. Hmm, this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 2x2 grid for each cell, and then repeating that for each row. For example, each input row is split into two rows, and each input column into two columns.\n\nBut how to get from the input to the output. Let's think of the output as being generated by taking the input and applying a transformation that creates a 2x2 grid for each cell, then repeating that for each row. But this is getting too vague.\n\nLooking at the second example. Input is 3x4:\n\n5 5 9 9\n\n9 5 5 5\n\n5 7 5 7\n\nOutput is 6x8. Let's look at the first output row: 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. The second row is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. Third row is 9 9 5 5 5 5 9 9. Fourth same as third. Fifth same as second. Sixth same as first.\n\nSo the first input row is 5 5 9 9. The first two output rows are 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7 and 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. So the first output row seems to be a combination of 7 and 5, then 5 and 7, etc. The second output row is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. So perhaps the first input row is transformed into two rows where the first row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7, which is the original elements with some pattern. For example, 7 and 5 alternating, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and applying some kind of pattern where each element is mirrored or repeated. For example, the first input row is 5 5 9 9. The first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. Which is 7, 5, 7, 5, 5, 7, 5, 7. So maybe the first row is generated by taking the original elements and inserting some values between them. Like 5 is replaced by 7 and 5, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first input row and the first two output rows. The first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. The second is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. So maybe the first output row is generated by taking the first input row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, but with some pattern. For example, 5 becomes 7 5, and 9 becomes 5 7? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a 2x2 grid for each cell, but the pattern depends on the cell's value. For example, if a cell is 5, it becomes a 2x2 block with 7 and 5 in some way. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother approach: looking for a pattern in the output rows. For example, in Example 1, the output has the first two rows as the first input row transformed, then the next two as the second input row, then the last two as the third input row. So for each input row, there are two output rows. So maybe each input row is transformed into two output rows, and the same for each input column.\n\nBut how to generate those two rows from the input row.\n\nLooking at the first input row (6 2 4 2) and the first two output rows:\n\nFirst output row: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\n\nSecond output row: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6\n\nHmm. Let's split the first output row into two parts: first four elements and next four. The first four are 4 2 4 6. The next four are 6 4 2 4. The second output row is 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6. So maybe the first output row is the original row transformed in some way, and the second is another transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is the original row with some pattern applied, and the second is the original row with another pattern. For example, the first output row could be the original row with each element replaced by two elements, but the second row is the same as the first but with some changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is the original row's elements with some transformation applied, and the second is the same as the first but with a different pattern. For example, the first row could be the original row's elements mirrored in some way, and the second row is the same as the first but with some changes.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first input row and the first output row. The first input row is 6, 2, 4, 2. The first output row is 4, 2, 4, 6, 6, 4, 2, 4. Let's see if there's a pattern in the first four elements. 4, 2, 4, 6. The original elements are 6, 2, 4, 2. So maybe the first element of the first output row is 4, which is the second element of the original row. Then the second element is 2, which is the original first element. Then third is 4 (original third), fourth is 6 (original first). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and inserting some values between the elements. For example, between 6 and 2, insert 2, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first output row and the second output row. The first output row starts with 4 2 4 6, and the second starts with 6 6 2 2. The original row is 6 2 4 2. So maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, but the second output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a different transformation.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block. For example, each input cell is transformed into a 2x2 block. Then, the entire input grid is transformed into a 2x2 grid for each cell, resulting in a larger grid. But how?\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input is 3 rows by 4 columns. If each cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, the output would be 6 rows by 8 columns, which matches the required output size. So this seems promising.\n\nSo for each cell in the input grid, we generate a 2x2 block in the output grid. But how to determine the values of these blocks?\n\nLet's look at the first input cell (6,2,4,2) in the first row. Let's take the first input cell, which is 6. If this is expanded into a 2x2 block, what would the values be?\n\nIn the first output row, the first four elements are 4, 2, 4, 6. The second output row is 6, 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 6, 6. So the first two output rows are the first two rows of the expanded blocks for the first input row.\n\nIf the first input row's first cell (6) is expanded into a 2x2 block, then the first two output rows for this cell would be:\n\nRow 1: 4 2\n\nRow 2: 6 6\n\nBut then the next cell in the input row is 2. Expanding that into a 2x2 block would give:\n\nRow 1: 2 4\n\nRow 2: 2 2\n\nThen the third cell is 4, which would expand into:\n\nRow 1: 4 6\n\nRow 2: 4 4\n\nAnd the fourth cell is 2, which would expand into:\n\nRow 1: 6 4\n\nRow 2: 2 2\n\nBut combining these blocks for the first input row would give the first two output rows as:\n\nRow 1: 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4\n\nRow 2: 6 6 2 2 4 4 2 2\n\nBut this doesn't match the actual output. The actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this approach may not be correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is different. For example, the first input cell (6) is expanded into:\n\nRow 1: 4 2\n\nRow 2: 6 6\n\nThen the second input cell (2) is expanded into:\n\nRow 1: 2 4\n\nRow 2: 2 2\n\nThird input cell (4) is expanded into:\n\nRow 1: 4 6\n\nRow 2: 4 4\n\nFourth input cell (2) is expanded into:\n\nRow 1: 6 4\n\nRow 2: 2 2\n\nCombining these blocks for the first input row would give:\n\nRow 1: 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4\n\nRow 2: 6 6 2 2 4 4 2 2\n\nBut the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion for each cell is different. For example, the first cell (6) is expanded into:\n\nRow 1: 4 2\n\nRow 2: 4 6\n\nBut then the second cell (2) is expanded into:\n\nRow 1: 2 4\n\nRow 2: 2 2\n\nThird cell (4) is expanded into:\n\nRow 1: 4 6\n\nRow 2: 4 4\n\nFourth cell (2) is expanded into:\n\nRow 1: 6 4\n\nRow 2: 2 2\n\nCombining these gives for row 1: 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4. Still not matching the actual output.\n\nThis suggests that the expansion is not straightforward. Maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the first output row for the first input row: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Let's split this into two parts: 4 2 4 6 and 6 4 2 4. So the first part is 4 2 4 6, and the second part is 6 4 2 4. The original input row is 6 2 4 2. So perhaps the first part is generated by taking the original elements and applying some transformation, and the second part is another transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, but the first element is the original element's value, and the second is something else. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the first input row and the first output row. The first input row is 6 2 4 2. The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Let's look at the first two elements of the output row: 4 and 2. These are the second and first elements of the input row. Then the next two are 4 and 6, which are the third and first elements of the input row. Then the next two are 6 and 4, which are the first and third elements of the input row. Then the next two are 2 and 4, which are the fourth and second elements of the input row.\n\nHmm, this seems like a pattern. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row: 6 (index 0), 2 (index 1), 4 (index 2), 2 (index 3).\n\nFirst two elements of output row: 4 (index 2), 2 (index 1).\n\nNext two: 4 (index 2), 6 (index 0).\n\nNext two: 6 (index 0), 4 (index 2).\n\nNext two: 2 (index 3), 4 (index 2).\n\nThis seems arbitrary. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and creating a new row where each element is the original element's value at a certain position, but in a different order.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first output row for the first input row: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Let's split this into two parts: the first four elements and the next four. The first four are 4, 2, 4, 6. The next four are 6, 4, 2, 4. So maybe the first four elements are derived from the original row in a certain way, and the next four are derived from another way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is a combination of the original row and its reverse. For example, the original row is 6 2 4 2. Reverse is 2 4 2 6. But the first four elements of the output row are 4 2 4 6, which is not directly related.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the output for the first example, the output has two rows for each input row. The first two output rows for the first input row are:\n\nRow 1: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\n\nRow 2: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6\n\nNow, looking at the second output row for the first input row: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6. This seems like a pattern where the first two elements are 6, then two 2s, then two 2s again, then 6 again. So it's 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6. This could be generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two copies of itself, but with some pattern. For example, the original row is 6 2 4 2. If each element is replaced by two copies, it would be 6 6 2 2 4 4 2 2. But the second output row is 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, but with some changes. For example, the original row's elements are 6, 2, 4, 2. The second output row is 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6. So the first two elements are 6 6, which is the original first element repeated twice. Then the next two are 2 2, which is the original second element repeated twice. Then the next two are 2 2 again, and then 6 6 again. So this could be a pattern where each element is replaced by two copies of itself, but the third element (4) is replaced by two 2s. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a pattern where each element is replaced by two copies of the same value, but with the third element replaced by 2. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\n\nInput:\n5 5 9 9\n9 5 5 5\n\nOutput:\n7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7\n5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5\n9 9 5 5 5 5 9 9\n9 9 5 5 5 5 9 9\n5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5\n7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7\n\nThe first input row is 5 5 9 9. The first two output rows are 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7 and 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. So the first output row for the first input row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. This seems like a pattern where each element is replaced by two elements, but with alternating values.\n\nFor example, the first input row is 5 5 9 9. The first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. So the first element is 7, then 5, then 7, then 5, then 5, then 7, then 5, then 7. This looks like a pattern where the first element is 7, then alternating between 5 and 7, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and inserting a 7 between the 5s and 9s. For example, the first input row is 5 5 9 9. The first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. This could be generated by inserting a 7 between the 5s and 9s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and creating a new row where each element is replaced by two elements: the first is 7 if the original element is 5, or 5 if it's 9. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, but the values in the block depend on the cell's value and its neighbors. For example, if the cell is 5, the block is 7 5 5 7, and if it's 9, it's 5 9 9 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nLooking at the first output row for the first input row in Example 2: 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. This could be generated by taking the original row's elements and inserting 7 between them. For example, 5 5 9 9 becomes 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. This seems to be the case. So between each pair of elements, insert a 7. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the first input row is 5 5 9 9. The first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. This could be generated by inserting 7 between each element. For example, the original row is 5,5,9,9. Inserting 7 between each pair gives 5 7 5 7 9 7 9 7. But that's not matching the first output row. Alternatively, inserting 7 at the beginning and end. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and creating a new row where each element is replaced by two elements: for 5, it's 7 and 5, and for 9, it's 5 and 7. So for 5 5 9 9, the new row would be 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. Which matches the first output row.\n\nAh! This seems promising. Let's check:\n\nFor each element in the input row, replace it with two elements: if the element is 5, then 7 and 5; if it's 9, then 5 and 7. So for the first input row 5 5 9 9, the first output row would be 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. Which matches the first output row. Then the second output row is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. This could be generated by replacing each element with two copies of itself. For example, 5 becomes 5 5, 9 becomes 9 9. So for 5 5 9 9, the second output row would be 5 5 5 5 9 9 9 9. But the actual second output row is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, but the second output row in Example 2 is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. This seems like it's not generated by simply repeating the elements. So perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by replacing each element with two elements, where the first is 7 if the element is 5, and 5 if it's 9. The second element is the original element. For example, 5 becomes 7 5, 9 becomes 5 9. So for the first input row 5 5 9 9, the first output row would be 7 5 7 5 5 9 9 9. But the actual first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by replacing each element with two elements, where the first is 7 if the element is 5, and 5 if it's 9. The second element is the original element. But for the first input row 5 5 9 9, the first output row would be 7 5 7 5 5 9 9 9. But the actual first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the first output row is generated by replacing each element with two elements, where the first is 7 if the element is 5, and 5 if it's 9, and the second is the same as the first. For example, 5 becomes 7 7, 9 becomes 5 5. But then the first output row would be 7 7 7 7 5 5 5 5. Which doesn't match.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the first example's output for the first input row: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. Let's split this into two parts: 4 2 4 6 and 6 4 2 4. The original input row is 6 2 4 2. If I take the first element (6) and replace it with 4 and 2, then the second element (2) replaced with 2 and 4, third element (4) replaced with 4 and 6, fourth element (2) replaced with 6 and 4. This would give:\n\n4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4. But the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the first element (6) is replaced with 4 and 2, the second (2) with 2 and 4, third (4) with 4 and 6, fourth (2) with 6 and 4. Then combining them gives 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4. Still not matching.\n\nBut the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So maybe the first element is replaced with 4 and 2, the second with 2 and 4, third with 4 and 6, fourth with 6 and 4. Then the first part is 4 2 2 4, and the second part is 4 6 6 4. But this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, but the first element is the original element's value, and the second is the next element's value. For example, 6 2 4 2 becomes 6 2 2 4 4 2 2 4. But this doesn't match the actual output.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: the output for each input row is generated by taking the input row and creating two rows, where each row is a combination of the input row and some transformation. For example, the first output row is the input row with some pattern applied, and the second output row is the input row with another pattern.\n\nLooking at the first input row of Example 1: 6 2 4 2.\n\nFirst output row: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4.\n\nSecond output row: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6.\n\nNow, if I look at the first output row, it starts with 4 2 4 6, which could be the original row's elements in a certain order. Let's see: 6, 2, 4, 2. If I take the elements in the order 2, 4, 6, 2, that gives 2 4 6 2. Not matching. Alternatively, 4, 2, 4, 6. This could be the original elements in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, but the first is the original element, and the second is the next element. For example:\n\nOriginal row: 6, 2, 4, 2.\n\nFirst output row: 6, 2, 2, 4, 4, 2, 2, 4. But this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and creating a new row where each element is the original element's value at a certain position, but with some pattern. For example, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements: the first is the original element, and the second is the next element. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and creating a new row where each element is the original element's value at a certain position, but with some pattern. For example, the first output row is the original row with each element replaced by two elements, where the first is the original element, and the second is the original element's value from the next position.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nMaybe I should look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nTest input is:\n\n8 5 7 8\n\n7 7 8 8\n\n5 5 8 5\n\nSo the input is 3 rows, each with 4 elements. The output should be 6x8.\n\nLooking at the test input, if I can find a pattern, it might help.\n\nBut since I don't have the output for the test input, I have to rely on the training examples.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each input cell is expanded into a 2x2 block, and the values in the block depend on the cell's value and its position. For example, if the cell is in the first row, the block is a certain pattern, and if it's in the second row, another pattern.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's first input row, the first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. This could be the first row of a 2x2 block for each input cell. For example, the first input cell is 6, and its block is:\n\n4 2\n\n6 6\n\nThen the second input cell is 2, and its block is:\n\n2 4\n\n2 2\n\nThird input cell is 4, block:\n\n4 6\n\n4 4\n\nFourth input cell is 2, block:\n\n6 4\n\n2 2\n\nCombining these blocks for the first input row would give:\n\nRow 1: 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4\n\nRow 2: 6 6 2 2 4 4 2 2\n\nBut the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So maybe the first block for the first input cell is:\n\n4 2\n\n6 4\n\nThen the second block is:\n\n2 4\n\n2 2\n\nThird block:\n\n4 6\n\n4 4\n\nFourth block:\n\n6 4\n\n2 2\n\nCombining these would give:\n\nRow 1: 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4\n\nRow 2: 6 4 2 2 4 4 2 2\n\nStill not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLet me think about the output for each input row in Example 1. The first input row is 6 2 4 2. The first two output rows are:\n\nRow 1: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\n\nRow 2: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6\n\nNow, let's look at the first output row. If I split it into two parts, the first four elements are 4 2 4 6, and the next four are 6 4 2 4. This looks like the original row's elements are 6, 2, 4, 2. The first part is 4 2 4 6, which is the original elements in a certain order. Maybe it's the original elements with some transformation.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and creating a new row where each element is the original element's value at a certain position. For example, the first element is 4, which is the second element of the original row. The second is 2, which is the first element. The third is 4, which is the third element. The fourth is 6, which is the first element. Then the next four elements are 6, 4, 2, 4, which are the first, third, second, third elements. This seems arbitrary.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that each input row is transformed into two output rows, where each output row is a combination of the original row and its reverse. For example, the first output row is the original row and its reverse combined in some way.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input and creating a grid where each input cell is replaced by a 2x2 block that depends on the cell's value and its neighbors. For example, if the cell is 6, the block is 4 2, 6 6. If the cell is 2, the block is 2 4, 2 2. If the cell is 4, the block is 4 6, 4 4. If the cell is 2, the block is 6 4, 2 2.\n\nThis would give for the first input row:\n\nRow 1: 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4\n\nRow 2: 6 6 2 2 4 4 2 2\n\nBut the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut if the block for the first input cell (6) is 4 2, 6 4, then the first output row would be 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4. Still not matching.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput:\n3 3 5 5\n5 8 5 8\n8 8 5 8\n\nOutput:\n8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8\n8 5 8 5 5 8 5 8\n5 5 3 3 3 3 5 5\n5 5 3 3 3 3 5 5\n8 5 8 5 5 8 5 8\n8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8\n\nLet's look at the first input row: 3 3 5 5. The first two output rows are:\n\nRow 1: 8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8\n\nRow 2: 8 5 8 5 5 8 5 8\n\nSo for the first input row, the first output row is 8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8. This seems like a pattern where each element is replaced by two elements. For example, 3 becomes 8 5, 3 becomes 8 8, 5 becomes 8 8, 5 becomes 5 8. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, where the first is 8 if the original element is 3 or 5, and the second is 5 or 8 depending on the original element. But this is just a guess.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should try to find a general pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at the first example, the output for each input row is generated by taking the input row and creating two output rows. For example, the first input row is 6 2 4 2, and the first two output rows are:\n\nRow 1: 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4\n\nRow 2: 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6\n\nNow, if I look at the first output row, it starts with 4 2 4 6, which is the original row's elements in a certain order. The second output row is 6 6 2 2 2 2 6 6, which is the original row's elements with each replaced by two copies.\n\nMaybe the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements: for 6, it's 4 and 2; for 2, it's 2 and 4; for 4, it's 4 and 6; for 2, it's 6 and 4. This would give:\n\n4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4. But the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut if the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, but the first is the original element's value, and the second is the next element's value. For example, 6 2 4 2 becomes 6 2 2 4 4 2 2 4. But this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements, where the first is the original element's value, and the second is the original element's value from the next position. For example, 6 2 4 2 becomes 6 2 2 4 4 2 2 4. But this doesn't match.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output rows for each example.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first input row is 6 2 4 2. The first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. This could be generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements: 4 2, 2 4, 4 6, 6 4. So the first two elements are 4 2, next two are 2 4, next two are 4 6, next two are 6 4. This would give the first output row as 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4. But the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut if the first output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a transformation where each element is replaced by two elements: 4 2, 4 6, 6 4, 2 4. This would give 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4, which matches the first output row. So this seems to be the pattern.\n\nSo for each element in the input row, it is replaced by two elements: the first is 4 if the element is 6, 2 if it's 2, 4 if it's 4, and 6 if it's 2. Wait, this is not consistent. For example, the first element is 6, replaced by 4 and 2. The second element is 2, replaced by 4 and 6. The third element is 4, replaced by 6 and 4. The fourth element is 2, replaced by 2 and 4. This seems arbitrary, but it matches the first output row.\n\nBut this is just for the first input row. How does this apply to other examples?\n\nIn Example 2, the first input row is 5 5 9 9. The first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7. If each element is replaced by two elements: 7 and 5 for 5, 5 and 7 for 9. So 5 becomes 7 5, 5 becomes 7 5, 9 becomes 5 7, 9 becomes 5 7. This would give 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7, which matches the first output row.\n\nThe second output row for the first input row is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. This could be generated by replacing each element with two copies of itself. So 5 becomes 5 5, 5 becomes 5 5, 9 becomes 9 9, 9 becomes 9 9. But the actual second output row is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. So this doesn't match. But maybe the second output row is generated by taking the original row and replacing each element with two copies of itself, but with some changes.\n\nAlternatively, the second output row is generated by taking the original row and replacing each element with two copies of itself, but with the third element replaced by 5. But this is not clear.\n\nBut if the first output row is generated by replacing each element with two elements based on its value, and the second output row is generated by replacing each element with two copies of itself, then this might be the pattern.\n\nFor example, for the first input row in Example 2, the first output row is generated by replacing each 5 with 7 5 and each 9 with 5 7. The second output row is generated by replacing each element with two copies of itself. But this would give for the first input row 5 5 9 9: 5 5 5 5 9 9 9 9. But the actual second output row is 5 5 5 9 9 5 5 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the second output row is generated by taking the original row and replacing each element with two copies of itself, but with the third element replaced by 5. This is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the second output row is generated by taking the original row and applying a different transformation. For example, for each element, replace it with two elements: if it's 5, replace with 5 5; if it's 9, replace with 9 9. But this would give 5 5 5 5 9 9 9 9, which doesn't match the actual second output row.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to find a general pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at the first example, the first output row for the first input row is generated by replacing each element with two elements, where the first element is 4 if the original is 6, 2 if it's 2, 4 if it's 4, and 6 if it's 2. This seems arbitrary, but it works for the first example.\n\nFor the second example, the first output row is generated by replacing each 5 with 7 5 and each 9 with 5 7.\n\nFor the third example, the first input row is 3 3 5 5. The first output row is 8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8. This could be generated by replacing each 3 with 8 5 and each 5 with 8 8. So for 3 3 5 5, it becomes 8 5 8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8. Wait, but the first output row is 8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row for the third example is generated by replacing each 3 with 8 5, each 3 with 8 8, each 5 with 8 8, and each 5 with 5 8. This would give 8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8, which matches the first output row.\n\nSo this suggests that each element is replaced by two elements, but the replacement depends on the element's value. For example:\n\n- 3 \u2192 8 5\n- 3 \u2192 8 8\n- 5 \u2192 8 8\n- 5 \u2192 5 8\n\nBut this is inconsistent. However, this seems to work for the third example.\n\nBut how to generalize this? It seems like there's a pattern where each element is replaced by two elements based on its value, but the replacement rules vary.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is to replace each element in the input with two elements, where the first element is determined by the original value, and the second element is determined by the original value or its position.\n\nBut this is too vague. Maybe the pattern is that each element is replaced by two elements, and the first element is the original value, and the second element is the next element in the input row. But this would be for the first output row.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and creating a new row where each element is the original element followed by the next element. For example, for 6 2 4 2, the first output row would be 6 2 2 4 4 2 2 4. But the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the patterns I've observed.\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that each input row is transformed into two output rows. The first output row for each input row is generated by replacing each element with two elements, where the first is a certain value and the second is another. The second output row is generated by replacing each element with two copies of itself.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first input row is 6 2 4 2. The first output row is generated by replacing each element with two elements: 4 2, 2 4, 4 6, 6 4. This gives the first output row as 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4, but the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut if I look at the first output row of Example 1, it's 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. This could be generated by replacing each element with two elements, where the first is 4 if the original is 6, 2 if it's 2, 4 if it's 4, and 6 if it's 2. This seems arbitrary, but it works for the first example.\n\nFor Example 2, the first input row is 5 5 9 9. The first output row is 7 5 7 5 5 7 5 7, which is generated by replacing each 5 with 7 5 and each 9 with 5 7.\n\nFor Example 3, the first input row is 3 3 5 5. The first output row is 8 5 8 8 8 8 5 8. This could be generated by replacing each 3 with 8 5 and each 5 with 8 8.\n\nThis suggests that the first output row is generated by replacing each element with two elements based on its value, and the second output row is generated by replacing each element with two copies of itself.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nMaybe the first output row is generated by replacing each element with two elements, where the first is a certain value and the second is the original element. For example, for 5, it's 7 and 5; for 9, it's 5 and 7; for 6, it's 4 and 2; for 2, it's 2 and 4; for 4, it's 4 and 6; for 3, it's 8 and 5; for 5, it's 8 and 8.\n\nBut this is too specific to the examples and doesn't generalize.\n\nAlternatively, the first output row is generated by taking the original row and creating a new row where each element is the original element's value and the next element's value. For example, for 6 2 4 2, the first output row would be 6 2 2 4 4 2 2 4. But this doesn't match the actual first output row.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that takes the input grid and generates the output grid by expanding each input row into two output rows, where the first output row is generated by some transformation and the second is generated by another.\n\nBut since I'm not sure of the exact pattern, I'll have to make a guess.\n\nBased on the examples, it seems that each input row is transformed into two output rows. The first output row for each input row is generated by replacing each element with two elements, where the first is a certain value and the second is the original element. The second output row is generated by replacing each element with two copies of itself.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the first input row is 6 2 4 2. The first output row is generated by replacing each element with two elements: 4 2, 2 4, 4 6, 6 4. The second output row is generated by replacing each element with two copies of itself: 6 6, 2 2, 4 4, 2 2.\n\nThis would give the first output row as 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4 and the second as 6 6 2 2 4 4 2 2. But the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4, which doesn't match.\n\nBut this is the best I can do. So I'll try to implement this pattern, even if it doesn't match all examples.\n\nThe function would take the input grid, and for each row in the input, generate two rows in the output. For the first output row, replace each element with two elements, where the first is a certain value and the second is the original element. For the second output row, replace each element with two copies of itself.\n\nBut how to determine the first part of the replacement.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nExample 1: 6 \u2192 4 2, 2 \u2192 2 4, 4 \u2192 4 6, 2 \u2192 6 4.\n\nExample 2: 5 \u2192 7 5, 9 \u2192 5 7.\n\nExample 3: 3 \u2192 8 5, 5 \u2192 8 8.\n\nThis suggests that the first part of the replacement is determined by the element's value. But how?\n\nMaybe the first part of the replacement is determined by the element's value and its position in the input row.\n\nAlternatively, it's a fixed pattern for each value. For example:\n\n- 6 \u2192 4 2\n- 2 \u2192 2 4\n- 4 \u2192 4 6\n- 5 \u2192 7 5\n- 9 \u2192 5 7\n- 3 \u2192 8 5\n- 5 \u2192 8 8\n\nBut this is arbitrary and specific to the examples.\n\nGiven that, the function could be written as follows:\n\nFor each input row, generate two output rows.\n\nFor the first output row, replace each element with two elements based on a lookup table.\n\nFor the second output row, replace each element with two copies of itself.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThe lookup table could be:\n\n{\n    6: [4, 2],\n    2: [2, 4],\n    4: [4, 6],\n    5: [7, 5],\n    9: [5, 7],\n    3: [8, 5],\n    8: [8, 5],  # assuming 8 is replaced with 8 5?\n    7: [8, 5],  # assuming 7 is replaced with 8 5?\n}\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nHowever, this approach might not work for all cases, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the function would:\n\n- For each input row, generate two output rows.\n\n- For the first output row, replace each element with the pair from the lookup table.\n\n- For the second output row, replace each element with two copies of itself.\n\nBut how to handle elements not in the lookup table. For example, if the input has a 1, what to do?\n\nBut since the training examples don't include such cases, perhaps this is the best approach.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a lookup table for the first output row\n    lookup = {\n        6: [4, 2],\n        2: [2, 4],\n        4: [4, 6],\n        5: [7, 5],\n        9: [5, 7],\n        3: [8, 5],\n        8: [8, 5],\n        7: [8, 5]\n    }\n    \n    output = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Generate first output row\n        first_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            first_row.extend(lookup[val])\n        # Generate second output row\n        second_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            second_row.extend([val, val])\n        # Add both rows to the output\n        output.append(first_row)\n        output.append(second_row)\n    # Now, the output is 2 * len(grid) rows, each of length 2 * len(row)\n    # But the required output is 6x8, which is 3x4 input. So for input of 3 rows, output has 6 rows.\n    # But this code would generate 2 * len(grid) rows, each of length 2 * len(row).\n    # However, the required output is 6x8, which is 3 rows * 2 = 6 rows, and each row is 4 * 2 = 8 columns.\n    # So this code would work for the training examples.\n    return output\n\nBut this code would generate the first output rows based on the lookup table, and the second rows as duplicates.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1:\n\nInput row: 6 2 4 2\n\nFirst_row: [4, 2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 6, 4] \u2192 4 2 2 4 4 6 6 4\n\nSecond_row: 6 6 2 2 4 4 2 2\n\nBut the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut this is the best I can do given the time constraints. Maybe the lookup table is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first output row is generated by replacing each element with the pair [val, next_val], but this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: for the first output row, each element is replaced by two elements, where the first is the original element and the second is the next element. For example, for 6 2 4 2, the first output row would be 6 2 2 4 4 2 2 4. But this doesn't match the actual first output row.\n\nBut the actual first output row is 4 2 4 6 6 4 2 4. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I have to proceed with the code that generates the first output row based on the lookup table and the second output row as duplicates. Even if it doesn't match all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the final code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a lookup table for the first output row\n    lookup = {\n        6: [4, 2],\n        2: [2, 4],\n        4: [4, 6],\n        5: [7, 5],\n        9: [5, 7],\n        3: [8, 5],\n        8: [8, 5],\n        7: [8, 5]\n    }\n    \n    output = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Generate first output row\n        first_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            first_row.extend(lookup[val])\n        # Generate second output row\n        second_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            second_row.extend([val, val])\n        # Add both rows to the output\n        output.append(first_row)\n        output.append(second_row)\n    return output\n\nBut this code may not work for all examples. For example, in Example 1, the first output row is not matching, but it's the best I can do based on the examples provided.\n"
