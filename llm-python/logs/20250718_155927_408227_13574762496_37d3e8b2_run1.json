The output grid always has the same size (19x17)\n2. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with new values based on their position and context\n3. There are patterns where certain values (like 8) are replaced with other values (like 1, 2, 3, 7)\n4. The transformation appears to be based on some kind of regional pattern recognition or shape detection\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with new values based on their position and context.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 19x17 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(17)] for

The output grid has a fixed size of 19x17\n2. The transformation seems to involve some kind of pattern recognition and replacement\n3. There are patterns where 0s are replaced with numbers (like 1, 2, 3, 7)\n4. The transformation seems to involve identifying regions or shapes and replacing them with specific numbers\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain patterns with specific numbers. This is a hypothesis based on the patterns I see in the training examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for
