          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to transform the input grid into the output grid based on the examples provided. Let me look at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input and output grids are both 7x11. The input seems to have a pattern of 2s and 0s. The output seems to have some changes in certain rows. For instance, in the first example, the output's second row is different from the input's second row. Let me compare them:\n\nInput row 2: 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2\nOutput row 2: 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\n\nHmm, so in the output, the first three elements are 2s instead of 2,0,2. Wait, maybe there's a pattern of flipping or rotating certain parts?\n\nLooking at Example 2 and 3, maybe there's a pattern where certain rows are being modified in a specific way. Let me check the outputs for these examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the output's second row is different from the input's second row. The input's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2, and the output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, maybe I need to look at the entire grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping certain columns or rows. Let me think about the positions where the 0s and 2s are placed.\n\nAnother approach: look for symmetry. For example, maybe the output is a reflection or rotation of the input. But since the output grids are the same size, maybe it's a reflection along a vertical or horizontal axis, or some other transformation.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nThe input's first row is all 2s except for 0s in positions 3 and 7 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Well, the input is given as a list of numbers, so probably 0-based in the code, but the actual positions would be based on the grid's structure).\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that certain rows are being flipped in a specific way. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is different from the input's second row. Let me check the input and output for each example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain columns are being toggled. For instance, in the input, maybe columns 3 and 7 (if 0-based) are being flipped. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The input's second row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So, in the input's second row, the 0s are at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. The output's second row has 0s at positions 3, 5, 7, 9. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the 0s are being moved or replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain rows are being reversed. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is different from the input's second row. Let me check the input and output for other rows.\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2\nOutput row 0: same as input.\n\nRow 1: input is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2\nOutput row 1: 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\n\nSo the output row 1 has 2s in positions 0, 1, 2, then 0 at position 3, then 2 at 4, 0 at 5, 2 at 6, 0 at 7, 2 at 8, 0 at 9, 2 at 10.\n\nHmm. So the input row 1 has 0s at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. The output row 1 has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. So the 0s in positions 1 and 0, 2 are 2s. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 0s are being shifted or replaced in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, certain columns are flipped. But this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0 at position 5 (input) is now 2, and the 0 at position 7 is still 0. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain rows are being mirrored. For example, in the input, maybe the first row is mirrored in some way. But the first row of input and output are the same in Example 1.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the fifth row (input row 4) is the same as output row 4. But the sixth row (input row 5) is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2, and the output row 5 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the output row 5 is different from the input row 5. So maybe there's a pattern where certain rows are being flipped in a way that depends on their position.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain columns are flipped. For example, in Example 1, the second row (input row 1) has 0s in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. The output row 1 has 0s in positions 3,5,7,9. So the 0s at positions 1 and 0, 2 are 2s. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in even rows, the 0s are being moved to certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the positions of 0s. For instance, in the input, the 0s are arranged in a certain way, and in the output, they are arranged in a different way. Maybe the output is a result of flipping certain parts of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for every row, the 0s are being replaced in a certain way. For example, in the input, the 0s are in positions that are spaced every other column. But in the output, perhaps the 0s are in different positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a reflection of the input along the vertical axis. But looking at Example 1's input and output, the first row is the same. The second row input is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The output row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three elements are 2,2,2 in the output, but in the input, they are 2,0,2. So that's not a vertical reflection.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that certain columns are being toggled. For example, in the input, columns 3 and 7 (assuming 0-based) have 0s, and in the output, they are 0s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, except for certain rows where the 0s are replaced with 2s or vice versa. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of the examples, maybe the transformation is that for rows with even indices (0-based), the pattern remains the same, but for odd rows, the pattern is modified. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, which is a 10x11 grid. Wait, the test input is given as 10 rows. But the problem says that the output must be 7x11. Wait, no, the problem says that the output must be 7x11. Wait, the test input is 10 rows, but the output must be 7x11. Wait, but the examples have 7 rows. So maybe the test input is for a different problem. But the user says that the test input is for context, and the code must produce a 7x11 output grid regardless.\n\nBut back to the examples. Let me look for a pattern in the examples. Let's take Example 1's input and output. The output seems to have some rows that are the same as the input, and others that are modified. For instance, in Example 1, the output's second row is different from the input's second row. Similarly, the sixth row in the input is different from the output's sixth row.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the sixth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2, which is the same as the input's fifth row. Wait, maybe the rows are being shifted or mirrored in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even-numbered rows (like row 0, 2, 4, 6), the pattern remains the same, and for odd-numbered rows (row 1, 3, 5, 7), the pattern is modified. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row (row 1) is modified. The sixth row (row 5) is modified.\n\nBut how to determine the exact transformation.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the 0s in the input and output.\n\nIn Example 1, input row 1 (second row) has 0s at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. The output row 1 has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. So the 0s at positions 1 and 0, 2 are 2s. Wait, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the 0s are being moved to the middle of the row. For example, in the input, the 0s are in positions that are spaced every other column, but in the output, they are in positions that are spaced every other column starting from position 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 0s are being shifted to the right by two positions. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1's row 1: the 0s are at positions 3,5,7,9. So that's every other column starting from position 3. The input's row 1 has 0s at positions 1,3,5,7,9. So the output's row 1 has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. So the 0s in positions 1 and 0,2 are 2s. So maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 0s are being removed from the left side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 0s are being replaced in a way that depends on the row's position. For example, if the row is even, then the pattern is the same, but if it's odd, then certain columns are flipped.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a result of flipping certain columns. For example, columns 3 and 7 are being toggled.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nOutput row 1: [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nSo, the first three elements are 2,2,2. The fourth is 0, then 2, then 0, then 2, then 0, then 2. So the pattern seems to be that the first three elements are 2s, and then every other element is 0, starting from position 3.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input?\n\nIn the input, the first three elements are 2, 0, 2. So maybe the transformation is that in certain rows, the first three elements are changed to 2s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for rows with even indices (0-based), the pattern is the same, and for rows with odd indices, the first three elements are 2s, then 0, 2, 0, etc.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's check other rows in Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's row 5 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. Which is the same as the input's row 5. Wait, no. The input row 5 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The output row 5 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three elements are 2,0,2 instead of 2,2,2. So this suggests that the transformation is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are being moved to specific positions based on their row number. For example, in row 1 (second row), the 0s are moved to positions 3,5,7,9. In row 5 (sixth row), the 0s are moved to positions 1,3,5,7,9. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even-numbered rows, the pattern is the same as the input, and for odd-numbered rows, the pattern is modified in a way that depends on the column. For example, in row 1, the 0s are in certain positions, and in row 3, the 0s are in other positions.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's think about the output for Example 2. The input's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0 at position 5 (input) is now 2, and the 0 at position 7 is still 0. So this suggests that in this row, the 0s are being moved to certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 0s are being flipped in certain columns. For example, columns 5 and 7 are being toggled.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of 0s in the input and output for all examples. For example, in Example 1's input, the 0s are in columns that are even or odd. Maybe the transformation is that the 0s are being shifted in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, except for certain rows where the 0s are being flipped in certain columns. For example, in row 1 of Example 1, the 0s are in columns 1,3,5,7,9. In the output, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. So the 0 at column 1 is now 2. So maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are being removed from the left side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with some rows reversed. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row (input row 5) is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2, and the output row 5 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three elements are 2,0,2 instead of 2,2,2. So this suggests that the row is being modified in a way that depends on the row's position.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 0s are being replaced in a way that depends on the row's index. For example, for even rows, the pattern is the same, and for odd rows, the 0s are being moved to the right.\n\nBut without seeing more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of the examples, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain rows flipped in a way that depends on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is modified, and the sixth row is modified. But in Example 2, the output's second row is modified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, except for rows that are even or odd. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row (row 1) is modified, and the sixth row (row 5) is modified. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the second row has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. The input's second row has 0s at positions 1,3,5,7,9. So the 0s are being shifted to the right by two positions. But why?\n\nIf that's the case, then for row 1, the 0s are shifted to the right by two positions. For example, the 0 at position 1 becomes 2, and the 0 at position 3 becomes 0. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are being replaced in a way that depends on the column's position. For example, for columns that are even or odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain columns toggled. For example, columns 3 and 7 are toggled.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2\n\nOutput row 1: 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\n\nSo the first three elements are 2,2,2. The fourth is 0, then 2, 0, 2, 0, 2. So the pattern is that the first three elements are 2s, then every other element is 0, starting from position 3.\n\nIn the input, the first three elements are 2,0,2. So maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the first three elements are set to 2s.\n\nBut why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 0s are being replaced in a way that depends on the row's position. For example, for even rows, the pattern is the same, but for odd rows, the pattern is modified.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs of all examples and see if there's a pattern in the rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's second row is modified. In Example 2, the output's second row is modified. In Example 3, the output's second row is modified. So maybe the transformation is that for rows with even indices (0-based), the pattern is the same as input, and for odd rows, the pattern is modified.\n\nBut in Example 1, the sixth row (row 5, which is odd) is modified. In Example 2, the sixth row (row 5) is modified. In Example 3, the sixth row is modified. So perhaps the transformation is that for rows with even indices, the pattern remains the same, and for odd indices, the pattern is modified in a certain way.\n\nBut how to determine the modification.\n\nLooking at the modified rows in Example 1:\n\nRow 1 (second row) in input is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The output is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2.\n\nSo the first three elements are 2, 2, 2. The fourth is 0, then 2, 0, 2, 0, 2.\n\nSo the pattern is that the first three elements are 2s, then every other element is 0, starting from position 3.\n\nIn the input, the first three elements are 2,0,2. So the transformation is that for row 1, the first three elements are changed to 2s.\n\nSimilarly, for row 5 (sixth row) in Example 1, the input is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The output is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three elements are 2,0,2. So the pattern here is that the first three elements are 2,0,2, but the fifth element is 2.\n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is not consistent for all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the pattern is flipped in a certain way. For example, in row 1, the first three elements are changed to 2s, and in row 5, the first three elements are 2,0,2.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output for Example 1 is the same as the input for rows 0, 2, 3, 4, 6. But for rows 1 and 5, it's modified. So perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the pattern remains the same, and for odd rows, the pattern is modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the pattern is the same as the input, but with the 0s in certain positions replaced with 2s and vice versa. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the second row has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. The input row 1 has 0s at positions 1,3,5,7,9. So the 0s are shifted to the right by two positions. For example, the 0 at position 1 is now 2, and the 0 at position 3 is still 0. So perhaps the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are shifted to the right by two positions.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 0s are being replaced in a way that depends on the row's index. For example, for row i, the 0s are moved to certain columns based on i.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain rows reversed. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is not reversed, but the sixth row is modified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with the rows 1 and 5 swapped. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the sixth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The input's sixth row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three elements are 2,0,2 in the output, and 2,2,2 in the input. So this suggests that the transformation is that for certain rows, the first three elements are changed to 2,0,2.\n\nBut why?\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. But given that the examples have a certain structure, perhaps the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, except for certain rows where the pattern is modified. For example, in the first example, the second row and sixth row are modified.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the second row is modified. Let's compare it to the input's second row. The input's second row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three elements are 2,2,2 instead of 2,0,2. The fourth element is 0, fifth is 2, sixth is 0, seventh is 2, eighth is 0, ninth is 2, tenth is 0, eleventh is 2.\n\nSo the pattern is that the first three elements are 2, and then the rest of the row follows a pattern of 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2.\n\nSimilarly, in the output's sixth row, the first three elements are 2,0,2, and then the pattern is 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is that for certain rows, the first three elements are set to 2,2,2 or 2,0,2, and the rest of the row follows a pattern.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are affected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the first three elements are set to 2,2,2 if the row is even, and 2,0,2 if the row is odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output row 1 (second row), which is odd, the first three elements are 2,2,2. But this contradicts the idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the first three elements are set to 2,2,2 for even rows and 2,0,2 for odd rows. But in Example 1's output row 5 (sixth row, which is odd), the first three elements are 2,0,2. So this fits. But for the second row (row 1, odd), the first three elements are 2,2,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the first three elements are set to 2,2,2 if the row is even, and 2,0,2 if the row is odd. But this doesn't fit the second row in Example 1.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Perhaps I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the second row has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. The input's second row has 0s at positions 1,3,5,7,9. So the 0 at position 1 is now 2. So perhaps the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are being removed from the left side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the pattern is the same as input, and for odd rows, the pattern is modified by replacing the first 0 with a 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I have, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 1, the second row is the same as the input's fourth row. Let me check:\n\nInput's fourth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. Output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. No, that's not the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the pattern is mirrored. For example, the second row in the output is a mirror of the input's fourth row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the second row is modified in a way that the 0s are in even columns. For example, in the input's second row, the 0s are at positions 1,3,5,7,9 (odd positions). In the output, the 0s are at positions 3,5,7,9 (odd positions). So the 0 at position 1 is now 2.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are being moved to the right by two positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the 0s are being replaced in a way that depends on the row's index. For example, for row i, if i is even, then the 0s are in certain positions, and if i is odd, then they are in other positions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of a possible transformation that could work for the examples.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's second row: it has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. The input's second row has 0s at positions 1,3,5,7,9. So the 0 at position 1 is now 2. So perhaps the transformation is that for row 1 (second row), the 0 at position 1 is replaced with 2.\n\nSimilarly, in the sixth row of Example 1, the input's row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The output's row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0 at position 1 is now 2, and the 0 at position 5 is now 2.\n\nWait, no. The input's sixth row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The output's sixth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three elements are 2,0,2. The 0 at position 1 is now 0, but the 0 at position 5 is now 2.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 0s are being replaced in a way that depends on the column's position. For example, if the column is even, it's 2, and if it's odd, it's 0. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain columns flipped. For example, columns 3 and 7 are flipped.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAnother idea: the output for Example 1's second row is the same as the input's fourth row. Let me check:\n\nInput's fourth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. Output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. Not the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the pattern is reversed. For example, the second row is reversed, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern in the rows.\n\nFor example, the output's second row has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. The input's second row has 0s at positions 1,3,5,7,9. So the 0 at position 1 is now 2. So maybe the transformation is that for row 1, the 0 at position 1 is replaced with 2.\n\nSimilarly, in the sixth row of Example 1, the input has 0 at position 1, and the output has 0 at position 1. But the input has 0 at position 5, and the output has 2 at position 5. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for rows where the row number is odd, the 0s are being shifted to the right by two positions.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the same as the input, but for certain rows, the 0s are being replaced in a way that depends on the row's index. For example, for row i, if i is even, the pattern is the same, and if i is odd, the pattern is modified by replacing certain 0s with 2s.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll try to write a function that for each row, if the row is even, it remains the same, and if it's odd, it modifies the first three elements to 2,2,2, and then the rest of the row follows a pattern of 0,2,0,2,0,2.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's see if this fits the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's second row (row 1, odd), the first three elements are 2,2,2. Then the rest is 0,2,0,2,0,2. So the row becomes 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2, which matches the output.\n\nFor the sixth row (row 5, odd), the first three elements are 2,0,2. But according to this hypothesis, they should be 2,2,2. But the output's sixth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for even rows, the pattern is the same, and for odd rows, the pattern is modified by replacing the first 0 with 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each row, if the row index is even, keep it as is. For odd rows, modify the first three elements to 2,2,2, and then the rest of the row follows the pattern of 0,2,0,2,0,2.\n\nThis would fit the second row of Example 1, but not the sixth row. But maybe this is the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = []\n    for i in range(7):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            new_grid.append(grid[i])\n        else:\n            # modify the row\n            row = grid[i]\n            # set first three elements to 2,2,2\n            new_row = [2, 2, 2] + row[3:]\n            # then modify the rest of the row to have 0,2,0,2,0,2\n            # but this is not clear\n            # perhaps replace the elements starting from position 3\n            # for example, in the new_row, starting from position 3, alternate 0 and 2\n            # but this is not clear\n            # this part is not clear\n            # so perhaps this approach is not correct\n            # alternative idea: for the odd rows, replace the first three elements with 2,2,2, and then for the rest, alternate 0 and 2\n            # but this is just a guess\n            # for example, in the new_row, after the first three elements, the rest are 0,2,0,2,0,2\n            # but how to calculate this\n            # let's see for the second row in Example 1: after the first three elements, the rest is 0,2,0,2,0,2\n            # the original row after the first three elements is 0,2,2,0,2,0,2\n            # but after modification, it becomes 0,2,0,2,0,2\n            # so the third element is 2, and the fourth is 0, fifth is 2, etc.\n            # this is not clear.\n\n            # perhaps this approach is not working, and I need to think of another way.\n\n            # alternative idea: for odd rows, the first three elements are 2,2,2, and then every other element is 0, starting from position 3\n            # for example, in the second row of Example 1, the new_row is [2,2,2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n            # which matches the output\n            # so for the odd rows, the first three elements are 2,2,2, and then every other element is 0, starting from position 3\n            # but how to implement this\n\n            # for the row, after the first three elements, the rest are 0,2,0,2,0,2\n            # so for the rest of the elements, starting from position 3, we alternate 0 and 2\n            # but how to calculate that\n\n            # for example, in the original row, after the first three elements, the rest is row[3:]\n            # we need to replace it with 0,2,0,2,0,2\n            # but the original row's length is 11, so after the first three elements, there are 8 elements.\n\n            # so for the new_row, after the first three elements, we have 0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2\n\n            # but how to determine that.\n\n            # for example, for the second row in Example 1, the original row after first three elements is [0,2,2,0,2,0,2]. But the new row is [0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2].\n\n            # this suggests that the elements at even positions are 0 and odd positions are 2.\n\n            # but this is not clear.\n\n            # given the time, I'll proceed with this approach for the odd rows, setting the first three elements to 2,2,2, and then for the rest, alternate 0 and 2 starting from position 3.\n\n            # so for the new_row, after the first three elements, we create a new list of 0 and 2 alternating.\n\n            # let's implement this.\n\n            # create a new row with first three elements as 2,2,2\n            new_row = [2, 2, 2]\n            # for the rest of the elements, starting from position 3, alternate 0 and 2\n            # the original row has 11 elements, so after the first three, there are 8 elements.\n            # for position 3 to 10 (0-based), we need to alternate 0 and 2.\n            # for example, position 3 is 0, position 4 is 2, position 5 is 0, etc.\n            # but how to calculate this.\n\n            # for the new_row, after the first three elements, the rest is:\n            # for j in range(3, 11):\n            #   if (j - 3) % 2 == 0:\n            #       new_row.append(0)\n            #   else:\n            #       new_row.append(2)\n            # but this is a guess.\n\n            # let's try this for the second row of Example 1:\n            # original row is [2,0,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,2]\n            # new_row after first three elements is [2,2,2]\n            # for j from 3 to 10 (indices 3-10, which is 8 elements):\n            # j=3: (3-3) = 0 \u2192 even \u2192 0\n            # j=4: 1 \u2192 odd \u2192 2\n            # j=5: 2 \u2192 even \u2192 0\n            # j=6: 3 \u2192 odd \u2192 2\n            # j=7: 4 \u2192 even \u2192 0\n            # j=8: 5 \u2192 odd \u2192 2\n            # j=9: 6 \u2192 even \u2192 0\n            # j=10: 7 \u2192 odd \u2192 2\n            # so the new_row is [2,2,2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2], which matches the output.\n\n            # this seems to work for the second row of Example 1.\n\n            # for the sixth row of Example 1, which is row 5 (odd), the original row is [2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2]. The new_row after first three elements is [2,2,2], and then the rest is 0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2. So the new_row is [2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2], which is the same as the input's row 5. But the output for row 5 is [2,0,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,2]. So this doesn't match.\n\n            # this suggests that this approach is not correct for all cases.\n\n            # but perhaps the transformation is that for odd rows, the first three elements are 2,2,2, and the rest are 0,2,0,2,0,2.\n\n            # but in Example 1's sixth row, the output is different. So this approach may not work.\n\n            # given the time, I'll proceed with this approach, as it fits some of the examples, and hope that it's the correct pattern.\n\n            # so the code would be:\n\n            new_row = [2, 2, 2]\n            for j in range(3, 11):\n                if (j - 3) % 2 == 0:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(2)\n            new_grid.append(new_row)\n\n    return new_grid\n\nBut wait, this would only work for the second row of Example 1, but not for other rows. However, this is the best I can do given the time.\n\nBut the problem says that the output must be 7x11. So the code must return a 7x11 grid.\n\nSo, the function would iterate through each row. For even rows (0,2,4,6), it appends the original row. For odd rows (1,3,5), it creates a new row with first three elements as 2,2,2, and then alternates 0 and 2 starting from position 3.\n\nBut this may not work for all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nNow, let's check Example 2's output.\n\nExample 2's input is a 7x11 grid. The output for Example 2's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. According to the code, for row 1 (odd), the new_row would be [2,2,2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2], which is not the same as the output. But the output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nBut this is the best I can do. I'll proceed with this approach and write the code.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, the task is to transform the input grid into the output grid based on the examples provided. Let me look at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input and output grids are both 7x11. The input seems to have a pattern of 2s and 0s. The output seems to have some changes in certain rows. For instance, in the first example, the output's second row is different from the input's second row. Let me compare them:\n\nInput row 2: 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2\nOutput row 2: 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\n\nHmm, so in the output, the first three elements are 2s instead of 2,0,2. Wait, maybe there's a pattern of flipping or rotating certain parts?\n\nLooking at Example 2 and 3, maybe there's a pattern where certain rows are being modified in a specific way. Let me check the outputs for these examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the output's second row is different from the input's second row. The input's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2, and the output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. Wait, that's not matching. Wait, maybe I need to look at the entire grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping certain columns or rows. Let me think about the positions where the 0s and 2s are placed.\n\nAnother approach: look for symmetry. For example, maybe the output is a reflection or rotation of the input. But since the output grids are the same size, maybe it's a reflection along a vertical or horizontal axis, or some other transformation.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nThe input's first row is all 2s except for 0s in positions 3 and 7 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Well, the input is given as a list of numbers, so probably 0-based in the code, but the actual positions would be based on the grid's structure).\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is that certain rows are being flipped in a specific way. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is different from the input's second row. Let me check the input and output for each example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain columns are being toggled. For instance, in the input, maybe columns 3 and 7 (if 0-based) are being flipped. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The input's second row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So, in the input's second row, the 0s are at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. The output's second row has 0s at positions 3, 5, 7, 9. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in certain positions, the 0s are being moved or replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain rows are being reversed. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is different from the input's second row. Let me check the input and output for other rows.\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2\nOutput row 0: same as input.\n\nRow 1: input is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2\nOutput row 1: 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\n\nSo the output row 1 has 2s in positions 0, 1, 2, then 0 at position 3, then 2 at 4, 0 at 5, 2 at 6, 0 at 7, 2 at 8, 0 at 9, 2 at 10.\n\nHmm. So the input row 1 has 0s at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. The output row 1 has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. So the 0s in positions 1 and 0, 2 are 2s. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 0s are being shifted or replaced in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, certain columns are flipped. But this is getting a bit confusing.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0 at position 5 (input) is now 2, and the 0 at position 7 is still 0. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain rows are being mirrored. For example, in the input, maybe the first row is mirrored in some way. But the first row of input and output are the same in Example 1.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the fifth row (input row 4) is the same as output row 4. But the sixth row (input row 5) is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2, and the output row 5 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the output row 5 is different from the input row 5. So maybe there's a pattern where certain rows are being flipped in a way that depends on their position.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain columns are flipped. For example, in Example 1, the second row (input row 1) has 0s in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. The output row 1 has 0s in positions 3,5,7,9. So the 0s at positions 1 and 0, 2 are 2s. Wait, maybe the pattern is that in even rows, the 0s are being moved to certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the positions of 0s. For instance, in the input, the 0s are arranged in a certain way, and in the output, they are arranged in a different way. Maybe the output is a result of flipping certain parts of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for every row, the 0s are being replaced in a certain way. For example, in the input, the 0s are in positions that are spaced every other column. But in the output, perhaps the 0s are in different positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a reflection of the input along the vertical axis. But looking at Example 1's input and output, the first row is the same. The second row input is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The output row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three elements are 2,2,2 in the output, but in the input, they are 2,0,2. So that's not a vertical reflection.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that certain columns are being toggled. For example, in the input, columns 3 and 7 (assuming 0-based) have 0s, and in the output, they are 0s. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, except for certain rows where the 0s are replaced with 2s or vice versa. But how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of the examples, maybe the transformation is that for rows with even indices (0-based), the pattern remains the same, but for odd rows, the pattern is modified. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the test input, which is a 10x11 grid. Wait, the test input is given as 10 rows. But the problem says that the output must be 7x11. Wait, no, the problem says that the output must be 7x11. Wait, the test input is 10 rows, but the output must be 7x11. Wait, but the examples have 7 rows. So maybe the test input is for a different problem. But the user says that the test input is for context, and the code must produce a 7x11 output grid regardless.\n\nBut back to the examples. Let me look for a pattern in the examples. Let's take Example 1's input and output. The output seems to have some rows that are the same as the input, and others that are modified. For instance, in Example 1, the output's second row is different from the input's second row. Similarly, the sixth row in the input is different from the output's sixth row.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the sixth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2, which is the same as the input's fifth row. Wait, maybe the rows are being shifted or mirrored in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even-numbered rows (like row 0, 2, 4, 6), the pattern remains the same, and for odd-numbered rows (row 1, 3, 5, 7), the pattern is modified. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row (row 1) is modified. The sixth row (row 5) is modified.\n\nBut how to determine the exact transformation.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the 0s in the input and output.\n\nIn Example 1, input row 1 (second row) has 0s at positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. The output row 1 has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. So the 0s at positions 1 and 0, 2 are 2s. Wait, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the 0s are being moved to the middle of the row. For example, in the input, the 0s are in positions that are spaced every other column, but in the output, they are in positions that are spaced every other column starting from position 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 0s are being shifted to the right by two positions. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1's row 1: the 0s are at positions 3,5,7,9. So that's every other column starting from position 3. The input's row 1 has 0s at positions 1,3,5,7,9. So the output's row 1 has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. So the 0s in positions 1 and 0,2 are 2s. So maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 0s are being removed from the left side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 0s are being replaced in a way that depends on the row's position. For example, if the row is even, then the pattern is the same, but if it's odd, then certain columns are flipped.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a result of flipping certain columns. For example, columns 3 and 7 are being toggled.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nOutput row 1: [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nSo, the first three elements are 2,2,2. The fourth is 0, then 2, then 0, then 2, then 0, then 2. So the pattern seems to be that the first three elements are 2s, and then every other element is 0, starting from position 3.\n\nBut how does this relate to the input?\n\nIn the input, the first three elements are 2, 0, 2. So maybe the transformation is that in certain rows, the first three elements are changed to 2s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for rows with even indices (0-based), the pattern is the same, and for rows with odd indices, the first three elements are 2s, then 0, 2, 0, etc.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's check other rows in Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's row 5 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. Which is the same as the input's row 5. Wait, no. The input row 5 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The output row 5 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three elements are 2,0,2 instead of 2,2,2. So this suggests that the transformation is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are being moved to specific positions based on their row number. For example, in row 1 (second row), the 0s are moved to positions 3,5,7,9. In row 5 (sixth row), the 0s are moved to positions 1,3,5,7,9. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even-numbered rows, the pattern is the same as the input, and for odd-numbered rows, the pattern is modified in a way that depends on the column. For example, in row 1, the 0s are in certain positions, and in row 3, the 0s are in other positions.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's think about the output for Example 2. The input's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0 at position 5 (input) is now 2, and the 0 at position 7 is still 0. So this suggests that in this row, the 0s are being moved to certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 0s are being flipped in certain columns. For example, columns 5 and 7 are being toggled.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of 0s in the input and output for all examples. For example, in Example 1's input, the 0s are in columns that are even or odd. Maybe the transformation is that the 0s are being shifted in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, except for certain rows where the 0s are being flipped in certain columns. For example, in row 1 of Example 1, the 0s are in columns 1,3,5,7,9. In the output, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. So the 0 at column 1 is now 2. So maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are being removed from the left side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with some rows reversed. For example, in Example 1, the sixth row (input row 5) is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2, and the output row 5 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three elements are 2,0,2 instead of 2,2,2. So this suggests that the row is being modified in a way that depends on the row's position.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 0s are being replaced in a way that depends on the row's index. For example, for even rows, the pattern is the same, and for odd rows, the 0s are being moved to the right.\n\nBut without seeing more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of the examples, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain rows flipped in a way that depends on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is modified, and the sixth row is modified. But in Example 2, the output's second row is modified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, except for rows that are even or odd. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row (row 1) is modified, and the sixth row (row 5) is modified. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the second row has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. The input's second row has 0s at positions 1,3,5,7,9. So the 0s are being shifted to the right by two positions. But why?\n\nIf that's the case, then for row 1, the 0s are shifted to the right by two positions. For example, the 0 at position 1 becomes 2, and the 0 at position 3 becomes 0. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are being replaced in a way that depends on the column's position. For example, for columns that are even or odd.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain columns toggled. For example, columns 3 and 7 are toggled.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2\n\nOutput row 1: 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\n\nSo the first three elements are 2,2,2. The fourth is 0, then 2, 0, 2, 0, 2. So the pattern is that the first three elements are 2s, then every other element is 0, starting from position 3.\n\nIn the input, the first three elements are 2,0,2. So maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the first three elements are set to 2s.\n\nBut why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 0s are being replaced in a way that depends on the row's position. For example, for even rows, the pattern is the same, but for odd rows, the pattern is modified.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs of all examples and see if there's a pattern in the rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's second row is modified. In Example 2, the output's second row is modified. In Example 3, the output's second row is modified. So maybe the transformation is that for rows with even indices (0-based), the pattern is the same as input, and for odd rows, the pattern is modified.\n\nBut in Example 1, the sixth row (row 5, which is odd) is modified. In Example 2, the sixth row (row 5) is modified. In Example 3, the sixth row is modified. So perhaps the transformation is that for rows with even indices, the pattern remains the same, and for odd indices, the pattern is modified in a certain way.\n\nBut how to determine the modification.\n\nLooking at the modified rows in Example 1:\n\nRow 1 (second row) in input is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The output is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2.\n\nSo the first three elements are 2, 2, 2. The fourth is 0, then 2, 0, 2, 0, 2.\n\nSo the pattern is that the first three elements are 2s, then every other element is 0, starting from position 3.\n\nIn the input, the first three elements are 2,0,2. So the transformation is that for row 1, the first three elements are changed to 2s.\n\nSimilarly, for row 5 (sixth row) in Example 1, the input is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The output is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three elements are 2,0,2. So the pattern here is that the first three elements are 2,0,2, but the fifth element is 2.\n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is not consistent for all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the pattern is flipped in a certain way. For example, in row 1, the first three elements are changed to 2s, and in row 5, the first three elements are 2,0,2.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output for Example 1 is the same as the input for rows 0, 2, 3, 4, 6. But for rows 1 and 5, it's modified. So perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the pattern remains the same, and for odd rows, the pattern is modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the pattern is the same as the input, but with the 0s in certain positions replaced with 2s and vice versa. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the second row has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. The input row 1 has 0s at positions 1,3,5,7,9. So the 0s are shifted to the right by two positions. For example, the 0 at position 1 is now 2, and the 0 at position 3 is still 0. So perhaps the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are shifted to the right by two positions.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 0s are being replaced in a way that depends on the row's index. For example, for row i, the 0s are moved to certain columns based on i.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain rows reversed. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is not reversed, but the sixth row is modified.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with the rows 1 and 5 swapped. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the sixth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The input's sixth row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three elements are 2,0,2 in the output, and 2,2,2 in the input. So this suggests that the transformation is that for certain rows, the first three elements are changed to 2,0,2.\n\nBut why?\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the exact pattern is. But given that the examples have a certain structure, perhaps the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, except for certain rows where the pattern is modified. For example, in the first example, the second row and sixth row are modified.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the second row is modified. Let's compare it to the input's second row. The input's second row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three elements are 2,2,2 instead of 2,0,2. The fourth element is 0, fifth is 2, sixth is 0, seventh is 2, eighth is 0, ninth is 2, tenth is 0, eleventh is 2.\n\nSo the pattern is that the first three elements are 2, and then the rest of the row follows a pattern of 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2.\n\nSimilarly, in the output's sixth row, the first three elements are 2,0,2, and then the pattern is 0, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is that for certain rows, the first three elements are set to 2,2,2 or 2,0,2, and the rest of the row follows a pattern.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are affected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the first three elements are set to 2,2,2 if the row is even, and 2,0,2 if the row is odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut looking at Example 1's output row 1 (second row), which is odd, the first three elements are 2,2,2. But this contradicts the idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the first three elements are set to 2,2,2 for even rows and 2,0,2 for odd rows. But in Example 1's output row 5 (sixth row, which is odd), the first three elements are 2,0,2. So this fits. But for the second row (row 1, odd), the first three elements are 2,2,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the first three elements are set to 2,2,2 if the row is even, and 2,0,2 if the row is odd. But this doesn't fit the second row in Example 1.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Perhaps I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the second row has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. The input's second row has 0s at positions 1,3,5,7,9. So the 0 at position 1 is now 2. So perhaps the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are being removed from the left side.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the pattern is the same as input, and for odd rows, the pattern is modified by replacing the first 0 with a 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I have, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 1, the second row is the same as the input's fourth row. Let me check:\n\nInput's fourth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. Output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. No, that's not the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the pattern is mirrored. For example, the second row in the output is a mirror of the input's fourth row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 1, the second row is modified in a way that the 0s are in even columns. For example, in the input's second row, the 0s are at positions 1,3,5,7,9 (odd positions). In the output, the 0s are at positions 3,5,7,9 (odd positions). So the 0 at position 1 is now 2.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are being moved to the right by two positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the 0s are being replaced in a way that depends on the row's index. For example, for row i, if i is even, then the 0s are in certain positions, and if i is odd, then they are in other positions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of a possible transformation that could work for the examples.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's second row: it has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. The input's second row has 0s at positions 1,3,5,7,9. So the 0 at position 1 is now 2. So perhaps the transformation is that for row 1 (second row), the 0 at position 1 is replaced with 2.\n\nSimilarly, in the sixth row of Example 1, the input's row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The output's row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0 at position 1 is now 2, and the 0 at position 5 is now 2.\n\nWait, no. The input's sixth row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The output's sixth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three elements are 2,0,2. The 0 at position 1 is now 0, but the 0 at position 5 is now 2.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the 0s are being replaced in a way that depends on the column's position. For example, if the column is even, it's 2, and if it's odd, it's 0. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain columns flipped. For example, columns 3 and 7 are flipped.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAnother idea: the output for Example 1's second row is the same as the input's fourth row. Let me check:\n\nInput's fourth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. Output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. Not the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the pattern is reversed. For example, the second row is reversed, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern in the rows.\n\nFor example, the output's second row has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. The input's second row has 0s at positions 1,3,5,7,9. So the 0 at position 1 is now 2. So maybe the transformation is that for row 1, the 0 at position 1 is replaced with 2.\n\nSimilarly, in the sixth row of Example 1, the input has 0 at position 1, and the output has 0 at position 1. But the input has 0 at position 5, and the output has 2 at position 5. So this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for rows where the row number is odd, the 0s are being shifted to the right by two positions.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAnother idea: the output is the same as the input, but for certain rows, the 0s are being replaced in a way that depends on the row's index. For example, for row i, if i is even, the pattern is the same, and if i is odd, the pattern is modified by replacing certain 0s with 2s.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll try to write a function that for each row, if the row is even, it remains the same, and if it's odd, it modifies the first three elements to 2,2,2, and then the rest of the row follows a pattern of 0,2,0,2,0,2.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's see if this fits the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's second row (row 1, odd), the first three elements are 2,2,2. Then the rest is 0,2,0,2,0,2. So the row becomes 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2, which matches the output.\n\nFor the sixth row (row 5, odd), the first three elements are 2,0,2. But according to this hypothesis, they should be 2,2,2. But the output's sixth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for even rows, the pattern is the same, and for odd rows, the pattern is modified by replacing the first 0 with 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each row, if the row index is even, keep it as is. For odd rows, modify the first three elements to 2,2,2, and then the rest of the row follows the pattern of 0,2,0,2,0,2.\n\nThis would fit the second row of Example 1, but not the sixth row. But maybe this is the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = []\n    for i in range(7):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            new_grid.append(grid[i])\n        else:\n            # modify the row\n            row = grid[i]\n            # set first three elements to 2,2,2\n            new_row = [2, 2, 2] + row[3:]\n            # then modify the rest of the row to have 0,2,0,2,0,2\n            # but this is not clear\n            # perhaps replace the elements starting from position 3\n            # for example, in the new_row, starting from position 3, alternate 0 and 2\n            # but this is not clear\n            # this part is not clear\n            # so perhaps this approach is not correct\n            # alternative idea: for the odd rows, replace the first three elements with 2,2,2, and then for the rest, alternate 0 and 2\n            # but this is just a guess\n            # for example, in the new_row, after the first three elements, the rest are 0,2,0,2,0,2\n            # but how to calculate this\n            # let's see for the second row in Example 1: after the first three elements, the rest is 0,2,0,2,0,2\n            # the original row after the first three elements is 0,2,2,0,2,0,2\n            # but after modification, it becomes 0,2,0,2,0,2\n            # so the third element is 2, and the fourth is 0, fifth is 2, etc.\n            # this is not clear.\n\n            # perhaps this approach is not working, and I need to think of another way.\n\n            # alternative idea: for odd rows, the first three elements are 2,2,2, and then every other element is 0, starting from position 3\n            # for example, in the second row of Example 1, the new_row is [2,2,2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n            # which matches the output\n            # so for the odd rows, the first three elements are 2,2,2, and then every other element is 0, starting from position 3\n            # but how to implement this\n\n            # for the row, after the first three elements, the rest are 0,2,0,2,0,2\n            # so for the rest of the elements, starting from position 3, we alternate 0 and 2\n            # but how to calculate that\n\n            # for example, in the original row, after the first three elements, the rest is row[3:]\n            # we need to replace it with 0,2,0,2,0,2\n            # but the original row's length is 11, so after the first three elements, there are 8 elements.\n\n            # so for the new_row, after the first three elements, we have 0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2\n\n            # but how to determine that.\n\n            # for example, for the second row in Example 1, the original row after first three elements is [0,2,2,0,2,0,2].

The new_row after first three elements is [2,2,2], and then the rest is 0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2. So the new_row is [2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2], which is the same as the input's row 5. But the output for row 5 is [2,0,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,2]. So this doesn't match.\n\n            # this suggests that this approach is not correct for all cases.\n\n            # but perhaps the transformation is that for odd rows, the first three elements are 2,2,2, and the rest are 0,2,0,2,0,2.\n\n            # but in Example 1's sixth row, the output is different. So this approach may not work.\n\n            # given the time, I'll proceed with this approach, as it fits some of the examples, and hope that it's the correct pattern.\n\n            # so the code would be:\n\n            new_row = [2, 2, 2]\n            for j in range(3, 11):\n                if (j - 3) % 2 == 0:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(2)\n            new_grid.append(new_row)\n\n    return new_grid\n\nBut wait, this would only work for the second row of Example 1, but not for other rows. However, this is the best I can do given the time.\n\nBut the problem says that the output must be 7x11. So the code must return a 7x11 grid.\n\nSo, the function would iterate through each row. For even rows (0,2,4,6), it appends the original row. For odd rows (1,3,5), it creates a new row with first three elements as 2,2,2, and then alternates 0 and 2 starting from position 3.\n\nBut this may not work for all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nNow, let's check Example 2's output.\n\nExample 2's input is a 7x11 grid. The output for Example 2's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. According to the code, for row 1 (odd), the new_row would be [2,2,2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2], which is not the same as the output. But the output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nBut this is the best I can do. I'll proceed with this approach and write the code.\n"
