The transformation appears to be a form of \"expansion\" or \"infection\" where certain values propagate to neighboring cells.\n4. The output grid always has 15x15 cells, so the transformation must ensure this.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads values from their original positions to neighboring cells, with some specific rules for how they spread.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the spread pattern\n    spread_pattern = [\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 1, 1],\n        [0, 1, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(15):\n        for j in range(15):\n            # If the cell is not zero, spread its value to neighboring cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Apply the spread pattern\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 15 and 0 <= nj < 15:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the spread pattern\n    spread_pattern = [\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [1, 1, 1],\n        [0, 1, 0]\n    ]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(15):\n        for j in range(15):\n            # If the cell is not zero, spread its value to neighboring cells\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Apply the spread pattern\n                for di in range(-1, 2):\n                    for dj in range(-1, 2):\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 15 and 0 <= nj < 15:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
