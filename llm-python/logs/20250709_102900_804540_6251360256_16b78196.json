that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

Always start by attempting to find a complete rule that solves all training examples and should generalize to the test input.\n2. If you cannot find a perfect solution, provide your best attempt at a transformation that solves as many training examples as possible - ideally more than in the best previous turn.\n3. Even if your solution doesn't solve all examples perfectly, ensure it demonstrates meaningful pattern recognition and provides reasonable outputs that minimize pixel-level errors.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your improved transformation logic here (even if partial)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nTraining results: 0/2 examples solved, 90.8% pixel accuracy - Good partial progress! Your approach is capturing some patterns. Next, try to identify a transformation that solves at least one of the training examples.\n\nTraining Example 1 \u2717:\nExpected: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0,

The colour occupying the largest number of cells (non-zero) is a\n        huge \u201cbackground\u201d figure.  We keep it untouched.\n    2.  All other coloured components are considered *movable pieces*.\n        We erase them from their original position.\n    3.  Inside the dominant area there are zero-valued holes.  If a hole\u2019s\n        silhouette matches a movable piece in a unique way (the piece\u2019s\n        shape fits exactly one hole location on the board) we relocate that\n        piece there.  Otherwise the piece stays erased.\n    4.
