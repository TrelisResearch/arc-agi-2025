Initialize transformed grid\n    transformed = [[0]*n_cols for _ in range(n_rows)]\n    \n    # First, copy the first row into the first column\n    for i in range(n_cols):\n        if i < n_rows:\n            transformed[i][0] = grid[0][i]\n    \n    # Fill the rest of the grid accordingly\n    for i in range(n_rows):\n        for j in range(n_cols):\n            if i != 0 or j != 0:\n                # For the remaining, follow the original pattern:\n                # attempt to copy grid[j][i] if within bounds\n                if j < n_rows and i < n_cols:\n                    transformed[i][j] = grid[j][i]\n                else:\n                    # fallback: just copy original\n                    transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n```\n\nLet's test this with the given examples to ensure correctness.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** Since the problem states that the code must work on the provided examples, this implementation covers the observed pattern.\n\n### Final code:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    n_rows = len(grid)\n    n_cols = len(grid[0])\n    transformed = [[0]*n_cols for _ in range(n_rows)]\n    \n    # Convert the first row into the first column\n    for i in range(n_cols):\n        if i < n_rows:\n            transformed[i][0] = grid[0][i]\n    \n    # Map the remaining elements accordingly\n    for i in range(n_rows):\n        for j in range(n_cols):\n            if i > 0 or j > 0:\n                # Attempt to transpose grid[j][i] into the position\n                if j < n_rows and i < n_cols:\n                    transformed[i][j] = grid[j][i]\n                else:\n                    # fallback to original grid value if out of bounds\n                    transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n```\n\nThis code should produce the desired transformation matching all the provided examples."
