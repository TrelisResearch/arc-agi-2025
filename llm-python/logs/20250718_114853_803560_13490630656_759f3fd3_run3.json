There's a central vertical line of 3s in the input that becomes a vertical line of 3s in the output\n2. The 3s in the input are surrounded by 4s in the output\n3. The 4s form a kind of \"frame\" around the 3s\n4. The 4s seem to follow a pattern that forms a kind of \"border\" around the 3s\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Leaves the 3s in their original positions\n- Surrounds the 3s with 4s in a pattern that forms a kind of border\n- Fills the rest of the grid with 0s\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

There's a central vertical line of 3s in the input that becomes a vertical line of 3s in the output\n2. The 3s in the input are surrounded by 4s in the output\n3. The 4s form a kind of \"frame\" around the 3s\n4. The 4s seem to follow a pattern that forms a kind of \"border\" around the 3s\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Leaves the 3s in their original positions\n- Surrounds the 3s with 4s in a pattern that forms a kind of border\n- Fills the rest of the grid with 0s\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
