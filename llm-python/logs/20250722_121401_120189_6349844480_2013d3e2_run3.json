The output grid seems to be formed by taking values from specific positions in the input grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the output grid is formed by taking values from specific positions in the input grid. The exact positions seem to be determined by some pattern that I'm not entirely clear on, but I'll implement a transformation that takes values from specific positions in the input grid to form the output grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Extract specific positions from the input grid to form the output grid\n    # Based on the training examples, the output grid seems to be formed by taking values from specific positions\n    # in the input grid.
