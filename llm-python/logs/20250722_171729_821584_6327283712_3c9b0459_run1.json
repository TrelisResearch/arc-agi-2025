          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the transformation seems to involve some form of rotation or permutation of the elements in the grid. Let's look at the patterns more closely:\n\n1. In Example 1, the input grid is:\n```\n2 2 1\n2 1 2\n2 8 1\n```\nAnd the output is:\n```\n1 8 2\n2 1 2\n1 2 2\n```\nThis looks like a rotation of the grid, but not a simple 90-degree rotation.\n\n2. In Example 2, the input grid is:\n```\n9 2 4\n2 4 4\n2 9 2\n```\nAnd the output is:\n```\n2 9 2\n4 4 2\n4 2 9\n```\nThis also seems to be a permutation of the elements, possibly involving some form of transformation that moves elements in a specific pattern.\n\n3. In Example 3, the input grid is:\n```\n8 8 8\n5 5 8\n8 5 5\n```\nAnd the output is:\n```\n5 5 8\n8 5 5\n8 8 8\n```\nThis looks like a rotation of the grid, but again not a simple 90-degree rotation.\n\n4. In Example 4, the input grid is:\n```\n3 2 9\n9 9 9\n2 3 3\n```\nAnd the output is:\n```\n3 3 2\n9 9 9\n9 2 3\n```\nThis also seems to be a permutation of the elements.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves a specific permutation of the elements in the grid. The pattern seems to involve moving elements in a specific order, possibly involving a rotation or permutation of the elements.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Perform the transformation based on observed patterns\n    # This is a hypothesis based on the examples provided\n    # The transformation seems to involve a specific permutation of the elements\n    # We'll apply a specific permutation to the grid\n    \n    # Example transformation pattern (based on observed patterns)\n    # This is a hypothesis and may not be perfect\n    # The pattern seems to involve a specific permutation of the elements\n    \n    # For the purpose of this solution, we'll apply a specific permutation\n    #
