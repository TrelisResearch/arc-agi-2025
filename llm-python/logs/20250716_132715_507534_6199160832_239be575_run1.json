    "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function that maps the input grid to a 1x1 output grid. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input is a 6x5 grid. The output is 0. Let me think about what might cause that. Maybe there's some condition based on the numbers in the grid. For instance, maybe the output is determined by the presence of certain numbers in specific positions.\n\nExample 2's output is 8. The input has a lot of 8s and 2s. Maybe the output is the maximum value in the grid? Wait, let's check. In Example 1, the input has 8s and 2s. The output is 0. But if the maximum was 8, that wouldn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the count of certain numbers. For example, maybe the output is 0 if there's an even number of 8s, or something like that. But let's check the examples.\n\nExample 1's input: Let's count the 8s. Looking at the input rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 8 0 8 \u2192 two 8s\nRow 1: 2 2 8 0 0 \u2192 one 8\nRow 2: 2 2 0 0 8 \u2192 one 8\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 none\nRow 4: 8 8 0 2 2 \u2192 two 8s\nTotal 8s: 2+1+1+0+2 = 6. Which is even. Output is 0. Hmm, maybe if the count of 8s is even, output 0? But example 2's output is 8. Let's check example 2's input.\n\nExample 2's input is a 7x7 grid. Let's count the 8s. Let me look:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 one 8\nRow 1: 2 2 0 8 8 8 0 \u2192 three 8s\nRow 2: 2 2 8 8 0 2 2 \u2192 two 8s\nRow 3: 0 0 8 0 0 2 2 \u2192 one 8\nRow 4: 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 \u2192 two 8s\nRow 5: 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 \u2192 two 8s\nTotal 8s: 1+3+2+1+2+2 = 11. Which is odd. Output is 8. So maybe if the count of 8s is odd, output 8? But example 1's count is 6 (even) and output is 0. That seems to fit. Let me check example 3.\n\nExample 3's output is 8. Let's count the 8s in its input. Input is 7x7 grid.\n\nRow 0: 8 2 2 8 8 0 0 \u2192 three 8s\nRow 1: 0 2 2 0 0 0 8 \u2192 one 8\nRow 2: 0 8 8 0 0 8 0 \u2192 three 8s\nRow 3: 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 \u2192 two 8s\nRow 4: 8 0 8 8 8 2 2 \u2192 four 8s\nRow 5: 8 0 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 one 8\nTotal 8s: 3+1+3+2+4+1 = 14. Even. But output is 8. That contradicts the previous hypothesis. So maybe that's not the right pattern.\n\nHmm. So maybe the output is based on something else. Let's think again.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is determined by the presence of certain patterns. For example, maybe the output is the value at a specific position, like the center of the grid. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's input, which is 6x5. The center might be around row 2, column 2. Let's see. The input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 8 0 8\nRow 1: 2 2 8 0 0\nRow 2: 2 2 0 0 8\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 2\nRow 4: 8 8 0 2 2\n\nThe center would be around (2,2) which is 0. The output is 0. That matches. Let's check example 2's output. The input is 7x7. The center is row 3, column 3. Let's look at row 3, column 3. The input row 3 is 0 0 8 0 0 2 2. So column 3 is 0. But the output is 8. That doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the sum of all elements. Let's check example 1. Sum of all elements:\n\nRow 0: 0+0+8+0+8 = 16\nRow 1: 2+2+8+0+0 = 12\nRow 2: 2+2+0+0+8 = 12\nRow 3: 0+0+0+2+2 =4\nRow 4:8+8+0+2+2= 20\nTotal sum: 16+12+12+4+20= 64. Output is 0. Not sure how that relates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of 8s in the grid. For example, if there's at least one 8, output 8, else 0. But example 1 has 8s, output is 0. So that's not.\n\nLooking at example 2's output is 8. The input has 8s. So maybe the output is 8 if there's an odd number of 8s, else 0. But example 1's count is 6 (even), output 0. Example 2's count was 11 (odd), output 8. Example 3's count is 14 (even), but output is 8. So that contradicts. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. Maybe the output is determined by the presence of certain numbers in certain positions. For example, maybe the output is the value of the top-left cell. But in example 1, the top-left is 0. Output is 0. Example 2's top-left is 0, output is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of 2s and 8s. For example, if there's more 8s than 2s, output 8, else 0. Let's check example 1. Let's count 2s and 8s.\n\nIn example 1:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,8,0,8 \u2192 2 8s.\nRow 1: 2,2,8,0,0 \u2192 2 2s and 1 8.\nRow 2: 2,2,0,0,8 \u2192 2 2s and 1 8.\nRow 3: 0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 2 2s.\nRow 4: 8,8,0,2,2 \u2192 2 8s and 2 2s.\nTotal 8s: 2+1+1+0+2 = 6. 2s: 2+2+2+2+2 = 10. So 8s are less than 2s. Output is 0. That fits. But example 2's output is 8. Let's check that.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nRow 0: 0,8,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 1 8, 0 2s.\nRow 1: 2,2,0,8,8,8,0 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 2: 2,2,8,8,0,2,2 \u2192 2 8s, 4 2s.\nRow 3: 0,0,8,0,0,2,2 \u2192 1 8, 2 2s.\nRow 4: 0,8,0,0,8,0,0 \u2192 2 8s, 0 2s.\nRow 5: 0,0,8,0,0,0,8 \u2192 2 8s, 0 2s.\nTotal 8s: 1+3+2+1+2+2 = 11. 2s: 2+2+4+2+0+0 = 10. So 8s (11) > 2s (10). Output is 8. Which fits. Example 3's output is 8. Let's check.\n\nExample 3's input:\n\nRow 0: 8,2,2,8,8,0,0 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 1: 0,2,2,0,0,0,8 \u2192 1 8, 2 2s.\nRow 2: 0,8,8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 3 8s, 0 2s.\nRow 3: 0,0,8,0,0,0,8 \u2192 2 8s, 0 2s.\nRow 4: 8,0,8,8,8,2,2 \u2192 4 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 5: 8,0,0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 1 8, 2 2s.\nTotal 8s: 3+1+3+2+4+1 = 14. 2s: 2+2+0+0+2+2 = 8. 8s (14) > 2s (8). Output is 8. Which fits. So this seems to be a possible pattern. So the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, else 0. Let's check example 4.\n\nExample 4's output is 0. Let's count 8s and 2s in input.\n\nInput is 7x7 grid:\n\nRow 0: 8,8,0,0,2,2,0 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 1: 0,8,8,0,2,2,8 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 2: 0,0,0,8,0,8,0 \u2192 2 8s, 0 2s.\nRow 3: 8,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 1 8, 0 2s.\nRow 4: 0,2,2,0,8,0,8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 5: 0,2,2,8,8,0,8 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 6: 0,0,8,2,2,0,8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nTotal 8s: 2+3+2+1+2+3+2 = 15. 2s: 2+2+0+0+2+2+2 = 10. So 15 > 10. Output should be 8, but the example output is 0. That contradicts the hypothesis. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm. So example 4's output is 0, but according to this hypothesis, it should be 8. So this suggests that my previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is determined by the presence of a certain pattern. For example, maybe the output is 8 if there's at least one 8 in the grid, but that doesn't fit example 1, which has 8s and outputs 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the number of 8s and 2s in certain positions. For example, maybe if there's an even number of 8s and odd number of 2s, output 0. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is determined by the sum of the numbers in certain positions. For example, the sum of all elements. Let's check example 1's sum. Earlier, I calculated 64. Output is 0. Example 2's sum: let's see. Example 2's input is 7x7. Let's compute sum:\n\nRow 0: 0+8+0+0+0+0+0 = 8\nRow 1: 2+2+0+8+8+8+0 = 28\nRow 2: 2+2+8+8+0+2+2 = 24\nRow 3: 0+0+8+0+0+2+2 = 12\nRow 4: 0+8+0+0+8+0+0 = 16\nRow 5: 0+0+8+0+0+0+8 = 16\nTotal sum: 8+28=36, +24=60, +12=72, +16=88, +16=104. Output is 8. Not sure how that relates. Maybe the sum mod something. 104 mod 12 is 4, but output is 8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the maximum value in the grid. For example 1, the max is 8, but output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is based on the parity of the number of 8s and 2s. For example, if the number of 8s is even and the number of 2s is odd, output 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the presence of certain numbers in the grid. For example, if there's a 0 in the grid, output 0. But example 2's output is 8, which has 0s. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of each example, maybe the output is 0 if the number of 8s is even and 8 if odd. But example 3's count of 8s was 14 (even) but output is 8. That contradicts.\n\nHmm. Let me try to think of other possible patterns. Maybe the output is determined by the number of 8s in the grid. For example, if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, output 8. If the number of 8s is less than the number of 2s, output 0. If equal, output something else. But example 4's count of 8s is 15 and 2s is 10. So 15>10, output should be 8, but example 4's output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different condition. Let me check example 4's input again. The output is 0. Let me count the number of 8s and 2s again. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nExample 4's input is:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 0 0 2 2 0 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 1: 0 8 8 0 2 2 8 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 2: 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 \u2192 2 8s, 0 2s.\nRow 3: 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 1 8, 0 2s.\nRow 4: 0 2 2 0 8 0 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 5: 0 2 2 8 8 0 8 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 6: 0 0 8 2 2 0 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\n\nTotal 8s: 2+3+2+1+2+3+2 = 15. 2s: 2+2+0+0+2+2+2 = 10. So 15>10. Output is 0. So that contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nHmm. What's different about example 4? Maybe the output is based on the number of 8s and 2s in certain positions. For example, maybe the count of 8s in even rows and 2s in odd rows? Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the presence of 8s and 2s in certain positions. For example, if there's a 8 in the top-left corner, output 8, else 0. But example 1's top-left is 0, output is 0. Example 2's top-left is 0, output is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the outputs. The outputs are either 0 or 8. So maybe the output is determined by some condition that is true for some examples and not others.\n\nLooking at example 1: output is 0. Example 2: 8. Example 3: 8. Example 4: 0. Example 5: 8. Example 6: 0. So the outputs are 0 in examples 1,4,6 and 8 in others. Maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, and 0 otherwise. But example 4's count of 8s is 15, 2s is 10. So 15>10, output should be 8, but it's 0. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, but only if the number of 8s is odd. Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the difference between the counts. Like, if the difference is positive, output 8, else 0. But example 4's difference is 5, which is positive. Output is 0. So that's not.\n\nHmm. Let me look for other patterns. Maybe the output is determined by the presence of certain numbers in the grid. For example, if there's at least one 8 in the grid, output 8, but that doesn't fit example 1. Or if there's a 0 in the grid, output 0. But example 2 has 0s and outputs 8.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is determined by the number of 8s and 2s in the grid. For example, if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is even, output 0. Or some other combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the sum of the counts of 8s and 2s. For example, if the sum is even, output 0, else 8. Let's check example 1: 6 8s and 10 2s. Sum is 16 even \u2192 output 0. Example 2: 11 8s and 10 2s. Sum 21, odd \u2192 output 8. Example 3: 14 8s and 8 2s \u2192 sum 22 even. Output is 8. So that doesn't fit. So that's not.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is based on the parity of the count of 8s. For example, if the count of 8s is even, output 0. If odd, output 8. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: 6 even \u2192 0. Correct. Example 2: 11 odd \u2192 8. Correct. Example 3: 14 even \u2192 output is 8. So that doesn't fit. So that's not.\n\nBut example 3's output is 8, but according to this hypothesis, it should be 0. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the parity of the count of 2s. Example 3 has 8 2s (even), output is 8. So that's not.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let me think of other possible patterns.\n\nLooking at the examples, the output is 0 or 8. Maybe the output is 8 if there's at least one 8 in the grid and the number of 8s is odd, else 0. Let's see:\n\nExample 1: 6 8s (even), output 0. Correct. Example 2: 11 (odd), output 8. Correct. Example 3: 14 (even), output 8. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is odd and there's at least one 2. But example 3 has 14 8s (even), so output 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, and the number of 8s is odd. But example 3's 8s is 14 (even) but output is 8. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if there's at least one 8 in the grid and the number of 8s is not equal to the number of 2s. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: 6 8s, 10 2s. Not equal. Output 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is even. But example 3's 14 8s is even, but output is 8. So that's not.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the examples again.\n\nExample 1: output is 0. Let's think about the positions of the 8s. Maybe there's a specific pattern in their positions.\n\nExample 1's input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 8 0 8\nRow 1: 2 2 8 0 0\nRow 2: 2 2 0 0 8\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 2\nRow 4: 8 8 0 2 2\n\nThe 8s are at positions (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (2,4), (4,0), (4,1). So six 8s. Maybe the output is 0 if the number of 8s is even and 8 if odd. But example 1's output is 0, which fits. Example 2's output is 8, which has 11 8s (odd). Example 3's output is 8, which has 14 8s (even). So that doesn't fit. But maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is odd, else 0. But example 3's output is 8, which is even. So that's not.\n\nWait, but example 3's output is 8. So maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is odd or even, but there's some other condition. Like, if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, then output 8, else 0. But example 4's count of 8s is 15, 2s is 10. So 15>10, output should be 8, but it's 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if there's at least one 8 in the grid, but that's not the case for example 1. So no.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is determined by the sum of the values in certain positions. For example, the sum of the top-left 2x2 square. Let's check example 1:\n\nTop-left 2x2 square is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2\nSum is 0+0+2+2 = 4. Output is 0. Not sure.\n\nExample 2's top-left 2x2 is 0,8,2,2. Sum is 0+8+2+2=12. Output is 8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the values in the grid modulo something. For example, modulo 10. Let's check example 1's sum was 64. 64 mod 10 is 4, but output is 0. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is determined by the presence of certain patterns in the grid. For example, if there's a 8 in the center, output 8. But example 1's center is 0. Output is 0. Example 2's center is 0, output is 8. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of 8s and 2s in the grid. For example, if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, output 8. If the number of 2s is greater, output 0. If equal, output something else. But example 4 has 15 8s and 10 2s, so output should be 8, but it's 0. So that's not.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I need to look for another pattern. Let's think about the examples where the output is 8.\n\nExample 2: 11 8s, 10 2s. Output is 8.\n\nExample 3: 14 8s, 8 2s. Output is 8.\n\nExample 5: let's check. Input is 7x7.\n\nRow 0: 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 \u2192 2 8s.\nRow 1: 0 0 2 2 0 8 0 \u2192 1 8.\nRow 2: 8 0 2 2 0 0 0 \u2192 1 8.\nRow 3: 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 \u2192 2 8s.\nRow 4: 0 0 8 2 2 0 8 \u2192 3 8s.\nRow 5: 8 0 0 2 2 8 0 \u2192 2 8s.\nTotal 8s: 2+1+1+2+3+2 = 11. 2s: let's count.\n\nRow 0: 0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 0 2s.\nRow 1: 0,0,2,2,0 \u2192 2 2s.\nRow 2: 0,0,2,2,0 \u2192 2 2s.\nRow 3: 0,0,8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 0 2s.\nRow 4: 0,0,8,2,2,0,8 \u2192 2 2s.\nRow 5: 0,0,0,2,2,0,0 \u2192 2 2s.\nTotal 2s: 0+2+2+0+2+2 = 8. So 8s is 11, which is greater than 2s (8). Output is 8. So this fits the hypothesis that if 8s > 2s, output 8. But example 4's count is 15 8s, 10 2s, but output is 0. So why is that?\n\nWait, maybe there's another condition. Like, if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is odd, output 8. Otherwise, 0. Let's check example 4's 8s is 15 (odd), 2s is 10. 15>10, and odd. Output should be 8, but example 4's output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the difference between the counts. If the difference is positive and even, output 0. If odd, output 8. But example 1's difference is 6-10 = -4 (even), output 0. Example 2: 11-10=1 (odd), output 8. Example 3: 14-8=6 (even), output 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think of other patterns. Maybe the output is determined by the presence of certain numbers in the grid. For example, if there's a 8 in the first row, output 8. But example 1 has 8s in first row, output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number of 8s in the grid and the number of 2s in the grid. For example, if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is greater than 5, output 8. But example 4 has 15 8s, which is greater than 5, output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is greater than 10. But example 3 has 14, which is greater than 10. Output is 8. Example 4 has 15, output is 0. So that's not.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think of other patterns. Let's look at the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n2 2 8 8 0 8\n2 2 0 8 0 0\n8 8 0 0 0 8\n0 8 8 8 0 0\n8 0 8 0 0 8\n0 0 8 2 2 0\n8 0 0 2 2 0\n0 8 0 0 0 8\n\nThis is a 8x6 grid. Let's count the number of 8s and 2s.\n\nLet's count 8s:\n\nRow 0: 2,2,8,8,0,8 \u2192 3 8s.\nRow 1: 2,2,0,8,0,0 \u2192 1 8.\nRow 2: 8,8,0,0,0,8 \u2192 3 8s.\nRow 3: 0,8,8,8,0,0 \u2192 3 8s.\nRow 4: 8,0,8,0,0,8 \u2192 3 8s.\nRow 5: 0,0,8,2,2,0 \u2192 1 8.\nRow 6: 8,0,0,2,2,0 \u2192 1 8.\nRow 7: 0,8,0,0,0,8 \u2192 2 8s.\nTotal 8s: 3+1+3+3+3+1+1+2 = 17.\n\nCount of 2s:\n\nRow 0: 2,2 \u2192 2.\nRow 1: 2,2 \u2192 2.\nRow 2: 0,0,0 \u2192 0.\nRow 3: 0,8,8,8 \u2192 0.\nRow 4: 0,0,0 \u2192 0.\nRow 5: 2,2 \u2192 2.\nRow 6: 2,2 \u2192 2.\nRow 7: 0,8 \u2192 0.\nTotal 2s: 2+2+0+0+0+2+2+0 = 8.\n\nSo 17 8s, 8 2s. According to the earlier hypothesis (if 8s > 2s, output 8), the output should be 8. But I don't know what the actual output is. But the test input is just for context, and the task is to write the transformation function.\n\nBut since I can't know the test output, I need to base my hypothesis on the training examples.\n\nLet me try to think of another approach. Maybe the output is 8 if there's at least one 8 in the grid and the number of 8s is not equal to the number of 2s. But example 1 has 6 8s and 10 2s, which are not equal, output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is odd. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: 6 8s (even) and 10 2s. 6<10 \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 11 8s (odd), 10 2s. 11>10 \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nExample 3: 14 8s (even), 8 2s. 14>8 \u2192 output 8. But according to this hypothesis, since 14 is even, it should not be output 8. So this is not.\n\nBut example 3's output is 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, regardless of their parity. But example 4's count is 15 8s and 10 2s, which is greater, but output is 0. So that's not.\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by the parity of the number of 8s and 2s. For example, if the number of 8s is even and the number of 2s is even, output 0. If one is even and the other is odd, output 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nExample 1: 6 8s (even), 10 2s (even) \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 11 (odd), 10 (even) \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nExample 3: 14 (even), 8 (even) \u2192 output 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the examples where the output is 0.\n\nExample 1: 6 8s, 10 2s. Output 0.\n\nExample 4: 15 8s, 10 2s. Output 0.\n\nExample 6: let's check. Input is 6x6 grid:\n\nRow 0: 8 0 0 2 2 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 1: 8 0 8 2 2 0 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 8 0 \u2192 1 8.\nRow 3: 2 2 8 0 0 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 4: 2 2 0 0 0 8 \u2192 1 8, 2 2s.\nRow 5: 0 8 8 0 8 0 \u2192 3 8s, 0 2s.\nTotal 8s: 2+2+1+2+1+3 = 11. 2s: 2+2+0+2+2+0 = 8. So 11>8. Output is 0. So why is this output 0?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe there's a different pattern. Maybe the output is 0 if the number of 8s is even, and 8 if it's odd. But example 4 has 15 8s (odd), output 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 if the number of 8s is even and 8 if it's odd, but only if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: 6 8s (even), 10 2s. 6<10 \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 11 (odd), 10 (even). 11>10 \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nExample 3: 14 (even), 8 (even). 14>8 \u2192 output 8. But according to this hypothesis, since 14 is even, output 0. So this is not.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think of another approach. Let's think about the positions of the 8s and 2s in the examples.\n\nIn example 1, the 8s are in positions that form a certain pattern. Maybe the output is 0 if there's an even number of 8s in the grid and 8 if odd. But example 3 has 14 (even) and output 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if there's at least one 8 in the grid and the number of 8s is not equal to the number of 2s. But example 1 has 6 8s and 10 2s, which are not equal, but output is 0. So that's not.\n\nMaybe the output is determined by the number of 8s and 2s in the grid, but with some other condition. For example, if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, and the number of 8s is greater than 5, output 8. But example 4 has 15 8s, which is greater than 5, but output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the correct pattern is that the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, and 0 otherwise. Even though example 4 contradicts this, maybe I'm making a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me re-count example 4's 8s and 2s.\n\nExample 4's input:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 0 0 2 2 0 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 1: 0 8 8 0 2 2 8 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 2: 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 \u2192 2 8s, 0 2s.\nRow 3: 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 1 8, 0 2s.\nRow 4: 0 2 2 0 8 0 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 5: 0 2 2 8 8 0 8 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 6: 0 0 8 2 2 0 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\n\nTotal 8s: 2+3+2+1+2+3+2 = 15. 2s: 2+2+0+0+2+2+2 = 10. So 15>10, so according to the hypothesis, output should be 8. But the example says output is 0. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut why is example 4's output 0? Maybe there's another condition. Let's look at example 4's input. Maybe the output is 0 if there are more 8s than 2s and the number of 8s is even. But 15 is odd. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is even. But example 4 has 15 8s (odd), so output is 8. But example 4's output is 0. So that's not.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the outputs. The output is always 0 or 8. So maybe it's based on the presence of certain numbers in the grid. For example, if there's at least one 8 and at least one 2, output 8. But example 1 has both, output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is based on the sum of all the 8s and 2s. For example, if the sum is even, output 0, else 8. Let's check example 1:\n\nSum of 8s is 6*8 = 48. Sum of 2s is 10*2 = 20. Total sum is 68. 68 is even \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 11 8s (11*8=88), 10 2s (10*2=20). Total 108. Even \u2192 output 8? No, example 2's output is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is greater than 10. But example 4 has 15 8s, which is greater than 10, output is 0. So no.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples that fit most of them, even if it's not perfect. The most consistent pattern I've seen is that the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, else 0. Even though example 4 contradicts this, maybe I'm missing something in the counting.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting example 4. Let me re-count the 8s and 2s in example 4.\n\nExample 4's input is:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 0 0 2 2 0 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 1: 0 8 8 0 2 2 8 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 2: 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 \u2192 2 8s, 0 2s.\nRow 3: 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 1 8, 0 2s.\nRow 4: 0 2 2 0 8 0 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 5: 0 2 2 8 8 0 8 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 6: 0 0 8 2 2 0 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\n\nTotal 8s: 2+3+2+1+2+3+2 = 15. 2s: 2+2+0+0+2+2+2 = 10. So 15 > 10. Output should be 8, but example 4's output is 0. So this is a contradiction.\n\nMaybe the pattern is not based on the count of 8s and 2s, but on something else. Let's think about the positions of the 8s and 2s.\n\nMaybe the output is 8 if there's at least one 8 in the grid and the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, and the number of 8s is not divisible by 3. But example 4 has 15 8s, which is divisible by 3. Output is 0. Example 2 has 11, which is not divisible by 3. Output is 8. Example 3 has 14, not divisible by 3. Output is 8. Example 1 has 6, divisible by 3. Output is 0. So this fits. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: 6 8s (divisible by 3) \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 11 not divisible by 3 \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nExample 3: 14 not divisible by 3 \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nExample 4: 15 divisible by 3 \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nExample 5: let's check. Example 5's input has 11 8s (not divisible by 3). Output is 8. Correct.\n\nExample 6: input has 11 8s (not divisible by 3), output is 0. Wait, example 6's output is 0. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nExample 6's input: let's count the 8s and 2s.\n\nExample 6's input is 6x6 grid:\n\nRow 0: 8 0 0 2 2 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 1: 8 0 8 2 2 0 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 8 0 \u2192 1 8.\nRow 3: 2 2 8 0 0 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 4: 2 2 0 0 0 8 \u2192 1 8, 2 2s.\nRow 5: 0 8 8 0 8 0 \u2192 3 8s, 0 2s.\nTotal 8s: 2+2+1+2+1+3 = 11. 11 is not divisible by 3. Output is 0. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So this doesn't fit. But example 6's output is 0, but according to this hypothesis, it should be 8. So this is not.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and the examples I've checked, I think the most plausible pattern is that the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, and 0 otherwise. Even though example 4 contradicts this, perhaps I made a mistake in counting, or there's another condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is odd. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: 6 8s (even) \u2192 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 11 8s (odd) \u2192 8. Correct.\n\nExample 3: 14 8s (even) \u2192 0. But example 3's output is 8. So this is not.\n\nBut example 3's output is 8. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, else 0. Even though it doesn't fit example 4, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nSo the code would count the number of 8s and 2s in the grid, and return 8 if 8s > 2s, else 0.\n\nLet's write the code for that.\n\nThe function will:\n\n- Iterate through all elements in the grid.\n- Count the number of 8s and 2s.\n- Compare the counts.\n- Return 8 if 8s > 2s, else 0.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    count_8 = 0\n    count_2 = 0\n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 8:\n                count_8 += 1\n            elif val == 2:\n                count_2 += 1\n    if count_8 > count_2:\n        return [[8]]\n    else:\n        return [[0]]\n\nBut let's check example 4. According to this code, it would return 8, but the example says 0. So this is a problem.\n\nBut perhaps the example is wrong, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is odd. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: 6 8s (even) \u2192 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 11 (odd) \u2192 8. Correct.\n\nExample 3: 14 (even) \u2192 0. But example 3's output is 8. So this is not.\n\nBut example 3's output is 8, so this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis, even if it doesn't fit example 4. Perhaps there's a mistake in my counting for example 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of 8s and 2s in certain positions, like the first row or column.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the examples I've checked, I'll proceed with the code that counts 8s and 2s and returns 8 if 8s > 2s.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function that maps the input grid to a 1x1 output grid. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input is a 6x5 grid. The output is 0. Let me think about what might cause that. Maybe there's some condition based on the numbers in the grid. For instance, maybe the output is determined by the presence of certain numbers in specific positions.\n\nExample 2's output is 8. The input has a lot of 8s and 2s. Maybe the output is the maximum value in the grid? Wait, let's check. In Example 1, the input has 8s and 2s. The output is 0. But if the maximum was 8, that wouldn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the count of certain numbers. For example, maybe the output is 0 if there's an even number of 8s, or something like that. But let's check the examples.\n\nExample 1's input: Let's count the 8s. Looking at the input rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 8 0 8 \u2192 two 8s\nRow 1: 2 2 8 0 0 \u2192 one 8\nRow 2: 2 2 0 0 8 \u2192 one 8\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 none\nRow 4: 8 8 0 2 2 \u2192 two 8s\nTotal 8s: 2+1+1+0+2 = 6. Which is even. Output is 0. Hmm, maybe if the count of 8s is even, output 0? But example 2's output is 8. Let's check example 2's input.\n\nExample 2's input is a 7x7 grid. Let's count the 8s. Let me look:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 one 8\nRow 1: 2 2 0 8 8 8 0 \u2192 three 8s\nRow 2: 2 2 8 8 0 2 2 \u2192 two 8s\nRow 3: 0 0 8 0 0 2 2 \u2192 one 8\nRow 4: 0 8 0 0 8 0 0 \u2192 two 8s\nRow 5: 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 \u2192 two 8s\nTotal 8s: 1+3+2+1+2+2 = 11. Which is odd. Output is 8. So maybe if the count of 8s is odd, output 8? But example 1's count is 6 (even) and output is 0. That seems to fit. Let me check example 3.\n\nExample 3's output is 8. Let's count the 8s in its input. Input is 7x7 grid.\n\nRow 0: 8 2 2 8 8 0 0 \u2192 three 8s\nRow 1: 0 2 2 0 0 0 8 \u2192 one 8\nRow 2: 0 8 8 0 0 8 0 \u2192 three 8s\nRow 3: 0 0 8 0 0 0 8 \u2192 two 8s\nRow 4: 8 0 8 8 8 2 2 \u2192 four 8s\nRow 5: 8 0 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 one 8\nTotal 8s: 3+1+3+2+4+1 = 14. Even. But output is 8. That contradicts the previous hypothesis. So maybe that's not the right pattern.\n\nHmm. So maybe the output is based on something else. Let's think again.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is determined by the presence of certain patterns. For example, maybe the output is the value at a specific position, like the center of the grid. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's input, which is 6x5. The center might be around row 2, column 2. Let's see. The input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 8 0 8\nRow 1: 2 2 8 0 0\nRow 2: 2 2 0 0 8\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 2\nRow 4: 8 8 0 2 2\n\nThe center would be around (2,2) which is 0. The output is 0. That matches. Let's check example 2's output. The input is 7x7. The center is row 3, column 3. Let's look at row 3, column 3. The input row 3 is 0 0 8 0 0 2 2. So column 3 is 0. But the output is 8. That doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the sum of all elements. Let's check example 1. Sum of all elements:\n\nRow 0: 0+0+8+0+8 = 16\nRow 1: 2+2+8+0+0 = 12\nRow 2: 2+2+0+0+8 = 12\nRow 3: 0+0+0+2+2 =4\nRow 4:8+8+0+2+2= 20\nTotal sum: 16+12+12+4+20= 64. Output is 0. Not sure how that relates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of 8s in the grid. For example, if there's at least one 8, output 8, else 0. But example 1 has 8s, output is 0. So that's not.\n\nLooking at example 2's output is 8. The input has 8s. So maybe the output is 8 if there's an odd number of 8s, else 0. But example 1's count is 6 (even), output 0. Example 2's count was 11 (odd), output 8. Example 3's count is 14 (even), but output is 8. So that contradicts. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. Let me think again. Maybe the output is determined by the presence of certain numbers in certain positions. For example, maybe the output is the value of the top-left cell. But in example 1, the top-left is 0. Output is 0. Example 2's top-left is 0, output is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of 2s and 8s. For example, if there's more 8s than 2s, output 8, else 0. Let's check example 1. Let's count 2s and 8s.\n\nIn example 1:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,8,0,8 \u2192 2 8s.\nRow 1: 2,2,8,0,0 \u2192 2 2s and 1 8.\nRow 2: 2,2,0,0,8 \u2192 2 2s and 1 8.\nRow 3: 0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 2 2s.\nRow 4: 8,8,0,2,2 \u2192 2 8s and 2 2s.\nTotal 8s: 2+1+1+0+2 = 6. 2s: 2+2+2+2+2 = 10. So 8s are less than 2s. Output is 0. That fits. But example 2's output is 8. Let's check that.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nRow 0: 0,8,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 1 8, 0 2s.\nRow 1: 2,2,0,8,8,8,0 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 2: 2,2,8,8,0,2,2 \u2192 2 8s, 4 2s.\nRow 3: 0,0,8,0,0,2,2 \u2192 1 8, 2 2s.\nRow 4: 0,8,0,0,8,0,0 \u2192 2 8s, 0 2s.\nRow 5: 0,0,8,0,0,0,8 \u2192 2 8s, 0 2s.\nTotal 8s: 1+3+2+1+2+2 = 11. 2s: 2+2+4+2+0+0 = 10. So 8s (11) > 2s (10). Output is 8. Which fits. Example 3's output is 8. Let's check.\n\nExample 3's input:\n\nRow 0: 8,2,2,8,8,0,0 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 1: 0,2,2,0,0,0,8 \u2192 1 8, 2 2s.\nRow 2: 0,8,8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 3 8s, 0 2s.\nRow 3: 0,0,8,0,0,0,8 \u2192 2 8s, 0 2s.\nRow 4: 8,0,8,8,8,2,2 \u2192 4 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 5: 8,0,0,0,0,2,2 \u2192 1 8, 2 2s.\nTotal 8s: 3+1+3+2+4+1 = 14. 2s: 2+2+0+0+2+2 = 8. 8s (14) > 2s (8). Output is 8. Which fits. So this seems to be a possible pattern. So the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, else 0. Let's check example 4.\n\nExample 4's output is 0. Let's count 8s and 2s in input.\n\nInput is 7x7 grid:\n\nRow 0: 8,8,0,0,2,2,0 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 1: 0,8,8,0,2,2,8 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 2: 0,0,0,8,0,8,0 \u2192 2 8s, 0 2s.\nRow 3: 8,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 1 8, 0 2s.\nRow 4: 0,2,2,0,8,0,8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 5: 0,2,2,8,8,0,8 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 6: 0,0,8,2,2,0,8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nTotal 8s: 2+3+2+1+2+3+2 = 15. 2s: 2+2+0+0+2+2+2 = 10. So 15 > 10. Output should be 8, but the example output is 0. That contradicts the hypothesis. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm. So example 4's output is 0, but according to this hypothesis, it should be 8. So this suggests that my previous hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: Maybe the output is determined by the presence of a certain pattern. For example, maybe the output is 8 if there's at least one 8 in the grid, but that doesn't fit example 1, which has 8s and outputs 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the number of 8s and 2s in certain positions. For example, maybe if there's an even number of 8s and odd number of 2s, output 0. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is determined by the sum of the numbers in certain positions. For example, the sum of all elements. Let's check example 1's sum. Earlier, I calculated 64. Output is 0. Example 2's sum: let's see. Example 2's input is 7x7. Let's compute sum:\n\nRow 0: 0+8+0+0+0+0+0 = 8\nRow 1: 2+2+0+8+8+8+0 = 28\nRow 2: 2+2+8+8+0+2+2 = 24\nRow 3: 0+0+8+0+0+2+2 = 12\nRow 4: 0+8+0+0+8+0+0 = 16\nRow 5: 0+0+8+0+0+0+8 = 16\nTotal sum: 8+28=36, +24=60, +12=72, +16=88, +16=104. Output is 8. Not sure how that relates. Maybe the sum mod something. 104 mod 12 is 4, but output is 8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the maximum value in the grid. For example 1, the max is 8, but output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is based on the parity of the number of 8s and 2s. For example, if the number of 8s is even and the number of 2s is odd, output 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the presence of certain numbers in the grid. For example, if there's a 0 in the grid, output 0. But example 2's output is 8, which has 0s. So that can't be.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of each example, maybe the output is 0 if the number of 8s is even and 8 if odd. But example 3's count of 8s was 14 (even) but output is 8. That contradicts.\n\nHmm. Let me try to think of other possible patterns. Maybe the output is determined by the number of 8s in the grid. For example, if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, output 8. If the number of 8s is less than the number of 2s, output 0. If equal, output something else. But example 4's count of 8s is 15 and 2s is 10. So 15>10, output should be 8, but example 4's output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe there's a different condition. Let me check example 4's input again. The output is 0. Let me count the number of 8s and 2s again. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nExample 4's input is:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 0 0 2 2 0 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 1: 0 8 8 0 2 2 8 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 2: 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 \u2192 2 8s, 0 2s.\nRow 3: 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 1 8, 0 2s.\nRow 4: 0 2 2 0 8 0 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 5: 0 2 2 8 8 0 8 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 6: 0 0 8 2 2 0 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\n\nTotal 8s: 2+3+2+1+2+3+2 = 15. 2s: 2+2+0+0+2+2+2 = 10. So 15>10. Output is 0. So that contradicts the previous hypothesis.\n\nHmm. What's different about example 4? Maybe the output is based on the number of 8s and 2s in certain positions. For example, maybe the count of 8s in even rows and 2s in odd rows? Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the presence of 8s and 2s in certain positions. For example, if there's a 8 in the top-left corner, output 8, else 0. But example 1's top-left is 0, output is 0. Example 2's top-left is 0, output is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the outputs. The outputs are either 0 or 8. So maybe the output is determined by some condition that is true for some examples and not others.\n\nLooking at example 1: output is 0. Example 2: 8. Example 3: 8. Example 4: 0. Example 5: 8. Example 6: 0. So the outputs are 0 in examples 1,4,6 and 8 in others. Maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, and 0 otherwise. But example 4's count of 8s is 15, 2s is 10. So 15>10, output should be 8, but it's 0. So that can't be.\n\nWait, maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, but only if the number of 8s is odd. Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the difference between the counts. Like, if the difference is positive, output 8, else 0. But example 4's difference is 5, which is positive. Output is 0. So that's not.\n\nHmm. Let me look for other patterns. Maybe the output is determined by the presence of certain numbers in the grid. For example, if there's at least one 8 in the grid, output 8, but that doesn't fit example 1. Or if there's a 0 in the grid, output 0. But example 2 has 0s and outputs 8.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is determined by the number of 8s and 2s in the grid. For example, if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is even, output 0. Or some other combination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the sum of the counts of 8s and 2s. For example, if the sum is even, output 0, else 8. Let's check example 1: 6 8s and 10 2s. Sum is 16 even \u2192 output 0. Example 2: 11 8s and 10 2s. Sum 21, odd \u2192 output 8. Example 3: 14 8s and 8 2s \u2192 sum 22 even. Output is 8. So that doesn't fit. So that's not.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the output is based on the parity of the count of 8s. For example, if the count of 8s is even, output 0. If odd, output 8. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: 6 even \u2192 0. Correct. Example 2: 11 odd \u2192 8. Correct. Example 3: 14 even \u2192 output is 8. So that doesn't fit. So that's not.\n\nBut example 3's output is 8, but according to this hypothesis, it should be 0. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the parity of the count of 2s. Example 3 has 8 2s (even), output is 8. So that's not.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Let me think of other possible patterns.\n\nLooking at the examples, the output is 0 or 8. Maybe the output is 8 if there's at least one 8 in the grid and the number of 8s is odd, else 0. Let's see:\n\nExample 1: 6 8s (even), output 0. Correct. Example 2: 11 (odd), output 8. Correct. Example 3: 14 (even), output 8. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is odd and there's at least one 2. But example 3 has 14 8s (even), so output 8. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, and the number of 8s is odd. But example 3's 8s is 14 (even) but output is 8. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if there's at least one 8 in the grid and the number of 8s is not equal to the number of 2s. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: 6 8s, 10 2s. Not equal. Output 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is even. But example 3's 14 8s is even, but output is 8. So that's not.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the examples again.\n\nExample 1: output is 0. Let's think about the positions of the 8s. Maybe there's a specific pattern in their positions.\n\nExample 1's input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 8 0 8\nRow 1: 2 2 8 0 0\nRow 2: 2 2 0 0 8\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 2\nRow 4: 8 8 0 2 2\n\nThe 8s are at positions (0,2), (0,4), (1,2), (2,4), (4,0), (4,1). So six 8s. Maybe the output is 0 if the number of 8s is even and 8 if odd. But example 1's output is 0, which fits. Example 2's output is 8, which has 11 8s (odd). Example 3's output is 8, which has 14 8s (even). So that doesn't fit. But maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is odd, else 0. But example 3's output is 8, which is even. So that's not.\n\nWait, but example 3's output is 8. So maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is odd or even, but there's some other condition. Like, if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, then output 8, else 0. But example 4's count of 8s is 15, 2s is 10. So 15>10, output should be 8, but it's 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if there's at least one 8 in the grid, but that's not the case for example 1. So no.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is determined by the sum of the values in certain positions. For example, the sum of the top-left 2x2 square. Let's check example 1:\n\nTop-left 2x2 square is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2\nSum is 0+0+2+2 = 4. Output is 0. Not sure.\n\nExample 2's top-left 2x2 is 0,8,2,2. Sum is 0+8+2+2=12. Output is 8. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the values in the grid modulo something. For example, modulo 10. Let's check example 1's sum was 64. 64 mod 10 is 4, but output is 0. Not matching.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is determined by the presence of certain patterns in the grid. For example, if there's a 8 in the center, output 8. But example 1's center is 0. Output is 0. Example 2's center is 0, output is 8. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of 8s and 2s in the grid. For example, if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, output 8. If the number of 2s is greater, output 0. If equal, output something else. But example 4 has 15 8s and 10 2s, so output should be 8, but it's 0. So that's not.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I need to look for another pattern. Let's think about the examples where the output is 8.\n\nExample 2: 11 8s, 10 2s. Output is 8.\n\nExample 3: 14 8s, 8 2s. Output is 8.\n\nExample 5: let's check. Input is 7x7.\n\nRow 0: 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 \u2192 2 8s.\nRow 1: 0 0 2 2 0 8 0 \u2192 1 8.\nRow 2: 8 0 2 2 0 0 0 \u2192 1 8.\nRow 3: 0 0 8 0 0 8 0 \u2192 2 8s.\nRow 4: 0 0 8 2 2 0 8 \u2192 3 8s.\nRow 5: 8 0 0 2 2 8 0 \u2192 2 8s.\nTotal 8s: 2+1+1+2+3+2 = 11. 2s: let's count.\n\nRow 0: 0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 0 2s.\nRow 1: 0,0,2,2,0 \u2192 2 2s.\nRow 2: 0,0,2,2,0 \u2192 2 2s.\nRow 3: 0,0,8,0,0,8,0 \u2192 0 2s.\nRow 4: 0,0,8,2,2,0,8 \u2192 2 2s.\nRow 5: 0,0,0,2,2,0,0 \u2192 2 2s.\nTotal 2s: 0+2+2+0+2+2 = 8. So 8s is 11, which is greater than 2s (8). Output is 8. So this fits the hypothesis that if 8s > 2s, output 8. But example 4's count is 15 8s, 10 2s, but output is 0. So why is that?\n\nWait, maybe there's another condition. Like, if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is odd, output 8. Otherwise, 0. Let's check example 4's 8s is 15 (odd), 2s is 10. 15>10, and odd. Output should be 8, but example 4's output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the difference between the counts. If the difference is positive and even, output 0. If odd, output 8. But example 1's difference is 6-10 = -4 (even), output 0. Example 2: 11-10=1 (odd), output 8. Example 3: 14-8=6 (even), output 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe I need to think of other patterns. Maybe the output is determined by the presence of certain numbers in the grid. For example, if there's a 8 in the first row, output 8. But example 1 has 8s in first row, output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the number of 8s in the grid and the number of 2s in the grid. For example, if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is greater than 5, output 8. But example 4 has 15 8s, which is greater than 5, output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is greater than 10. But example 3 has 14, which is greater than 10. Output is 8. Example 4 has 15, output is 0. So that's not.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think of other patterns. Let's look at the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n\n2 2 8 8 0 8\n2 2 0 8 0 0\n8 8 0 0 0 8\n0 8 8 8 0 0\n8 0 8 0 0 8\n0 0 8 2 2 0\n8 0 0 2 2 0\n0 8 0 0 0 8\n\nThis is a 8x6 grid. Let's count the number of 8s and 2s.\n\nLet's count 8s:\n\nRow 0: 2,2,8,8,0,8 \u2192 3 8s.\nRow 1: 2,2,0,8,0,0 \u2192 1 8.\nRow 2: 8,8,0,0,0,8 \u2192 3 8s.\nRow 3: 0,8,8,8,0,0 \u2192 3 8s.\nRow 4: 8,0,8,0,0,8 \u2192 3 8s.\nRow 5: 0,0,8,2,2,0 \u2192 1 8.\nRow 6: 8,0,0,2,2,0 \u2192 1 8.\nRow 7: 0,8,0,0,0,8 \u2192 2 8s.\nTotal 8s: 3+1+3+3+3+1+1+2 = 17.\n\nCount of 2s:\n\nRow 0: 2,2 \u2192 2.\nRow 1: 2,2 \u2192 2.\nRow 2: 0,0,0 \u2192 0.\nRow 3: 0,8,8,8 \u2192 0.\nRow 4: 0,0,0 \u2192 0.\nRow 5: 2,2 \u2192 2.\nRow 6: 2,2 \u2192 2.\nRow 7: 0,8 \u2192 0.\nTotal 2s: 2+2+0+0+0+2+2+0 = 8.\n\nSo 17 8s, 8 2s. According to the earlier hypothesis (if 8s > 2s, output 8), the output should be 8. But I don't know what the actual output is. But the test input is just for context, and the task is to write the transformation function.\n\nBut since I can't know the test output, I need to base my hypothesis on the training examples.\n\nLet me try to think of another approach. Maybe the output is 8 if there's at least one 8 in the grid and the number of 8s is not equal to the number of 2s. But example 1 has 6 8s and 10 2s, which are not equal, output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is odd. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: 6 8s (even) and 10 2s. 6<10 \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 11 8s (odd), 10 2s. 11>10 \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nExample 3: 14 8s (even), 8 2s. 14>8 \u2192 output 8. But according to this hypothesis, since 14 is even, it should not be output 8. So this is not.\n\nBut example 3's output is 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, regardless of their parity. But example 4's count is 15 8s and 10 2s, which is greater, but output is 0. So that's not.\n\nWait, maybe the output is determined by the parity of the number of 8s and 2s. For example, if the number of 8s is even and the number of 2s is even, output 0. If one is even and the other is odd, output 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nExample 1: 6 8s (even), 10 2s (even) \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 11 (odd), 10 (even) \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nExample 3: 14 (even), 8 (even) \u2192 output 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the examples where the output is 0.\n\nExample 1: 6 8s, 10 2s. Output 0.\n\nExample 4: 15 8s, 10 2s. Output 0.\n\nExample 6: let's check. Input is 6x6 grid:\n\nRow 0: 8 0 0 2 2 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 1: 8 0 8 2 2 0 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 8 0 \u2192 1 8.\nRow 3: 2 2 8 0 0 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 4: 2 2 0 0 0 8 \u2192 1 8, 2 2s.\nRow 5: 0 8 8 0 8 0 \u2192 3 8s, 0 2s.\nTotal 8s: 2+2+1+2+1+3 = 11. 2s: 2+2+0+2+2+0 = 8. So 11>8. Output is 0. So why is this output 0?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe there's a different pattern. Maybe the output is 0 if the number of 8s is even, and 8 if it's odd. But example 4 has 15 8s (odd), output 0. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 if the number of 8s is even and 8 if it's odd, but only if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: 6 8s (even), 10 2s. 6<10 \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 11 (odd), 10 (even). 11>10 \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nExample 3: 14 (even), 8 (even). 14>8 \u2192 output 8. But according to this hypothesis, since 14 is even, output 0. So this is not.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should think of another approach. Let's think about the positions of the 8s and 2s in the examples.\n\nIn example 1, the 8s are in positions that form a certain pattern. Maybe the output is 0 if there's an even number of 8s in the grid and 8 if odd. But example 3 has 14 (even) and output 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if there's at least one 8 in the grid and the number of 8s is not equal to the number of 2s. But example 1 has 6 8s and 10 2s, which are not equal, but output is 0. So that's not.\n\nMaybe the output is determined by the number of 8s and 2s in the grid, but with some other condition. For example, if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, and the number of 8s is greater than 5, output 8. But example 4 has 15 8s, which is greater than 5, but output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the correct pattern is that the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, and 0 otherwise. Even though example 4 contradicts this, maybe I'm making a mistake in counting.\n\nLet me re-count example 4's 8s and 2s.\n\nExample 4's input:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 0 0 2 2 0 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 1: 0 8 8 0 2 2 8 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 2: 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 \u2192 2 8s, 0 2s.\nRow 3: 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 1 8, 0 2s.\nRow 4: 0 2 2 0 8 0 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 5: 0 2 2 8 8 0 8 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 6: 0 0 8 2 2 0 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\n\nTotal 8s: 2+3+2+1+2+3+2 = 15. 2s: 2+2+0+0+2+2+2 = 10. So 15>10, so according to the hypothesis, output should be 8. But the example says output is 0. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut why is example 4's output 0? Maybe there's another condition. Let's look at example 4's input. Maybe the output is 0 if there are more 8s than 2s and the number of 8s is even. But 15 is odd. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 0 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is even. But example 4 has 15 8s (odd), so output is 8. But example 4's output is 0. So that's not.\n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the outputs. The output is always 0 or 8. So maybe it's based on the presence of certain numbers in the grid. For example, if there's at least one 8 and at least one 2, output 8. But example 1 has both, output is 0. So that's not.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is based on the sum of all the 8s and 2s. For example, if the sum is even, output 0, else 8. Let's check example 1:\n\nSum of 8s is 6*8 = 48. Sum of 2s is 10*2 = 20. Total sum is 68. 68 is even \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 11 8s (11*8=88), 10 2s (10*2=20). Total 108. Even \u2192 output 8? No, example 2's output is 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is greater than 10. But example 4 has 15 8s, which is greater than 10, output is 0. So no.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples that fit most of them, even if it's not perfect. The most consistent pattern I've seen is that the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, else 0. Even though example 4 contradicts this, maybe I'm missing something in the counting.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in counting example 4. Let me re-count the 8s and 2s in example 4.\n\nExample 4's input is:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 0 0 2 2 0 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 1: 0 8 8 0 2 2 8 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 2: 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 \u2192 2 8s, 0 2s.\nRow 3: 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 1 8, 0 2s.\nRow 4: 0 2 2 0 8 0 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 5: 0 2 2 8 8 0 8 \u2192 3 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 6: 0 0 8 2 2 0 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\n\nTotal 8s: 2+3+2+1+2+3+2 = 15. 2s: 2+2+0+0+2+2+2 = 10. So 15 > 10. Output should be 8, but example 4's output is 0. So this is a contradiction.\n\nMaybe the pattern is not based on the count of 8s and 2s, but on something else. Let's think about the positions of the 8s and 2s.\n\nMaybe the output is 8 if there's at least one 8 in the grid and the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, and the number of 8s is not divisible by 3. But example 4 has 15 8s, which is divisible by 3. Output is 0. Example 2 has 11, which is not divisible by 3. Output is 8. Example 3 has 14, not divisible by 3. Output is 8. Example 1 has 6, divisible by 3. Output is 0. So this fits. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: 6 8s (divisible by 3) \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 11 not divisible by 3 \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nExample 3: 14 not divisible by 3 \u2192 output 8. Correct.\n\nExample 4: 15 divisible by 3 \u2192 output 0. Correct.\n\nExample 5: let's check. Example 5's input has 11 8s (not divisible by 3). Output is 8. Correct.\n\nExample 6: input has 11 8s (not divisible by 3), output is 0. Wait, example 6's output is 0. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nExample 6's input: let's count the 8s and 2s.\n\nExample 6's input is 6x6 grid:\n\nRow 0: 8 0 0 2 2 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 1: 8 0 8 2 2 0 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 8 0 \u2192 1 8.\nRow 3: 2 2 8 0 0 8 \u2192 2 8s, 2 2s.\nRow 4: 2 2 0 0 0 8 \u2192 1 8, 2 2s.\nRow 5: 0 8 8 0 8 0 \u2192 3 8s, 0 2s.\nTotal 8s: 2+2+1+2+1+3 = 11. 11 is not divisible by 3. Output is 0. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So this doesn't fit. But example 6's output is 0, but according to this hypothesis, it should be 8. So this is not.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and the examples I've checked, I think the most plausible pattern is that the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, and 0 otherwise. Even though example 4 contradicts this, perhaps I made a mistake in counting, or there's another condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is odd. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: 6 8s (even) \u2192 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 11 8s (odd) \u2192 8. Correct.\n\nExample 3: 14 8s (even) \u2192 0. But example 3's output is 8. So this is not.\n\nBut example 3's output is 8. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s, else 0. Even though it doesn't fit example 4, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nSo the code would count the number of 8s and 2s in the grid, and return 8 if 8s > 2s, else 0.\n\nLet's write the code for that.\n\nThe function will:\n\n- Iterate through all elements in the grid.\n- Count the number of 8s and 2s.\n- Compare the counts.\n- Return 8 if 8s > 2s, else 0.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    count_8 = 0\n    count_2 = 0\n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 8:\n                count_8 += 1\n            elif val == 2:\n                count_2 += 1\n    if count_8 > count_2:\n        return [[8]]\n    else:\n        return [[0]]\n\nBut let's check example 4. According to this code, it would return 8, but the example says 0. So this is a problem.\n\nBut perhaps the example is wrong, or I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAnother possibility: Maybe the output is 8 if the number of 8s is greater than the number of 2s and the number of 8s is odd. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: 6 8s (even) \u2192 0. Correct.\n\nExample 2: 11 (odd) \u2192 8. Correct.\n\nExample 3: 14 (even) \u2192 0. But example 3's output is 8. So this is not.\n\nBut example 3's output is 8, so this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis, even if it doesn't fit example 4. Perhaps there's a mistake in my counting for example 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of 8s and 2s in certain positions, like the first row or column.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the examples I've checked, I'll proceed with the code that counts 8s and 2s and returns 8 if 8s > 2s.\n"
