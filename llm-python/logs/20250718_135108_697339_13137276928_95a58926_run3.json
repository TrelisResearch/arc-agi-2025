          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a bunch of 0s and some numbers like 2,5. The output seems to have more 0s and 5s, but also some 2s. Wait, the output has a lot of 5s in certain positions. Let me check the input and output for that example.\n\nIn the input, the fifth row is all 2s and 5s. The output for that row is 5s and 2s. Wait, the output's fifth row is 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are changed based on their original values. \n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output seems to have 5s in certain positions. For instance, the first few rows of the output are all 0s except for the fifth column which is 5. But in the input, the fifth column has 0s and 5s. Wait, maybe the output is replacing certain positions with 5s based on some rule. \n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has a lot of 3s and 5s. The output seems to have 0s and 5s. For example, the first row of input is 0 0 3 0 0 5... and the output is 0 0 0 0 0 5... So maybe the output is replacing some numbers with 0s or 5s based on some condition. \n\nWait, looking at Example 2's output, the first row is all 0s except for the sixth column which is 5. The input's first row has a 3 in the third column and a 5 in the sixth. The output's sixth column is 5, but others are 0. Maybe the output is replacing certain positions with 5s if they meet a condition, and others with 0s. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is based on the positions of the numbers in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has 5s in certain positions where the input had 5s, but also some 2s. Wait, but in Example 1's input, the fifth row has 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5. The output's fifth row is 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5. So maybe the output is changing the 2s to 5s and vice versa? Or maybe it's some kind of transformation where certain positions are flipped. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain cells are set to 5 if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's fifth column is 5 in all rows except the fifth row, which has a 2. Wait, that's not consistent. \n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output: The input has a lot of 4s and 5s, and the output has 5s and 4s. For example, the first row of input is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 0 0 5 0 4 0 5. The output is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5. So the 4s in the input are replaced with 5s in the output. But why? \n\nWait, in the input, the fourth column is 4, and in the output, it's 5. Similarly, the eighth column in the input is 5, and in the output it's 5. So maybe the output is replacing 4s with 5s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output has a lot of 5s in the fifth column. Maybe the fifth column is being set to 5s in the output. But in the input, the fifth column has 0s and 5s. For example, in the first row of input, fifth column is 5. In the output, the fifth column is 5. But in the second row, input fifth column is 5, output fifth column is 5. Wait, maybe the fifth column is kept as is. But that doesn't explain the other changes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of transformation where certain cells are set to 5 if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's fifth row has a 2 in the fifth column. But that's not consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain cells are set to 5 if they are in even rows or columns, or something like that. \n\nAnother thought: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output has 5s in the fifth column. The input's fifth column has 5s in some positions. But the output's fifth column is all 5s. Wait, looking at the first row of input: fifth column is 5. Output's first row fifth column is 5. Second row's fifth column is 5, output fifth column is 5. Third row's fifth column is 2, output fifth column is 5. Hmm, that's not matching. \n\nWait, maybe the output is replacing certain values based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output's fifth column is 5 for all rows except the fifth row. But the fifth row's fifth column is 2 in the input, but in the output it's 2. Wait, that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain positions are set to 5 if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's fifth column is 5 in all rows. But in the input, the fifth column has 5s and 2s. So maybe the fifth column is being set to 5. But in the fifth row of the input, fifth column is 5. In the output, fifth row's fifth column is 2. So that's not matching. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me try to look for other patterns. \n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input's first row has 4 in the fourth column, and the output has 5 there. The input's fourth column is 4, and the output has 5. Similarly, in the input's eighth column, there's a 5, and the output has 5. But in the input's fourth column, there's a 4, and the output has 5. So maybe the output is replacing 4s with 5s in certain positions. \n\nBut why? Maybe the output is replacing all 4s with 5s. But in Example 2, the input has 3s and 5s, and the output has 0s and 5s. So that's not consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's set to 5. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the fifth column is all 5s. So maybe the fifth column is always 5. But in the input, the fifth column has 5s and 2s. So maybe the output is replacing all 2s in the fifth column with 5s. But that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of parity. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's fifth column is 2 in the input, but in the output it's 2. So that's not helpful. \n\nWait, looking at Example 3's output, the first row of output is all 5s in certain positions. The input's first row has 4s and 5s. The output's first row has 5s where the input had 4s. So maybe the output is replacing 4s with 5s. But in Example 2, the input has 3s and 5s. The output has 0s and 5s. So that's not the same. \n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output seems to have more 5s than the input. For instance, the output's fifth row has 5s in positions where the input had 5s. But the fifth row of the input has 2s and 5s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain cells are set to 5 if they are in certain positions. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the fifth column is all 5s. So maybe the fifth column is always 5. But in the input, the fifth column has 5s and 2s. So maybe the output is replacing all 2s in the fifth column with 5s. But in the fifth row of the input, the fifth column is 5. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain positions are set to 5 if the original value is 5, and 0 otherwise. But that's not the case in Example 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain cells are set to 5 if they are in certain positions. For example, in the fifth column, all cells are 5. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a transformation where the fifth column is always 5. Let's check Example 2. In Example 2, the output's fifth column is 5 in all rows. For example, the first row's fifth column is 0 in the input, but in the output it's 5. Wait, no. Wait, in Example 2's input, the first row is 0 0 3 0 0 5 3 3 0 3 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The fifth column (index 4?) is 0. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The fifth column is 0. But the output's sixth column is 5. So maybe the fifth column is being set to 5 in the output. Wait, but in Example 2's output, the fifth column is 0. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look for patterns in the output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the fifth column is all 5s. Let me check the input for that column. In the input, the fifth column is 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0. The output's fifth column is 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5. So the fifth column in the output is 5s except for the fifth row, which is 2. But in the input's fifth row, the fifth column is 5. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fifth column is being set to 5 in the output, but the fifth row's fifth column is 2. That doesn't fit. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, in the output, the fifth column is 5s except for certain rows. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a transformation where certain positions are set to 5 if the original value is 5, and 0 otherwise. But in Example 1, the output has some 2s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain positions are set to 5 if the original value is 5 or 2, and others are 0. But this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 3's input and output. The input's first row has 4 in the fourth column, and the output has 5. Similarly, the input's fourth column is 4, and the output has 5. So maybe the fourth column is being set to 5. But in the output, the fourth column is 5 for all rows. \n\nWait, in Example 3's output, the fourth column is 5 for all rows. So maybe the fourth column is always 5 in the output. But in the input, the fourth column has 4s and 5s. \n\nBut then, in Example 1's output, the fifth column is 5 for all rows. So maybe the fifth column is always 5. \n\nBut how to reconcile this with the input? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the position of the cell. For example, if the column is 5, set to 5. But that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain columns are set to 5. For example, column 5 (index 4?), but that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, in the output, the fifth column is 5. So maybe the fifth column is set to 5. \n\nBut how to handle the fifth row's fifth column in Example 1. In the input, the fifth row's fifth column is 5. In the output, it's 2. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain positions are set to 5 if they are in certain rows or columns. \n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the transformation that maps the input to output for all examples. \n\nIn Example 1, the output's fifth column is 5 in all rows. So maybe the fifth column is set to 5. \n\nIn Example 2, the output's fifth column is 5 in all rows. Wait, no. Let me check Example 2's input and output. \n\nExample 2's input is a 19x13 grid. The output is also 19x13. Looking at the first row of input, the fifth column is 0. The output's first row has 0 in the fifth column. But the sixth column is 5. So maybe the sixth column is being set to 5. \n\nWait, in Example 2's output, the sixth column is 5 in all rows. For example, the first row's sixth column is 5. The second row's sixth column is 5. So maybe the sixth column is being set to 5. \n\nBut then, in Example 1's output, the fifth column is 5. So maybe the fifth column is being set to 5. \n\nThis suggests that for each example, the output has a certain column set to 5. \n\nBut how to determine which column. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the fifth column is 5. Example 2's output, the sixth column is 5. Example 3's output, the fourth column is 5. \n\nWait, this seems inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's fifth column is 5. In Example 2, the sixth column is 5. In Example 3, the fourth column is 5. \n\nBut how to find a pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's positions. For example, in Example 1, the fifth column is 5. In Example 2, the sixth column is 5. In Example 3, the fourth column is 5. \n\nThis seems like a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, then the output is 5. Otherwise, it's 0. \n\nBut in Example 1's output, there are 2s. So that's not the case. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is a transformation where certain positions are set to 5 if the original value is 5 or 2, and others are 0. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 3's output, the first row has 5s in certain positions. The input's first row has 4s and 5s. So maybe the output is replacing 4s with 5s. \n\nBut why would that happen? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's set to 5. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 3, the first row has 5s in the fourth, eighth, and other columns. The input's first row has 4s in the fourth and eighth columns. So maybe the output is replacing 4s with 5s. \n\nBut in Example 2, the input has 3s and 5s, and the output has 0s and 5s. So maybe the output is replacing 3s with 0s. \n\nThis seems possible. \n\nSo, perhaps the transformation is: \n\n- For each cell, if the original value is 5, keep it as 5. \n- If the original value is 4, replace with 5. \n- If the original value is 3, replace with 0. \n- Other values are replaced with 0. \n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. \n\nLet me check if this fits with the examples. \n\nExample 1: The input has 2s and 5s. The output has 5s and 2s. But according to this hypothesis, 2s would be replaced with 0. But in the output, there are 2s. So this is not correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, the output is a transformation where certain positions are set to 5 if the original value is 5 or 2, and others are 0. \n\nBut again, this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the fifth column is 5 in all rows except the fifth row. But in the fifth row of the input, the fifth column is 5. So maybe the fifth column is set to 5, but the fifth row's fifth column is 2. \n\nThis doesn't fit. \n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is a transformation where the fifth column is set to 5, and the fifth row's fifth column is set to 2. But this seems arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, set to 5; if it's 2, set to 5; if it's 0, set to 0. \n\nBut this would not explain the outputs in the examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's set to 5. \n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the fifth column is all 5s. So maybe the fifth column is always 5. \n\nIn Example 2's output, the sixth column is all 5s. \n\nIn Example 3's output, the fourth column is all 5s. \n\nThis seems inconsistent, but maybe there's a pattern. For example, in Example 1, the fifth column is 5. In Example 2, the sixth column is 5. In Example 3, the fourth column is 5. \n\nBut this doesn't form a clear pattern. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, then the output is 5. If it's 0, then the output is 0. Otherwise, it's 5. \n\nBut this would not explain the 2s in the output of Example 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, the output is the original grid with 5s in certain positions and 0s in others. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to tell. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different pattern. \n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the fifth row's fifth column is 2. In the input, the fifth row's fifth column is 5. So this suggests that the fifth row's fifth column is not changed. \n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the fifth row's fifth column is 2, which is the same as the input's fifth row's fifth column. \n\nWait, no. In the input's fifth row, the fifth column is 5. In the output's fifth row, the fifth column is 2. So that's not the case. \n\nThis is getting me stuck. Maybe I should look for other patterns. \n\nLooking at the output of Example 3, the first row has 5s in the fourth, eighth, and other columns. The input's first row has 4 in the fourth column and 5 in the eighth. So the output replaces 4 with 5. \n\nIn the input's first row, the fourth column is 4, and the output's fourth column is 5. So maybe the output is replacing 4s with 5s in certain positions. \n\nIn Example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions. For example, the fifth row's fifth column is 2. But in the input, that position is 5. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, set to 5; if it's 2, set to 5; if it's 0, set to 0. But this would not explain the 2s in the output. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is based on the original grid's values, but with certain positions replaced. For example, in Example 1, the fifth column is set to 5. In Example 2, the sixth column is set to 5. In Example 3, the fourth column is set to 5. \n\nBut this is not consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the fifth column is set to 5. In Example 2, the sixth column is set to 5. In Example 3, the fourth column is set to 5. \n\nBut this seems arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, the output is the original grid with all 5s in the fifth column, but this doesn't fit the other examples. \n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. Maybe I should look for another approach. \n\nLooking at the output of Example 3, the first row of output is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5. The input's first row is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 0 0 5 0 4 0 5. So the fourth, eighth, twelfth, sixteenth, and twentieth columns are 5 in the output. \n\nThe input's fourth column is 4, which is replaced with 5. The eighth column is 5, which is kept. The twelfth column is 5, kept. The sixteenth is 5, kept. The twentieth is 5, kept. \n\nSo maybe the output is replacing 4s with 5s in certain columns. \n\nBut why those columns? \n\nIn the input's first row, the fourth column is 4, and the output's fourth column is 5. The input's twentieth column is 5, and the output's twentieth column is 5. \n\nSo maybe the output is replacing 4s with 5s in certain positions. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns. For example, if the column is even, set to 5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain rows. \n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of a different approach. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace certain values with 5s and others with 0s based on their positions. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's set to 5. \n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, it's kept. Otherwise, it's set to 5 if it's in a certain column, or 0 otherwise. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that fits all examples. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the fifth column is 5. Example 2's output, the sixth column is 5. Example 3's output, the fourth column is 5. \n\nThis suggests that the output has a column set to 5, but which column varies between examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, in the output, the fifth column is 5, but in the input, the fifth column has 5s and 2s. \n\nBut how to determine which column to set to 5. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns. For example, the output is the original grid with certain columns replaced with 5s. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven that I'm not making progress, perhaps I should try to code a function that replaces certain values based on their position. For example, replace all 4s with 5s, replace all 3s with 0s, and others with 0. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in the fifth column, set to 5. \n\nBut this would explain Example 1's output, but not others. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain rows and columns. For example, if the row is even or odd, set to 5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. \n\nLooking at Example 1, the output has 5s in the fifth column. Example 2's output has 5s in the sixth column. Example 3's output has 5s in the fourth column. \n\nThis suggests that the output is setting a certain column to 5, but which column varies. \n\nBut how to determine which column to set. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the column is determined by the input's row. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row has a certain pattern. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, set to 5. If it's 0, set to 0. If it's 2, set to 5. \n\nThis would explain some of the examples. \n\nIn Example 1, the output has 5s and 2s. \n\nBut in Example 2, the output has 0s and 5s. So this is not consistent. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a best guess based on the examples. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace all 4s with 5s, replace all 3s with 0s, and leave others as is. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, set to 5. If it's 2, set to 5. If it's 0, set to 0. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain values based on the examples. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 5s in the fifth column. So maybe the fifth column is set to 5. \n\nIn Example 2, the sixth column is set to 5. \n\nIn Example 3, the fourth column is set to 5. \n\nBut how to determine which column to set. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns. For example, the fifth column is set to 5 in Example 1, the sixth in Example 2, and the fourth in Example 3. \n\nBut this is not consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain rows. \n\nBut without more information, I'm not sure. \n\nPerhaps the best approach is to assume that the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns, and that the column is determined by some pattern. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the fifth column is set to 5. In Example 2, the sixth column is set to 5. In Example 3, the fourth column is set to 5. \n\nThis suggests that the column is determined by the row number. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row has a certain pattern, but this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns, and the column is determined by the row's index. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain values based on the examples. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 5s in the fifth column. So perhaps the fifth column is set to 5. \n\nIn Example 2, the sixth column is set to 5. \n\nIn Example 3, the fourth column is set to 5. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns, and the column is determined by the row's index. For example, in row 0, set column 4 to 5. In row 1, set column 5 to 5. In row 2, set column 3 to 5. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with a function that replaces certain values based on the examples. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 5s in the fifth column. So perhaps the fifth column is set to 5. \n\nSo, for each row, the fifth column is set to 5. \n\nBut in Example 2's output, the sixth column is set to 5. \n\nThis suggests that the column varies between examples. \n\nBut since the test input has a 19x13 grid, perhaps the column is determined by some rule. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in column 5 (index 4), set to 5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that, I'll write a function that sets the fifth column (index 4) to 5 for all rows. \n\nBut this would not explain Example 2 and 3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns, and the column is determined by the row number. For example, in row i, set column i to 5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain values based on the examples. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the fifth column is 5. So perhaps the fifth column is set to 5. \n\nIn Example 2's output, the sixth column is 5. \n\nIn Example 3's output, the fourth column is 5. \n\nThis suggests that the column is determined by the example. \n\nBut since I can't determine the pattern, I'll proceed to write a function that sets the fifth column to 5. \n\nBut this is not correct for other examples. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns. For example, if the original value is 5, set to 5. If it's 0, set to 0. If it's 2, set to 5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that, I'll write a function that replaces all 2s with 5s and 4s with 5s. \n\nBut this is not based on any clear pattern. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, set to 5. If it's 0, set to 0. If it's 2, set to 5. \n\nThis would explain some of the examples. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 5s and 2s. So 2s are kept. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision and write a function based on the examples. \n\nGiven that, I'll assume that the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the fifth column is set to 5. In Example 2, the sixth column is set to 5. In Example 3, the fourth column is set to 5. \n\nBut how to determine which column to set. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain rows. For example, the fifth row is set to 5 in certain columns. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces all 4s with 5s and 3s with 0s. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, set to 5. If it's 0, set to 0. If it's 2, set to 5. \n\nThis would explain some of the examples. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 4s with 5s, 3s with 0s, and leaves others as is. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nSo the function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 4:\n                new_row.append(5)\n            elif val == 3:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not work for all examples. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input has 2s, which would be left as is. But the output has 2s. So this would be correct. \n\nIn Example 2, the input has 3s, which would be replaced with 0. The output has 0s in some positions. \n\nIn Example 3, the input has 4s, which are replaced with 5s. This matches the output. \n\nSo this might be the correct pattern. \n\nLet me check Example 1's input and output. \n\nExample 1's input has 2s and 5s. The output has 5s and 2s. So 2s are left as is, which matches. \n\nExample 2's input has 3s and 5s. The output has 0s and 5s. So 3s are replaced with 0s. \n\nExample 3's input has 4s and 5s. The output has 5s and 5s. So 4s are replaced with 5s. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nSo this is a possible pattern. \n\nBut what about other values like 0, 1, 2, etc.? \n\nIn Example 1's output, there are 0s and 5s. So the function would leave 0s as is. \n\nIn Example 2's output, there are 0s and 5s. \n\nSo this function might work. \n\nBut what about the test input? \n\nThe test input has 0s, 1s, 5s, etc. \n\nBut according to this function, 4s are replaced with 5s, 3s with 0s, others are left as is. \n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the correct pattern. \n\nBut given the examples, this seems to be the best guess. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 4:\n                new_row.append(5)\n            elif val == 3:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, the output of Example 1 has 2s, which are not changed. So this function would leave them as is. \n\nBut what about the fifth column in Example 1? It has 5s and 2s. The output has 5s and 2s. So this function would leave them as is. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nBut what about Example 2's output? Let's check. \n\nExample 2's input has 3s, which are replaced with 0s. The output has 0s in those positions. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this function might be the correct one. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nBut given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this function.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a bunch of 0s and some numbers like 2,5. The output seems to have more 0s and 5s, but also some 2s. Wait, the output has a lot of 5s in certain positions. Let me check the input and output for that example.\n\nIn the input, the fifth row is all 2s and 5s. The output for that row is 5s and 2s. Wait, the output's fifth row is 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are changed based on their original values. \n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output seems to have 5s in certain positions. For instance, the first few rows of the output are all 0s except for the fifth column which is 5. But in the input, the fifth column has 0s and 5s. Wait, maybe the output is replacing certain positions with 5s based on some rule. \n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has a lot of 3s and 5s. The output seems to have 0s and 5s. For example, the first row of input is 0 0 3 0 0 5... and the output is 0 0 0 0 0 5... So maybe the output is replacing some numbers with 0s or 5s based on some condition. \n\nWait, looking at Example 2's output, the first row is all 0s except for the sixth column which is 5. The input's first row has a 3 in the third column and a 5 in the sixth. The output's sixth column is 5, but others are 0. Maybe the output is replacing certain positions with 5s if they meet a condition, and others with 0s. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is based on the positions of the numbers in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has 5s in certain positions where the input had 5s, but also some 2s. Wait, but in Example 1's input, the fifth row has 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5. The output's fifth row is 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5 5 2 5 5 5. So maybe the output is changing the 2s to 5s and vice versa? Or maybe it's some kind of transformation where certain positions are flipped. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain cells are set to 5 if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's fifth column is 5 in all rows except the fifth row, which has a 2. Wait, that's not consistent. \n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output: The input has a lot of 4s and 5s, and the output has 5s and 4s. For example, the first row of input is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 0 0 5 0 4 0 5. The output is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5. So the 4s in the input are replaced with 5s in the output. But why? \n\nWait, in the input, the fourth column is 4, and in the output, it's 5. Similarly, the eighth column in the input is 5, and in the output it's 5. So maybe the output is replacing 4s with 5s in certain positions. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output has a lot of 5s in the fifth column. Maybe the fifth column is being set to 5s in the output. But in the input, the fifth column has 0s and 5s. For example, in the first row of input, fifth column is 5. In the output, the fifth column is 5. But in the second row, input fifth column is 5, output fifth column is 5. Wait, maybe the fifth column is kept as is. But that doesn't explain the other changes. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of transformation where certain cells are set to 5 if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's fifth row has a 2 in the fifth column. But that's not consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain cells are set to 5 if they are in even rows or columns, or something like that. \n\nAnother thought: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output has 5s in the fifth column. The input's fifth column has 5s in some positions. But the output's fifth column is all 5s. Wait, looking at the first row of input: fifth column is 5. Output's first row fifth column is 5. Second row's fifth column is 5, output fifth column is 5. Third row's fifth column is 2, output fifth column is 5. Hmm, that's not matching. \n\nWait, maybe the output is replacing certain values based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the output's fifth column is 5 for all rows except the fifth row. But the fifth row's fifth column is 2 in the input, but in the output it's 2. Wait, that's not helpful. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain positions are set to 5 if they are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's fifth column is 5 in all rows. But in the input, the fifth column has 5s and 2s. So maybe the fifth column is being set to 5. But in the fifth row of the input, fifth column is 5. In the output, fifth row's fifth column is 2. So that's not matching. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me try to look for other patterns. \n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input's first row has 4 in the fourth column, and the output has 5 there. The input's fourth column is 4, and the output has 5. Similarly, in the input's eighth column, there's a 5, and the output has 5. But in the input's fourth column, there's a 4, and the output has 5. So maybe the output is replacing 4s with 5s in certain positions. \n\nBut why? Maybe the output is replacing all 4s with 5s. But in Example 2, the input has 3s and 5s, and the output has 0s and 5s. So that's not consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's set to 5. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the fifth column is all 5s. So maybe the fifth column is always 5. But in the input, the fifth column has 5s and 2s. So maybe the output is replacing all 2s in the fifth column with 5s. But that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on some kind of parity. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row's fifth column is 2 in the input, but in the output it's 2. So that's not helpful. \n\nWait, looking at Example 3's output, the first row of output is all 5s in certain positions. The input's first row has 4s and 5s. The output's first row has 5s where the input had 4s. So maybe the output is replacing 4s with 5s. But in Example 2, the input has 3s and 5s. The output has 0s and 5s. So that's not the same. \n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output seems to have more 5s than the input. For instance, the output's fifth row has 5s in positions where the input had 5s. But the fifth row of the input has 2s and 5s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain cells are set to 5 if they are in certain positions. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the fifth column is all 5s. So maybe the fifth column is always 5. But in the input, the fifth column has 5s and 2s. So maybe the output is replacing all 2s in the fifth column with 5s. But in the fifth row of the input, the fifth column is 5. So that's not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain positions are set to 5 if the original value is 5, and 0 otherwise. But that's not the case in Example 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain cells are set to 5 if they are in certain positions. For example, in the fifth column, all cells are 5. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a transformation where the fifth column is always 5. Let's check Example 2. In Example 2, the output's fifth column is 5 in all rows. For example, the first row's fifth column is 0 in the input, but in the output it's 5. Wait, no. Wait, in Example 2's input, the first row is 0 0 3 0 0 5 3 3 0 3 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The fifth column (index 4?) is 0. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The fifth column is 0. But the output's sixth column is 5. So maybe the fifth column is being set to 5 in the output. Wait, but in Example 2's output, the fifth column is 0. \n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look for patterns in the output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the fifth column is all 5s. Let me check the input for that column. In the input, the fifth column is 2, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 0. The output's fifth column is 5, 5, 5, 5, 2, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5. So the fifth column in the output is 5s except for the fifth row, which is 2. But in the input's fifth row, the fifth column is 5. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the fifth column is being set to 5 in the output, but the fifth row's fifth column is 2. That doesn't fit. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, in the output, the fifth column is 5s except for certain rows. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a transformation where certain positions are set to 5 if the original value is 5, and 0 otherwise. But in Example 1, the output has some 2s. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain positions are set to 5 if the original value is 5 or 2, and others are 0. But this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 3's input and output. The input's first row has 4 in the fourth column, and the output has 5. Similarly, the input's fourth column is 4, and the output has 5. So maybe the fourth column is being set to 5. But in the output, the fourth column is 5 for all rows. \n\nWait, in Example 3's output, the fourth column is 5 for all rows. So maybe the fourth column is always 5 in the output. But in the input, the fourth column has 4s and 5s. \n\nBut then, in Example 1's output, the fifth column is 5 for all rows. So maybe the fifth column is always 5. \n\nBut how to reconcile this with the input? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the position of the cell. For example, if the column is 5, set to 5. But that's not possible. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain columns are set to 5. For example, column 5 (index 4?), but that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, in the output, the fifth column is 5. So maybe the fifth column is set to 5. \n\nBut how to handle the fifth row's fifth column in Example 1. In the input, the fifth row's fifth column is 5. In the output, it's 2. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain positions are set to 5 if they are in certain rows or columns. \n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the transformation that maps the input to output for all examples. \n\nIn Example 1, the output's fifth column is 5 in all rows. So maybe the fifth column is set to 5. \n\nIn Example 2, the output's fifth column is 5 in all rows. Wait, no. Let me check Example 2's input and output. \n\nExample 2's input is a 19x13 grid. The output is also 19x13. Looking at the first row of input, the fifth column is 0. The output's first row has 0 in the fifth column. But the sixth column is 5. So maybe the sixth column is being set to 5. \n\nWait, in Example 2's output, the sixth column is 5 in all rows. For example, the first row's sixth column is 5. The second row's sixth column is 5. So maybe the sixth column is being set to 5. \n\nBut then, in Example 1's output, the fifth column is 5. So maybe the fifth column is being set to 5. \n\nThis suggests that for each example, the output has a certain column set to 5. \n\nBut how to determine which column. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the fifth column is 5. Example 2's output, the sixth column is 5. Example 3's output, the fourth column is 5. \n\nWait, this seems inconsistent. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's fifth column is 5. In Example 2, the sixth column is 5. In Example 3, the fourth column is 5. \n\nBut how to find a pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's positions. For example, in Example 1, the fifth column is 5. In Example 2, the sixth column is 5. In Example 3, the fourth column is 5. \n\nThis seems like a stretch. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, then the output is 5. Otherwise, it's 0. \n\nBut in Example 1's output, there are 2s. So that's not the case. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is a transformation where certain positions are set to 5 if the original value is 5 or 2, and others are 0. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 3's output, the first row has 5s in certain positions. The input's first row has 4s and 5s. So maybe the output is replacing 4s with 5s. \n\nBut why would that happen? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's set to 5. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 3, the first row has 5s in the fourth, eighth, and other columns. The input's first row has 4s in the fourth and eighth columns. So maybe the output is replacing 4s with 5s. \n\nBut in Example 2, the input has 3s and 5s, and the output has 0s and 5s. So maybe the output is replacing 3s with 0s. \n\nThis seems possible. \n\nSo, perhaps the transformation is: \n\n- For each cell, if the original value is 5, keep it as 5. \n- If the original value is 4, replace with 5. \n- If the original value is 3, replace with 0. \n- Other values are replaced with 0. \n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. \n\nLet me check if this fits with the examples. \n\nExample 1: The input has 2s and 5s. The output has 5s and 2s. But according to this hypothesis, 2s would be replaced with 0. But in the output, there are 2s. So this is not correct. \n\nHmm. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, the output is a transformation where certain positions are set to 5 if the original value is 5 or 2, and others are 0. \n\nBut again, this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the fifth column is 5 in all rows except the fifth row. But in the fifth row of the input, the fifth column is 5. So maybe the fifth column is set to 5, but the fifth row's fifth column is 2. \n\nThis doesn't fit. \n\nAnother approach: Maybe the output is a transformation where the fifth column is set to 5, and the fifth row's fifth column is set to 2. But this seems arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, set to 5; if it's 2, set to 5; if it's 0, set to 0. \n\nBut this would not explain the outputs in the examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's set to 5. \n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the fifth column is all 5s. So maybe the fifth column is always 5. \n\nIn Example 2's output, the sixth column is all 5s. \n\nIn Example 3's output, the fourth column is all 5s. \n\nThis seems inconsistent, but maybe there's a pattern. For example, in Example 1, the fifth column is 5. In Example 2, the sixth column is 5. In Example 3, the fourth column is 5. \n\nBut this doesn't form a clear pattern. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, then the output is 5. If it's 0, then the output is 0. Otherwise, it's 5. \n\nBut this would not explain the 2s in the output of Example 1. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, the output is the original grid with 5s in certain positions and 0s in others. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to tell. \n\nPerhaps I should look for a different pattern. \n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the fifth row's fifth column is 2. In the input, the fifth row's fifth column is 5. So this suggests that the fifth row's fifth column is not changed. \n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the fifth row's fifth column is 2, which is the same as the input's fifth row's fifth column. \n\nWait, no. In the input's fifth row, the fifth column is 5. In the output's fifth row, the fifth column is 2. So that's not the case. \n\nThis is getting me stuck. Maybe I should look for other patterns. \n\nLooking at the output of Example 3, the first row has 5s in the fourth, eighth, and other columns. The input's first row has 4 in the fourth column and 5 in the eighth. So the output replaces 4 with 5. \n\nIn the input's first row, the fourth column is 4, and the output's fourth column is 5. So maybe the output is replacing 4s with 5s in certain positions. \n\nIn Example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions. For example, the fifth row's fifth column is 2. But in the input, that position is 5. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, set to 5; if it's 2, set to 5; if it's 0, set to 0. But this would not explain the 2s in the output. \n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is based on the original grid's values, but with certain positions replaced. For example, in Example 1, the fifth column is set to 5. In Example 2, the sixth column is set to 5. In Example 3, the fourth column is set to 5. \n\nBut this is not consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the fifth column is set to 5. In Example 2, the sixth column is set to 5. In Example 3, the fourth column is set to 5. \n\nBut this seems arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, the output is the original grid with all 5s in the fifth column, but this doesn't fit the other examples. \n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. Maybe I should look for another approach. \n\nLooking at the output of Example 3, the first row of output is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5. The input's first row is 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 4 0 0 5 0 4 0 5. So the fourth, eighth, twelfth, sixteenth, and twentieth columns are 5 in the output. \n\nThe input's fourth column is 4, which is replaced with 5. The eighth column is 5, which is kept. The twelfth column is 5, kept. The sixteenth is 5, kept. The twentieth is 5, kept. \n\nSo maybe the output is replacing 4s with 5s in certain columns. \n\nBut why those columns? \n\nIn the input's first row, the fourth column is 4, and the output's fourth column is 5. The input's twentieth column is 5, and the output's twentieth column is 5. \n\nSo maybe the output is replacing 4s with 5s in certain positions. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns. For example, if the column is even, set to 5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain rows. \n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of a different approach. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace certain values with 5s and others with 0s based on their positions. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's set to 5. \n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, it's kept. Otherwise, it's set to 5 if it's in a certain column, or 0 otherwise. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that fits all examples. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the fifth column is 5. Example 2's output, the sixth column is 5. Example 3's output, the fourth column is 5. \n\nThis suggests that the output has a column set to 5, but which column varies between examples. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, in the output, the fifth column is 5, but in the input, the fifth column has 5s and 2s. \n\nBut how to determine which column to set to 5. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns. For example, the output is the original grid with certain columns replaced with 5s. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven that I'm not making progress, perhaps I should try to code a function that replaces certain values based on their position. For example, replace all 4s with 5s, replace all 3s with 0s, and others with 0. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in the fifth column, set to 5. \n\nBut this would explain Example 1's output, but not others. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain rows and columns. For example, if the row is even or odd, set to 5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. \n\nLooking at Example 1, the output has 5s in the fifth column. Example 2's output has 5s in the sixth column. Example 3's output has 5s in the fourth column. \n\nThis suggests that the output is setting a certain column to 5, but which column varies. \n\nBut how to determine which column to set. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the column is determined by the input's row. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row has a certain pattern. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, set to 5. If it's 0, set to 0. If it's 2, set to 5. \n\nThis would explain some of the examples. \n\nIn Example 1, the output has 5s and 2s. \n\nBut in Example 2, the output has 0s and 5s. So this is not consistent. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a best guess based on the examples. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace all 4s with 5s, replace all 3s with 0s, and leave others as is. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, set to 5. If it's 2, set to 5. If it's 0, set to 0. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain values based on the examples. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 5s in the fifth column. So maybe the fifth column is set to 5. \n\nIn Example 2, the sixth column is set to 5. \n\nIn Example 3, the fourth column is set to 5. \n\nBut how to determine which column to set. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns. For example, the fifth column is set to 5 in Example 1, the sixth in Example 2, and the fourth in Example 3. \n\nBut this is not consistent. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain rows. \n\nBut without more information, I'm not sure. \n\nPerhaps the best approach is to assume that the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns, and that the column is determined by some pattern. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the fifth column is set to 5. In Example 2, the sixth column is set to 5. In Example 3, the fourth column is set to 5. \n\nThis suggests that the column is determined by the row number. For example, in Example 1, the fifth row has a certain pattern, but this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns, and the column is determined by the row's index. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain values based on the examples. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 5s in the fifth column. So perhaps the fifth column is set to 5. \n\nIn Example 2, the sixth column is set to 5. \n\nIn Example 3, the fourth column is set to 5. \n\nBut how to generalize this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns, and the column is determined by the row's index. For example, in row 0, set column 4 to 5. In row 1, set column 5 to 5. In row 2, set column 3 to 5. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven that I can't find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with a function that replaces certain values based on the examples. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 5s in the fifth column. So perhaps the fifth column is set to 5. \n\nSo, for each row, the fifth column is set to 5. \n\nBut in Example 2's output, the sixth column is set to 5. \n\nThis suggests that the column varies between examples. \n\nBut since the test input has a 19x13 grid, perhaps the column is determined by some rule. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the cell is in column 5 (index 4), set to 5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that, I'll write a function that sets the fifth column (index 4) to 5 for all rows. \n\nBut this would not explain Example 2 and 3. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns, and the column is determined by the row number. For example, in row i, set column i to 5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces certain values based on the examples. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the fifth column is 5. So perhaps the fifth column is set to 5. \n\nIn Example 2's output, the sixth column is 5. \n\nIn Example 3's output, the fourth column is 5. \n\nThis suggests that the column is determined by the example. \n\nBut since I can't determine the pattern, I'll proceed to write a function that sets the fifth column to 5. \n\nBut this is not correct for other examples. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns. For example, if the original value is 5, set to 5. If it's 0, set to 0. If it's 2, set to 5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that, I'll write a function that replaces all 2s with 5s and 4s with 5s. \n\nBut this is not based on any clear pattern. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, set to 5. If it's 0, set to 0. If it's 2, set to 5. \n\nThis would explain some of the examples. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 5s and 2s. So 2s are kept. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision and write a function based on the examples. \n\nGiven that, I'll assume that the output is based on the original grid's values in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the fifth column is set to 5. In Example 2, the sixth column is set to 5. In Example 3, the fourth column is set to 5. \n\nBut how to determine which column to set. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain rows. For example, the fifth row is set to 5 in certain columns. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces all 4s with 5s and 3s with 0s. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original grid's values in certain positions. For example, if the original value is 5, set to 5. If it's 0, set to 0. If it's 2, set to 5. \n\nThis would explain some of the examples. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven that, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 4s with 5s, 3s with 0s, and leaves others as is. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nSo the function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 4:\n                new_row.append(5)\n            elif val == 3:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not work for all examples. \n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input has 2s, which would be left as is. But the output has 2s. So this would be correct. \n\nIn Example 2, the input has 3s, which would be replaced with 0. The output has 0s in some positions. \n\nIn Example 3, the input has 4s, which are replaced with 5s. This matches the output. \n\nSo this might be the correct pattern. \n\nLet me check Example 1's input and output. \n\nExample 1's input has 2s and 5s. The output has 5s and 2s. So 2s are left as is, which matches. \n\nExample 2's input has 3s and 5s. The output has 0s and 5s. So 3s are replaced with 0s. \n\nExample 3's input has 4s and 5s. The output has 5s and 5s. So 4s are replaced with 5s. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nSo this is a possible pattern. \n\nBut what about other values like 0, 1, 2, etc.? \n\nIn Example 1's output, there are 0s and 5s. So the function would leave 0s as is. \n\nIn Example 2's output, there are 0s and 5s. \n\nSo this function might work. \n\nBut what about the test input? \n\nThe test input has 0s, 1s, 5s, etc. \n\nBut according to this function, 4s are replaced with 5s, 3s with 0s, others are left as is. \n\nBut I'm not sure if this is the correct pattern. \n\nBut given the examples, this seems to be the best guess. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 4:\n                new_row.append(5)\n            elif val == 3:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, the output of Example 1 has 2s, which are not changed. So this function would leave them as is. \n\nBut what about the fifth column in Example 1? It has 5s and 2s. The output has 5s and 2s. So this function would leave them as is. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nBut what about Example 2's output? Let's check. \n\nExample 2's input has 3s, which are replaced with 0s. The output has 0s in those positions. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this function might be the correct one. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nBut given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this function.\n"
