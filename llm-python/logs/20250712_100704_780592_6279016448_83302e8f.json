          "Let's analyze the transformations in the provided examples to infer a pattern:\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input: Black background with light blue crosses and a horizontal bar, then a line of a different color replacing some of these structures.\n- Output: The pattern shifts colors from blue to a higher number (3 or 4), and the shapes seem to be \"colored over\" with new colors, possibly indicating labeling or color translation.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input: Random black layout with white lines and filled regions.\n- Output: The main structure remains, but the colors are replaced or layered into different values, indicating a pattern of color substitution based on region structure.\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Input: Patterns with '9's creating a grid pattern.\n- Output: Again, structure remains but coloring is changed, with some regions shifted to new values.\n\n**General Pattern Inference:**\n- The transformation appears to be a **color remapping** or a **label replacement** based on the shapes and regions.\n- The shapes (such as lines or crosses) tend to be preserved in structure but are recolored.\n- The constant grid size is 24\u00d724, which is maintained.\n- The test input has a repeating pattern of '5's forming vertical and horizontal lines with some zeros, and the output seems to replace or recolor these.\n\n**Based on the above and the last test case:**\n- The pattern could involve replacing certain values (like 0 and 5) with new values, possibly depending on their position or neighboring pixels, or simply by a fixed color mapping.\n\n---\n\n### Approach:\n- For the test input, the pattern resembles the training examples: black background, lines of a certain value.\n- The pattern might involve:\n  - Replacing '0' with a new value, say, '4' (a new color),\n  - And replacing '5' with another value, say, '9' (comparing the previous outputs),\n  - Keeping the structure but updating the color.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Plan:\n- Since the opponent pattern is not fully certain, I will implement a plausible transformation:\n  - Replace all '0's with '4's.\n  - Replace all '5's with '9's.\n  - Keep other values unchanged.\n- This matches the general pattern from the training examples where numbers are remapped but structure preserved.\n\n---\n\nHere is the final code:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    # Create a copy to avoid mutating input\n    result = grid.copy()\n\n    # Example transformation based on observed pattern:\n    # Replace 0 with 4\n    result[result == 0] = 4\n\n    # Replace 5 with 9\n    result[result == 5] = 9\n\n    # Return as list of list\n    return result.tolist()\n```\n\nThis captures the idea of relabeling the pixel values, consistent with the training examples suggesting color/label substitution pattern."

              "Let's analyze the transformations in the provided examples to infer a pattern:\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input: Black background with light blue crosses and a horizontal bar, then a line of a different color replacing some of these structures.\n- Output: The pattern shifts colors from blue to a higher number (3 or 4), and the shapes seem to be \"colored over\" with new colors, possibly indicating labeling or color translation.\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input: Random black layout with white lines and filled regions.\n- Output: The main structure remains, but the colors are replaced or layered into different values, indicating a pattern of color substitution based on region structure.\n\n**Example 3:**\n- Input: Patterns with '9's creating a grid pattern.\n- Output: Again, structure remains but coloring is changed, with some regions shifted to new values.\n\n**General Pattern Inference:**\n- The transformation appears to be a **color remapping** or a **label replacement** based on the shapes and regions.\n- The shapes (such as lines or crosses) tend to be preserved in structure but are recolored.\n- The constant grid size is 24\u00d724, which is maintained.\n- The test input has a repeating pattern of '5's forming vertical and horizontal lines with some zeros, and the output seems to replace or recolor these.\n\n**Based on the above and the last test case:**\n- The pattern could involve replacing certain values (like 0 and 5) with new values, possibly depending on their position or neighboring pixels, or simply by a fixed color mapping.\n\n---\n\n### Approach:\n- For the test input, the pattern resembles the training examples: black background, lines of a certain value.\n- The pattern might involve:\n  - Replacing '0' with a new value, say, '4' (a new color),\n  - And replacing '5' with another value, say, '9' (comparing the previous outputs),\n  - Keeping the structure but updating the color.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation Plan:\n- Since the opponent pattern is not fully certain, I will implement a plausible transformation:\n  - Replace all '0's with '4's.\n  - Replace all '5's with '9's.\n  - Keep other values unchanged.\n- This matches the general pattern from the training examples where numbers are remapped but structure preserved.\n\n---\n\nHere is the final code:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    # Create a copy to avoid mutating input\n    result = grid.copy()\n\n    # Example transformation based on observed pattern:\n    # Replace 0 with 4\n    result[result == 0] = 4\n\n    # Replace 5 with 9\n    result[result == 5] = 9\n\n    # Return as list of list\n    return result.tolist()\n```\n\nThis captures the idea of relabeling the pixel values, consistent with the training examples suggesting color/label substitution pattern."
