The transformation seems to involve spreading or propagating certain values (like 2, 0, 1, 4, 3) in specific patterns.\n2. Values like 8 seem to be \"border\" values that remain unchanged.\n3. There appears to be a pattern of spreading values from certain positions to neighboring cells.\n4. Values like 2 and 0 seem to propagate in a way that creates diagonal or horizontal patterns.\n5. Values like 1 and 4 seem to propagate in a more structured way, possibly in diagonal or vertical patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading certain values from their initial positions to neighboring cells in a specific pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the transformation logic\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # We'll propagate values in a way that spreads 2s and 0s in certain patterns\n    # This is a placeholder implementation that needs to be refined\n    \n    # Spread 2s and 0s in a pattern that seems to match the examples\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 2:\n                # Spread 2s to neighboring cells\n                if i > 0 and grid_np[i-1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j] = 2\n                if i < 18 and grid_np[i+1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = 2\n                if j > 0 and grid_np[i][j-1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j-1] = 2\n                if j < 12 and grid_np[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = 2\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 0:\n                # Spread 0s to neighboring cells\n                if i > 0 and grid_np[i-1][j] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j] = 0\n                if i < 18 and grid_np[i+1][j] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = 0\n                if j > 0 and grid_np[i][j-1] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j-1] = 0\n                if j < 12 and grid_np[i][j+1] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = 0\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nThis implementation is a hypothesis based on the observed patterns. It spreads values like 2 and 0 in a way that seems to match the examples, but it's a simplified version that may need refinement to perfectly match all the training examples.",

The transformation seems to involve spreading or propagating certain values (like 2, 0, 1, 4, 3) in specific patterns.\n2. Values like 8 seem to be \"border\" values that remain unchanged.\n3. There appears to be a pattern of spreading values from certain positions to neighboring cells.\n4. Values like 2 and 0 seem to propagate in a way that creates diagonal or horizontal patterns.\n5. Values like 1 and 4 seem to propagate in a more structured way, possibly in diagonal or vertical patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading certain values from their initial positions to neighboring cells in a specific pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the transformation logic\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # We'll propagate values in a way that spreads 2s and 0s in certain patterns\n    # This is a placeholder implementation that needs to be refined\n    \n    # Spread 2s and 0s in a pattern that seems to match the examples\n    for i in range(19):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 2:\n                # Spread 2s to neighboring cells\n                if i > 0 and grid_np[i-1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j] = 2\n                if i < 18 and grid_np[i+1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = 2\n                if j > 0 and grid_np[i][j-1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j-1] = 2\n                if j < 12 and grid_np[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = 2\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 0:\n                # Spread 0s to neighboring cells\n                if i > 0 and grid_np[i-1][j] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j] = 0\n                if i < 18 and grid_np[i+1][j] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = 0\n                if j > 0 and grid_np[i][j-1] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j-1] = 0\n                if j < 12 and grid_np[i][j+1] == 2:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = 0\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nThis implementation is a hypothesis based on the observed patterns. It spreads values like 2 and 0 in a way that seems to match the examples, but it's a simplified version that may need refinement to perfectly match all the training examples.",
