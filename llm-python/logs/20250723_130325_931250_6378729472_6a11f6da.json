The output grid often contains the same numbers as the input grid, but with some changes.\n3. The changes typically involve replacing numbers with other numbers or patterns.\n\nLet's look at the transformations in detail:\n\n### Example 1:\n- Input: \n  ```\n  1 0 0 0 0\n  1 1 1 1 1\n  0 1 0 1 0\n  1 1 1 0 1\n  0 0 0 1 0\n  8 0 8 0 0\n  8 0 0 8 0\n  8 0 0 0 8\n  8 8 0 0 0\n  8 8 0 0 0\n  0 6 0 0 6\n  6 0 0 6 6\n  0 6 6 6 0\n  6 6 0 6 6\n  0 0 6 0 6\n  ```\n- Output:\n  ```\n  1 6 8 0 6\n  6 1 1 6 6\n  8 6 6 6 8\n  6 6 1 6 6\n  8 8 6 1 6\n  ```\n\n### Example 2:\n- Input:\n  ```\n  1 0 1 0 1\n  0 1 0 0 1\n  0 1 0 0 0\n  1 0 0 1 1\n  1 0 0 1 1\n  0 0 0 0 0\n  0 8 8 8 0\n  0 8 0 0 0\n  8 0 0 0 8\n  8 0 8 8 0\n  0 0 6 0 6\n  6 0 6 0 0\n  6 0 0 0 6\n  6 0 0 0 6\n  0 6 6 6 6\n  ```\n- Output:\n  ```\n  1 0 6 0 6\n  6 1 6 8 1\n  6 1 0 0 6\n  6 0 0 1 6\n  1 6 6 6 6\n  ```\n\n### Example 3:\n- Input:\n  ```\n  0 0 1 1 0\n  1 1 1 0 0\n  0 1 1 1 0\n  0 1 0 0 1\n  1 0 0 1 1\n  8 0 8 8 0\n  8 0 8 8 8\n  8 8 8 0 8\n  0 8 0 8 8\n  8 0 8 8 8\n  6 0 6 0 6\n  0 0 0 0 6\n  6 6 6 6 6\n  0 0 6 0 0\n  0 6 0 6 0\n  ```\n- Output:\n  ```\n  6 0 6 1 6\n  1 1 1 8 6\n  6 6 6 6 6\n  0 1 6 8 1\n  1 6 8 6 1\n  ```\n\n### Example 4:\n- Input:\n  ```\n  0 1 1 1 1\n  0 1 1 0 0\n  0 1 1 1 0\n  0 0 1 1 1\n  0 1 1 1 0\n  0 8 8 0 0\n  8 0 0 8 0\n  0 8 0 0 8\n  0 0 8 0 0\n  8 0 8 0 8\n  0 6 0 6 6\n  0 0 6 6 6\n  0 6 0 0 0\n  0 6 6 0 6\n  0 0 0 0 0\n  ```\n- Output:\n  ```\n  0 6 1 6 6\n  8 1 6 6 6\n  0 6 1 1 8\n  0 6 6 1 6\n  8 1 1 1 8\n  ```\n\n### Example 5:\n- Input:\n  ```\n  1 1 1 0 0\n  0 0 1 1 0\n  1 1 0 0 1\n  0 1 1 1 1\n  0 0 0 0 1\n  0 8 0 0 8\n  8 8 8 0 0\n  0 0 0 0 0\n  0 0 0 8 0\n  0 0 8 8 8\n  6 6 0 0 0\n  0 6 6 6 0\n  0 0 6 0 6\n  0 0 6 6 6\n  6 6 6 6 6\n  ```\n- Output:\n  ```\n  6 6 1 0 8\n  8 6 6 6 0\n  1 1 6 0 6\n  0 1 6 6 6\n  6 6 6 6 6\n  ```\n\n### Observations:\n1. The numbers 0, 1, 6, 8 are often transformed.\n2. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain numbers with others, often in a symmetrical or mirrored pattern.\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- Replace 0 with 8\n- Replace 1 with 6\n- Replace 6 with 1\n- Replace 8 with 0\n\n### Implementation:\nLet's implement this hypothesis in a Python function.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [[0] * 5 for _ in range(5)]\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis function attempts to transform the input grid according to the observed patterns. Note that this is a simple and heuristic approach, and it may not capture all the nuances of the transformations in the training examples.",

Let's break down the process step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The output grid seems to have a transformation that involves the numbers 1, 6, 8, and 0.\n   - There appears to be a rotation or reflection involved in the transformation.\n   - The numbers 8 and 6 seem to be transformed into each other.\n\n2. **Hypothesis:**\n   - The transformation might involve rotating the input grid by 90 degrees clockwise and then replacing 8s with 6s and 6s with 8s.\n\n3. **Implementation:**\n   - We will write a function `transform` that takes the input grid and applies the identified transformation.\n\nLet's implement this hypothesis in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Rotate the grid 90 degrees clockwise\n    rotated_grid = list(zip(*grid[::-1]))\n    \n    # Replace 8 with 6 and 6 with 8\n    transformed_grid = [[6 if x == 8 else 8 if x == 6 else x for x in row] for row in rotated_grid]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n\n# Example usage:\ninput_grid = [\n    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],\n    [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],\n    [1, 0, 1, 0, 1],\n    [0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 8, 8, 8],\n    [8, 8, 0, 8, 8],\n    [0, 0, 8, 0, 0],\n    [8, 8, 0, 8, 0],\n    [0, 6, 0, 6, 0],\n    [0, 0, 6, 0, 6],\n    [0, 6, 0, 0, 6],\n    [0, 0, 6, 0, 6],\n    [6, 0, 6, 6, 0]\n]\n\noutput_grid = transform(input_grid)\nfor row in output_grid:\n    print(row)\n```\n\nThis function rotates the input grid 90 degrees clockwise and then replaces 8s with 6s and 6s with 8s.
