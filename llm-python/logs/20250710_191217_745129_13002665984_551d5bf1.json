          "Let's analyze the training examples:\n\n## Observations\n\n- **Input:** There are several hollow blue rectangles (\"boxes\") on a black background.\n- **Output:** Each rectangle is now filled with a lighter blue (so all formerly empty spaces inside a box are now filled), AND several connections (\"filled links\") between some rectangles are drawn using the same fill color.\n- Filling color: inside = lighter blue (likely a '2', since outline is '1', background is '0').\n- *Some* pairs of rectangles are connected by \"filled corridors\" of the fill color.\n- Exact connection pattern depends on the arrangement:\n    - In Example 1: \n        - Top left and top right boxes are connected by a horizontal corridor.\n        - Top to central box is connected by a vertical corridor.\n    - In Example 2:\n        - Leftmost rectangles are connected by a horizontal corridor.\n        - Top to central by vertical corridor.\n- Only *horizontal* and *vertical* corridors between boxes.\n- **Corridors connect the centers of the boxes.**\n- All outputs are the same size as input.\n\n## Grid Size\n\n- Each output must be **24x28**.\n\n## Approach\n\n1. **Fill every box:** For every hollow blue box, fill its interior with the fill color.\n2. **Find the bounding box for each rectangle.**\n3. **Determine box \"centers\"** for connecting corridors.\n4. **Connect certain pairs of box centers with corridors** (always horizontal or vertical, as above).\n    - The pattern appears to: Connect horizontally aligned centers with horizontal corridors (if they have matching y-levels), vertically aligned centers with vertical corridors (if matching x-levels), and connect topboxes to central by a vertical line.\n    - However, in Example 2, not all rects are connected; only a subset.\n    - It appears that ONLY the two topmost boxes are connected by a horizontal corridor, and these are also connected (one of them) to the central by a vertical corridor. Similarly for other arrangements.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be:\n\n- For each row/column, **find the boxes that are horizontally (or vertically) aligned**.\n- Connect them by a corridor if they are \"neighbors\" (i.e., no other box between them on that axis).\n- For each box that has another box below/above (or right/left), connect their centers.\n\n**Fill value:** In the pictures, the fill color is lighter than the outline. Let's use '2' for the fill (since images show output is a single increment in shade).\n\n**Corridors use the same fill color.**\n\nLet's summarize the algorithm steps:\n1. Identify all boxes: Find their bounding boxes.\n2. For each box, fill its interior.\n3. Find \"center\" points for the boxes (for corridor ends).\n4. For each pair of horizontally aligned boxes, connect their centers with a horizontal corridor.\n5. For each pair of vertically aligned boxes (that are neighbors), connect their centers with a vertical corridor.\n6. Always maintain 24x28 output.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n- Use numpy for easy grid ops.\n- For box detection, scan for '1' pixels, and for each connected component find min/max x/y.\n- For filling, fill all inner pixels in each box with '2'.\n- For centers, use the box's centroid (either center of bounding box, or a designated spot).\n- For linking, connect centers via corridors, as per rules.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.ndimage import label\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    # Output shape\n    out = np.copy(grid)\n    # Step 1: Label all connected components of value 1 (the blue boxes)\n    mask = (grid == 1)\n    labels, num = label(mask)\n    boxes = []\n    for i in range(1, num+1):\n        ys, xs = np.where(labels == i)\n        y0, y1 = ys.min(), ys.max()\n        x0, x1 = xs.min(), xs.max()\n        boxes.append({'label': i, 'bbox': (y0,y1,x0,x1)})\n        # Fill the inside of the box with 2 (except the border, which stays 1)\n        if (y1-y0 > 2) and (x1-x0 > 2):\n            out[y0+1:y1, x0+1:x1] = 2\n\n    # Function to get the center of a box\n    def box_center(box):\n        y0,y1,x0,x1 = box['bbox']\n        cy = (y0+y1)//2\n        cx = (x0+x1)//2\n        return cy, cx\n\n    centers = [box_center(b) for b in boxes]\n\n    # CORRIDOR LOGIC\n    # The task seems to connect horizontally or vertically aligned neighboring boxes.\n    # Find horizontally aligned boxes (center y within 1 row)\n    used_pairs = set()\n    for i, b1 in enumerate(boxes):\n        c1y,c1x = box_center(b1)\n        # Find next closest horizontal neighbor (center y within 1)\n        min_dx = np.inf\n        min_j = None\n        for j, b2 in enumerate(boxes):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            c2y,c2x = box_center(b2)\n            if abs(c1y - c2y) <= 1:\n                dx = abs(c2x - c1x)\n                if dx < min_dx:\n                    min_dx = dx\n                    min_j = j\n        if min_j is not None and (min_j,i) not in used_pairs:\n            # connect horizontally\n            c2y,c2x = box_center(boxes[min_j])\n            y = c1y\n            x0, x1 = sorted([c1x, c2x])\n            out[y, x0:x1+1] = 2\n            used_pairs.add((i,min_j))\n    # Now, connect top/side boxes to central box vertically if they align in x\n    used_pairs = set()\n    for i, b1 in enumerate(boxes):\n        c1y,c1x = box_center(b1)\n        # Find next closest vertically aligned neighbor (center x within 1)\n        min_dy = np.inf\n        min_j = None\n        for j, b2 in enumerate(boxes):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            c2y,c2x = box_center(b2)\n            if abs(c1x - c2x) <= 1:\n                dy = abs(c2y - c1y)\n                if dy < min_dy:\n                    min_dy = dy\n                    min_j = j\n        if min_j is not None and (min_j,i) not in used_pairs:\n            c2y,c2x = box_center(boxes[min_j])\n            x = c1x\n            y0, y1 = sorted([c1y, c2y])\n            out[y0:y1+1, x] = 2\n            used_pairs.add((i,min_j))\n    # Ensure output is 24x28 by cropping or padding if needed\n    H,W = out.shape\n    out_fixed = np.zeros((24,28), dtype=int)\n    hh = min(24, H)\n    ww = min(28, W)\n    out_fixed[:hh, :ww] = out[:hh, :ww]\n    return out_fixed.tolist()\n```\n"

examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

          "Let's analyze the training examples:\n\n## Observations\n\n- **Input:** There are several hollow blue rectangles (\"boxes\") on a black background.\n- **Output:** Each rectangle is now filled with a lighter blue (so all formerly empty spaces inside a box are now filled), AND several connections (\"filled links\") between some rectangles are drawn using the same fill color.\n- Filling color: inside = lighter blue (likely a '2', since outline is '1', background is '0').\n- *Some* pairs of rectangles are connected by \"filled corridors\" of the fill color.\n- Exact connection pattern depends on the arrangement:\n    - In Example 1: \n        - Top left and top right boxes are connected by a horizontal corridor.\n        - Top to central box is connected by a vertical corridor.\n    - In Example 2:\n        - Leftmost rectangles are connected by a horizontal corridor.\n        - Top to central by vertical corridor.\n- Only *horizontal* and *vertical* corridors between boxes.\n- **Corridors connect the centers of the boxes.**\n- All outputs are the same size as input.\n\n## Grid Size\n\n- Each output must be **24x28**.\n\n## Approach\n\n1. **Fill every box:** For every hollow blue box, fill its interior with the fill color.\n2. **Find the bounding box for each rectangle.**\n3. **Determine box \"centers\"** for connecting corridors.\n4. **Connect certain pairs of box centers with corridors** (always horizontal or vertical, as above).\n    - The pattern appears to: Connect horizontally aligned centers with horizontal corridors (if they have matching y-levels), vertically aligned centers with vertical corridors (if matching x-levels), and connect topboxes to central by a vertical line.\n    - However, in Example 2, not all rects are connected; only a subset.\n    - It appears that ONLY the two topmost boxes are connected by a horizontal corridor, and these are also connected (one of them) to the central by a vertical corridor. Similarly for other arrangements.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be:\n\n- For each row/column, **find the boxes that are horizontally (or vertically) aligned**.\n- Connect them by a corridor if they are \"neighbors\" (i.e., no other box between them on that axis).\n- For each box that has another box below/above (or right/left), connect their centers.\n\n**Fill value:** In the pictures, the fill color is lighter than the outline. Let's use '2' for the fill (since images show output is a single increment in shade).\n\n**Corridors use the same fill color.**\n\nLet's summarize the algorithm steps:\n1. Identify all boxes: Find their bounding boxes.\n2. For each box, fill its interior.\n3. Find \"center\" points for the boxes (for corridor ends).\n4. For each pair of horizontally aligned boxes, connect their centers with a horizontal corridor.\n5. For each pair of vertically aligned boxes (that are neighbors), connect their centers with a vertical corridor.\n6. Always maintain 24x28 output.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n- Use numpy for easy grid ops.\n- For box detection, scan for '1' pixels, and for each connected component find min/max x/y.\n- For filling, fill all inner pixels in each box with '2'.\n- For centers, use the box's centroid (either center of bounding box, or a designated spot).\n- For linking, connect centers via corridors, as per rules.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.ndimage import label\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    # Output shape\n    out = np.copy(grid)\n    # Step 1: Label all connected components of value 1 (the blue boxes)\n    mask = (grid == 1)\n    labels, num = label(mask)\n    boxes = []\n    for i in range(1, num+1):\n        ys, xs = np.where(labels == i)\n        y0, y1 = ys.min(), ys.max()\n        x0, x1 = xs.min(), xs.max()\n        boxes.append({'label': i, 'bbox': (y0,y1,x0,x1)})\n        # Fill the inside of the box with 2 (except the border, which stays 1)\n        if (y1-y0 > 2) and (x1-x0 > 2):\n            out[y0+1:y1, x0+1:x1] = 2\n\n    # Function to get the center of a box\n    def box_center(box):\n        y0,y1,x0,x1 = box['bbox']\n        cy = (y0+y1)//2\n        cx = (x0+x1)//2\n        return cy, cx\n\n    centers = [box_center(b) for b in boxes]\n\n    # CORRIDOR LOGIC\n    # The task seems to connect horizontally or vertically aligned neighboring boxes.\n    # Find horizontally aligned boxes (center y within 1 row)\n    used_pairs = set()\n    for i, b1 in enumerate(boxes):\n        c1y,c1x = box_center(b1)\n        # Find next closest horizontal neighbor (center y within 1)\n        min_dx = np.inf\n        min_j = None\n        for j, b2 in enumerate(boxes):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            c2y,c2x = box_center(b2)\n            if abs(c1y - c2y) <= 1:\n                dx = abs(c2x - c1x)\n                if dx < min_dx:\n                    min_dx = dx\n                    min_j = j\n        if min_j is not None and (min_j,i) not in used_pairs:\n            # connect horizontally\n            c2y,c2x = box_center(boxes[min_j])\n            y = c1y\n            x0, x1 = sorted([c1x, c2x])\n            out[y, x0:x1+1] = 2\n            used_pairs.add((i,min_j))\n    # Now, connect top/side boxes to central box vertically if they align in x\n    used_pairs = set()\n    for i, b1 in enumerate(boxes):\n        c1y,c1x = box_center(b1)\n        # Find next closest vertically aligned neighbor (center x within 1)\n        min_dy = np.inf\n        min_j = None\n        for j, b2 in enumerate(boxes):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            c2y,c2x = box_center(b2)\n            if abs(c1x - c2x) <= 1:\n                dy = abs(c2y - c1y)\n                if dy < min_dy:\n                    min_dy = dy\n                    min_j = j\n        if min_j is not None and (min_j,i) not in used_pairs:\n            c2y,c2x = box_center(boxes[min_j])\n            x = c1x\n            y0, y1 = sorted([c1y, c2y])\n            out[y0:y1+1, x] = 2\n            used_pairs.add((i,min_j))\n    # Ensure output is 24x28 by cropping or padding if needed\n    H,W = out.shape\n    out_fixed = np.zeros((24,28), dtype=int)\n    hh = min(24, H)\n    ww = min(28, W)\n    out_fixed[:hh, :ww] = out[:hh, :ww]\n    return out_fixed.tolist()\n```\n"

              "Let's analyze the training examples:\n\n## Observations\n\n- **Input:** There are several hollow blue rectangles (\"boxes\") on a black background.\n- **Output:** Each rectangle is now filled with a lighter blue (so all formerly empty spaces inside a box are now filled), AND several connections (\"filled links\") between some rectangles are drawn using the same fill color.\n- Filling color: inside = lighter blue (likely a '2', since outline is '1', background is '0').\n- *Some* pairs of rectangles are connected by \"filled corridors\" of the fill color.\n- Exact connection pattern depends on the arrangement:\n    - In Example 1: \n        - Top left and top right boxes are connected by a horizontal corridor.\n        - Top to central box is connected by a vertical corridor.\n    - In Example 2:\n        - Leftmost rectangles are connected by a horizontal corridor.\n        - Top to central by vertical corridor.\n- Only *horizontal* and *vertical* corridors between boxes.\n- **Corridors connect the centers of the boxes.**\n- All outputs are the same size as input.\n\n## Grid Size\n\n- Each output must be **24x28**.\n\n## Approach\n\n1. **Fill every box:** For every hollow blue box, fill its interior with the fill color.\n2. **Find the bounding box for each rectangle.**\n3. **Determine box \"centers\"** for connecting corridors.\n4. **Connect certain pairs of box centers with corridors** (always horizontal or vertical, as above).\n    - The pattern appears to: Connect horizontally aligned centers with horizontal corridors (if they have matching y-levels), vertically aligned centers with vertical corridors (if matching x-levels), and connect topboxes to central by a vertical line.\n    - However, in Example 2, not all rects are connected; only a subset.\n    - It appears that ONLY the two topmost boxes are connected by a horizontal corridor, and these are also connected (one of them) to the central by a vertical corridor. Similarly for other arrangements.\n\nSo, the rule seems to be:\n\n- For each row/column, **find the boxes that are horizontally (or vertically) aligned**.\n- Connect them by a corridor if they are \"neighbors\" (i.e., no other box between them on that axis).\n- For each box that has another box below/above (or right/left), connect their centers.\n\n**Fill value:** In the pictures, the fill color is lighter than the outline. Let's use '2' for the fill (since images show output is a single increment in shade).\n\n**Corridors use the same fill color.**\n\nLet's summarize the algorithm steps:\n1. Identify all boxes: Find their bounding boxes.\n2. For each box, fill its interior.\n3. Find \"center\" points for the boxes (for corridor ends).\n4. For each pair of horizontally aligned boxes, connect their centers with a horizontal corridor.\n5. For each pair of vertically aligned boxes (that are neighbors), connect their centers with a vertical corridor.\n6. Always maintain 24x28 output.\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n- Use numpy for easy grid ops.\n- For box detection, scan for '1' pixels, and for each connected component find min/max x/y.\n- For filling, fill all inner pixels in each box with '2'.\n- For centers, use the box's centroid (either center of bounding box, or a designated spot).\n- For linking, connect centers via corridors, as per rules.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.ndimage import label\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    # Output shape\n    out = np.copy(grid)\n    # Step 1: Label all connected components of value 1 (the blue boxes)\n    mask = (grid == 1)\n    labels, num = label(mask)\n    boxes = []\n    for i in range(1, num+1):\n        ys, xs = np.where(labels == i)\n        y0, y1 = ys.min(), ys.max()\n        x0, x1 = xs.min(), xs.max()\n        boxes.append({'label': i, 'bbox': (y0,y1,x0,x1)})\n        # Fill the inside of the box with 2 (except the border, which stays 1)\n        if (y1-y0 > 2) and (x1-x0 > 2):\n            out[y0+1:y1, x0+1:x1] = 2\n\n    # Function to get the center of a box\n    def box_center(box):\n        y0,y1,x0,x1 = box['bbox']\n        cy = (y0+y1)//2\n        cx = (x0+x1)//2\n        return cy, cx\n\n    centers = [box_center(b) for b in boxes]\n\n    # CORRIDOR LOGIC\n    # The task seems to connect horizontally or vertically aligned neighboring boxes.\n    # Find horizontally aligned boxes (center y within 1 row)\n    used_pairs = set()\n    for i, b1 in enumerate(boxes):\n        c1y,c1x = box_center(b1)\n        # Find next closest horizontal neighbor (center y within 1)\n        min_dx = np.inf\n        min_j = None\n        for j, b2 in enumerate(boxes):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            c2y,c2x = box_center(b2)\n            if abs(c1y - c2y) <= 1:\n                dx = abs(c2x - c1x)\n                if dx < min_dx:\n                    min_dx = dx\n                    min_j = j\n        if min_j is not None and (min_j,i) not in used_pairs:\n            # connect horizontally\n            c2y,c2x = box_center(boxes[min_j])\n            y = c1y\n            x0, x1 = sorted([c1x, c2x])\n            out[y, x0:x1+1] = 2\n            used_pairs.add((i,min_j))\n    # Now, connect top/side boxes to central box vertically if they align in x\n    used_pairs = set()\n    for i, b1 in enumerate(boxes):\n        c1y,c1x = box_center(b1)\n        # Find next closest vertically aligned neighbor (center x within 1)\n        min_dy = np.inf\n        min_j = None\n        for j, b2 in enumerate(boxes):\n            if i == j:\n                continue\n            c2y,c2x = box_center(b2)\n            if abs(c1x - c2x) <= 1:\n                dy = abs(c2y - c1y)\n                if dy < min_dy:\n                    min_dy = dy\n                    min_j = j\n        if min_j is not None and (min_j,i) not in used_pairs:\n            c2y,c2x = box_center(boxes[min_j])\n            x = c1x\n            y0, y1 = sorted([c1y, c2y])\n            out[y0:y1+1, x] = 2\n            used_pairs.add((i,min_j))\n    # Ensure output is 24x28 by cropping or padding if needed\n    H,W = out.shape\n    out_fixed = np.zeros((24,28), dtype=int)\n    hh = min(24, H)\n    ww = min(28, W)\n    out_fixed[:hh, :ww] = out[:hh, :ww]\n    return out_fixed.tolist()\n```\n"
