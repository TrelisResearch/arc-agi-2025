The output grid often has a \"border\" of 0s around the middle section\n2. The middle section (rows 3-7 and columns 3-7) seems to have some transformation applied\n3. Values in the middle section seem to be modified in a way that preserves some structure\n4. There appears to be a transformation that affects the middle section in a way that preserves some symmetry\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Preserves the 0-filled rows (rows 2 and 7 in the examples)\n- Applies a transformation to the middle section (rows 3-7 and columns 3-7)\n- Preserves the structure of the middle section while modifying values\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # The middle section is rows 3-7 and columns 3-7\n    middle = [row[3:8] for row in transformed[3:8]]\n    \n    # Apply a transformation to the middle section\n    # This is a simple pattern that seems to work for the examples\n    # It preserves the structure but modifies values in a way that matches the examples\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if middle[i][j] == 2:\n                middle[i][j] = 1\n            elif middle[i][j] == 1:\n                middle[i][j] = 2\n            # Leave 0s unchanged\n    \n    # Replace the middle section in the transformed grid\n    for i in range(3):\n        transformed[3+i][3:8] = middle[i]\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # The middle section is rows 3-7 and columns 3-7\n    middle = [row[3:8] for row in transformed[3:8]]\n    \n    # Apply a transformation to the middle section\n    # This is a simple pattern that seems to work for the examples\n    # It preserves the structure but modifies values in a way that matches the examples\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if middle[i][j] == 2:\n                middle[i][j] = 1\n            elif middle[i][j] == 1:\n                middle[i][j] = 2\n            # Leave 0s unchanged\n    \n    # Replace the middle section in the transformed grid\n    for i in range(3):\n        transformed[3+i][3:8] = middle[i]\n    \n    return transformed\n```",
