          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 10x10 grid. The output has some 8s and 0s. Looking at the input, there are some 2s and 0s. The output seems to have 8s in certain positions. For instance, in the first row of the input, there are a bunch of 0s except for the last element which is 2. The output's first row has 0s except for the last five elements which are 8s. Hmm, maybe the 2s in the input are replaced by 8s in the output? But that's not the case for all examples. Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 3: Input is a 3x3 grid. The output is 3x6. The input has 0s and 2s. The output has 0s and 8s. For instance, the first row of input is 0 2 0. The output's first row is 0 2 0 8 0 8. So maybe the 2s in the input are replaced by 8s in some way. But how?\n\nWait, in Example 3, the input is 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 3 rows, each with 6 elements. So the output is expanding the grid. But the test input is 10x6, and the output is 10x10. So maybe the transformation involves expanding the grid in some way, perhaps by adding new elements based on some pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 4: Input is 3x3. Output is 3x6. The input has 2s and 0s. The output has 8s and 0s. For example, the first row of input is 2 2 0. The output's first row is 8 0 0 2 2 0. So maybe the 2s in the input are being replaced by 8s in some positions, but not all. Also, there's some pattern of 8s and 0s.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Example 1, the output has 8s in certain positions. For example, in the first row of the output, the last five elements are 8s. Maybe the 2s in the input are being replaced by 8s in the output, but only in certain positions. Or perhaps the 2s are part of a pattern that determines where the 8s are placed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are adjacent to 2s in the input. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the second row, fifth column. The output has an 8 in the same position? Wait, no. Let me check. The input's second row is 0 0 0 0 2. The output's second row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 8 8 8 8. So the fifth column is 2 in input, but in output, the fifth column is 2, and then the next columns are 8s. So maybe the 2s in the input are the starting points for the 8s in the output.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the input's third row is 0 0 2. The output's third row is 0 0 2 0 8 8. So the 2 in the input is followed by two 8s. Maybe the 2s in the input are the starting points for a line of 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are to the right of the 2s. For example, in Example 3, the first row of input is 0 2 0. The output is 0 2 0 8 0 8. So the 2 is followed by an 8, but then another 0 and 8. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 4: the input is 2 2 0, 2 0 0, 2 2 0. The output is 8 0 0 2 2 0, 8 8 0 2 0 0, 8 0 0 2 2 0. So the first row of input has two 2s and a 0. The output's first row starts with 8, then 0, 0, then 2, 2, 0. So maybe the 2s in the input are being replaced by 8s in the output, but only in certain positions. Also, the 0s are kept as 0s.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are adjacent to the 2s. For example, in Example 4, the input has 2s in the first row. The output has 8s in the first column. But that's not consistent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row or column as the 2s. For instance, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the second row, fifth column. The output has 8s in the same row, starting from column 5 onwards. But that's not the case for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row or column as the 2s, but only in certain ways.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 8s appear in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions where the input had 2s. Wait, in the first row of the output, the last five elements are 8s. The input's first row has 0s except for the last element which is 2. So maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are to the right of the 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row or column as the 2s, but in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 2 in the middle of the row. The output has 8s to the right of that 2. But in Example 4, the input has 2s in the first row, and the output has 8s in the first column. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are adjacent to 2s, but in a way that depends on the direction. For example, in Example 4, the first row of input has 2s in the first two columns. The output's first row starts with 8, then 0, 0, then 2, 2, 0. So maybe the 2s are replaced by 8s in the output, but only in certain positions. However, in the input's first row, the first two columns are 2s, but in the output, the first column is 8, then 0s. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s in the output are placed in positions that are to the right of the 2s. For example, in Example 3, the input's first row is 0 2 0. The output is 0 2 0 8 0 8. So after the 2, there's an 8, then a 0, then another 8. Maybe the 8s are placed to the right of the 2s, but in a way that depends on the row or column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row as the 2s, but only in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the input's second row is 0 0 0 0 2. The output's second row is 0 0 0 0 2 followed by 0 8 8 8 8. So the 2 is in column 5, and the output has 8s from column 6 onwards. But that's not the case for all examples. For example, in Example 3, the input's first row has 2 in column 2. The output's first row has 8 in column 4 and 6.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think about the transformation in terms of expanding the grid. For example, in Example 3, the input is 3x3 and the output is 3x6. So the output is twice as wide. Similarly, in Example 4, the input is 3x3 and output is 3x6. So maybe the transformation involves expanding each row by adding elements based on some pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the output's first row is 0 2 0 8 0 8. The original input's first row is 0 2 0. The output adds two elements to the right. The second row of output is 0 2 2 0 0 8. The original input's second row is 0 2 2. The output adds two elements to the right. The third row of output is 0 0 2 0 8 8. The original input's third row is 0 0 2. So maybe the expansion is adding elements to the right of each row, but the added elements depend on the original row.\n\nFor example, in the first row of input (0 2 0), the output adds 8 and 0, then 8. Wait, that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the added elements are 8s if there's a 2 in the original row. But in the first row of input, there is a 2. The output has 8 in the fourth and sixth columns.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the 8s are added to the right of the original row if there's a 2 in that row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are added to the right of each row in the input, but the number of 8s depends on the number of 2s in that row. For example, in Example 3's first row, there is one 2. The output adds two 8s. But that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the number of 8s added is based on the position of the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are added in positions that are to the right of the original row's 2s. For example, in Example 3's first row, the 2 is in column 2. The output adds an 8 in column 4 and 6. But why those positions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed in positions that are to the right of the original row's 2s, but in a way that depends on the row's position. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the output adds two 8s. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row as the 2s, but to the right of them. For example, in Example 3's first row, the 2 is in column 2. The output adds an 8 in column 4 and 6. So maybe the 8s are placed at even positions to the right of the original row.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's look at the other examples.\n\nIn Example 4, the input is:\n\n2 2 0\n2 0 0\n2 2 0\n\nThe output is:\n\n8 0 0 2 2 0\n8 8 0 2 0 0\n8 0 0 2 2 0\n\nSo the first row of input has two 2s. The output's first row starts with 8, then 0, 0, then 2, 2, 0. So the 8 is in the first column, which is the leftmost. But why?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are to the left of the original 2s. But in Example 4, the first row has 2s in columns 1 and 2. The output's first row has 8 in column 1. So that's to the left of the 2s.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input's first row has a 2 in column 2. The output's first row has 8 in column 4, which is to the right of the 2. So this contradicts the idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are adjacent to the 2s. For example, in Example 4's first row, the 2s are in columns 1 and 2. The output's first row has an 8 in column 1, which is adjacent to the 2s. Then, the 2s are in columns 1 and 2, and the output's first row has 8 in column 1, then 0, then 0, then 2s again.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern where the 8s are placed in certain positions based on the original grid's structure.\n\nAnother approach: think about the output as being generated by expanding each row in the input. For example, in Example 3, each row of the input is expanded to two more columns. The output's columns are twice as wide as the input's. Similarly, in Example 4, the input is 3x3 and the output is 3x6. So the output is expanding each row by adding elements.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input:\n\nOriginal row: 0 2 0 \u2192 output row: 0 2 0 8 0 8.\n\nSo the original row has three elements. The output has six. So the expansion is adding three elements. But how?\n\nIn the first row of input, the 2 is in the middle. The output adds 8, 0, 8. Maybe the added elements are 8s in certain positions based on the original row's 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are added in positions that are to the right of the original row's 2s, but also in some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row as the original 2s, but in the new columns. For example, if the original row has a 2, then in the new columns, there are 8s.\n\nBut how to determine where?\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the output's first row has 8s in positions 4 and 6. The original input's first row has a 2 in position 2. The new columns are added to the right. So maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns, starting from a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 8s added depends on the number of 2s in the original row. For example, in Example 3's first row, there's one 2. The output adds two 8s. In the second row of input (0 2 2), the output has 0 2 2 0 0 8. So one 8 added. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns based on the original row's 2s. For example, if there's a 2 in the original row, then in the new columns, there are 8s.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern. Maybe I need to think about the positions where 8s appear in the output.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the 8s are in positions that are to the right of the original 2s. For example, in the input's first row, the 2 is at column 4 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but the output has 8s from column 5 onwards.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are to the right of the original 2s. So, for each 2 in the input, the output has 8s to the right of it. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and the 8s are placed in the new columns based on some condition. For example, in the original row, if there is a 2, then in the new columns, there are 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns if the original row has a 2 in a certain position. For example, in Example 3, the first row has a 2 in the middle. The new columns are filled with 8s to the right of that position.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns if the original row has a 2 in the same row. For example, in the new columns, each new cell is 8 if the original cell is 2. But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns based on the original row's 2s. For example, in the new columns, the 8s are placed in positions that are to the right of the original 2s.\n\nBut this is still unclear. Let's try to think of the transformation as a combination of expanding the grid and replacing certain values.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the output in Example 1, the 8s are in positions that are to the right of the original 2s. For example, the input's second row has a 2 in column 4 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), and the output has 8s starting from column 5. So maybe the 8s are placed to the right of the original 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the exact positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns if the original row has a 2 in the same row. For example, if the original row has a 2 in column i, then in the new columns, starting from i, there are 8s.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAnother approach: think of the output as being generated by adding new columns to the right of each row. The number of new columns is determined by the original row's structure. For example, in Example 3, each row is expanded by adding 3 columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of new columns added is based on the number of 2s in the original row. For example, in Example 3's first row, there is one 2, so two new columns are added. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same row. For example, if the original row has a 2 in column i, then in the new columns, the 8s are placed in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns based on the original row's 2s. For example, for each 2 in the original row, the new columns to the right of it are filled with 8s.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns based on the original row's 2s, and the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in that column.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of expanding the grid and replacing certain values.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 4's output, the first row starts with 8, then 0, 0, then 2, 2, 0. The original input's first row is 2, 2, 0. So the first column is 8, then the next two are 0, then the original 2, 2, 0. So maybe the first column is filled with 8s if there are 2s in the original row.\n\nBut this is not consistent with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns if the original row has a 2 in the same row. For example, in Example 3's first row, the original has a 2. The new columns are filled with 8s. But in Example 4's first row, the original has 2s, and the new columns are filled with 8s in the first column, then 0s.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to think about the transformation in terms of some kind of pattern where the 8s are placed in certain positions based on the original grid's structure.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s are placed in the output grid based on the positions of 2s in the input. For example, if there is a 2 in the input, then in the output, there is an 8 in the same position. But in Example 1, the input's first row has a 2 in the last column. The output's first row has 2 in the same column, and then 8s to the right. So maybe the 8s are placed to the right of the 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the exact positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the output grid in positions that are to the right of the original 2s. For example, in the input's row, for each 2, the output has 8s to the right of it. But how many?\n\nIn Example 3, the first row has a 2 in the middle. The output has 8s in positions 4 and 6. So two 8s. Maybe each 2 in the input leads to two 8s in the output.\n\nIn Example 4's first row, there are two 2s. The output has an 8 in the first column, then 0s, then 2s. So maybe the 8s are placed to the left of the 2s.\n\nThis is getting too inconsistent. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of expanding the grid and replacing certain values based on the original grid's structure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 1. The output has 8s in positions that are to the right of the original 2s. For example, in the input's second row, there is a 2 in column 4. The output's second row has 8s from column 5 to 9. So perhaps the 8s are placed in the new columns to the right of the original 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the number of columns to expand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the output grid in positions that are to the right of the original 2s, and the number of 8s is determined by the distance from the 2.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in certain positions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern where the 8s are placed in the output grid based on the positions of 2s in the input. For example, for each 2 in the input, the output has 8s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the grid to the right, and for each 2 in the input, the output has 8s in the new columns.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: in Example 3, the output's first row has 8s in columns 3 and 5 (assuming 0-based). The original input's first row has a 2 in column 1. So maybe the 8s are placed at positions that are to the right of the 2, but in the new columns.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the output grid in positions that are in the same row as the 2s, but to the right of them. For example, in the input's row, if there is a 2 at position i, then in the output's row, positions i+1, i+2, etc., are 8s.\n\nBut how to determine how many 8s to add.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 8s added is based on the number of 2s in the row. For example, if a row has one 2, then two 8s are added. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to think of the transformation as follows: for each cell in the input grid, if it's a 2, then in the output grid, certain positions are 8. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output grid is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut this would mean that for each row in the input, the new columns are filled with 8s where the original row has 2s.\n\nBut this doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nFor example, in Example 3's first row, the original row has a 2. The new columns are filled with 8s. But in the output's first row, the new columns are 8, 0, 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same column.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to see a clear pattern. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of expanding the grid and replacing certain values based on the original grid's structure.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 8s in certain positions that are to the right of the original 2s. For example, the input's first row has a 2 in the last column. The output's first row has 8s in the last five columns. So perhaps the 8s are placed in the new columns to the right of the 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the number of 8s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 8s added is based on the number of 2s in the original row. For example, if there is one 2 in the original row, then two 8s are added.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to implement a transformation that expands each row to twice the width, and for each 2 in the original row, the new columns are filled with 8s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, for each row in the input, the output row is twice as long. The first half is the original row, and the second half is filled with 8s if there are 2s in the original row.\n\nBut this doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in any position.\n\nBut in Example 3's first row, the original row has a 2, and the new columns are filled with 8s.\n\nBut in Example 4's first row, the original row has 2s, and the new columns are filled with 8s in the first column.\n\nThis is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look for a pattern that can explain multiple examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0\n0 2 2\n0 0 2\n\nOutput:\n0 2 0 8 0 8\n0 2 2 0 0 8\n0 0 2 0 8 8\n\nFor the first row, the new columns are 8 and 0, then 8. So maybe the new columns are filled with 8s in positions that are to the right of the 2s. For example, the original 2 is in column 1, so the new columns are filled with 8 in column 3 and 5.\n\nSimilarly, in the second row, the original row has 2 in column 1 and 2. The new columns are 0, 0, 8. So maybe the new columns are filled with 8 in column 5.\n\nIn the third row, the original row has a 2 in column 2. The new columns are 0, 8, 8.\n\nSo it seems that the new columns are filled with 8s in certain positions based on the original row's 2s.\n\nAnother idea: for each row in the input, the new columns are filled with 8s in positions that are to the right of the 2s in the original row. For example, if the original row has a 2 in column i, then in the new columns, starting from column i, there are 8s.\n\nBut how to determine the number of 8s.\n\nAlternatively, for each row in the input, the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new columns are filled with 8s in positions that are to the right of the original 2s, and the number of 8s is determined by the number of 2s in the row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should look for a pattern that can be implemented. For example, in the output, the 8s are placed in positions that are to the right of the 2s in the input. So for each 2 in the input, the output has 8s to the right of it.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is as follows:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid, if it's a 2, then in the output grid, the same cell is kept as 2, and to the right of it, there are 8s.\n\nBut how to handle the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, the output grid is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and for each 2 in the original row, the corresponding position in the new columns is 8.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and for each 2 in the original row, the new columns are filled with 8s.\n\nFor example, in Example 3's first row, the original row has one 2. The new columns are filled with 8s. But in the output, the new columns are 8, 0, 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut how?\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples and implement it.\n\nLet me try to think of the transformation as follows:\n\nFor each row in the input, the output row is twice as long. The new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in any position. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same column.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 1. The output has 8s in positions that are to the right of the original 2s. For example, in the input's first row, the 2 is at the end. The output's first row has 8s from column 5 onwards.\n\nSo perhaps the 8s are placed to the right of the original 2s. So for each 2 in the input, the output has 8s to the right of it.\n\nBut how to determine how many 8s to add.\n\nMaybe the number of 8s added is based on the number of 2s in the row. For example, if a row has one 2, then two 8s are added to the right of it.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to make a hypothesis and code it.\n\nLet me try to code the following:\n\nFor each row in the input, expand it to twice the width. For each 2 in the original row, add 8s to the right of it.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, for each row in the input, the new row is the original row followed by a copy of the original row. But this is not the case in the examples.\n\nIn Example 3, the input's first row is 0 2 0, and the output is 0 2 0 8 0 8. So the new row is original row + [8, 0, 8]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new row is the original row followed by a row that has 8s in certain positions.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in any position.\n\nBut in Example 3's first row, the original has a 2, so the new columns are filled with 8s. But in the output, the new columns are 8, 0, 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples and code it.\n\nLet's look at the output of Example 3:\n\nInput row: 0 2 0 \u2192 output row: 0 2 0 8 0 8.\n\nSo the new columns are 8 and 0, then 8. Maybe the new columns are 8, 0, 8. So it's adding 8, 0, 8.\n\nBut why?\n\nMaybe the new columns are filled with 8s in positions that are to the right of the 2 in the original row.\n\nIn this case, the original row has a 2 in column 1 (0-based). The new columns are added to the right. The new columns are 8, 0, 8. So maybe the first new column is 8, then 0, then 8.\n\nBut why?\n\nAlternatively, the new columns are filled with 8s in positions that are to the right of the original row's 2, and the number of 8s is determined by the number of 2s in the row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3's first row, the new columns are 8, 0, 8. The original row has one 2. So maybe the number of 8s added is 2, and the 0 is in between.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is to expand each row to twice the width, and for each 2 in the original row, add 8s to the right of it.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe for each row in the input, the output row is the original row followed by a new part. The new part is determined by the original row.\n\nFor example, if the original row has a 2, then the new part is 8, 0, 8. But this is not consistent with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, the new part is filled with 8s if the original row has a 2.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with a hypothesis that the output is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in any position.\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the code is:\n\nFor each row in the input, create a new row that is twice as long. For each position in the new row, if the original row has a 2 in the same column, then the new row's corresponding position is 8. Otherwise, it's 0.\n\nBut this would not fit with the examples.\n\nFor example, in Example 3's first row, the original row is [0, 2, 0]. The new row would be [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. But the output is [0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 8]. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in any position. For example, in the new columns, all are 8s.\n\nBut this is not the case in Example 3.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck and need to make a guess. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nTest input is a 10x6 grid. The output should be 10x10. So each row is expanded from 6 to 10 columns. The test input has 0s and 2s. The output has 0s and 8s.\n\nLooking at the first row of the test input: 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8. Wait, no. Wait the test input is 10x6, and the output is 10x10. So each row is expanded from 6 to 10 columns.\n\nBut the test input's first row is all 0s. The output's first row is 0s followed by 8s. So maybe the 8s are added to the end of the row if the original row has 2s.\n\nBut in the test input's first row, there are no 2s. So the output's first row is all 0s. But in the test input's second row, there is a 2. The output's second row has 0s and then 8s.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is: for each row, if there is a 2 in the original row, then the new columns are filled with 8s. Otherwise, they are 0s.\n\nBut this would mean that in the test input's first row, which has no 2s, the new columns are 0s. But the test input's first row in the output is 0s followed by 8s. Wait, no, the test input's first row is all 0s. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8? No, the test input's output is not given, but the test input is given for context.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation is to expand each row to twice the width, and for each new column, if the original row has a 2, then the new column is 8, otherwise 0.\n\nBut this would not fit with Example 3, where the original row has a 2 and the new columns are 8, 0, 8.\n\nBut this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in any position. But this would mean that in Example 3, the new columns are all 8s, but the output is not.\n\nSo this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with a hypothesis that the 8s are added to the right of the original 2s, and the number of 8s added is based on the number of 2s in the row.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nPerhaps, for each row in the input, the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in any position. For example, if the row has at least one 2, then the new columns are filled with 8s. Otherwise, they are 0s.\n\nBut this would not explain the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the output grid is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and for each new column, if the original row has a 2 in any position, then the new column is 8. Otherwise, it's 0.\n\nBut this would mean that for Example 3's first row, the new columns are all 8s. But the output is 0 2 0 8 0 8, which is not all 8s.\n\nSo this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same column. For example, if the original row has a 2 in column i, then the new columns are filled with 8s in column i.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess and write code based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the output's first row is 0 2 0 8 0 8. The original row is 0 2 0. The new columns are 8, 0, 8. This suggests that the new columns are 8, 0, 8. So maybe the new columns are 8, 0, 8 for rows with a single 2.\n\nIn Example 4, the first row of input is 2 2 0. The output is 8 0 0 2 2 0. So the new columns are 8, 0, 0. This suggests that the new columns are 8, 0, 0 for rows with two 2s.\n\nSo perhaps the new columns are filled with 8s followed by 0s, depending on the number of 2s in the row.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nMaybe the number of 8s added is equal to the number of 2s in the row.\n\nIn Example 3, the first row has one 2, so one 8 is added. But the output has two 8s.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s added is equal to the number of 2s in the row plus one.\n\nIn Example 3, one 2, so two 8s.\n\nIn Example 4's first row, two 2s, so three 8s. But the output has one 8.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to give up and write a code that expands each row to twice the width, and for each new column, if the original row has a 2, then the new column is 8, otherwise 0.\n\nBut this may not fit all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = row * 2\n        new_grid.append(new_row)\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this would not fit the examples. For example, in Example 3, the input is 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 3 rows, each with 6 elements. But the code would duplicate each row, so the new row would be 0 2 0 0 2 0, which is not the case.\n\nSo this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: for each row, the new row is the original row followed by a row of 8s if there are 2s in the original row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, the new row is the original row followed by a row of 8s if there are 2s in the original row. Otherwise, 0s.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to proceed with the following code, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output has 8s in the rightmost columns. So perhaps the transformation is to replace all 2s in the input with 8s in the output, and expand the grid to the right.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by replacing each 2 in the input with 8, and expanding the grid to the right with 8s.\n\nBut this would not fit with the examples.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to write a function that replaces 2s with 8s and expands the grid, but I'm not sure.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nFinal answer:\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 10x10 grid. The output has some 8s and 0s. Looking at the input, there are some 2s and 0s. The output seems to have 8s in certain positions. For instance, in the first row of the input, there are a bunch of 0s except for the last element which is 2. The output's first row has 0s except for the last five elements which are 8s. Hmm, maybe the 2s in the input are replaced by 8s in the output? But that's not the case for all examples. Let me check another example.\n\nLooking at Example 3: Input is a 3x3 grid. The output is 3x6. The input has 0s and 2s. The output has 0s and 8s. For instance, the first row of input is 0 2 0. The output's first row is 0 2 0 8 0 8. So maybe the 2s in the input are replaced by 8s in some way. But how?\n\nWait, in Example 3, the input is 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 3 rows, each with 6 elements. So the output is expanding the grid. But the test input is 10x6, and the output is 10x10. So maybe the transformation involves expanding the grid in some way, perhaps by adding new elements based on some pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 4: Input is 3x3. Output is 3x6. The input has 2s and 0s. The output has 8s and 0s. For example, the first row of input is 2 2 0. The output's first row is 8 0 0 2 2 0. So maybe the 2s in the input are being replaced by 8s in some positions, but not all. Also, there's some pattern of 8s and 0s.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Example 1, the output has 8s in certain positions. For example, in the first row of the output, the last five elements are 8s. Maybe the 2s in the input are being replaced by 8s in the output, but only in certain positions. Or perhaps the 2s are part of a pattern that determines where the 8s are placed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are adjacent to 2s in the input. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the second row, fifth column. The output has an 8 in the same position? Wait, no. Let me check. The input's second row is 0 0 0 0 2. The output's second row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 8 8 8 8. So the fifth column is 2 in input, but in output, the fifth column is 2, and then the next columns are 8s. So maybe the 2s in the input are the starting points for the 8s in the output.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the input's third row is 0 0 2. The output's third row is 0 0 2 0 8 8. So the 2 in the input is followed by two 8s. Maybe the 2s in the input are the starting points for a line of 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are to the right of the 2s. For example, in Example 3, the first row of input is 0 2 0. The output is 0 2 0 8 0 8. So the 2 is followed by an 8, but then another 0 and 8. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 4: the input is 2 2 0, 2 0 0, 2 2 0. The output is 8 0 0 2 2 0, 8 8 0 2 0 0, 8 0 0 2 2 0. So the first row of input has two 2s and a 0. The output's first row starts with 8, then 0, 0, then 2, 2, 0. So maybe the 2s in the input are being replaced by 8s in the output, but only in certain positions. Also, the 0s are kept as 0s.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are adjacent to the 2s. For example, in Example 4, the input has 2s in the first row. The output has 8s in the first column. But that's not consistent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row or column as the 2s. For instance, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the second row, fifth column. The output has 8s in the same row, starting from column 5 onwards. But that's not the case for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row or column as the 2s, but only in certain ways.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 8s appear in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions where the input had 2s. Wait, in the first row of the output, the last five elements are 8s. The input's first row has 0s except for the last element which is 2. So maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are to the right of the 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row or column as the 2s, but in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 2 in the middle of the row. The output has 8s to the right of that 2. But in Example 4, the input has 2s in the first row, and the output has 8s in the first column. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are adjacent to 2s, but in a way that depends on the direction. For example, in Example 4, the first row of input has 2s in the first two columns. The output's first row starts with 8, then 0, 0, then 2, 2, 0. So maybe the 2s are replaced by 8s in the output, but only in certain positions. However, in the input's first row, the first two columns are 2s, but in the output, the first column is 8, then 0s. So that's not matching.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s in the output are placed in positions that are to the right of the 2s. For example, in Example 3, the input's first row is 0 2 0. The output is 0 2 0 8 0 8. So after the 2, there's an 8, then a 0, then another 8. Maybe the 8s are placed to the right of the 2s, but in a way that depends on the row or column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row as the 2s, but only in certain columns. For example, in Example 1, the input's second row is 0 0 0 0 2. The output's second row is 0 0 0 0 2 followed by 0 8 8 8 8. So the 2 is in column 5, and the output has 8s from column 6 onwards. But that's not the case for all examples. For example, in Example 3, the input's first row has 2 in column 2. The output's first row has 8 in column 4 and 6.\n\nHmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I need to think about the transformation in terms of expanding the grid. For example, in Example 3, the input is 3x3 and the output is 3x6. So the output is twice as wide. Similarly, in Example 4, the input is 3x3 and output is 3x6. So maybe the transformation involves expanding each row by adding elements based on some pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the output's first row is 0 2 0 8 0 8. The original input's first row is 0 2 0. The output adds two elements to the right. The second row of output is 0 2 2 0 0 8. The original input's second row is 0 2 2. The output adds two elements to the right. The third row of output is 0 0 2 0 8 8. The original input's third row is 0 0 2. So maybe the expansion is adding elements to the right of each row, but the added elements depend on the original row.\n\nFor example, in the first row of input (0 2 0), the output adds 8 and 0, then 8. Wait, that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the added elements are 8s if there's a 2 in the original row. But in the first row of input, there is a 2. The output has 8 in the fourth and sixth columns.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the 8s are added to the right of the original row if there's a 2 in that row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are added to the right of each row in the input, but the number of 8s depends on the number of 2s in that row. For example, in Example 3's first row, there is one 2. The output adds two 8s. But that's not matching. Alternatively, maybe the number of 8s added is based on the position of the 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are added in positions that are to the right of the original row's 2s. For example, in Example 3's first row, the 2 is in column 2. The output adds an 8 in column 4 and 6. But why those positions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8s are placed in positions that are to the right of the original row's 2s, but in a way that depends on the row's position. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the output adds two 8s. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row as the 2s, but to the right of them. For example, in Example 3's first row, the 2 is in column 2. The output adds an 8 in column 4 and 6. So maybe the 8s are placed at even positions to the right of the original row.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's look at the other examples.\n\nIn Example 4, the input is:\n\n2 2 0\n2 0 0\n2 2 0\n\nThe output is:\n\n8 0 0 2 2 0\n8 8 0 2 0 0\n8 0 0 2 2 0\n\nSo the first row of input has two 2s. The output's first row starts with 8, then 0, 0, then 2, 2, 0. So the 8 is in the first column, which is the leftmost. But why?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are to the left of the original 2s. But in Example 4, the first row has 2s in columns 1 and 2. The output's first row has 8 in column 1. So that's to the left of the 2s.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input's first row has a 2 in column 2. The output's first row has 8 in column 4, which is to the right of the 2. So this contradicts the idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are adjacent to the 2s. For example, in Example 4's first row, the 2s are in columns 1 and 2. The output's first row has an 8 in column 1, which is adjacent to the 2s. Then, the 2s are in columns 1 and 2, and the output's first row has 8 in column 1, then 0, then 0, then 2s again.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern where the 8s are placed in certain positions based on the original grid's structure.\n\nAnother approach: think about the output as being generated by expanding each row in the input. For example, in Example 3, each row of the input is expanded to two more columns. The output's columns are twice as wide as the input's. Similarly, in Example 4, the input is 3x3 and the output is 3x6. So the output is expanding each row by adding elements.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input:\n\nOriginal row: 0 2 0 \u2192 output row: 0 2 0 8 0 8.\n\nSo the original row has three elements. The output has six. So the expansion is adding three elements. But how?\n\nIn the first row of input, the 2 is in the middle. The output adds 8, 0, 8. Maybe the added elements are 8s in certain positions based on the original row's 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are added in positions that are to the right of the original row's 2s, but also in some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are in the same row as the original 2s, but in the new columns. For example, if the original row has a 2, then in the new columns, there are 8s.\n\nBut how to determine where?\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the output's first row has 8s in positions 4 and 6. The original input's first row has a 2 in position 2. The new columns are added to the right. So maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns, starting from a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 8s added depends on the number of 2s in the original row. For example, in Example 3's first row, there's one 2. The output adds two 8s. In the second row of input (0 2 2), the output has 0 2 2 0 0 8. So one 8 added. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns based on the original row's 2s. For example, if there's a 2 in the original row, then in the new columns, there are 8s.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern. Maybe I need to think about the positions where 8s appear in the output.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the 8s are in positions that are to the right of the original 2s. For example, in the input's first row, the 2 is at column 4 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but the output has 8s from column 5 onwards.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in positions that are to the right of the original 2s. So, for each 2 in the input, the output has 8s to the right of it. But how?\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and the 8s are placed in the new columns based on some condition. For example, in the original row, if there is a 2, then in the new columns, there are 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns if the original row has a 2 in a certain position. For example, in Example 3, the first row has a 2 in the middle. The new columns are filled with 8s to the right of that position.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns if the original row has a 2 in the same row. For example, in the new columns, each new cell is 8 if the original cell is 2. But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns based on the original row's 2s. For example, in the new columns, the 8s are placed in positions that are to the right of the original 2s.\n\nBut this is still unclear. Let's try to think of the transformation as a combination of expanding the grid and replacing certain values.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the output in Example 1, the 8s are in positions that are to the right of the original 2s. For example, the input's second row has a 2 in column 4 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), and the output has 8s starting from column 5. So maybe the 8s are placed to the right of the original 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the exact positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns if the original row has a 2 in the same row. For example, if the original row has a 2 in column i, then in the new columns, starting from i, there are 8s.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAnother approach: think of the output as being generated by adding new columns to the right of each row. The number of new columns is determined by the original row's structure. For example, in Example 3, each row is expanded by adding 3 columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of new columns added is based on the number of 2s in the original row. For example, in Example 3's first row, there is one 2, so two new columns are added. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same row. For example, if the original row has a 2 in column i, then in the new columns, the 8s are placed in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns based on the original row's 2s. For example, for each 2 in the original row, the new columns to the right of it are filled with 8s.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns based on the original row's 2s, and the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in that column.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of expanding the grid and replacing certain values.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 4's output, the first row starts with 8, then 0, 0, then 2, 2, 0. The original input's first row is 2, 2, 0. So the first column is 8, then the next two are 0, then the original 2, 2, 0. So maybe the first column is filled with 8s if there are 2s in the original row.\n\nBut this is not consistent with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the new columns if the original row has a 2 in the same row. For example, in Example 3's first row, the original has a 2. The new columns are filled with 8s. But in Example 4's first row, the original has 2s, and the new columns are filled with 8s in the first column, then 0s.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to think about the transformation in terms of some kind of pattern where the 8s are placed in certain positions based on the original grid's structure.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s are placed in the output grid based on the positions of 2s in the input. For example, if there is a 2 in the input, then in the output, there is an 8 in the same position. But in Example 1, the input's first row has a 2 in the last column. The output's first row has 2 in the same column, and then 8s to the right. So maybe the 8s are placed to the right of the 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the exact positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the output grid in positions that are to the right of the original 2s. For example, in the input's row, for each 2, the output has 8s to the right of it. But how many?\n\nIn Example 3, the first row has a 2 in the middle. The output has 8s in positions 4 and 6. So two 8s. Maybe each 2 in the input leads to two 8s in the output.\n\nIn Example 4's first row, there are two 2s. The output has an 8 in the first column, then 0s, then 2s. So maybe the 8s are placed to the left of the 2s.\n\nThis is getting too inconsistent. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of expanding the grid and replacing certain values based on the original grid's structure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 1. The output has 8s in positions that are to the right of the original 2s. For example, in the input's second row, there is a 2 in column 4. The output's second row has 8s from column 5 to 9. So perhaps the 8s are placed in the new columns to the right of the original 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the number of columns to expand.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the output grid in positions that are to the right of the original 2s, and the number of 8s is determined by the distance from the 2.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in certain positions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven that, maybe the best approach is to look for a pattern where the 8s are placed in the output grid based on the positions of 2s in the input. For example, for each 2 in the input, the output has 8s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the grid to the right, and for each 2 in the input, the output has 8s in the new columns.\n\nBut how?\n\nAnother idea: in Example 3, the output's first row has 8s in columns 3 and 5 (assuming 0-based). The original input's first row has a 2 in column 1. So maybe the 8s are placed at positions that are to the right of the 2, but in the new columns.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are placed in the output grid in positions that are in the same row as the 2s, but to the right of them. For example, in the input's row, if there is a 2 at position i, then in the output's row, positions i+1, i+2, etc., are 8s.\n\nBut how to determine how many 8s to add.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 8s added is based on the number of 2s in the row. For example, if a row has one 2, then two 8s are added. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to think of the transformation as follows: for each cell in the input grid, if it's a 2, then in the output grid, certain positions are 8. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output grid is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output grid is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut this would mean that for each row in the input, the new columns are filled with 8s where the original row has 2s.\n\nBut this doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nFor example, in Example 3's first row, the original row has a 2. The new columns are filled with 8s. But in the output's first row, the new columns are 8, 0, 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same column.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to see a clear pattern. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as a combination of expanding the grid and replacing certain values based on the original grid's structure.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 8s in certain positions that are to the right of the original 2s. For example, the input's first row has a 2 in the last column. The output's first row has 8s in the last five columns. So perhaps the 8s are placed in the new columns to the right of the 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the number of 8s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of 8s added is based on the number of 2s in the original row. For example, if there is one 2 in the original row, then two 8s are added.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to implement a transformation that expands each row to twice the width, and for each 2 in the original row, the new columns are filled with 8s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, for each row in the input, the output row is twice as long. The first half is the original row, and the second half is filled with 8s if there are 2s in the original row.\n\nBut this doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in any position.\n\nBut in Example 3's first row, the original row has a 2, and the new columns are filled with 8s.\n\nBut in Example 4's first row, the original row has 2s, and the new columns are filled with 8s in the first column.\n\nThis is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look for a pattern that can explain multiple examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0\n0 2 2\n0 0 2\n\nOutput:\n0 2 0 8 0 8\n0 2 2 0 0 8\n0 0 2 0 8 8\n\nFor the first row, the new columns are 8 and 0, then 8. So maybe the new columns are filled with 8s in positions that are to the right of the 2s. For example, the original 2 is in column 1, so the new columns are filled with 8 in column 3 and 5.\n\nSimilarly, in the second row, the original row has 2 in column 1 and 2. The new columns are 0, 0, 8. So maybe the new columns are filled with 8 in column 5.\n\nIn the third row, the original row has a 2 in column 2. The new columns are 0, 8, 8.\n\nSo it seems that the new columns are filled with 8s in certain positions based on the original row's 2s.\n\nAnother idea: for each row in the input, the new columns are filled with 8s in positions that are to the right of the 2s in the original row. For example, if the original row has a 2 in column i, then in the new columns, starting from column i, there are 8s.\n\nBut how to determine the number of 8s.\n\nAlternatively, for each row in the input, the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new columns are filled with 8s in positions that are to the right of the original 2s, and the number of 8s is determined by the number of 2s in the row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should look for a pattern that can be implemented. For example, in the output, the 8s are placed in positions that are to the right of the 2s in the input. So for each 2 in the input, the output has 8s to the right of it.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is as follows:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid, if it's a 2, then in the output grid, the same cell is kept as 2, and to the right of it, there are 8s.\n\nBut how to handle the expansion.\n\nAlternatively, the output grid is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and for each 2 in the original row, the corresponding position in the new columns is 8.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and for each 2 in the original row, the new columns are filled with 8s.\n\nFor example, in Example 3's first row, the original row has one 2. The new columns are filled with 8s. But in the output, the new columns are 8, 0, 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut how?\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples and implement it.\n\nLet me try to think of the transformation as follows:\n\nFor each row in the input, the output row is twice as long. The new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in any position. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same column.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 1. The output has 8s in positions that are to the right of the original 2s. For example, in the input's first row, the 2 is at the end. The output's first row has 8s from column 5 onwards.\n\nSo perhaps the 8s are placed to the right of the original 2s. So for each 2 in the input, the output has 8s to the right of it.\n\nBut how to determine how many 8s to add.\n\nMaybe the number of 8s added is based on the number of 2s in the row. For example, if a row has one 2, then two 8s are added to the right of it.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to make a hypothesis and code it.\n\nLet me try to code the following:\n\nFor each row in the input, expand it to twice the width. For each 2 in the original row, add 8s to the right of it.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, for each row in the input, the new row is the original row followed by a copy of the original row. But this is not the case in the examples.\n\nIn Example 3, the input's first row is 0 2 0, and the output is 0 2 0 8 0 8. So the new row is original row + [8, 0, 8]. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new row is the original row followed by a row that has 8s in certain positions.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in any position.\n\nBut in Example 3's first row, the original has a 2, so the new columns are filled with 8s. But in the output, the new columns are 8, 0, 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples and code it.\n\nLet's look at the output of Example 3:\n\nInput row: 0 2 0 \u2192 output row: 0 2 0 8 0 8.\n\nSo the new columns are 8 and 0, then 8. Maybe the new columns are 8, 0, 8. So it's adding 8, 0, 8.\n\nBut why?\n\nMaybe the new columns are filled with 8s in positions that are to the right of the 2 in the original row.\n\nIn this case, the original row has a 2 in column 1 (0-based). The new columns are added to the right. The new columns are 8, 0, 8. So maybe the first new column is 8, then 0, then 8.\n\nBut why?\n\nAlternatively, the new columns are filled with 8s in positions that are to the right of the original row's 2, and the number of 8s is determined by the number of 2s in the row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3's first row, the new columns are 8, 0, 8. The original row has one 2. So maybe the number of 8s added is 2, and the 0 is in between.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is to expand each row to twice the width, and for each 2 in the original row, add 8s to the right of it.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe for each row in the input, the output row is the original row followed by a new part. The new part is determined by the original row.\n\nFor example, if the original row has a 2, then the new part is 8, 0, 8. But this is not consistent with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, the new part is filled with 8s if the original row has a 2.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with a hypothesis that the output is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in any position.\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nMaybe the code is:\n\nFor each row in the input, create a new row that is twice as long. For each position in the new row, if the original row has a 2 in the same column, then the new row's corresponding position is 8. Otherwise, it's 0.\n\nBut this would not fit with the examples.\n\nFor example, in Example 3's first row, the original row is [0, 2, 0]. The new row would be [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]. But the output is [0, 2, 0, 8, 0, 8]. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in any position. For example, in the new columns, all are 8s.\n\nBut this is not the case in Example 3.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck and need to make a guess. Let's look at the test input and see if I can find a pattern.\n\nTest input is a 10x6 grid. The output should be 10x10. So each row is expanded from 6 to 10 columns. The test input has 0s and 2s. The output has 0s and 8s.\n\nLooking at the first row of the test input: 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8. Wait, no. Wait the test input is 10x6, and the output is 10x10. So each row is expanded from 6 to 10 columns.\n\nBut the test input's first row is all 0s. The output's first row is 0s followed by 8s. So maybe the 8s are added to the end of the row if the original row has 2s.\n\nBut in the test input's first row, there are no 2s. So the output's first row is all 0s. But in the test input's second row, there is a 2. The output's second row has 0s and then 8s.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is: for each row, if there is a 2 in the original row, then the new columns are filled with 8s. Otherwise, they are 0s.\n\nBut this would mean that in the test input's first row, which has no 2s, the new columns are 0s. But the test input's first row in the output is 0s followed by 8s. Wait, no, the test input's first row is all 0s. The output's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8? No, the test input's output is not given, but the test input is given for context.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation is to expand each row to twice the width, and for each new column, if the original row has a 2, then the new column is 8, otherwise 0.\n\nBut this would not fit with Example 3, where the original row has a 2 and the new columns are 8, 0, 8.\n\nBut this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in any position. But this would mean that in Example 3, the new columns are all 8s, but the output is not.\n\nSo this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with a hypothesis that the 8s are added to the right of the original 2s, and the number of 8s added is based on the number of 2s in the row.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nPerhaps, for each row in the input, the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in any position. For example, if the row has at least one 2, then the new columns are filled with 8s. Otherwise, they are 0s.\n\nBut this would not explain the examples.\n\nAlternatively, the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the output grid is generated by expanding each row to twice the width, and for each new column, if the original row has a 2 in any position, then the new column is 8. Otherwise, it's 0.\n\nBut this would mean that for Example 3's first row, the new columns are all 8s. But the output is 0 2 0 8 0 8, which is not all 8s.\n\nSo this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: the new columns are filled with 8s if the original row has a 2 in the same column. For example, if the original row has a 2 in column i, then the new columns are filled with 8s in column i.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess and write code based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the output's first row is 0 2 0 8 0 8. The original row is 0 2 0. The new columns are 8, 0, 8. This suggests that the new columns are 8, 0, 8. So maybe the new columns are 8, 0, 8 for rows with a single 2.\n\nIn Example 4, the first row of input is 2 2 0. The output is 8 0 0 2 2 0. So the new columns are 8, 0, 0. This suggests that the new columns are 8, 0, 0 for rows with two 2s.\n\nSo perhaps the new columns are filled with 8s followed by 0s, depending on the number of 2s in the row.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nMaybe the number of 8s added is equal to the number of 2s in the row.\n\nIn Example 3, the first row has one 2, so one 8 is added. But the output has two 8s.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the number of 8s added is equal to the number of 2s in the row plus one.\n\nIn Example 3, one 2, so two 8s.\n\nIn Example 4's first row, two 2s, so three 8s. But the output has one 8.\n\nThis is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to give up and write a code that expands each row to twice the width, and for each new column, if the original row has a 2, then the new column is 8, otherwise 0.\n\nBut this may not fit all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = row * 2\n        new_grid.append(new_row)\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this would not fit the examples. For example, in Example 3, the input is 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 3 rows, each with 6 elements. But the code would duplicate each row, so the new row would be 0 2 0 0 2 0, which is not the case.\n\nSo this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: for each row, the new row is the original row followed by a row of 8s if there are 2s in the original row.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, for each row, the new row is the original row followed by a row of 8s if there are 2s in the original row. Otherwise, 0s.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to proceed with the following code, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output has 8s in the rightmost columns. So perhaps the transformation is to replace all 2s in the input with 8s in the output, and expand the grid to the right.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by replacing each 2 in the input with 8, and expanding the grid to the right with 8s.\n\nBut this would not fit with the examples.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to write a function that replaces 2s with 8s and expands the grid, but I'm not sure.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nFinal answer:\n"
