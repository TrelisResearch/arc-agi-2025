          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain patterns of numbers with specific shapes or patterns.\n2. There appears to be a transformation where certain values (like 1, 2) are replaced with specific patterns that spread out or change in certain ways.\n3. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"expansion\" or \"propagation\" of certain values.\n4. There's a pattern where certain values are replaced with a specific pattern that seems to spread out in a way that forms a kind of \"cross\" or \"diagonal\" shape.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with specific patterns, particularly focusing on the spread of values like 1 and 2.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the pattern to spread (a cross shape)\n    cross_pattern = np.array([\n        [0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0]\n    ])\n    \n    # Define the pattern to spread (a diagonal shape)\n    diagonal_pattern = np.array([\n        [0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0]\n    ])\n    \n    # Function to spread a pattern from a given cell\n    def spread_pattern(x, y, pattern):\n        for i in range(3):\n            for j in range(3):\n                if pattern[i][j] != 0:\n                    # Check if the cell is within bounds\n                    if 0 <= x + i < 30 and 0 <= y + j < 30:\n                        transformed_grid[x + i][y + j] = pattern[i][j]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 1:\n                # Spread the cross pattern from this cell\n                spread_pattern(i, j, cross_pattern)\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 2:\n                # Spread the diagonal pattern from this cell\n                spread_pattern(i, j, diagonal_pattern)\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    cross_pattern = np.array([\n        [0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0]\n    ])\n    \n    diagonal_pattern = np.array([\n        [0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0]\n    ])\n    \n    def spread_pattern(x, y, pattern):\n        for i in range(3):\n            for j in range(3):\n                if pattern[i][j] != 0:\n                    if 0 <= x + i < 30 and 0 <= y + j < 30:\n                        transformed_grid[x + i][y + j] = pattern[i][j]\n    \n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 1:\n                spread_pattern(i, j, cross_pattern)\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 2:\n                spread_pattern(i, j, diagonal_pattern)\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",

The transformation seems to involve replacing certain patterns of numbers with specific shapes or patterns.\n2. There appears to be a transformation where certain values (like 1, 2) are replaced with specific patterns that spread out or change in certain ways.\n3. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"expansion\" or \"propagation\" of certain values.\n4. There's a pattern where certain values are replaced with a specific pattern that seems to spread out in a way that forms a kind of \"cross\" or \"diagonal\" shape.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with specific patterns, particularly focusing on the spread of values like 1 and 2.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the pattern to spread (a cross shape)\n    cross_pattern = np.array([\n        [0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0]\n    ])\n    \n    # Define the pattern to spread (a diagonal shape)\n    diagonal_pattern = np.array([\n        [0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0]\n    ])\n    \n    # Function to spread a pattern from a given cell\n    def spread_pattern(x, y, pattern):\n        for i in range(3):\n            for j in range(3):\n                if pattern[i][j] != 0:\n                    # Check if the cell is within bounds\n                    if 0 <= x + i < 30 and 0 <= y + j < 30:\n                        transformed_grid[x + i][y + j] = pattern[i][j]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 1:\n                # Spread the cross pattern from this cell\n                spread_pattern(i, j, cross_pattern)\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 2:\n                # Spread the diagonal pattern from this cell\n                spread_pattern(i, j, diagonal_pattern)\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    cross_pattern = np.array([\n        [0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0]\n    ])\n    \n    diagonal_pattern = np.array([\n        [0, 0, 0],\n        [0, 1, 0],\n        [0, 0, 0]\n    ])\n    \n    def spread_pattern(x, y, pattern):\n        for i in range(3):\n            for j in range(3):\n                if pattern[i][j] != 0:\n                    if 0 <= x + i < 30 and 0 <= y + j < 30:\n                        transformed_grid[x + i][y + j] = pattern[i][j]\n    \n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 1:\n                spread_pattern(i, j, cross_pattern)\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 2:\n                spread_pattern(i, j, diagonal_pattern)\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
