Input:\n```\n3 1 2\n3 1 2\n3 1 2\n```\nOutput:\n```\n4 5 6\n4 5 6\n4 5 6\n```\n- The pattern looks like the input values are being summed with a number ('+1') or transformed to a fixed set of numbers.  \n- But more simply, notice the input column [3,3,3], [1,1,1], [2,2,2], and output columns are now [4,4,4], [5,5,5], [6,6,6].\n\n2. Input:\n```\n2 3 8\n2 3 8\n2 3 8\n```\nOutput:\n```\n6 4 9\n6 4 9\n6 4 9\n```\n- Input columns: [2,2,2], [3,3,3], [8,8,8]  \n- Output columns: [6,6,6], [4,4,4], [9,9,9]  \n- The first column (2) is doubled to 6, the second (3) is unchanged (but replaced with 4), and the third (8) is transformed to 9.\n\n3. Input:\n```\n5 8 6\n5 8 6\n5 8 6\n```\nOutput:\n```\n1 9 2\n1 9 2\n1 9 2\n```\n- Inputs: [5,5,5], [8,8,8], [6,6,6], replaced with [1,1,1], [9,9,9], [2,2,2]\n\n4. Input:\n```\n9 4 2\n9 4 2\n9 4 2\n```\nOutput:\n```\n8 3 6\n8 3 6\n8 3 6\n```\n- Inputs: [9,9,9], [4,4,4], [2,2,2]\n- Outputs: [8,8,8], [3,3,3], [6,6,6]\n\n**Observation:**\n- Each column seems to be processed independently.\n- The transformations differ, but let's try to find if there's a pattern.\n\n**Potential pattern:**\n- The first column appears in example 2 as doubled (2 to 6; but in examples 3 and 4, it decreases by 4?), in example 4, 9 becomes 8 (decreased by 1), and in example 1, 3 becomes 4 (+1). No clear uniform pattern.\n- The middle column: in example 2, 3 becomes 4, 8 becomes 9; in example 3, 8 becomes 9; in example 4, 4 becomes 3 (decreased by 1). The transformations are inconsistent.\n- The last column: in example 2, 8 becomes 9; in example 4, 2 becomes 6 (which is 2+4?).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is based on the original value:\n\n- For each column, the output might be related to the input + some fixed or variable offset.  \n- Or perhaps, the transformation is to produce a *fixed* pattern per column based on input values.\n\n**Trying a heuristic:**\n\n- For the first column, the value seems to roughly become `(original value + 2)` or `(original value - 1)`. \n- The second column seems to usually increase by 1 or decrease by 1.\n- The third column seems to be shifted or transformed arbitrarily but possibly related to the original value.\n\nGiven the inconsistency, perhaps the only pattern that matches *most* examples is:\n\n- In the first column, add +1 or -1.\n- In the second column, add +1 or -1.\n- In the third column, add +1 or -1.\n\nAlternatively, matching only example 1:\n\n- Columns are increased by fixed amounts:\n  - Column 1: +1\n  - Column 2: +4\n  - Column 3: +4\n- But this doesn't generalize.\n\n**Note:** It's very ambiguous, but considering the multiple transformations, here's a **hypothesis**:\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n\n- Each column is transformed by adding a certain number derived from its original value, possibly using modular arithmetic or a fixed offset.\n- Alternatively, perhaps the transformation involves summation of the original row or column, then mapping to a new set.\n\n**Given the challenging pattern, I'll proceed with a simple assumption:**\n\n- The pattern might be to:\n\n    1. For each column, sum all original column values, then assign that sum or its modular equivalent to all cells in that column.\n\nDoes this match the examples?\n\nCalculations:\n\n- For example 1: input columns are [3,3,3], [1,1,1], [2,2,2].\n\n  - Summaries:\n    - Col 1: 3+3+3=9 -> output: 4\n    - Col 2: 1+1+1=3 -> output: 5\n    - Col 3: 2+2+2=6 -> output: 6\n\n  No obvious direct relation, but outputs are close to these sums.\n\nSimilarly for example 2:\n\n- Input: [2,2,2], [3,3,3], [8,8,8]\n\n  - Col sums: 6, 9, 24.\n\n  Output: 6, 4, 9.\n\nNo clear relation, but see that 6 matches the first col sum, 4 is less than 9, and 9 matches the second sum 9.\n\nThis pattern is too ambiguous.\n\n----\n\n**Alternative approach:**\n\nGiven the diversity, perhaps a better guess is:\n\n- From examples, the output seems to be derived by shifting each column's values into a small set or by applying fixed rules.\n\n- The test input is:\n\n```\n8 1 3\n8 1 3\n8 1 3\n```\n\nBased on previous examples, perhaps the pattern for the first column 8 should be '8 - 1' = 7? Or '8 - 1' in the output? Alternatively, perhaps in others 8 is mapped to 8 or 6.\n\nGiven the vagueness, I will attempt:\n\n### Final hypothesis:\n\n- For each column:\n   - Take the first value (or the column value), and set the output based on a fixed transformation:\n     - For first column: decrement by 1 if value >= 8; else add 1.\n     - For second column: add 1.\n     - For third column: add 3.\n\nThis is an educated guess.\n\nFor the test input: [8,1,3].\n\n- First column: 8 -> 7 (decrement by 1).\n- Second column: 1 -> 2 (+1).\n- Third column: 3 -> 6 (+3).\n\nResult:\n\n```\n7 2 6\n7 2 6\n7 2 6\n```\n\nI think this is a reasonable approach given the pattern.\n\n---\n\n# Implementation\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    # Initialize output array\n    output = np.empty_like(arr)\n    \n    # For each column, apply a guessed transformation\n    for col in range(arr.shape[1]):\n        col_vals = arr[:, col]\n        # Apply heuristic based on input value\n        new_col = []\n        for val in col_vals:\n            if col == 0:\n                # For first column, decrement by 1 if \u22658, else add 1\n                if val >= 8:\n                    new_val = val - 1\n                else:\n                    new_val = val + 1\n            elif col == 1:\n                # For second column, add 1\n                new_val = val + 1\n            else:\n                # For third column, add 3\n                new_val = val + 3\n            # Keep within 0-9\n            new_val = max(0, min(9, new_val))\n            new_col.append(new_val)\n        # Assign the new column back to output\n        output[:, col] = new_col\n    \n    # Convert numpy array back to list of lists\n    transformed_grid = output.tolist()\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
