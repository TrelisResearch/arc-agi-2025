          "Based on the training examples and the test input, a pattern emerges that suggests the transformation involves:\n\n- Detecting prominent \"path\" or \"structure\" shapes (like grids, crosses, or lines)\n- Replacing the central or most prominent color regions with a specific \"highlighted\" color (e.g., 8, 4, or 7) in the output\n- The outer background and non-feature regions are set to a standard background (e.g., 3) in output\n- For input with a central shape, the shape is preserved but recolored with a specific color, while background is homogenized\n- The grid size remains fixed at 23\u00d723, regardless of input\n\nFor the test grid:\n- The input has a clear structure of a grid of 4s, with some outer boundary\n- The pattern seems to involve outlining key features and filling inner areas with a specific color\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n- Detect the main structure (like the \"grid\" shape)\n- Fill the central or certain regions with a distinct color\n- Set the background to a uniform color (3)\n\nGiven these observations and the fact we need a consistent transformation, I will implement a process that:\n\n- Normalizes the grid size to 23\u00d723 (if not already)\n- Detects regions with the highest concentration of a particular value (like 7 or 4)\n- Assigns a specific color (say, 4, matching the pattern in example 3 where 4 is the shape color)\n- Background is set to 3\n- Keep the main shapes intact\n\n---\n\n### Final implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Ensure grid is 23x23\n    size = 23\n    input_grid = np.array(grid)\n    if input_grid.shape != (size, size):\n        # Pad or crop if needed\n        padded = np.zeros((size, size), dtype=int)\n        r, c = input_grid.shape\n        padded[:r, :c] = input_grid\n        input_grid = padded\n\n    # Initialize output with background color 3\n    output_grid = np.full((size, size), 3, dtype=int)\n\n    # Detect the main feature (e.g., the region with the maximum value, often 7 or 4)\n    unique, counts = np.unique(input_grid, return_counts=True)\n    # Exclude background (0) from consideration\n    non_background = {val: cnt for val, cnt in zip(unique, counts) if val != 0}\n    # Identify the most common non-zero value to denote the shape color\n    if non_background:\n        shape_color = max(non_background, key=non_background.get)\n    else:\n        shape_color = 0\n\n    # For the main shape, convert it to a specific color, e.g., 4 (matching example 3)\n    shape_mask = (input_grid == shape_color)\n    # Set the shape pixels to 4\n    output_grid[shape_mask] = 4\n\n    # For the outline, maybe keep the border or prominent pixels as in input - optional\n    # For simplicity, we keep shape as is\n\n    # Return as list of lists\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nThis implementation:\n- Always returns a 23\u00d723 grid\n- Detects the most prominent shape color (excluding background)\n- Recolors it to a specific color (4 in this case, matching the style of example 3)\n- Sets background to 3\n\n**Note:** This is based on observed patterns and may not perfectly generalize, but it captures the idea of identifying and recoloring main shapes with a standard background, similar to the provided examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Ensure grid is 23x23\n    size = 23\n    input_grid = np.array(grid)\n    if input_grid.shape != (size, size):\n        # Pad or crop if needed\n        padded = np.zeros((size, size), dtype=int)\n        r, c = input_grid.shape\n        padded[:r, :c] = input_grid\n        input_grid = padded\n\n    # Initialize output with background color 3\n    output_grid = np.full((size, size), 3, dtype=int)\n\n    # Detect the main feature (e.g., the region with the maximum value, often 7 or 4)\n    unique, counts = np.unique(input_grid, return_counts=True)\n    # Exclude background (0) from consideration\n    non_background = {val: cnt for val, cnt in zip(unique, counts) if val != 0}\n    # Identify the most common non-zero value to denote the shape color\n    if non_background:\n        shape_color = max(non_background, key=non_background.get)\n    else:\n        shape_color = 0\n\n    # For the main shape, convert it to a specific color, e.g., 4 (matching example 3)\n    shape_mask = (input_grid == shape_color)\n    # Set the shape pixels to 4\n    output_grid[shape_mask] = 4\n\n    # Return as list of lists\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"

              "Based on the training examples and the test input, a pattern emerges that suggests the transformation involves:\n\n- Detecting prominent \"path\" or \"structure\" shapes (like grids, crosses, or lines)\n- Replacing the central or most prominent color regions with a specific \"highlighted\" color (e.g., 8, 4, or 7) in the output\n- The outer background and non-feature regions are set to a standard background (e.g., 3) in output\n- For input with a central shape, the shape is preserved but recolored with a specific color, while background is homogenized\n- The grid size remains fixed at 23\u00d723, regardless of input\n\nFor the test grid:\n- The input has a clear structure of a grid of 4s, with some outer boundary\n- The pattern seems to involve outlining key features and filling inner areas with a specific color\n\n**Hypotheses:**\n- Detect the main structure (like the \"grid\" shape)\n- Fill the central or certain regions with a distinct color\n- Set the background to a uniform color (3)\n\nGiven these observations and the fact we need a consistent transformation, I will implement a process that:\n\n- Normalizes the grid size to 23\u00d723 (if not already)\n- Detects regions with the highest concentration of a particular value (like 7 or 4)\n- Assigns a specific color (say, 4, matching the pattern in example 3 where 4 is the shape color)\n- Background is set to 3\n- Keep the main shapes intact\n\n---\n\n### Final implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Ensure grid is 23x23\n    size = 23\n    input_grid = np.array(grid)\n    if input_grid.shape != (size, size):\n        # Pad or crop if needed\n        padded = np.zeros((size, size), dtype=int)\n        r, c = input_grid.shape\n        padded[:r, :c] = input_grid\n        input_grid = padded\n\n    # Initialize output with background color 3\n    output_grid = np.full((size, size), 3, dtype=int)\n\n    # Detect the main feature (e.g., the region with the maximum value, often 7 or 4)\n    unique, counts = np.unique(input_grid, return_counts=True)\n    # Exclude background (0) from consideration\n    non_background = {val: cnt for val, cnt in zip(unique, counts) if val != 0}\n    # Identify the most common non-zero value to denote the shape color\n    if non_background:\n        shape_color = max(non_background, key=non_background.get)\n    else:\n        shape_color = 0\n\n    # For the main shape, convert it to a specific color, e.g., 4 (matching example 3)\n    shape_mask = (input_grid == shape_color)\n    # Set the shape pixels to 4\n    output_grid[shape_mask] = 4\n\n    # For the outline, maybe keep the border or prominent pixels as in input - optional\n    # For simplicity, we keep shape as is\n\n    # Return as list of lists\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nThis implementation:\n- Always returns a 23\u00d723 grid\n- Detects the most prominent shape color (excluding background)\n- Recolors it to a specific color (4 in this case, matching the style of example 3)\n- Sets background to 3\n\n**Note:** This is based on observed patterns and may not perfectly generalize, but it captures the idea of identifying and recoloring main shapes with a standard background, similar to the provided examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Ensure grid is 23x23\n    size = 23\n    input_grid = np.array(grid)\n    if input_grid.shape != (size, size):\n        # Pad or crop if needed\n        padded = np.zeros((size, size), dtype=int)\n        r, c = input_grid.shape\n        padded[:r, :c] = input_grid\n        input_grid = padded\n\n    # Initialize output with background color 3\n    output_grid = np.full((size, size), 3, dtype=int)\n\n    # Detect the main feature (e.g., the region with the maximum value, often 7 or 4)\n    unique, counts = np.unique(input_grid, return_counts=True)\n    # Exclude background (0) from consideration\n    non_background = {val: cnt for val, cnt in zip(unique, counts) if val != 0}\n    # Identify the most common non-zero value to denote the shape color\n    if non_background:\n        shape_color = max(non_background, key=non_background.get)\n    else:\n        shape_color = 0\n\n    # For the main shape, convert it to a specific color, e.g., 4 (matching example 3)\n    shape_mask = (input_grid == shape_color)\n    # Set the shape pixels to 4\n    output_grid[shape_mask] = 4\n\n    # Return as list of lists\n    return output_grid.tolist()\n```"
