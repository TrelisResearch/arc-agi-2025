          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from these training examples. So the task is to transform an input grid into an output grid of size 3x7. Let me look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput is a 3x3 grid (wait, no, the input lines are 9 elements each? Wait, the input for example 1 is three lines, each with 9 elements. Wait, but the output is 3x7. So the input is 3 rows, each with 9 columns? Wait, the input for example 1 is:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 2\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nSo each row has 9 elements. The output is 3 rows, each with 7 elements. So the input is 3x9, output is 3x7. So the transformation reduces the number of columns from 9 to 7. How?\n\nLooking at the output for example 1:\n\nOutput:\n0 2 1 1 0 0 0\n2 2 0 1 2 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHmm. Let's compare each row. Let's take the first input row: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output first row is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So the original row has 9 elements, the output row has 7. How does that mapping happen?\n\nLooking at the output row, maybe the first two elements are the same as the input's first two. Then, maybe some elements are taken from positions 3 and 4? Wait, the input's first row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output first row is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. Wait, where do the 1s come from? Maybe the input's third and fourth elements are 0 and 0, but in the output, they are 1 and 1. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the output is derived from some kind of processing of the input rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in the first row of input, the output is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. Let me think: maybe the first two elements are kept as is. Then, maybe the next elements are determined by some pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. Let's look at the output for example 1. The first row of output is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The input first row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe the third and fourth elements in the input are 0 and 0, but in the output they are replaced by 1s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of transformation where certain cells are kept, and others are replaced based on some rule. For example, maybe the output is a 3x7 grid where each column is derived from the input's columns. But how?\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput is three rows, each with 11 elements. Output is 3 rows, each with 8 elements. So the input is 3x11, output is 3x8. So the transformation is reducing the number of columns by 3 each time. But how?\n\nLooking at the output of example 2:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 1 2 2\n0 2 3 3 1 1 0 2\n\nThe first row of output is 8 zeros. The input first row is 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 0 2 2. So maybe the first row of output is taking some elements from the input's first row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of compression where certain columns are kept and others are removed. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking every third column or something. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in example 1, the output first row is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The input first row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe the third and fourth elements in the input are 0 and 0, but in the output they are 1 and 1. That suggests that maybe the 1s are coming from other parts of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at certain positions in the input. For example, maybe the output is derived from the input by taking certain columns and combining them. Let's look at the output of example 1 again. The first row of output is 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. The input's first row is 0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So the third and fourth elements in the output are 1 and 1. Maybe those come from the input's third and fourth elements, but they are 0 and 0. That doesn't fit. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3:\n\nInput is 3 rows of 11 elements. Output is 3 rows of 9 elements. Wait, no, example 3's output is 3x7? Wait, the output for example 3 is:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6\n0 0 2 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nWait, that's 3 rows, each with 9 elements. But the problem says the output must be 3x7. Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 3x7. But in the examples, the outputs have different numbers of columns. Wait, maybe the examples are not correct? Or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement. The user says that the output must always be 3x7. But in the examples, the outputs have different numbers of columns. For example, example 1's output is 3 rows with 7 elements each. Let me check:\n\nExample 1's output is:\n\n0 2 1 1 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements.\n\nYes. So the output is 3x7. But the input for example 1 is 3 rows of 9 elements. So the transformation reduces the number of columns from 9 to 7. Similarly, example 2's input is 3 rows of 11 elements, output is 3 rows of 8 elements. Example 3's input is 3 rows of 11 elements, output is 3 rows of 9 elements. Wait, but that contradicts the problem statement that the output must be 3x7. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Or perhaps the examples are not correctly formatted. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nLooking at example 2's output:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 8 elements. So that's 3x8? But the problem says the output must be 3x7. That's a problem. Wait, maybe the examples have different numbers of columns. But the problem says that the output must be 3x7. So perhaps the examples are not correctly formatted. Or maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps the examples are not correctly presented. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says that the output must be 3x7. So for example 2, the output must be 3 rows of 7 elements. But according to the given example 2's output, it's 3 rows of 8 elements. That seems inconsistent. So maybe there's a mistake in the examples. Or perhaps I'm misreading the examples. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at example 2's output:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 that's 8 elements. But according to the problem, the output must be 3x7. So this is conflicting. So perhaps the examples are not correctly presented. Or maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the output is 3x7, and the examples have some formatting errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are correct, but the output is 3x7. Let me check example 2 again. The output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 that's 8 elements. So that's not possible. Therefore, there must be a mistake here. But perhaps the user made a typo. Maybe the output for example 2 is 3 rows of 7 elements. Let me check the example 2's output again.\n\nThe example 2's output is written as:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 1 2 2\n0 2 3 3 1 1 0 2\n\nWait, the first line is 8 elements. The second line is 8 elements. The third line is 8 elements. But according to the problem, the output should be 3x7. So this is a contradiction. So perhaps the examples are not correct. But the user provided them as part of the problem. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the output for example 2 is 3x7. Let me recheck the example 2's output. The first line is written as 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 that's 8 elements. But the output should be 3x7. So this is conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the examples are not correct. But the user says that the test input is shown for context. Maybe the examples are not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the output for example 2 is 3x7, and the user made a typo in the example. For example, maybe the output for example 2 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 1 1 0\n\nWhich would be 3 rows of 7 elements. But that's just a guess. However, the user provided the example as is, so I have to work with that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 3x7, but the examples have different numbers of columns. That would mean that the examples are not correctly formatted, but perhaps the user made a mistake. However, given that the problem says that the output must be 3x7, I need to find a pattern that transforms the input into 3x7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples have different numbers of columns because they are not the actual input and output. For example, maybe the input is 3x9, output is 3x7. So the examples are correct. But how?\n\nLet me try to think of a pattern that can transform the input into 3x7. Let's look at example 1 again. The input is 3 rows of 9 elements. The output is 3 rows of 7 elements. So each row is reduced by two elements. How?\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output row 1: 0 2 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nSo the output row has 7 elements. Let's see: the first two elements are same as input. Then, the third and fourth elements in the output are 1 and 1. But the input's third and fourth elements are 0 and 0. So maybe those are replaced with 1s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking certain columns from the input. For example, maybe the first two columns are kept, then columns 3 and 4 are replaced with something, then columns 5 and 6 are replaced with something else. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that involves combining adjacent elements. For example, in the first row of example 1, the third and fourth elements are 0 and 0, but in the output they are 1 and 1. Maybe that's because there's a 1 in the input's second row. Let me check the second row of input:\n\nInput row 2: 2 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 2 \u2192 output row 2: 2 2 0 1 2 2 2.\n\nSo the output row 2 is 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. The input row 2 has elements 2 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 2. So the output row 2 is 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. So the fifth element in the output is 2, which is from the input's fifth element (1) and sixth (0)? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the first two columns, then some other columns, then the last two. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the third and fourth elements in the output are 1 and 1. Looking at the input's second row, there are 1s in positions 4 and 5. Maybe those are influencing the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of rule that involves the positions of the numbers. For example, if a cell in the input has a value of 0, it's replaced with something else based on neighboring cells. But this seems too vague.\n\nLooking at example 4:\n\nInput is 3 rows of 11 elements. Output is 3 rows of 7 elements. Let's look at the input and output for example 4:\n\nInput:\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2\n1 1 0 0 2 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the output is 3 rows of 8 elements. Wait, no, the output for example 4 is:\n\nOutput:\n0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2 \u2192 8 elements\n1 1 0 0 2 2 2 0 \u2192 8 elements\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 8 elements\n\nBut the problem says the output must be 3x7. So this is conflicting again. So perhaps there's a mistake in the examples. But given that the user provided these examples, I need to find a pattern that fits them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for example 4 is 3x7, and the user made a typo. Let me check the example 4's output again. The first line of output is 0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2 \u2192 that's 8 elements. So that's not 7. So this is confusing.\n\nBut the problem says that the output must be 3x7. So maybe the examples have a mistake. But since the user provided them, I need to find a pattern that fits them. Alternatively, maybe the output is 3x7, and the examples have some formatting issues. For example, maybe the output for example 1 is 3 rows of 7 elements, and the user's formatting is incorrect. Let me check example 1's output again:\n\nOutput:\n0 2 1 1 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements\n2 2 0 1 2 2 2 \u2192 7 elements\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements\n\nYes, that's correct. So the first example's output is 3x7. The second example's output is written as 8 elements per row. So that's conflicting. But perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the examples. For example, maybe the output for example 2 is 3 rows of 7 elements. Let me check the example 2's output again.\n\nExample 2's output:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 8 elements\n2 2 0 0 0 1 2 2 \u2192 8 elements\n0 2 3 3 1 1 0 2 \u2192 8 elements\n\nBut according to the problem, the output must be 3x7. So there's a contradiction here. But given that the problem says the output must be 3x7, perhaps the examples are not correct. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples. Alternatively, perhaps the output is 3x7, and the examples are correct, but the way they are presented is different. For example, maybe the output for example 2 is 3 rows of 7 elements, and the user made a typo in the example. For instance, maybe the first line of output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (7 elements), and the second line is 2 2 0 0 0 1 2 (7 elements), and the third line is 0 2 3 3 1 1 0 (7 elements). But the user wrote 8 elements. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example.\n\nBut given that the test input is provided, and the output must be 3x7, I need to find a pattern that transforms the input into 3x7. So perhaps the examples are correct, but the output for example 2 is 3x7, and the user made a mistake in the example's formatting. Let me proceed with the assumption that the examples are correct, and that the output is 3x7.\n\nSo, for example 2, the output is 3x7. Let me think about that. The input for example 2 is 3 rows of 11 elements. The output is 3 rows of 7 elements. So each row is reduced by 4 elements. How?\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 0 2 2 \u2192 output row 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nSo the output is taking some columns from the input. For example, the first three columns are 0,0,0, which are kept. Then, perhaps the next columns are replaced with zeros. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the first row of output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The input's first row has 0,0,0,3,3,0,0,1,0,2,2. So maybe the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are replaced with zeros. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first three elements, then the fifth and sixth, then the eighth and ninth, etc. But this is unclear.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output row 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 but that's 9 elements. Wait, no, the output must be 3x7. So this is conflicting again. But according to the example 3's output, the first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 9 elements. So this is not possible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the examples. But given that the user provided them, I need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are not the correct ones, but the problem is to find a pattern that transforms the input into 3x7. So maybe the pattern is that the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, and combining them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns of the input, then some other columns, and then the last two. For example, in example 1, the output first row is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The input first row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the first two elements are kept. Then, the third and fourth elements in the output are 1 and 1. Where do they come from? Maybe they are derived from the second row of the input. For example, the second row has 2 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 2. So the fourth and fifth elements are 1 and 1. Maybe the output is taking the fourth and fifth elements of the second row and using them as the third and fourth elements in the output. Then, the fifth and sixth elements of the output are 0 and 0, which are from the input's first row's fifth and sixth elements (0 and 0). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, and combining them. For example, the output is formed by taking the first two columns, then the fourth and fifth columns, then the seventh and eighth columns. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in example 1, the output row 1 is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The input row 1 is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the third and fourth elements in the output are 1 and 1. Maybe these are derived from the second row's fourth and fifth elements, which are 1 and 1. So maybe the output is taking elements from the second row. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the first two columns, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that involves the positions of the numbers. For example, if a cell in the input has a value of 0, it is replaced by something based on neighboring cells. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first two columns of the input, then the fourth and fifth columns of the input, then the seventh and eighth columns of the input. But this would give 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 columns, but the output is 7 columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, and then combining them. For example, in example 1, the output is formed by taking columns 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8. But that's 7 columns. Let's see:\n\nInput row 1: columns 0-8 are [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So columns 0,1,3,4,6,7,8 would be [0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. But the output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input and combining them. For example, in example 1, the first row of output is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The third and fourth elements are 1 and 1. So maybe those are derived from the second row's fourth and fifth elements, which are 1 and 1. So the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row. But that would be 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 columns. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input and combining them. For example, the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row. But this is just a guess.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can be applied to all examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output: the first row of output is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The second row is 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. The third row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nLooking at example 4's output: the first row is 0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2. But the output must be 3x7. So perhaps the example 4's output is actually 3x7, and the user made a typo. Let me assume that.\n\nSo, for example 4's output, the first row is 0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2 \u2192 but that's 8 elements. So perhaps it's 0 1 1 2 2 0 2, which is 7 elements. But that would mean that the output is 3x7. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in example 1, the output is 3x7. Let's think of the input as 3 rows of 9 elements, and the output as 3 rows of 7 elements. So each row is reduced by 2 elements. Perhaps the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, and combining them.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output row 1: 0 2 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nSo the first two elements are kept. Then, the third and fourth elements are replaced with 1 and 1. Where do these 1s come from? Maybe from the second row's fourth and fifth elements, which are 1 and 1. So the output row 1's third and fourth elements are taken from the second row's fourth and fifth elements. Then, the fifth and sixth elements are 0 and 0, which are from the first row's fifth and sixth elements. The seventh element is 0, from the first row's seventh element.\n\nBut how does that fit into a pattern? Maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, but combining rows. For example, for the first row of output, the first two columns are from the first row of input. The third and fourth columns are from the second row's fourth and fifth columns. The fifth and sixth columns are from the first row's fifth and sixth columns. The seventh column is from the first row's seventh column. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns of the input, then the fourth and fifth columns of the input, then the seventh and eighth columns of the input. But this would give 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 columns, but the output is 7 columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns, then the fourth and fifth columns of the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns of the first row. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input, and combining them. For example, the first row of output is formed by taking the first two columns, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row. But this would give 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 columns, but the output is 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns of the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns of the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns of the first row, and then the eighth column of the first row. That would give 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 columns. But this is just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 1's output row 1: 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The third and fourth elements are 1 and 1, which are from the second row's fourth and fifth elements (1 and 1). The fifth and sixth elements are 0 and 0, which are from the first row's fifth and sixth elements (0 and 0). The seventh element is 0, from the first row's seventh element. So this would suggest that the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, combining them from different rows.\n\nBut how to generalize this to all examples?\n\nLooking at example 4's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 \u2192 output row 1: 0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2 \u2192 but this is 8 elements, which is not 7. So I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, and for each row in the output, the columns are taken from different rows of the input. For example, the first column of the output is the first column of the input's first row. The second column is the second column of the input's first row. The third column is the fourth column of the input's second row. The fourth column is the fifth column of the input's second row. The fifth column is the sixth column of the input's first row. The sixth column is the seventh column of the input's first row. The seventh column is the eighth column of the input's first row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input and combining them. For example, for each row in the output, the columns are selected from the input's rows in a specific way. For example, in example 1, the first row of output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row. But this is just a guess.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can be implemented in code. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input and combining them, but the exact columns depend on the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first two columns of the input, then the fourth and fifth columns of the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns of the first row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, and for each row in the output, the columns are selected from the input's rows in a certain pattern. For example, the first two columns of the output are the first two columns of the input's first row. Then, the next two columns are the fourth and fifth columns of the input's second row. Then, the next two columns are the sixth and seventh columns of the input's first row. Then, the seventh column is the eighth column of the input's first row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input and combining them, but the exact columns depend on the input's values. For example, if a cell in the input is 0, it is replaced with something based on neighboring cells.\n\nBut without seeing the actual pattern, it's hard to proceed. Given the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for example 1. The first row of output is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The second row is 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. The third row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1:\n\nRow 1: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 2 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 2\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the output's first row is derived from the first two columns of row 1, then the fourth and fifth columns of row 2, then the sixth and seventh columns of row 1, and the eighth column of row 1. But this would give 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 columns.\n\nFor example, the third and fourth elements of the output row are 1 and 1, which are from row 2's fourth and fifth elements (1 and 1). The fifth and sixth elements of the output are 0 and 0, which are from row 1's fifth and sixth elements (0 and 0). The seventh element is 0, from row 1's seventh element (0).\n\nSo the output row is formed by:\n\ncolumns 0, 1 from row 1.\n\ncolumns 3, 4 from row 2.\n\ncolumns 5, 6 from row 1.\n\ncolumn 7 from row 1.\n\nBut this would be 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 columns.\n\nSo for each output row, the columns are selected from different rows of the input.\n\nBut how to generalize this to other examples?\n\nFor example, in example 2, the input is 3 rows of 11 elements. The output is 3 rows of 7 elements.\n\nLet's look at the output for example 2's first row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So all zeros. The input's first row is 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 0 2 2. So maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input's first row, but replacing them with zeros. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, but only if they are 0. Or some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first three columns from the input's first row, then the fifth and sixth columns from the input's first row, then the eighth and ninth columns from the input's first row. But this would give 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 columns. Let's see: for the first row of example 2, input is 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 0 2 2. So columns 0,1,2,4,5,7,8. That would be 0,0,0,3,0,1,0. But the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input's rows and combining them. For example, in example 2's first row, the output is all zeros. Maybe this is because the input's first row has some zeros in certain positions, and those are selected. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time, I think the best approach is to write code that takes the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row, and then the eighth column from the first row. This would give 7 columns. But this is just for example 1. But how to generalize this to other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row, and then the eighth column from the first row. This would be a pattern for example 1.\n\nBut how to apply this to other examples?\n\nFor example, in example 4's input:\n\nInput row 1: 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\nInput row 2: 1 1 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 0\nInput row 3: 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput for example 4 is 3 rows of 7 elements:\n\n0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2 \u2192 but this is 8 elements. Assuming it's 7 elements, maybe the first row is 0 1 1 2 2 0 2.\n\nSo for the first row of output, the first two columns are 0 and 1 from the input's first row. Then, the fourth and fifth columns from the second row (0 and 2). Then, the sixth and seventh columns from the first row (0 and 0). Then, the eighth column from the first row (2). So the output would be 0,1,0,0,2,0,0,2. But this doesn't match the example's output. So this approach is not working.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the first example and try to code it. Even if it doesn't work for other examples, it's better than nothing.\n\nSo, the code would take the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row, and then the eighth column from the first row. But this is just for example 1. However, this would not work for other examples. But given the time, I'll proceed with this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input's rows. For example, the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row. This would give 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 columns, but the output is 7. So maybe adding one more column from the first row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row, and the eighth column from the first row. This gives 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 columns.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the output:\n\noutput_row = [input_row[0], input_row[1]] + [input_row[3], input_row[4]] + [input_row[5], input_row[6]] + [input_row[7]]\n\nBut this is for example 1. Let's check:\n\nFor example 1's first row:\n\ninput_row[0] = 0, input_row[1] = 2 \u2192 [0,2]\n\ninput_row[3] = 0, input_row[4] = 0 \u2192 [0,0]\n\ninput_row[5] = 0, input_row[6] = 0 \u2192 [0,0]\n\ninput_row[7] = 0 \u2192 [0]\n\nSo the output row would be [0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. But the actual output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input's rows, but the columns are determined by the input's values. For example, if a cell is 0, it is replaced with the value from the second row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the third row. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the third row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, but the exact columns depend on the input's values. For example, if a cell is 0, it is replaced with the value from the second row. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the third row. For example, in example 1, the third row of input is [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. So the sixth and seventh columns are 0 and 0. So the output would be [0,2,0,0,1,0,0], but the actual output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples and try to write code that fits at least some of them. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row, and the eighth column from the first row. Even though this doesn't fit example 1, but it's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row, and the eighth column from the second row. Let's try this for example 1:\n\nFirst row of output: [0,2] + [0,1] (from second row's fourth and fifth columns) + [0,0] (from first row's sixth and seventh) + [2] (from second row's eighth column). This would give [0,2,0,1,0,0,2], which doesn't match the example's output of [0,2,1,1,0,0,0].\n\nThis is not working.\n\nGiven the time, I think I should proceed with the following approach: the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, but the exact columns are determined by the input's rows. For example, the first two columns are from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row, and the eighth column from the first row. This is just a guess, but I'll implement it and see.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # grid is a list of 3 rows, each with 9 elements (example 1)\n    # output is 3x7\n    output = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = grid[i]\n        # first two columns from row i\n        part1 = row[0:2]\n        # fourth and fifth columns from row (i+1) % 3\n        # assuming that for row 0, it's row 1, for row 1, it's row 2, for row 2, it's row 0\n        # but this is just a guess\n        # for example, in example 1, row 0 is first row, row 1 is second row\n        # so for row 0 of output, it's row 1's fourth and fifth columns\n        # for row 1 of output, it's row 2's fourth and fifth columns\n        # for row 2 of output, it's row 0's fourth and fifth columns\n        # but this is just a guess\n        # but this is not clear\n        # alternative approach: for each output row, take certain columns from the input rows\n        # for example, first two columns from the first row, then fourth and fifth from the second row, then sixth and seventh from the first row\n        # but this is just a guess\n        # for example, in example 1:\n        # part1 = [0,2]\n        # part2 = row[3], row[4] from second row\n        # part3 = row[5], row[6] from first row\n        # part4 = row[7] from first row\n        # but this would give 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 columns\n        # but for example 1, the part2 is from the second row's fourth and fifth columns, which are 1 and 1\n        # part3 is from first row's sixth and seventh columns, which are 0 and 0\n        # part4 is from first row's eighth column, which is 0\n        # so the output row would be [0,2,1,1,0,0,0], which matches example 1's output\n        # so this is the pattern\n        # so for each output row i:\n        # part1 = row[i][0:2]\n        # part2 = row[(i+1) % 3][3:5]\n        # part3 = row[i][5:7]\n        # part4 = row[i][7]\n        # but this is for example 1. Let's check for other examples.\n\n        # So for output row i, the columns are:\n        # first two columns from row i\n        # fourth and fifth columns from row (i+1) % 3\n        # sixth and seventh columns from row i\n        # eighth column from row i\n\n        # So for example 1, i=0:\n        # part1 = row[0][0:2] = [0,2]\n        # part2 = row[1][3:5] = [1,1]\n        # part3 = row[0][5:7] = [0,0]\n        # part4 = row[0][7] = 0\n        # so combined: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0] which matches.\n\n        # For example 4's first row of output:\n        # row i=0 is input row 0: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\n        # part1 = [0,1]\n        # part2 = row 1 (i+1=1) [3:5] \u2192 row 1 is [1,1,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,0] \u2192 columns 3 and 4 are 0 and 2 \u2192 [0,2]\n        # part3 = row 0 [5:7] \u2192 columns 5 and 6 are 0 and 0 \u2192 [0,0]\n        # part4 = row 0[7] \u2192 0\n        # combined: [0,1,0,2,0,0,0] \u2192 but example 4's output is [0,1,1,2,2,0,2,2], which is not matching. So this approach is not correct.\n\nBut this approach works for example 1. Let's see if it works for example 4.\n\nFor example 4's first row of output:\n\nAccording to the code, it would be [0,1] (from row 0's first two columns), then [0,2] (from row 1's columns 3 and 4), then [0,0] (from row 0's columns 5 and 6), then [0] (from row 0's column 7). So the output row would be [0,1,0,2,0,0,0], but the example's output is [0,1,1,2,2,0,2]. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct and the example is different. Or perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code, even if it doesn't work for all examples. The code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = grid[i]\n        part1 = row[0:2]\n        part2 = grid[(i+1)%3][3:5]\n        part3 = row[5:7]\n        part4 = row[7]\n        combined = part1 + part2 + part3 + [part4]\n        output.append(combined)\n    return output\n\nBut this is for example 1. Let's check for example 1:\n\ni=0, row is [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\npart1 = [0,2]\npart2 = grid[1][3:5] \u2192 grid[1] is [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]. So columns 3 and 4 are 1 and 1 \u2192 [1,1]\npart3 = row[5:7] \u2192 0 and 0 \u2192 [0,0]\npart4 = row[7] \u2192 0\ncombined = [0,2,1,1,0,0,0] \u2192 correct.\n\nFor example 2's first row:\n\ni=0, row is [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,1,0,2,2]. Wait, the input for example 2 is 3 rows of 11 elements. So row is 11 elements. So for part1, row[0:2] is [0,0]. part2 is grid[1][3:5]. grid[1] is [2,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,2]. So columns 3 and 4 are 0 and 0 \u2192 [0,0]. part3 is row[5:7] \u2192 [0,0]. part4 is row[7] \u2192 1. So combined is [0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. But the example's output for first row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut perhaps the code is not correct. However, given the time, I'll proceed with this code, even if it doesn't work for all examples. It's the best I can do.\n\nBut the problem says that the output must be 3x7. So this code would generate 3 rows of 7 elements each. So this is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = grid[i]\n        part1 = row[0:2]\n        part2 = grid[(i+1)%3][3:5]\n        part3 = row[5:7]\n        part4 = row[7]\n        combined = part1 + part2 + part3 + [part4]\n        output.append(combined)\n    return output\n\nBut this code may not work for all examples, but it's based on the pattern observed in example 1.\n\nHowever, in example 2, the code would generate for the first row [0,0,0,0,0,0,1], but the example's output is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So this suggests that the code is incorrect. But perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the code should take part2 from the second row, but not the fourth and fifth columns, but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should take part2 from the second row's fourth and fifth columns, but for example 2, those are 0 and 0, so the code would generate [0,0,0,0,0,0,1], but the example's output is all zeros. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code, as it fits example 1 and may be the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from these training examples. So the task is to transform an input grid into an output grid of size 3x7. Let me look at the examples one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1:\n\nInput is a 3x3 grid (wait, no, the input lines are 9 elements each? Wait, the input for example 1 is three lines, each with 9 elements. Wait, but the output is 3x7. So the input is 3 rows, each with 9 columns? Wait, the input for example 1 is:\n\nInput:\n0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 2\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nSo each row has 9 elements. The output is 3 rows, each with 7 elements. So the input is 3x9, output is 3x7. So the transformation reduces the number of columns from 9 to 7. How?\n\nLooking at the output for example 1:\n\nOutput:\n0 2 1 1 0 0 0\n2 2 0 1 2 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHmm. Let's compare each row. Let's take the first input row: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. The output first row is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So the original row has 9 elements, the output row has 7. How does that mapping happen?\n\nLooking at the output row, maybe the first two elements are the same as the input's first two. Then, maybe some elements are taken from positions 3 and 4? Wait, the input's first row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output first row is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. Wait, where do the 1s come from? Maybe the input's third and fourth elements are 0 and 0, but in the output, they are 1 and 1. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the output is derived from some kind of processing of the input rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in the first row of input, the output is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. Let me think: maybe the first two elements are kept as is. Then, maybe the next elements are determined by some pattern. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. Let's look at the output for example 1. The first row of output is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The input first row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe the third and fourth elements in the input are 0 and 0, but in the output they are replaced by 1s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of transformation where certain cells are kept, and others are replaced based on some rule. For example, maybe the output is a 3x7 grid where each column is derived from the input's columns. But how?\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput is three rows, each with 11 elements. Output is 3 rows, each with 8 elements. So the input is 3x11, output is 3x8. So the transformation is reducing the number of columns by 3 each time. But how?\n\nLooking at the output of example 2:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 1 2 2\n0 2 3 3 1 1 0 2\n\nThe first row of output is 8 zeros. The input first row is 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 0 2 2. So maybe the first row of output is taking some elements from the input's first row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of compression where certain columns are kept and others are removed. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking every third column or something. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in example 1, the output first row is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The input first row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe the third and fourth elements in the input are 0 and 0, but in the output they are 1 and 1. That suggests that maybe the 1s are coming from other parts of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at certain positions in the input. For example, maybe the output is derived from the input by taking certain columns and combining them. Let's look at the output of example 1 again. The first row of output is 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. The input's first row is 0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. So the third and fourth elements in the output are 1 and 1. Maybe those come from the input's third and fourth elements, but they are 0 and 0. That doesn't fit. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3:\n\nInput is 3 rows of 11 elements. Output is 3 rows of 9 elements. Wait, no, example 3's output is 3x7? Wait, the output for example 3 is:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6\n0 0 2 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nWait, that's 3 rows, each with 9 elements. But the problem says the output must be 3x7. Oh, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 3x7. But in the examples, the outputs have different numbers of columns. Wait, maybe the examples are not correct? Or perhaps I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement. The user says that the output must always be 3x7. But in the examples, the outputs have different numbers of columns. For example, example 1's output is 3 rows with 7 elements each. Let me check:\n\nExample 1's output is:\n\n0 2 1 1 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements.\n\nYes. So the output is 3x7. But the input for example 1 is 3 rows of 9 elements. So the transformation reduces the number of columns from 9 to 7. Similarly, example 2's input is 3 rows of 11 elements, output is 3 rows of 8 elements. Example 3's input is 3 rows of 11 elements, output is 3 rows of 9 elements. Wait, but that contradicts the problem statement that the output must be 3x7. So perhaps there's a mistake here. Or perhaps the examples are not correctly formatted. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nLooking at example 2's output:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 8 elements. So that's 3x8? But the problem says the output must be 3x7. That's a problem. Wait, maybe the examples have different numbers of columns. But the problem says that the output must be 3x7. So perhaps the examples are not correctly formatted. Or maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nWait, perhaps the examples are not correctly presented. Let me check again.\n\nThe problem says that the output must be 3x7. So for example 2, the output must be 3 rows of 7 elements. But according to the given example 2's output, it's 3 rows of 8 elements. That seems inconsistent. So maybe there's a mistake in the examples. Or perhaps I'm misreading the examples. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at example 2's output:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 that's 8 elements. But according to the problem, the output must be 3x7. So this is conflicting. So perhaps the examples are not correctly presented. Or maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, perhaps the output is 3x7, and the examples have some formatting errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are correct, but the output is 3x7. Let me check example 2 again. The output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 that's 8 elements. So that's not possible. Therefore, there must be a mistake here. But perhaps the user made a typo. Maybe the output for example 2 is 3 rows of 7 elements. Let me check the example 2's output again.\n\nThe example 2's output is written as:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 1 2 2\n0 2 3 3 1 1 0 2\n\nWait, the first line is 8 elements. The second line is 8 elements. The third line is 8 elements. But according to the problem, the output should be 3x7. So this is a contradiction. So perhaps the examples are not correct. But the user provided them as part of the problem. So maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the output for example 2 is 3x7. Let me recheck the example 2's output. The first line is written as 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 that's 8 elements. But the output should be 3x7. So this is conflicting. Therefore, perhaps the examples are not correct. But the user says that the test input is shown for context. Maybe the examples are not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the output for example 2 is 3x7, and the user made a typo in the example. For example, maybe the output for example 2 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 1 2\n0 2 3 3 1 1 0\n\nWhich would be 3 rows of 7 elements. But that's just a guess. However, the user provided the example as is, so I have to work with that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is 3x7, but the examples have different numbers of columns. That would mean that the examples are not correctly formatted, but perhaps the user made a mistake. However, given that the problem says that the output must be 3x7, I need to find a pattern that transforms the input into 3x7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples have different numbers of columns because they are not the actual input and output. For example, maybe the input is 3x9, output is 3x7. So the examples are correct. But how?\n\nLet me try to think of a pattern that can transform the input into 3x7. Let's look at example 1 again. The input is 3 rows of 9 elements. The output is 3 rows of 7 elements. So each row is reduced by two elements. How?\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output row 1: 0 2 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nSo the output row has 7 elements. Let's see: the first two elements are same as input. Then, the third and fourth elements in the output are 1 and 1. But the input's third and fourth elements are 0 and 0. So maybe those are replaced with 1s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking certain columns from the input. For example, maybe the first two columns are kept, then columns 3 and 4 are replaced with something, then columns 5 and 6 are replaced with something else. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that involves combining adjacent elements. For example, in the first row of example 1, the third and fourth elements are 0 and 0, but in the output they are 1 and 1. Maybe that's because there's a 1 in the input's second row. Let me check the second row of input:\n\nInput row 2: 2 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 2 \u2192 output row 2: 2 2 0 1 2 2 2.\n\nSo the output row 2 is 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. The input row 2 has elements 2 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 2. So the output row 2 is 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. So the fifth element in the output is 2, which is from the input's fifth element (1) and sixth (0)? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the first two columns, then some other columns, then the last two. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the third and fourth elements in the output are 1 and 1. Looking at the input's second row, there are 1s in positions 4 and 5. Maybe those are influencing the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of rule that involves the positions of the numbers. For example, if a cell in the input has a value of 0, it's replaced with something else based on neighboring cells. But this seems too vague.\n\nLooking at example 4:\n\nInput is 3 rows of 11 elements. Output is 3 rows of 7 elements. Let's look at the input and output for example 4:\n\nInput:\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2\n1 1 0 0 2 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the output is 3 rows of 8 elements. Wait, no, the output for example 4 is:\n\nOutput:\n0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2 \u2192 8 elements\n1 1 0 0 2 2 2 0 \u2192 8 elements\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 8 elements\n\nBut the problem says the output must be 3x7. So this is conflicting again. So perhaps there's a mistake in the examples. But given that the user provided these examples, I need to find a pattern that fits them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for example 4 is 3x7, and the user made a typo. Let me check the example 4's output again. The first line of output is 0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2 \u2192 that's 8 elements. So that's not 7. So this is confusing.\n\nBut the problem says that the output must be 3x7. So maybe the examples have a mistake. But since the user provided them, I need to find a pattern that fits them. Alternatively, maybe the output is 3x7, and the examples have some formatting issues. For example, maybe the output for example 1 is 3 rows of 7 elements, and the user's formatting is incorrect. Let me check example 1's output again:\n\nOutput:\n0 2 1 1 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements\n2 2 0 1 2 2 2 \u2192 7 elements\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements\n\nYes, that's correct. So the first example's output is 3x7. The second example's output is written as 8 elements per row. So that's conflicting. But perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the examples. For example, maybe the output for example 2 is 3 rows of 7 elements. Let me check the example 2's output again.\n\nExample 2's output:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 8 elements\n2 2 0 0 0 1 2 2 \u2192 8 elements\n0 2 3 3 1 1 0 2 \u2192 8 elements\n\nBut according to the problem, the output must be 3x7. So there's a contradiction here. But given that the problem says the output must be 3x7, perhaps the examples are not correct. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples. Alternatively, perhaps the output is 3x7, and the examples are correct, but the way they are presented is different. For example, maybe the output for example 2 is 3 rows of 7 elements, and the user made a typo in the example. For instance, maybe the first line of output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (7 elements), and the second line is 2 2 0 0 0 1 2 (7 elements), and the third line is 0 2 3 3 1 1 0 (7 elements). But the user wrote 8 elements. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example.\n\nBut given that the test input is provided, and the output must be 3x7, I need to find a pattern that transforms the input into 3x7. So perhaps the examples are correct, but the output for example 2 is 3x7, and the user made a mistake in the example's formatting. Let me proceed with the assumption that the examples are correct, and that the output is 3x7.\n\nSo, for example 2, the output is 3x7. Let me think about that. The input for example 2 is 3 rows of 11 elements. The output is 3 rows of 7 elements. So each row is reduced by 4 elements. How?\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 0 2 2 \u2192 output row 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 all zeros.\n\nSo the output is taking some columns from the input. For example, the first three columns are 0,0,0, which are kept. Then, perhaps the next columns are replaced with zeros. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the first row of output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The input's first row has 0,0,0,3,3,0,0,1,0,2,2. So maybe the first three elements are kept, then the next elements are replaced with zeros. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first three elements, then the fifth and sixth, then the eighth and ninth, etc. But this is unclear.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output row 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 but that's 9 elements. Wait, no, the output must be 3x7. So this is conflicting again. But according to the example 3's output, the first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 9 elements. So this is not possible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the examples. But given that the user provided them, I need to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are not the correct ones, but the problem is to find a pattern that transforms the input into 3x7. So maybe the pattern is that the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, and combining them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns of the input, then some other columns, and then the last two. For example, in example 1, the output first row is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The input first row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the first two elements are kept. Then, the third and fourth elements in the output are 1 and 1. Where do they come from? Maybe they are derived from the second row of the input. For example, the second row has 2 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 2. So the fourth and fifth elements are 1 and 1. Maybe the output is taking the fourth and fifth elements of the second row and using them as the third and fourth elements in the output. Then, the fifth and sixth elements of the output are 0 and 0, which are from the input's first row's fifth and sixth elements (0 and 0). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, and combining them. For example, the output is formed by taking the first two columns, then the fourth and fifth columns, then the seventh and eighth columns. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in example 1, the output row 1 is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The input row 1 is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the third and fourth elements in the output are 1 and 1. Maybe these are derived from the second row's fourth and fifth elements, which are 1 and 1. So maybe the output is taking elements from the second row. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the first two columns, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that involves the positions of the numbers. For example, if a cell in the input has a value of 0, it is replaced by something based on neighboring cells. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first two columns of the input, then the fourth and fifth columns of the input, then the seventh and eighth columns of the input. But this would give 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 columns, but the output is 7 columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, and then combining them. For example, in example 1, the output is formed by taking columns 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8. But that's 7 columns. Let's see:\n\nInput row 1: columns 0-8 are [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So columns 0,1,3,4,6,7,8 would be [0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. But the output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input and combining them. For example, in example 1, the first row of output is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The third and fourth elements are 1 and 1. So maybe those are derived from the second row's fourth and fifth elements, which are 1 and 1. So the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row. But that would be 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 columns. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input and combining them. For example, the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row. But this is just a guess.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can be applied to all examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output: the first row of output is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The second row is 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. The third row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nLooking at example 4's output: the first row is 0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2. But the output must be 3x7. So perhaps the example 4's output is actually 3x7, and the user made a typo. Let me assume that.\n\nSo, for example 4's output, the first row is 0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2 \u2192 but that's 8 elements. So perhaps it's 0 1 1 2 2 0 2, which is 7 elements. But that would mean that the output is 3x7. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in example 1, the output is 3x7. Let's think of the input as 3 rows of 9 elements, and the output as 3 rows of 7 elements. So each row is reduced by 2 elements. Perhaps the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, and combining them.\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output row 1: 0 2 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nSo the first two elements are kept. Then, the third and fourth elements are replaced with 1 and 1. Where do these 1s come from? Maybe from the second row's fourth and fifth elements, which are 1 and 1. So the output row 1's third and fourth elements are taken from the second row's fourth and fifth elements. Then, the fifth and sixth elements are 0 and 0, which are from the first row's fifth and sixth elements. The seventh element is 0, from the first row's seventh element.\n\nBut how does that fit into a pattern? Maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, but combining rows. For example, for the first row of output, the first two columns are from the first row of input. The third and fourth columns are from the second row's fourth and fifth columns. The fifth and sixth columns are from the first row's fifth and sixth columns. The seventh column is from the first row's seventh column. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns of the input, then the fourth and fifth columns of the input, then the seventh and eighth columns of the input. But this would give 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 columns, but the output is 7 columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns, then the fourth and fifth columns of the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns of the first row. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input, and combining them. For example, the first row of output is formed by taking the first two columns, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row. But this would give 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 columns, but the output is 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns of the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns of the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns of the first row, and then the eighth column of the first row. That would give 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 columns. But this is just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 1's output row 1: 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The third and fourth elements are 1 and 1, which are from the second row's fourth and fifth elements (1 and 1). The fifth and sixth elements are 0 and 0, which are from the first row's fifth and sixth elements (0 and 0). The seventh element is 0, from the first row's seventh element. So this would suggest that the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, combining them from different rows.\n\nBut how to generalize this to all examples?\n\nLooking at example 4's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 \u2192 output row 1: 0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2 \u2192 but this is 8 elements, which is not 7. So I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, and for each row in the output, the columns are taken from different rows of the input. For example, the first column of the output is the first column of the input's first row. The second column is the second column of the input's first row. The third column is the fourth column of the input's second row. The fourth column is the fifth column of the input's second row. The fifth column is the sixth column of the input's first row. The sixth column is the seventh column of the input's first row. The seventh column is the eighth column of the input's first row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input and combining them. For example, for each row in the output, the columns are selected from the input's rows in a specific way. For example, in example 1, the first row of output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row. But this is just a guess.\n\nThis is getting too time-consuming. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can be implemented in code. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input and combining them, but the exact columns depend on the input.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first two columns of the input, then the fourth and fifth columns of the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns of the first row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, and for each row in the output, the columns are selected from the input's rows in a certain pattern. For example, the first two columns of the output are the first two columns of the input's first row. Then, the next two columns are the fourth and fifth columns of the input's second row. Then, the next two columns are the sixth and seventh columns of the input's first row. Then, the seventh column is the eighth column of the input's first row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input and combining them, but the exact columns depend on the input's values. For example, if a cell in the input is 0, it is replaced with something based on neighboring cells.\n\nBut without seeing the actual pattern, it's hard to proceed. Given the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for example 1. The first row of output is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The second row is 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. The third row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1:\n\nRow 1: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 2 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 2\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the output's first row is derived from the first two columns of row 1, then the fourth and fifth columns of row 2, then the sixth and seventh columns of row 1, and the eighth column of row 1. But this would give 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 columns.\n\nFor example, the third and fourth elements of the output row are 1 and 1, which are from row 2's fourth and fifth elements (1 and 1). The fifth and sixth elements of the output are 0 and 0, which are from row 1's fifth and sixth elements (0 and 0). The seventh element is 0, from row 1's seventh element (0).\n\nSo the output row is formed by:\n\ncolumns 0, 1 from row 1.\n\ncolumns 3, 4 from row 2.\n\ncolumns 5, 6 from row 1.\n\ncolumn 7 from row 1.\n\nBut this would be 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 columns.\n\nSo for each output row, the columns are selected from different rows of the input.\n\nBut how to generalize this to other examples?\n\nFor example, in example 2, the input is 3 rows of 11 elements. The output is 3 rows of 7 elements.\n\nLet's look at the output for example 2's first row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So all zeros. The input's first row is 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 0 2 2. So maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input's first row, but replacing them with zeros. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, but only if they are 0. Or some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first three columns from the input's first row, then the fifth and sixth columns from the input's first row, then the eighth and ninth columns from the input's first row. But this would give 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 columns. Let's see: for the first row of example 2, input is 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 0 2 2. So columns 0,1,2,4,5,7,8. That would be 0,0,0,3,0,1,0. But the output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input's rows and combining them. For example, in example 2's first row, the output is all zeros. Maybe this is because the input's first row has some zeros in certain positions, and those are selected. But this is unclear.\n\nGiven the time, I think the best approach is to write code that takes the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row, and then the eighth column from the first row. This would give 7 columns. But this is just for example 1. But how to generalize this to other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row, and then the eighth column from the first row. This would be a pattern for example 1.\n\nBut how to apply this to other examples?\n\nFor example, in example 4's input:\n\nInput row 1: 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\nInput row 2: 1 1 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 0\nInput row 3: 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput for example 4 is 3 rows of 7 elements:\n\n0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2 \u2192 but this is 8 elements. Assuming it's 7 elements, maybe the first row is 0 1 1 2 2 0 2.\n\nSo for the first row of output, the first two columns are 0 and 1 from the input's first row. Then, the fourth and fifth columns from the second row (0 and 2). Then, the sixth and seventh columns from the first row (0 and 0). Then, the eighth column from the first row (2). So the output would be 0,1,0,0,2,0,0,2. But this doesn't match the example's output. So this approach is not working.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the first example and try to code it. Even if it doesn't work for other examples, it's better than nothing.\n\nSo, the code would take the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row, and then the eighth column from the first row. But this is just for example 1. However, this would not work for other examples. But given the time, I'll proceed with this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input's rows. For example, the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row. This would give 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 columns, but the output is 7. So maybe adding one more column from the first row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row, and the eighth column from the first row. This gives 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 columns.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the output:\n\noutput_row = [input_row[0], input_row[1]] + [input_row[3], input_row[4]] + [input_row[5], input_row[6]] + [input_row[7]]\n\nBut this is for example 1. Let's check:\n\nFor example 1's first row:\n\ninput_row[0] = 0, input_row[1] = 2 \u2192 [0,2]\n\ninput_row[3] = 0, input_row[4] = 0 \u2192 [0,0]\n\ninput_row[5] = 0, input_row[6] = 0 \u2192 [0,0]\n\ninput_row[7] = 0 \u2192 [0]\n\nSo the output row would be [0,2,0,0,0,0,0]. But the actual output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input's rows, but the columns are determined by the input's values. For example, if a cell is 0, it is replaced with the value from the second row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the third row. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a different approach. Maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the third row. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, but the exact columns depend on the input's values. For example, if a cell is 0, it is replaced with the value from the second row. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the third row. For example, in example 1, the third row of input is [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]. So the sixth and seventh columns are 0 and 0. So the output would be [0,2,0,0,1,0,0], but the actual output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples and try to write code that fits at least some of them. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row, and the eighth column from the first row. Even though this doesn't fit example 1, but it's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first two columns from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row, and the eighth column from the second row. Let's try this for example 1:\n\nFirst row of output: [0,2] + [0,1] (from second row's fourth and fifth columns) + [0,0] (from first row's sixth and seventh) + [2] (from second row's eighth column). This would give [0,2,0,1,0,0,2], which doesn't match the example's output of [0,2,1,1,0,0,0].\n\nThis is not working.\n\nGiven the time, I think I should proceed with the following approach: the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input, but the exact columns are determined by the input's rows. For example, the first two columns are from the first row, then the fourth and fifth columns from the second row, then the sixth and seventh columns from the first row, and the eighth column from the first row. This is just a guess, but I'll implement it and see.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # grid is a list of 3 rows, each with 9 elements (example 1)\n    # output is 3x7\n    output = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = grid[i]\n        # first two columns from row i\n        part1 = row[0:2]\n        # fourth and fifth columns from row (i+1) % 3\n        # assuming that for row 0, it's row 1, for row 1, it's row 2, for row 2, it's row 0\n        # but this is just a guess\n        # for example, in example 1, row 0 is first row, row 1 is second row\n        # so for row 0 of output, it's row 1's fourth and fifth columns\n        # for row 1 of output, it's row 2's fourth and fifth columns\n        # for row 2 of output, it's row 0's fourth and fifth columns\n        # but this is just a guess\n        # but this is not clear\n        # alternative approach: for each output row, take certain columns from the input rows\n        # for example, first two columns from the first row, then fourth and fifth from the second row, then sixth and seventh from the first row\n        # but this is just a guess\n        # for example, in example 1:\n        # part1 = [0,2]\n        # part2 = row[3], row[4] from second row\n        # part3 = row[5], row[6] from first row\n        # part4 = row[7] from first row\n        # but this would give 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 7 columns\n        # but for example 1, the part2 is from the second row's fourth and fifth columns, which are 1 and 1\n        # part3 is from first row's sixth and seventh columns, which are 0 and 0\n        # part4 is from first row's eighth column, which is 0\n        # so the output row would be [0,2,1,1,0,0,0], which matches example 1's output\n        # so this is the pattern\n        # so for each output row i:\n        # part1 = row[i][0:2]\n        # part2 = row[(i+1) % 3][3:5]\n        # part3 = row[i][5:7]\n        # part4 = row[i][7]\n        # but this is for example 1. Let's check for other examples.\n\n        # So for output row i, the columns are:\n        # first two columns from row i\n        # fourth and fifth columns from row (i+1) % 3\n        # sixth and seventh columns from row i\n        # eighth column from row i\n\n        # So for example 1, i=0:\n        # part1 = row[0][0:2] = [0,2]\n        # part2 = row[1][3:5] = [1,1]\n        # part3 = row[0][5:7] = [0,0]\n        # part4 = row[0][7] = 0\n        # so combined: [0,2,1,1,0,0,0] which matches.\n\n        # For example 4's first row of output:\n        # row i=0 is input row 0: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]\n        # part1 = [0,1]\n        # part2 = row 1 (i+1=1) [3:5] \u2192 row 1 is [1,1,0,0,2,2,0,2,2,0,0] \u2192 columns 3 and 4 are 0 and 2 \u2192 [0,2]\n        # part3 = row 0 [5:7] \u2192 columns 5 and 6 are 0 and 0 \u2192 [0,0]\n        # part4 = row 0[7] \u2192 0\n        # combined: [0,1,0,2,0,0,0] \u2192 but example 4's output is [0,1,1,2,2,0,2,2], which is not matching. So this approach is not correct.\n\nBut this approach works for example 1. Let's see if it works for example 4.\n\nFor example 4's first row of output:\n\nAccording to the code, it would be [0,1] (from row 0's first two columns), then [0,2] (from row 1's columns 3 and 4), then [0,0] (from row 0's columns 5 and 6), then [0] (from row 0's column 7). So the output row would be [0,1,0,2,0,0,0], but the example's output is [0,1,1,2,2,0,2]. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct and the example is different. Or perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code, even if it doesn't work for all examples. The code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = grid[i]\n        part1 = row[0:2]\n        part2 = grid[(i+1)%3][3:5]\n        part3 = row[5:7]\n        part4 = row[7]\n        combined = part1 + part2 + part3 + [part4]\n        output.append(combined)\n    return output\n\nBut this is for example 1. Let's check for example 1:\n\ni=0, row is [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\npart1 = [0,2]\npart2 = grid[1][3:5] \u2192 grid[1] is [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]. So columns 3 and 4 are 1 and 1 \u2192 [1,1]\npart3 = row[5:7] \u2192 0 and 0 \u2192 [0,0]\npart4 = row[7] \u2192 0\ncombined = [0,2,1,1,0,0,0] \u2192 correct.\n\nFor example 2's first row:\n\ni=0, row is [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,1,0,2,2]. Wait, the input for example 2 is 3 rows of 11 elements. So row is 11 elements. So for part1, row[0:2] is [0,0]. part2 is grid[1][3:5]. grid[1] is [2,2,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,2]. So columns 3 and 4 are 0 and 0 \u2192 [0,0]. part3 is row[5:7] \u2192 [0,0]. part4 is row[7] \u2192 1. So combined is [0,0,0,0,0,0,1]. But the example's output for first row is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut perhaps the code is not correct. However, given the time, I'll proceed with this code, even if it doesn't work for all examples. It's the best I can do.\n\nBut the problem says that the output must be 3x7. So this code would generate 3 rows of 7 elements each. So this is acceptable.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        row = grid[i]\n        part1 = row[0:2]\n        part2 = grid[(i+1)%3][3:5]\n        part3 = row[5:7]\n        part4 = row[7]\n        combined = part1 + part2 + part3 + [part4]\n        output.append(combined)\n    return output\n\nBut this code may not work for all examples, but it's based on the pattern observed in example 1.\n\nHowever, in example 2, the code would generate for the first row [0,0,0,0,0,0,1], but the example's output is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So this suggests that the code is incorrect. But perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the code should take part2 from the second row, but not the fourth and fifth columns, but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should take part2 from the second row's fourth and fifth columns, but for example 2, those are 0 and 0, so the code would generate [0,0,0,0,0,0,1], but the example's output is all zeros. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code, as it fits example 1 and may be the best I can do.\n"
