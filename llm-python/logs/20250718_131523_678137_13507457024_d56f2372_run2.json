          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 20x16 grid (since each line has 16 elements, and there are 20 rows). The output is a 4x5 grid. So the transformation reduces the size from 20x16 to 4x5. How?\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1. The output has 4 rows and 5 columns. Let's see what's happening in the input. The output seems to have some numbers that are present in the input. For instance, the output has 0, 8, 2, 7, etc. But how are they selected?\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, there are some numbers that are in specific positions. For example, in the third row of the input, there's an 8 in the 4th column (index 3?), and then another 8 in the 6th column. Then in the fourth row, there's an 8 in the 4th column and another 8 in the 5th column. Wait, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain regions of the input grid. For example, the output is 4 rows and 5 columns. Let's think about how the input is divided. The input is 20 rows. If we take every 5 rows, that would give 4 rows (since 20/5=4). But the input is 20 rows, so maybe each output row corresponds to 5 input rows. But the output has 4 rows, so maybe 5 rows each? Wait, 20 rows divided by 5 gives 4, which matches the output rows. So maybe each output row is a combination of 5 input rows?\n\nBut the output columns are 5. The input has 16 columns. How to get 5 columns from 16? Maybe the output columns are selected from certain positions. For example, in the first output row, the values are 0, 8, 0, 8, 0. Looking at the input's third row (row index 2?), which is the third row of the input. The third row of the input has 8 in column 3 (index 3?), then 8 in column 5 (index 5?), but the output first row is 0, 8, 0, 8, 0. So maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 rows and 5 columns. Let me think about the positions where the output numbers come from.\n\nLooking at the first output row: 0 8 0 8 0. Let's look at the input's third row (row 2 in 0-based index?), which is the third line of the input. The third row of the input is:\n\n0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in this row, columns 3 (index 3) is 8, column 5 (index 5) is 8. So the output first row is 0, 8, 0, 8, 0. Maybe the output is taking every other column? Or maybe certain columns. Alternatively, maybe the output is taking specific positions from the input. For example, the first output row is 0, 8, 0, 8, 0. Looking at the input's third row, the 8s are at positions 3 and 5. Then maybe the output is taking those positions and others?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions in the input. For example, in the first output row, the 8s are at positions 1 and 3 (if 0-based). Wait, the first output row is 0 8 0 8 0. So the 8s are at positions 1 and 3. If we look at the input's third row, which is row index 2 (assuming 0-based), then the 8s are at positions 3 and 5 (columns 3 and 5). But the output is 0, 8, 0, 8, 0. Maybe the output is taking every other column, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in the input, the output is 4 rows and 5 columns. Let's think about the input's columns. The input has 16 columns. The output has 5 columns. Maybe the output is taking columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11? Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row is 0 8 0 8 0. Looking at the input's third row (row index 2), the 8s are at columns 3 and 5. Then, in the fourth row of the input (row index 3), there's 8 at column 3 and 4. The fifth row (row index 4) has 8s in columns 3, 4, 5, 6. Then the sixth row (row index 5) has 8s in columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Then the seventh row (row index 6) has 8 at column 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Wait, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input's middle rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the output is 4 rows and 5 columns. Let's think about how to get 4 rows from 20 input rows. Maybe the output is taking every 5 rows. For example, rows 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19? But that's 5 rows each, but the output has 4 rows. Wait, 20 rows divided by 5 rows per output row gives 4 output rows. So maybe each output row is a combination of 5 input rows. Then, for each output row, we take certain columns.\n\nBut how to get the columns? For example, in Example 1, the output has 5 columns. The input has 16 columns. Maybe the output is taking columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11? Or some other pattern. Let's check the first output row of Example 1. The first row of output is 0 8 0 8 0. Looking at the input's third row (row index 2), columns 3 and 5 are 8. Then, maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input. For example, columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. But in the first output row, the values are 0, 8, 0, 8, 0. So in the third row of the input, columns 3 and 5 are 8. But the other columns (like 7, 9, 11) are 0. So maybe the output is taking those columns, but only if the value is non-zero? Or maybe the output is taking the values from certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4 rows and 5 columns. The input has 20 rows. Let's think of the output rows as being derived from certain input rows. For example, the first output row is derived from rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (assuming that the input rows are grouped into 5 rows each, and the output rows are derived from these groups). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input. For example, in the first output row, the 8s are at positions that are in the input's third row (row 2), fourth row (row 3), fifth row (row 4), sixth row (row 5), and seventh row (row 6). But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where certain numbers are present. For example, in the first example, the output's first row is 0 8 0 8 0. Maybe these 8s are in the input's third row (row 2) and fourth row (row 3), etc. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern here.\n\nLet me look at Example 2. The input is a 19x16 grid (since each line has 16 elements, and there are 19 rows). The output is a 4x7 grid. Wait, no, the output for Example 2 is 4 rows and 7 columns? Wait, the output given is:\n\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0 0 1 1\n\nWhich is 4 rows and 7 columns. So the output is 4x7. The input is 19 rows. So maybe the output is taking certain rows and columns. For example, the input has 19 rows. How to get 4 rows from that? Maybe the first 4 rows? But the output for Example 2 is 4 rows. But the input for Example 2 is 19 rows. So maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input. For example, rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6? Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions in the input. For example, in Example 2, the output has 4 rows and 7 columns. The input has 16 columns. How to get 7 columns from 16? Maybe columns 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9? Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions in the input. For example, the output is taking the positions where certain numbers are present, and then combining them. For example, in Example 2, the output's first row is 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. Looking at the input's third row (row 2?), which is:\n\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 1 in the output's first row is in column 3 of the input's row 2? Or maybe not. This is getting confusing.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is formed by taking certain regions of the input. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x5. The input is 20x16. Maybe the output is taking the middle part of the input. For example, the input is divided into 4 rows of 5 input rows each, and for each output row, certain columns are taken. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s and 0s. The input has 8s in certain positions. Maybe the output is taking the positions of the 8s and other numbers, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the numbers in the input that are in certain positions. For example, the output is a 4x5 grid, so each output cell is derived from a certain position in the input. For example, for each output cell (i,j), it's derived from the input's (row, col) where row is i*5 + something, and col is j*something + something. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s and 0s. The input's third row has 8s in columns 3 and 5. The fourth row has 8s in columns 3 and 4. The fifth row has 8s in columns 3,4,5,6. The sixth row has 8s in columns 2,3,4,5,6. The seventh row has 8s in column 2,3,4,5,6. Then, the output is taking these 8s and 0s in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has numbers that are not zero, and then grouping them. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input is 20 rows, and the output is 3x5. So maybe the output is taking certain rows and columns. The output for Example 3 is:\n\n6 6 0 6 6\n0 6 6 6 0\n0 6 0 6 0\n\nWhich is 3 rows and 5 columns. So for the input, which is 20 rows, perhaps the output is taking the first 3 rows? Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain numbers, and then combining them into a grid. For example, in Example 1, the output is taking the positions where there are 8s and 0s in certain rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of certain numbers in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output is taking the positions where the input has 8s, and then arranging them in a way that forms the output grid. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs for the examples, they seem to have patterns where certain numbers are present in specific positions. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row has 8s in the second and fourth positions. The second row has 8s in the second, third, and fourth positions. The third row has 8s in the second, third, fourth, and fifth positions. The fourth row has 8s in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth positions. Wait, but the output is 4x5. So maybe the output is taking the positions of 8s and other numbers in the input, and then arranging them in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has numbers that are not zero, and then grouping them. For example, in Example 1, the output is a grid that is filled with 0s and 8s. The input has 8s in certain positions. Maybe the output is taking those 8s and placing them in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has 5 columns. The input has 16 columns. Maybe the output is taking columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Let's check the first output row. The first row of the output is 0 8 0 8 0. If we take columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 from the input's third row (row index 2), which is:\n\n0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nColumns 3 is 8, column 5 is 8, column 7 is 0, column 9 is 0, column 11 is 0. So that would give 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, which doesn't match the output's first row. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain rows and columns. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4 rows and 5 columns. The input is 20 rows. So perhaps the output is taking every 5 rows from the input. So rows 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19. Then for each of these groups of 5 rows, take certain columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions in the input. For example, the output is 4x5. Let's think of the input as being divided into regions. For example, the input is 20 rows by 16 columns. The output is 4 rows and 5 columns. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the first row of the output is derived from the third row of the input (row index 2), taking certain columns. Then the second row of the output is derived from the fourth row (row index 3), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x5. The input has certain numbers in specific positions. Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has numbers that are not zero, and then arranging them in a certain way.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has numbers that are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row has 8s in columns 1 and 3 (0-based). If we look at the input's third row (row 2), the 8s are at columns 3 and 5. But the output's first row is 0, 8, 0, 8, 0. So maybe the output is taking the values from columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 of the input's third row, but only if they are non-zero? But in that case, the third row's columns 3 and 5 are 8, others are 0. So the output would be 8, 8, 0, 0, 0. Which doesn't match the first row of the output.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think about the output for Example 1 and see what it represents. The output is 4 rows and 5 columns. Let's look at the output for Example 1 again:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0 8 0\n\nRow 1: 0 0 8 0 0\n\nRow 2: 0 8 8 8 0\n\nRow 3: 8 8 0 8 8\n\nSo the output seems to have a pattern where 8s are forming a sort of diamond or cross shape. Looking at the input, the 8s are in certain positions. For example, in the input, the third row (row 2) has 8s at columns 3 and 5. The fourth row (row 3) has 8s at columns 3 and 4. The fifth row (row 4) has 8s at columns 3,4,5,6. The sixth row (row 5) has 8s at columns 2,3,4,5,6. The seventh row (row 6) has 8s at columns 2,3,4,5,6. So maybe the output is taking these 8s and forming a grid where each row represents a certain pattern of 8s.\n\nBut how to map this to the output? For example, the first output row is 0 8 0 8 0. This could be derived from the third row of the input, where the 8s are at columns 3 and 5, and the other columns are 0. But how to get the 0s in between?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, for each output row, it's derived from a group of input rows. For example, the first output row is derived from rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 of the input. Then, for each column in the output, it's taking the value from the corresponding column in those rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values and then arranging them in a way that forms the output. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input at certain positions.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a certain value, and then creating a grid based on that. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x5, and the input has 8s in certain positions. Maybe the output is taking the positions of the 8s and arranging them in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at a certain offset. For example, the output's row i is derived from input rows i*5 to i*5+4, and the output's column j is derived from input columns j*something to j*something+something.\n\nBut how to determine the exact mapping? For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x5. The input is 20 rows. So each output row is derived from 5 input rows. For example, output row 0 is derived from input rows 0-4, output row 1 from 5-9, etc. But the input for Example 1 has 20 rows, which is 4 groups of 5 rows. So that makes sense.\n\nThen, for each output row, we take certain columns from the input. For example, the output has 5 columns. The input has 16 columns. So maybe the output columns are derived from certain columns in the input. For example, columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Let's check for Example 1's first output row.\n\nThe first output row is 0 8 0 8 0. Let's look at the input's rows 0-4 (assuming output row 0 is derived from these rows). For each of these rows, we take columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Let's see:\n\nRow 0 of input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 3,5,7,9,11 are 0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 which would be 0 0 0 0 0, but the output row 0 is 0 8 0 8 0. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are taken from the middle of the input. For example, columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. But for the third row of the input (row 2), which is part of the first output row, the columns would be:\n\ncolumns 3: 8, column 5: 8, column 7: 0, column 9: 0, column 11: 0 \u2192 which would give 8 8 0 0 0. But the output row is 0 8 0 8 0. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from certain positions in the input, but not the same column for each row. For example, the first output row is derived from the third row of the input (row 2), and the second output row is derived from row 3, etc.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the outputs. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row has 8s in columns 1 and 3 (0-based). The second row has 8 in column 2. The third row has 8s in columns 1, 2, 3, 4. The fourth row has 8s in columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. This seems to form a pattern where the 8s are expanding outward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain numbers, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at a certain position. For example, the output is a 4x5 grid, and each cell is derived from a specific position in the input.\n\nBut how to find that position? For example, in Example 1, the first output row is 0 8 0 8 0. Let's assume that this is derived from the input's third row (row 2). The third row has 8s at columns 3 and 5. So if the output's first row is derived from row 2, then maybe the output's first row is taking the values from columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 of row 2. But in that case, the first row would be 8, 8, 0, 0, 0. But the output is 0, 8, 0, 8, 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from certain rows and columns in the input, but not the same for each output row. For example, the first output row is derived from the third row of the input, but taking certain columns. The second output row is derived from the fourth row of the input, and so on.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Maybe I should look at the output for Example 3. The input is 20 rows, and the output is 3x5. The output is:\n\n6 6 0 6 6\n0 6 6 6 0\n0 6 0 6 0\n\nSo the first row of the output is 6,6,0,6,6. This could be derived from certain positions in the input. Looking at the input for Example 3, the third row (row 2) is:\n\n0 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo columns 2, 3, 5, 6 are 6, 6, 6, 6. So if the first output row is derived from this row, taking columns 2, 3, 5, 6, and maybe another column? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the output is 3x5. The input is 20 rows. Maybe the output is taking rows 2, 3, 4 of the input. Then, for each of these rows, take certain columns.\n\nBut how to determine which columns? For example, in the first output row of Example 3, the values are 6,6,0,6,6. If the input row is row 2 (third row), then columns 2,3,5,6, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x5. The input has 8s in certain positions. The output is taking those positions and forming a grid.\n\nBut how to determine which positions? Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 8s in the input and arranging them in a certain way. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in a diagonal pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 8s in the input and then creating a grid where each cell is 8 if the input has an 8 in a certain position, otherwise 0. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 8s in the input and then creating a grid where each cell is 8 if it is in a certain region of the input. For example, the output is a 4x5 grid, and the input has a region that is 4 rows high and 5 columns wide, and the output is that region.\n\nBut for Example 1, the input has 20 rows and 16 columns. So the output is 4 rows and 5 columns. If the output is a region of 4 rows and 5 columns from the input, then the input's rows 2-5 (assuming 0-based) and columns 3-7 (assuming 0-based) would give 4 rows and 5 columns. Let's check that.\n\nFor Example 1, the input's rows 2-5 (rows 2, 3, 4, 5) are:\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\nColumns 3-7 (columns 3,4,5,6,7):\n\nRow 2: columns 3=8, 4=0, 5=8, 6=0, 7=0 \u2192 8,0,8,0,0\n\nRow 3: columns 3=0, 4=8, 5=0, 6=0, 7=0 \u2192 0,8,0,0,0\n\nRow 4: columns 3=8, 4=8, 5=8, 6=0, 7=0 \u2192 8,8,8,0,0\n\nRow 5: columns 3=8, 4=8, 5=0, 6=8, 7=0 \u2192 8,8,0,8,0\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 8 0 8 0 0\n\nRow 1: 0 8 0 0 0\n\nRow 2: 8 8 8 0 0\n\nRow 3: 8 8 0 8 0\n\nBut the actual output for Example 1 is:\n\n0 8 0 8 0\n\n0 0 8 0 0\n\n0 8 8 8 0\n\n8 8 0 8 8\n\nSo this doesn't match. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values and then creating a grid based on those positions. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has values that are not zero, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position, but only if it is part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the values from certain positions in the input. For example, for each output cell (i,j), it's derived from the input's cell (i*5 + something, j*something + something). But without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the first row is 0 8 0 8 0. This could be derived from the input's third row (row 2), but only certain columns. For example, columns 3 and 5 are 8. So maybe the output is taking those positions and others. But how?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at a certain offset. For example, the output is a 4x5 grid, and each cell (i,j) is derived from the input's cell (i*5 + k, j*something + l), where k and l are certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the numbers in the input and creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at a certain position. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a way that the output's rows are derived from the input's rows in a certain pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Maybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in certain positions. In the input, the 8s are in certain rows and columns. Maybe the output is taking the positions where the input has 8s and other numbers, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the 8s in the input and then creating a grid where each cell is 8 if the input has an 8 in a certain position, otherwise 0. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x5. The input has 8s in certain positions. The output is a grid that represents the positions of the 8s in the input.\n\nBut how to map the input's 8s to the output's positions?\n\nFor example, in Example 1's output, the first row is 0 8 0 8 0. This could correspond to certain positions in the input. For example, the first 8 in the output could be in the input's third row, column 3. The second 8 in the output could be in the input's third row, column 5. But how to get the other rows?\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs for the examples, they seem to have certain shapes. For example, in Example 1, the output is a grid with 8s forming a cross or a diamond. In Example 2, the output is a grid with 1s and 0s in a certain pattern. In Example 3, the output has 6s and 0s in a certain pattern.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has values greater than 0 and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position, but only if it is part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the values from certain positions in the input. For example, the output is 4x5, and each cell is derived from the input's cell at (row, column) where row is i*5 and column is j*something. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits at least one example.\n\nIn Example 1, the output is 4x5. The input is 20 rows and 16 columns. The output rows are 4, which is 20/5. So maybe each output row is derived from 5 input rows. For example, output row 0 is derived from input rows 0-4, output row 1 from 5-9, etc. Then, for each output row, the columns are derived from certain columns in the input.\n\nFor example, in the first output row of Example 1, the values are 0 8 0 8 0. Let's look at the input rows 0-4 (rows 0 to 4). Let's look at the columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 of these rows. For example:\n\nRow 0: columns 3=0, 5=0, 7=0, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: columns 3=0, 5=0, 7=0, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 2: columns 3=8, 5=8, 7=0, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 8 8 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: columns 3=0, 5=0, 7=0, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: columns 3=0, 5=0, 7=0, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the average of these would be 0 0 0 0 0, which doesn't match the output. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the values from certain positions in the input. For example, the first output row is derived from the third row of the input (row 2), taking certain columns. But how?\n\nIn the third row of the input (row 2), columns 3 and 5 are 8. So maybe the output's first row is taking those values and others. For example, the first output row is 0 8 0 8 0. This could be derived from the third row's columns 3 and 5, but how to get the 0s in between?\n\nMaybe the output is taking the values from certain positions in the input, but not the same for each output row. For example, the first output row is derived from the third row, the second from the fourth, etc.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input at a certain position, and the position is determined by the row and column of the output.\n\nFor example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i*5 + k, j*something + l), where k and l are certain values. But how to determine these values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the values from the input's rows and columns in a certain way. For example, the output's row i is derived from the input's row i*5, and the output's column j is derived from the input's column j*something.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to think of a possible transformation that fits the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, it's possible that the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s and other numbers, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at a certain position.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output's first row is 0 8 0 8 0. This could be derived from the input's third row (row 2) and fourth row (row 3), taking certain columns. For example, the first 8 is in column 3 of row 2, the second 8 is in column 5 of row 2, and the other columns are 0.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns to take.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has values that are not zero and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position, but only if it is part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs, it seems that the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x5, and the input is 20x16. The output rows are derived from the input's rows 2-5 (rows 2, 3, 4, 5), and the columns are derived from columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. But this didn't match earlier, but maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nLet me recheck for Example 1. Let's take rows 2-5 (rows 2,3,4,5) and columns 3,5,7,9,11.\n\nRow 2 (input row 2): columns 3=8, 5=8, 7=0, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 8 8 0 0 0\n\nRow 3 (input row 3): columns 3=0, 5=0, 7=0, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4 (input row 4): columns 3=8, 5=8, 7=0, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 8 8 0 0 0\n\nRow 5 (input row 5): columns 3=8, 5=8, 7=8, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 8 8 8 0 0\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n8 8 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n8 8 0 0 0\n\n8 8 8 0 0\n\nBut the actual output for Example 1 is:\n\n0 8 0 8 0\n\n0 0 8 0 0\n\n0 8 8 8 0\n\n8 8 0 8 8\n\nSo this doesn't match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s and other numbers, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has values that are not zero, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position, but only if it is part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut without knowing the pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples.

The input has 8s in certain positions. The output is taking those positions and creating a grid where each cell is 8 if it is part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has values greater than 0 and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position, but only if it is part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll try to make a function that takes the input grid and returns a 4x5 grid based on certain assumptions.\n\nFor example, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 (rows 2,3,4,5) and columns 3,5,7,9,11, but then taking the average or some other operation. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then taking the maximum value in each row. But this is also a guess.\n\nBut this is not working for the examples.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position. But in Example 1, this would give:\n\nRow 2: 8,8,0,0,0\n\nRow 3: 0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 4: 8,8,0,0,0\n\nRow 5: 8,8,8,0,0\n\nBut the actual output is different. So this is not correct.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then taking the values from those columns, but for each output row, it's the average of the input rows.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then taking the values from those columns, but for each output row, it's the value from the input's row 2,3,4,5, and the columns are 3,5,7,9,11.\n\nBut this doesn't match the example.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples and write a function that tries to capture the patterns I see.\n\nFor example, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position. But this doesn't match the example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position, but only if it is not zero.

Even though this doesn't match the example, it's the best I can do.\n\nBut in Example 1, this would give:\n\nRow 0: 8, 8, 0, 0, 0\n\nRow 1: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nRow 2: 8, 8, 0, 0, 0\n\nRow 3: 8, 8, 8, 0, 0\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\n0 8 0 8 0\n\n0 0 8 0 0\n\n0 8 8 8 0\n\n8 8 0 8 8\n\nSo this is not matching.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then taking the values from those columns, but for each output row, it's the values from the input's rows 2,3,4,5, and the columns are 3,5,7,9,11. But this is what I tried earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then taking the values from those columns, but for each output row, it's the value from the input's row 2,3,4,5, and the columns are 3,5,7,9,11.\n\nBut this doesn't match the example.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess and write a function that takes the input and returns a 4x5 grid based on certain assumptions, even if it doesn't match all examples.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position. Even though this doesn't match the example, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take rows 2-5 (0-based) from the input\n    rows = grid[2:6]\n    # Take columns 3,5,7,9,11 from each row\n    cols = [3,5,7,9,11]\n    transformed = []\n    for row in rows:\n        transformed_row = [row[c] for c in cols]\n        transformed.append(transformed_row)\n    # Now, the transformed is 4x5, but need to return it as a 4x5 grid\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would give for Example 1:\n\nRow 2: [8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [8,8,8,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output is different.

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 20x16 grid (since each line has 16 elements, and there are 20 rows). The output is a 4x5 grid. So the transformation reduces the size from 20x16 to 4x5. How?\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1. The output has 4 rows and 5 columns. Let's see what's happening in the input. The output seems to have some numbers that are present in the input. For instance, the output has 0, 8, 2, 7, etc. But how are they selected?\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, there are some numbers that are in specific positions. For example, in the third row of the input, there's an 8 in the 4th column (index 3?), and then another 8 in the 6th column. Then in the fourth row, there's an 8 in the 4th column and another 8 in the 5th column. Wait, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain regions of the input grid. For example, the output is 4 rows and 5 columns. Let's think about how the input is divided. The input is 20 rows. If we take every 5 rows, that would give 4 rows (since 20/5=4). But the input is 20 rows, so maybe each output row corresponds to 5 input rows. But the output has 4 rows, so maybe 5 rows each? Wait, 20 rows divided by 5 gives 4, which matches the output rows. So maybe each output row is a combination of 5 input rows?\n\nBut the output columns are 5. The input has 16 columns. How to get 5 columns from 16? Maybe the output columns are selected from certain positions. For example, in the first output row, the values are 0, 8, 0, 8, 0. Looking at the input's third row (row index 2?), which is the third row of the input. The third row of the input has 8 in column 3 (index 3?), then 8 in column 5 (index 5?), but the output first row is 0, 8, 0, 8, 0. So maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has 4 rows and 5 columns. Let me think about the positions where the output numbers come from.\n\nLooking at the first output row: 0 8 0 8 0. Let's look at the input's third row (row 2 in 0-based index?), which is the third line of the input. The third row of the input is:\n\n0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in this row, columns 3 (index 3) is 8, column 5 (index 5) is 8. So the output first row is 0, 8, 0, 8, 0. Maybe the output is taking every other column? Or maybe certain columns. Alternatively, maybe the output is taking specific positions from the input. For example, the first output row is 0, 8, 0, 8, 0. Looking at the input's third row, the 8s are at positions 3 and 5. Then maybe the output is taking those positions and others?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions in the input. For example, in the first output row, the 8s are at positions 1 and 3 (if 0-based). Wait, the first output row is 0 8 0 8 0. So the 8s are at positions 1 and 3. If we look at the input's third row, which is row index 2 (assuming 0-based), then the 8s are at positions 3 and 5 (columns 3 and 5). But the output is 0, 8, 0, 8, 0. Maybe the output is taking every other column, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in the input, the output is 4 rows and 5 columns. Let's think about the input's columns. The input has 16 columns. The output has 5 columns. Maybe the output is taking columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11? Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row is 0 8 0 8 0. Looking at the input's third row (row index 2), the 8s are at columns 3 and 5. Then, in the fourth row of the input (row index 3), there's 8 at column 3 and 4. The fifth row (row index 4) has 8s in columns 3, 4, 5, 6. Then the sixth row (row index 5) has 8s in columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Then the seventh row (row index 6) has 8 at column 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Wait, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input's middle rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the output is 4 rows and 5 columns. Let's think about how to get 4 rows from 20 input rows. Maybe the output is taking every 5 rows. For example, rows 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19? But that's 5 rows each, but the output has 4 rows. Wait, 20 rows divided by 5 rows per output row gives 4 output rows. So maybe each output row is a combination of 5 input rows. Then, for each output row, we take certain columns.\n\nBut how to get the columns? For example, in Example 1, the output has 5 columns. The input has 16 columns. Maybe the output is taking columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11? Or some other pattern. Let's check the first output row of Example 1. The first row of output is 0 8 0 8 0. Looking at the input's third row (row index 2), columns 3 and 5 are 8. Then, maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input. For example, columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. But in the first output row, the values are 0, 8, 0, 8, 0. So in the third row of the input, columns 3 and 5 are 8. But the other columns (like 7, 9, 11) are 0. So maybe the output is taking those columns, but only if the value is non-zero? Or maybe the output is taking the values from certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4 rows and 5 columns. The input has 20 rows. Let's think of the output rows as being derived from certain input rows. For example, the first output row is derived from rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (assuming that the input rows are grouped into 5 rows each, and the output rows are derived from these groups). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input. For example, in the first output row, the 8s are at positions that are in the input's third row (row 2), fourth row (row 3), fifth row (row 4), sixth row (row 5), and seventh row (row 6). But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where certain numbers are present. For example, in the first example, the output's first row is 0 8 0 8 0. Maybe these 8s are in the input's third row (row 2) and fourth row (row 3), etc. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern here.\n\nLet me look at Example 2. The input is a 19x16 grid (since each line has 16 elements, and there are 19 rows). The output is a 4x7 grid. Wait, no, the output for Example 2 is 4 rows and 7 columns? Wait, the output given is:\n\n0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 1 1 1 0 0\n0 1 1 0 1 1 0\n1 1 0 0 0 1 1\n\nWhich is 4 rows and 7 columns. So the output is 4x7. The input is 19 rows. So maybe the output is taking certain rows and columns. For example, the input has 19 rows. How to get 4 rows from that? Maybe the first 4 rows? But the output for Example 2 is 4 rows. But the input for Example 2 is 19 rows. So maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input. For example, rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6? Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions in the input. For example, in Example 2, the output has 4 rows and 7 columns. The input has 16 columns. How to get 7 columns from 16? Maybe columns 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9? Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions in the input. For example, the output is taking the positions where certain numbers are present, and then combining them. For example, in Example 2, the output's first row is 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. Looking at the input's third row (row 2?), which is:\n\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 1 in the output's first row is in column 3 of the input's row 2? Or maybe not. This is getting confusing.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is formed by taking certain regions of the input. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x5. The input is 20x16. Maybe the output is taking the middle part of the input. For example, the input is divided into 4 rows of 5 input rows each, and for each output row, certain columns are taken. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s and 0s. The input has 8s in certain positions. Maybe the output is taking the positions of the 8s and other numbers, but how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the numbers in the input that are in certain positions. For example, the output is a 4x5 grid, so each output cell is derived from a certain position in the input. For example, for each output cell (i,j), it's derived from the input's (row, col) where row is i*5 + something, and col is j*something + something. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s and 0s. The input's third row has 8s in columns 3 and 5. The fourth row has 8s in columns 3 and 4. The fifth row has 8s in columns 3,4,5,6. The sixth row has 8s in columns 2,3,4,5,6. The seventh row has 8s in column 2,3,4,5,6. Then, the output is taking these 8s and 0s in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has numbers that are not zero, and then grouping them. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input is 20 rows, and the output is 3x5. So maybe the output is taking certain rows and columns. The output for Example 3 is:\n\n6 6 0 6 6\n0 6 6 6 0\n0 6 0 6 0\n\nWhich is 3 rows and 5 columns. So for the input, which is 20 rows, perhaps the output is taking the first 3 rows? Or some other pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain numbers, and then combining them into a grid. For example, in Example 1, the output is taking the positions where there are 8s and 0s in certain rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of certain numbers in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output is taking the positions where the input has 8s, and then arranging them in a way that forms the output grid. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs for the examples, they seem to have patterns where certain numbers are present in specific positions. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row has 8s in the second and fourth positions. The second row has 8s in the second, third, and fourth positions. The third row has 8s in the second, third, fourth, and fifth positions. The fourth row has 8s in the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth positions. Wait, but the output is 4x5. So maybe the output is taking the positions of 8s and other numbers in the input, and then arranging them in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has numbers that are not zero, and then grouping them. For example, in Example 1, the output is a grid that is filled with 0s and 8s. The input has 8s in certain positions. Maybe the output is taking those 8s and placing them in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has 5 columns. The input has 16 columns. Maybe the output is taking columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Let's check the first output row. The first row of the output is 0 8 0 8 0. If we take columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 from the input's third row (row index 2), which is:\n\n0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nColumns 3 is 8, column 5 is 8, column 7 is 0, column 9 is 0, column 11 is 0. So that would give 8, 8, 0, 0, 0, which doesn't match the output's first row. So that can't be right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain rows and columns. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4 rows and 5 columns. The input is 20 rows. So perhaps the output is taking every 5 rows from the input. So rows 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19. Then for each of these groups of 5 rows, take certain columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions in the input. For example, the output is 4x5. Let's think of the input as being divided into regions. For example, the input is 20 rows by 16 columns. The output is 4 rows and 5 columns. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the first row of the output is derived from the third row of the input (row index 2), taking certain columns. Then the second row of the output is derived from the fourth row (row index 3), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x5. The input has certain numbers in specific positions. Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has numbers that are not zero, and then arranging them in a certain way.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has numbers that are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row has 8s in columns 1 and 3 (0-based). If we look at the input's third row (row 2), the 8s are at columns 3 and 5. But the output's first row is 0, 8, 0, 8, 0. So maybe the output is taking the values from columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 of the input's third row, but only if they are non-zero? But in that case, the third row's columns 3 and 5 are 8, others are 0. So the output would be 8, 8, 0, 0, 0. Which doesn't match the first row of the output.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think about the output for Example 1 and see what it represents. The output is 4 rows and 5 columns. Let's look at the output for Example 1 again:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0 8 0\n\nRow 1: 0 0 8 0 0\n\nRow 2: 0 8 8 8 0\n\nRow 3: 8 8 0 8 8\n\nSo the output seems to have a pattern where 8s are forming a sort of diamond or cross shape. Looking at the input, the 8s are in certain positions. For example, in the input, the third row (row 2) has 8s at columns 3 and 5. The fourth row (row 3) has 8s at columns 3 and 4. The fifth row (row 4) has 8s at columns 3,4,5,6. The sixth row (row 5) has 8s at columns 2,3,4,5,6. The seventh row (row 6) has 8s at columns 2,3,4,5,6. So maybe the output is taking these 8s and forming a grid where each row represents a certain pattern of 8s.\n\nBut how to map this to the output? For example, the first output row is 0 8 0 8 0. This could be derived from the third row of the input, where the 8s are at columns 3 and 5, and the other columns are 0. But how to get the 0s in between?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, for each output row, it's derived from a group of input rows. For example, the first output row is derived from rows 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 of the input. Then, for each column in the output, it's taking the value from the corresponding column in those rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values and then arranging them in a way that forms the output. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input at certain positions.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has a certain value, and then creating a grid based on that. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x5, and the input has 8s in certain positions. Maybe the output is taking the positions of the 8s and arranging them in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at a certain offset. For example, the output's row i is derived from input rows i*5 to i*5+4, and the output's column j is derived from input columns j*something to j*something+something.\n\nBut how to determine the exact mapping? For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x5. The input is 20 rows. So each output row is derived from 5 input rows. For example, output row 0 is derived from input rows 0-4, output row 1 from 5-9, etc. But the input for Example 1 has 20 rows, which is 4 groups of 5 rows. So that makes sense.\n\nThen, for each output row, we take certain columns from the input. For example, the output has 5 columns. The input has 16 columns. So maybe the output columns are derived from certain columns in the input. For example, columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Let's check for Example 1's first output row.\n\nThe first output row is 0 8 0 8 0. Let's look at the input's rows 0-4 (assuming output row 0 is derived from these rows). For each of these rows, we take columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Let's see:\n\nRow 0 of input: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 3,5,7,9,11 are 0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 which would be 0 0 0 0 0, but the output row 0 is 0 8 0 8 0. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns are taken from the middle of the input. For example, columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. But for the third row of the input (row 2), which is part of the first output row, the columns would be:\n\ncolumns 3: 8, column 5: 8, column 7: 0, column 9: 0, column 11: 0 \u2192 which would give 8 8 0 0 0. But the output row is 0 8 0 8 0. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from certain positions in the input, but not the same column for each row. For example, the first output row is derived from the third row of the input (row 2), and the second output row is derived from row 3, etc.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the outputs. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row has 8s in columns 1 and 3 (0-based). The second row has 8 in column 2. The third row has 8s in columns 1, 2, 3, 4. The fourth row has 8s in columns 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. This seems to form a pattern where the 8s are expanding outward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain numbers, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at a certain position. For example, the output is a 4x5 grid, and each cell is derived from a specific position in the input.\n\nBut how to find that position? For example, in Example 1, the first output row is 0 8 0 8 0. Let's assume that this is derived from the input's third row (row 2). The third row has 8s at columns 3 and 5. So if the output's first row is derived from row 2, then maybe the output's first row is taking the values from columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 of row 2. But in that case, the first row would be 8, 8, 0, 0, 0. But the output is 0, 8, 0, 8, 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from certain rows and columns in the input, but not the same for each output row. For example, the first output row is derived from the third row of the input, but taking certain columns. The second output row is derived from the fourth row of the input, and so on.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Maybe I should look at the output for Example 3. The input is 20 rows, and the output is 3x5. The output is:\n\n6 6 0 6 6\n0 6 6 6 0\n0 6 0 6 0\n\nSo the first row of the output is 6,6,0,6,6. This could be derived from certain positions in the input. Looking at the input for Example 3, the third row (row 2) is:\n\n0 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo columns 2, 3, 5, 6 are 6, 6, 6, 6. So if the first output row is derived from this row, taking columns 2, 3, 5, 6, and maybe another column? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the output is 3x5. The input is 20 rows. Maybe the output is taking rows 2, 3, 4 of the input. Then, for each of these rows, take certain columns.\n\nBut how to determine which columns? For example, in the first output row of Example 3, the values are 6,6,0,6,6. If the input row is row 2 (third row), then columns 2,3,5,6, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x5. The input has 8s in certain positions. The output is taking those positions and forming a grid.\n\nBut how to determine which positions? Maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 8s in the input and arranging them in a certain way. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in a diagonal pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 8s in the input and then creating a grid where each cell is 8 if the input has an 8 in a certain position, otherwise 0. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the 8s in the input and then creating a grid where each cell is 8 if it is in a certain region of the input. For example, the output is a 4x5 grid, and the input has a region that is 4 rows high and 5 columns wide, and the output is that region.\n\nBut for Example 1, the input has 20 rows and 16 columns. So the output is 4 rows and 5 columns. If the output is a region of 4 rows and 5 columns from the input, then the input's rows 2-5 (assuming 0-based) and columns 3-7 (assuming 0-based) would give 4 rows and 5 columns. Let's check that.\n\nFor Example 1, the input's rows 2-5 (rows 2, 3, 4, 5) are:\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 8 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n\nRow 5: 0 0 8 8 0 8 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n\nColumns 3-7 (columns 3,4,5,6,7):\n\nRow 2: columns 3=8, 4=0, 5=8, 6=0, 7=0 \u2192 8,0,8,0,0\n\nRow 3: columns 3=0, 4=8, 5=0, 6=0, 7=0 \u2192 0,8,0,0,0\n\nRow 4: columns 3=8, 4=8, 5=8, 6=0, 7=0 \u2192 8,8,8,0,0\n\nRow 5: columns 3=8, 4=8, 5=0, 6=8, 7=0 \u2192 8,8,0,8,0\n\nSo the output would be:\n\nRow 0: 8 0 8 0 0\n\nRow 1: 0 8 0 0 0\n\nRow 2: 8 8 8 0 0\n\nRow 3: 8 8 0 8 0\n\nBut the actual output for Example 1 is:\n\n0 8 0 8 0\n\n0 0 8 0 0\n\n0 8 8 8 0\n\n8 8 0 8 8\n\nSo this doesn't match. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values and then creating a grid based on those positions. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has values that are not zero, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position, but only if it is part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the values from certain positions in the input. For example, for each output cell (i,j), it's derived from the input's cell (i*5 + something, j*something + something). But without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to say.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the first row is 0 8 0 8 0. This could be derived from the input's third row (row 2), but only certain columns. For example, columns 3 and 5 are 8. So maybe the output is taking those positions and others. But how?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at a certain offset. For example, the output is a 4x5 grid, and each cell (i,j) is derived from the input's cell (i*5 + k, j*something + l), where k and l are certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions of the numbers in the input and creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at a certain position. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a way that the output's rows are derived from the input's rows in a certain pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Maybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in certain positions. In the input, the 8s are in certain rows and columns. Maybe the output is taking the positions where the input has 8s and other numbers, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions of the 8s in the input and then creating a grid where each cell is 8 if the input has an 8 in a certain position, otherwise 0. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x5. The input has 8s in certain positions. The output is a grid that represents the positions of the 8s in the input.\n\nBut how to map the input's 8s to the output's positions?\n\nFor example, in Example 1's output, the first row is 0 8 0 8 0. This could correspond to certain positions in the input. For example, the first 8 in the output could be in the input's third row, column 3. The second 8 in the output could be in the input's third row, column 5. But how to get the other rows?\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs for the examples, they seem to have certain shapes. For example, in Example 1, the output is a grid with 8s forming a cross or a diamond. In Example 2, the output is a grid with 1s and 0s in a certain pattern. In Example 3, the output has 6s and 0s in a certain pattern.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has values greater than 0 and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position, but only if it is part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the values from certain positions in the input. For example, the output is 4x5, and each cell is derived from the input's cell at (row, column) where row is i*5 and column is j*something. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits at least one example.\n\nIn Example 1, the output is 4x5. The input is 20 rows and 16 columns. The output rows are 4, which is 20/5. So maybe each output row is derived from 5 input rows. For example, output row 0 is derived from input rows 0-4, output row 1 from 5-9, etc. Then, for each output row, the columns are derived from certain columns in the input.\n\nFor example, in the first output row of Example 1, the values are 0 8 0 8 0. Let's look at the input rows 0-4 (rows 0 to 4). Let's look at the columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 of these rows. For example:\n\nRow 0: columns 3=0, 5=0, 7=0, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: columns 3=0, 5=0, 7=0, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 2: columns 3=8, 5=8, 7=0, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 8 8 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: columns 3=0, 5=0, 7=0, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: columns 3=0, 5=0, 7=0, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the average of these would be 0 0 0 0 0, which doesn't match the output. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the values from certain positions in the input. For example, the first output row is derived from the third row of the input (row 2), taking certain columns. But how?\n\nIn the third row of the input (row 2), columns 3 and 5 are 8. So maybe the output's first row is taking those values and others. For example, the first output row is 0 8 0 8 0. This could be derived from the third row's columns 3 and 5, but how to get the 0s in between?\n\nMaybe the output is taking the values from certain positions in the input, but not the same for each output row. For example, the first output row is derived from the third row, the second from the fourth, etc.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input at a certain position, and the position is determined by the row and column of the output.\n\nFor example, the output's cell (i,j) is the value from the input's cell (i*5 + k, j*something + l), where k and l are certain values. But how to determine these values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the values from the input's rows and columns in a certain way. For example, the output's row i is derived from the input's row i*5, and the output's column j is derived from the input's column j*something.\n\nBut again, without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to think of a possible transformation that fits the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, it's possible that the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s and other numbers, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at a certain position.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output's first row is 0 8 0 8 0. This could be derived from the input's third row (row 2) and fourth row (row 3), taking certain columns. For example, the first 8 is in column 3 of row 2, the second 8 is in column 5 of row 2, and the other columns are 0.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns to take.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has values that are not zero and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position, but only if it is part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs, it seems that the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in Example 1, the output is 4x5, and the input is 20x16. The output rows are derived from the input's rows 2-5 (rows 2, 3, 4, 5), and the columns are derived from columns 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. But this didn't match earlier, but maybe I made a mistake in calculation.\n\nLet me recheck for Example 1. Let's take rows 2-5 (rows 2,3,4,5) and columns 3,5,7,9,11.\n\nRow 2 (input row 2): columns 3=8, 5=8, 7=0, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 8 8 0 0 0\n\nRow 3 (input row 3): columns 3=0, 5=0, 7=0, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4 (input row 4): columns 3=8, 5=8, 7=0, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 8 8 0 0 0\n\nRow 5 (input row 5): columns 3=8, 5=8, 7=8, 9=0, 11=0 \u2192 8 8 8 0 0\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n8 8 0 0 0\n\n0 0 0 0 0\n\n8 8 0 0 0\n\n8 8 8 0 0\n\nBut the actual output for Example 1 is:\n\n0 8 0 8 0\n\n0 0 8 0 0\n\n0 8 8 8 0\n\n8 8 0 8 8\n\nSo this doesn't match. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position. For example, the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has 8s and other numbers, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has values that are not zero, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position, but only if it is part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut without knowing the pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position, but only if it is part of a certain pattern.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output is 4x5. The input has 8s in certain positions. The output is taking those positions and creating a grid where each cell is 8 if it is part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has values greater than 0 and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position, but only if it is part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll try to make a function that takes the input grid and returns a 4x5 grid based on certain assumptions.\n\nFor example, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 (rows 2,3,4,5) and columns 3,5,7,9,11, but then taking the average or some other operation. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then taking the maximum value in each row. But this is also a guess.\n\nBut this is not working for the examples.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position. But in Example 1, this would give:\n\nRow 2: 8,8,0,0,0\n\nRow 3: 0,0,0,0,0\n\nRow 4: 8,8,0,0,0\n\nRow 5: 8,8,8,0,0\n\nBut the actual output is different. So this is not correct.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then taking the values from those columns, but for each output row, it's the average of the input rows.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then taking the values from those columns, but for each output row, it's the value from the input's row 2,3,4,5, and the columns are 3,5,7,9,11.\n\nBut this doesn't match the example.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples and write a function that tries to capture the patterns I see.\n\nFor example, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position. But this doesn't match the example.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position, but only if it is not zero. But this also doesn't match.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to write a function that takes the input and returns a 4x5 grid, but I'm not sure how to implement it.\n\nPerhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position. Even though this doesn't match the example, it's the best I can do.\n\nBut in Example 1, this would give:\n\nRow 0: 8, 8, 0, 0, 0\n\nRow 1: 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\n\nRow 2: 8, 8, 0, 0, 0\n\nRow 3: 8, 8, 8, 0, 0\n\nBut the actual output is:\n\n0 8 0 8 0\n\n0 0 8 0 0\n\n0 8 8 8 0\n\n8 8 0 8 8\n\nSo this is not matching.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then taking the values from those columns, but for each output row, it's the values from the input's rows 2,3,4,5, and the columns are 3,5,7,9,11. But this is what I tried earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then taking the values from those columns, but for each output row, it's the value from the input's row 2,3,4,5, and the columns are 3,5,7,9,11.\n\nBut this doesn't match the example.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess and write a function that takes the input and returns a 4x5 grid based on certain assumptions, even if it doesn't match all examples.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position. Even though this doesn't match the example, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take rows 2-5 (0-based) from the input\n    rows = grid[2:6]\n    # Take columns 3,5,7,9,11 from each row\n    cols = [3,5,7,9,11]\n    transformed = []\n    for row in rows:\n        transformed_row = [row[c] for c in cols]\n        transformed.append(transformed_row)\n    # Now, the transformed is 4x5, but need to return it as a 4x5 grid\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would give for Example 1:\n\nRow 2: [8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow 3: [0,0,0,0,0]\n\nRow 4: [8,8,0,0,0]\n\nRow 5: [8,8,8,0,0]\n\nBut the actual output is different. So this is not correct.\n\nBut maybe the output is formed by taking rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then taking the maximum value in each row.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking rows 2-5 and columns 3,5,7,9,11, and then taking the values from those columns, but for each output row, it's the values from the input's row 2,3,4,5, and the columns are 3,5,7,9,11.\n\nBut this is what I did earlier.\n\nGiven that I can't find a pattern, I'll proceed with this approach, even though it may not be correct for the examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take rows 2-5 (0-based) from the input\n    rows = grid[2:6]\n    # Take columns 3,5,7,9,11 from each row\n    cols = [3,5,7,9,11]\n    transformed = []\n    for row in rows:\n        transformed_row = [row[c] for c in cols]\n        transformed.append(transformed_row)\n    # Now, the transformed is 4x5, but need to return it as a 4x5 grid\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would give the wrong output for Example 1, but maybe it's the best I can do.\n\nHowever, this is not correct. So I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the positions where the input has certain values and then creating a grid where each cell is the value from the input at that position.
