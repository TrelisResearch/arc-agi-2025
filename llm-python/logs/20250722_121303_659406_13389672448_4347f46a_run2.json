The transformation seems to involve modifying the grid by:\n   - Keeping the outermost layer (edges) unchanged\n   - Modifying inner layers based on certain rules\n   - Creating patterns of 8s, 6s, 3s, and 7s in specific positions\n\n2. There's a pattern where certain numbers (like 8, 6, 3, 7) are placed in specific positions, and other numbers (like 0) are used to fill in the rest.\n\n3. The transformation seems to involve creating a \"border\" of 0s, then placing numbers in specific positions based on their original positions.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Keeps the outermost layer (edges) as 0s\n- Places 8s in the second row and second column\n- Places 6s in specific positions\n- Places 3s in specific positions\n- Places 7s in specific positions\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
