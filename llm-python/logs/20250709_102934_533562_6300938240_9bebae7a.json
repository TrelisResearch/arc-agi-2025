Next, try to identify a transformation that solves at least one of the training examples.\n\nTraining Example 1 \u2717:\nExpected: [[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0]]\nYour output: [[0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]]\nPixel accuracy: 73.3%\n\nTraining Example 2 \u2717:\nExpected: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nYour output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nPixel accuracy: 83.3%\n\nTraining Example 3 \u2717:\nExpected: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nYour output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0]]\nPixel accuracy: 86.0%\n\nTraining Example 4 \u2717:\nExpected: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 0, 4], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nYour output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [4, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nPixel accuracy: 88.2%\n\nTraining Example 5 \u2717:\nExpected: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]]\nYour output: [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 4, 4, 0, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4, 0, 0]]\nPixel accuracy: 88.8%\n\n"
