The transformation seems to involve propagating values from one cell to neighboring cells, particularly in specific regions of the grid.\n2. In Example 1, the value 1 in the third row spreads to the surrounding cells, and the value 3 appears in specific positions.\n3. In Example 2, the value 1 in the fourth row spreads to surrounding cells, and values like 2, 6, and 4 appear in specific patterns.\n4. In Example 3, the value 1 in the fifth row spreads to surrounding cells, and values like 8, 6, 4, and 2 appear in specific patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Propagating values from a central region to surrounding cells\n- Replacing values in certain regions with new values based on their position and neighboring values\n- Creating a pattern where values spread from a central region outward\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the region where the transformation starts\n    # This is based on the patterns observed in the training examples\n    start_row, start_col = 2, 2\n    end_row, end_col = 7, 7\n    \n    # Create a mask for the region where the transformation starts\n    mask = np.zeros_like(grid_np, dtype=bool)\n    mask[start_row:end_row, start_col:end_col] = True\n    \n    # Create a queue for BFS traversal\n    from collections import deque\n    queue = deque()\n    \n    # Find the starting values\n    for i in range(start_row, end_row):\n        for j in range(start_col, end_col):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Directions for BFS (up, right, down, left)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]\n    \n    # Perform BFS to propagate values\n    while queue:\n        i, j = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we are at the edge of the grid\n        if i == 0 or i == 9 or j == 0 or j == 9:\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the neighboring cell is within the transformation region\n        if mask[i-1][j] or mask[i+1][j] or mask[i][j-1] or mask[i][j+1]:\n            # Propagate the value to the neighboring cell\n            transformed_grid[i-1][j] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i+1][j] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i][j-1] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i][j+1] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            \n            # Add the neighboring cell to the queue if it's not already in the queue\n            if not (mask[i-1][j] and (i-1, j) in queue):\n                queue.append((i-1, j))\n            if not (mask[i+1][j] and (i+1, j) in queue):\n                queue.append((i+1, j))\n            if not (mask[i][j-1] and (i, j-1) in queue):\n                queue.append((i, j-1))\n            if not (mask[i][j+1] and (i, j+1) in queue):\n                queue.append((i, j+1))\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    start_row, start_col = 2, 2\n    end_row, end_col = 7, 7\n    \n    mask = np.zeros_like(grid_np, dtype=bool)\n    mask[start_row:end_row, start_col:end_col] = True\n    \n    from collections import deque\n    queue = deque()\n    \n    for i in range(start_row, end_row):\n        for j in range(start_col, end_col):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n    \n    directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]\n    \n    while queue:\n        i, j = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if i == 0 or i == 9 or j == 0 or j == 9:\n            continue\n        \n        if mask[i-1][j] or mask[i+1][j] or mask[i][j-1] or mask[i][j+1]:\n            transformed_grid[i-1][j] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i+1][j] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i][j-1] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i][j+1] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            \n            if not (mask[i-1][j] and (i-1, j) in queue):\n                queue.append((i-1, j))\n            if not (mask[i+1][j] and (i+1, j) in queue):\n                queue.append((i+1, j))\n            if not (mask[i][j-1] and (i, j-1) in queue):\n                queue.append((i, j-1))\n            if not (mask[i][j+1] and (i, j+1) in queue):\n                queue.append((i, j+1))\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",

The transformation seems to involve propagating values from one cell to neighboring cells, particularly in specific regions of the grid.\n2. In Example 1, the value 1 in the third row spreads to the surrounding cells, and the value 3 appears in specific positions.\n3. In Example 2, the value 1 in the fourth row spreads to surrounding cells, and values like 2, 6, and 4 appear in specific patterns.\n4. In Example 3, the value 1 in the fifth row spreads to surrounding cells, and values like 8, 6, 4, and 2 appear in specific patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Propagating values from a central region to surrounding cells\n- Replacing values in certain regions with new values based on their position and neighboring values\n- Creating a pattern where values spread from a central region outward\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the region where the transformation starts\n    # This is based on the patterns observed in the training examples\n    start_row, start_col = 2, 2\n    end_row, end_col = 7, 7\n    \n    # Create a mask for the region where the transformation starts\n    mask = np.zeros_like(grid_np, dtype=bool)\n    mask[start_row:end_row, start_col:end_col] = True\n    \n    # Create a queue for BFS traversal\n    from collections import deque\n    queue = deque()\n    \n    # Find the starting values\n    for i in range(start_row, end_row):\n        for j in range(start_col, end_col):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Directions for BFS (up, right, down, left)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]\n    \n    # Perform BFS to propagate values\n    while queue:\n        i, j = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we are at the edge of the grid\n        if i == 0 or i == 9 or j == 0 or j == 9:\n            continue\n        \n        # Check if the neighboring cell is within the transformation region\n        if mask[i-1][j] or mask[i+1][j] or mask[i][j-1] or mask[i][j+1]:\n            # Propagate the value to the neighboring cell\n            transformed_grid[i-1][j] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i+1][j] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i][j-1] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i][j+1] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            \n            # Add the neighboring cell to the queue if it's not already in the queue\n            if not (mask[i-1][j] and (i-1, j) in queue):\n                queue.append((i-1, j))\n            if not (mask[i+1][j] and (i+1, j) in queue):\n                queue.append((i+1, j))\n            if not (mask[i][j-1] and (i, j-1) in queue):\n                queue.append((i, j-1))\n            if not (mask[i][j+1] and (i, j+1) in queue):\n                queue.append((i, j+1))\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    start_row, start_col = 2, 2\n    end_row, end_col = 7, 7\n    \n    mask = np.zeros_like(grid_np, dtype=bool)\n    mask[start_row:end_row, start_col:end_col] = True\n    \n    from collections import deque\n    queue = deque()\n    \n    for i in range(start_row, end_row):\n        for j in range(start_col, end_col):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n    \n    directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]\n    \n    while queue:\n        i, j = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if i == 0 or i == 9 or j == 0 or j == 9:\n            continue\n        \n        if mask[i-1][j] or mask[i+1][j] or mask[i][j-1] or mask[i][j+1]:\n            transformed_grid[i-1][j] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i+1][j] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i][j-1] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            transformed_grid[i][j+1] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n            \n            if not (mask[i-1][j] and (i-1, j) in queue):\n                queue.append((i-1, j))\n            if not (mask[i+1][j] and (i+1, j) in queue):\n                queue.append((i+1, j))\n            if not (mask[i][j-1] and (i, j-1) in queue):\n                queue.append((i, j-1))\n            if not (mask[i][j+1] and (i, j+1) in queue):\n                queue.append((i, j+1))\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
