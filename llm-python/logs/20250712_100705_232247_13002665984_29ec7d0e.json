          "From analyzing the training examples and the images, the key observations are:\n\n- The output grids tend to be larger (18x18) and structured uniformly, with recurring patterns.\n- In each example, the transformation appears to **expand** the input pattern into a larger grid, possibly through tiling or repeating the pattern.\n- The training examples show that **patterns or shapes are replicated** across the larger canvas, often maintaining their relative positions.\n- The background color (mostly blue, value 1) fills most of the larger output grid, with complex color arrangements only in certain patches.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n- The main transformation is to \"tile\" the input pattern across the larger 18x18 grid.\n- For each input, the pattern is repeatedly copied in both directions to fill the larger output grid.\n- In some examples, the input pattern is tiled directly, possibly with a specific number of repetitions to fill the size.\n- The core pattern is to resize the input pattern into the 18x18 grid by tiling, possibly with a fixed number of tiles (e.g., 3x3 or 4x4) depending on the input size.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation outline:\n- Determine the size of the input grid.\n- Tile the input pattern to fill a larger grid, resizing tiles or repeating the pattern as necessary to fill 18x18.\n- For simplicity, assume the pattern repeats uniformly in both directions, probably as a multiple (e.g., 6x6 or 3x3 tiles).\n- Since the input size varies, a common approach is to tile the pattern enough times to fill 18x18, possibly with a uniform scale.\n\n---\n\n### Code:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert input to a numpy array for ease of manipulation\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    original_height, original_width = arr.shape\n    \n    # Target size\n    target_size = 18\n    \n    # Determine how many times to tile in each direction\n    tile_rows = target_size // original_height + 1\n    tile_cols = target_size // original_width + 1\n    \n    # Create a tiled version of the pattern\n    tiled = np.tile(arr, (tile_rows, tile_cols))\n    \n    # Crop to exact 18x18\n    transformed_grid = tiled[:target_size, :target_size].tolist()\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis implementation:\n- Tiles the input pattern enough times to cover 18x18.\n- Crops the result to exactly 18x18, ensuring the output size requirement.\n- Preserves the pattern's structure, similar to observed examples.\n\n---\n\n**Final answer:**\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    import numpy as np\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    original_height, original_width = arr.shape\n    \n    target_size = 18\n    tile_rows = target_size // original_height + 1\n    tile_cols = target_size // original_width + 1\n    \n    tiled = np.tile(arr, (tile_rows, tile_cols))\n    transformed_grid = tiled[:target_size, :target_size].tolist()\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
