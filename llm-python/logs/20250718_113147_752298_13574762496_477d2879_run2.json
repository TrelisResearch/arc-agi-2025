The output grid has a more uniform structure with certain values spreading out from specific points\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Replaces certain values with others based on their position and value\n- Applies a spreading effect where certain values influence their neighbors\n- Maintains the 13x13 grid size\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
