          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function that maps input grids to output grids. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some 4s and 2s, and the output changes some of them to 5s and 7s. For instance, in the third row of the input, there's a 0 in the middle. The output changes that to 5. Similarly, in the seventh row, a 3 is replaced by 7. Wait, but in the input, there's a 3 in some positions. Hmm.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 8s and 4s. The output changes the middle 0 to 5. So maybe when there's a 0 in a certain position, it gets replaced by a different number based on surrounding cells?\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has 4s and 0s. The output changes the 0s to 7s. But in the third row, the middle cell is 0, and it becomes 7. But in the fourth row, the middle cell is 0 again, but it's 7 again. So maybe when there's a 0 in a position that's surrounded by 4s, it's replaced by 7?\n\nWait, but in Example 1, there's a 0 in the third row, second column. The output changes that to 5. But in the same row, there's a 4 and then a 5. So maybe the 5 is replacing a 0 that's between two 4s? Or maybe it's based on the surrounding numbers.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the transformation is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, in Example 2, the input has a 8 in the middle of a 3x3 block. The output changes the middle 0 to 5. Similarly, in Example 3, the input has a 4 in the middle of a 3x3 block, and the 0 is replaced by 7. So perhaps when a 0 is in a position that's surrounded by a certain number, it's replaced by another number.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the third row of the input is 0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 4 5 4 0 0 0 2 5 2 0 0 0. So the 0s in positions 2 and 8 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?) are replaced by 5. Maybe those positions are in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced based on their position relative to other numbers. For example, in Example 2, the input has a 8 in the middle of a 3x3 block. The output changes the middle 0 to 5. Similarly, in Example 3, the middle 0 is replaced by 7. So maybe the 0s in certain positions are being replaced by numbers based on the surrounding numbers.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output of Example 1, the 5s and 7s are replacing 0s in certain positions. Let's check the positions where this happens. For example, in the third row, the 0s at positions 2 and 8 (assuming 0-based) are replaced by 5. But in the seventh row, the 0 is replaced by 7. So maybe the replacement depends on the surrounding numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced by numbers that are the average of their neighbors, or some other function. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 4: The input has some 0s that are replaced by 7s and 5s. For example, in the input, the third row has 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 3 3 3 0 0. The output is 0 4 7 7 4 0 0 3 3 3 0 0. So the 0s in positions 2 and 3 (third row) are replaced by 7s. Similarly, in the fourth row, the 0s are replaced by 4s and 7s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the presence of certain numbers in adjacent cells. For example, if a 0 is between two 4s, it becomes 5. Or if it's between 3s and 2s, it becomes 7.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the third row of the input has 0 4 0 4 0 ... So the 0s are between 4s. The output replaces them with 5s. In Example 3, the input has a 4 in the middle, and the 0 is replaced by 7. But in that case, the 0 is in the middle of a 3x3 block of 4s. So maybe when a 0 is in a position that's surrounded by a certain number, it's replaced by a different number.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 0s are being replaced by numbers that are the sum of their neighboring cells divided by something. But that might not fit all examples. For example, in Example 2, the input has a 0 in the middle of a 3x3 block of 8s. The output replaces it with 5. If the sum of the surrounding 8s is 8*4=32, but 32 divided by something gives 5? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced based on the positions in the grid. Like, if a 0 is in a certain row or column, it's replaced by a different number. But that might not be the case.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output for the third row is 0 4 5 4 0 0 0 2 5 2 0 0 0. The 5s are in positions 2 and 8. Let's check the surrounding cells. For example, the 0 in position 2 (third row, second column) is between 4 (position 1) and 4 (position 3). So maybe when a 0 is between two 4s, it's replaced by 5. Similarly, in the seventh row of Example 1, the input has 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, the output for that row is 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 0s in the input are replaced by 7s. But in the input, the seventh row is 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 0s in positions 4 and 5 (assuming 0-based) are replaced by 7s. But why? Because they are between 3 and 3?\n\nIn Example 2, the input is a 6x6 grid. The output changes the middle 0 to 5. The input has 8s in the middle of a 3x3 block. The output replaces the 0 in the middle with 5. So maybe when a 0 is in the center of a 3x3 block of 8s, it becomes 5. Similarly, in Example 3, the input has a 4 in the center of a 3x3 block, and the 0 is replaced by 7.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that when a 0 is in a position that is surrounded by a certain number (like 4 or 8), it's replaced by a different number (like 5 or 7). But how to determine which numbers to replace?\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 0s are being replaced by numbers that are the sum of the surrounding numbers divided by something. For example, in Example 2, the 0 is surrounded by 8s. The sum of the surrounding 8s is 8*4=32, but 32 divided by 6.4 is 5. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the position's coordinates. For example, if a 0 is in a row or column that has certain properties. But that seems unlikely.\n\nLooking at Example 4, the input has a 0 in the third row, third column. The output replaces it with 7. The surrounding cells in that position are 4, 0, 4, and 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced by numbers that are the same as the numbers in the surrounding cells. For example, in Example 2, the 0 is in the middle of 8s. The output replaces it with 5, which is not the same as 8. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Look for the positions where 0s are replaced. For example, in Example 1, the third row's 0s are in positions that are between 4s. In Example 3, the 0s are in positions between 4s. In Example 2, the 0 is between 8s. So perhaps the replacement is based on the value of the surrounding cells. For example, if a 0 is between two 4s, replace with 5. If between two 8s, replace with 5. But why 5?\n\nWait, in Example 1, the third row's 0s are between 4s. The output replaces them with 5. In Example 3, the 0 is between 4s, and replaced with 7. That's conflicting. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. Maybe the replacement depends on the position's coordinates. For example, if a 0 is in a certain row or column, it's replaced by a certain number. But that's not clear from the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced by numbers based on the presence of certain patterns. Like, if a 0 is part of a horizontal line of 4s, replace with 5. But in Example 3, the 0 is in the middle of a vertical line of 4s, and replaced with 7.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern where 0s are replaced by numbers based on their neighbors. For example, if a 0 is surrounded by 4s, replace with 5. If surrounded by 3s, replace with 7. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the sum of the surrounding cells. For example, in Example 2, the 0 is surrounded by 8s. The sum is 8*4=32. 32 divided by 6.4 is 5. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: Looking at the outputs, the numbers 5 and 7 are appearing in the outputs. Maybe these are the results of some operation. For example, 4 + 1 = 5, 3 + 4 = 7. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced by the numbers that are in the same row or column. For example, in Example 1, the third row has 0 4 0 4 0 ... and the output is 0 4 5 4 0 ... So the 5 is between 4 and 4. So maybe the 5 is the average of the two 4s. But 4 + 4 = 8, divided by 2 is 4. Not 5. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is a specific value that's added when there's a certain pattern. Like, if a 0 is in a position that is between two 4s and is part of a horizontal line, replace with 5. Similarly, if between two 3s, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to code this? Maybe for each 0 in the grid, check its neighbors. If the neighbors are 4s, replace with 5. If the neighbors are 3s, replace with 7. But how to determine which neighbors.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the 5s are in positions where there are 4s on both sides. Similarly, the 7s are in positions where there are 3s on both sides. For example, in the seventh row of Example 1, the input is 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 0s between the 3s are replaced by 7s. So maybe when a 0 is between two same numbers (like 3s), it's replaced by 7. Similarly, when between 4s, replaced by 5.\n\nBut then in Example 3, the input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n4 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 4 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n4 7 4 0 0 0\n4 7 4 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 0s in the middle of the 4s are replaced by 7s. So that's between two 4s. But in this case, the replacement is 7. But in Example 1, between two 4s, it's replaced by 5. So that's conflicting. So this suggests that the replacement depends on other factors.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 0s between 4s are replaced by 5, but in Example 3, between 4s, replaced by 7. So maybe the replacement depends on the position in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 0s are in the third row, which is part of a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the surrounding cells. For example, if the surrounding cells are 4, then replace with 5. If the surrounding cells are 3, replace with 7. But why different values?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the distance from the center of the grid. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output of Example 4. The input has a 0 in the third row, third column. The output replaces it with 7. The surrounding cells are 4, 0, 4, and 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the presence of certain numbers in the same row or column. For example, in Example 1, the third row has 0 4 0 4 0 ... and the output is 0 4 5 4 0 ... So the 5 is in the middle. Maybe this is a pattern where if there's a 0 between two 4s, replace with 5, but if it's in a different position, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell to the left and right. For example, if a cell is 0 and its left and right are 4, replace with 5. If left and right are 3, replace with 7. But in Example 3, the 0 is between 4 and 4, but replaced with 7. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe the pattern is that 0s are replaced by numbers that are the sum of the surrounding cells divided by something. For example, in Example 2, the 0 is surrounded by 8s. The sum is 8*4=32. 32 divided by 6.4 is 5. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the number of surrounding cells that are non-zero. For example, if a 0 is surrounded by 4s, replace with 5. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 0s are replaced by the value of the cell that is diagonally adjacent. For example, in Example 1, the third row's 0 is between 4s. The cell above it is 0, and the cell below is 0. But that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced by the value of the cell in the same column but a certain distance away. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the third row has a 0 that is between two 4s. The output replaces it with 5. In Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, but replaced with 7. So maybe the replacement depends on the row or column.\n\nLooking at the rows in Example 1:\n\nRow 2: 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 \u2192 output is same as input.\n\nRow 3: input is 0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 0 4 5 4 0 0 0 2 5 2 0 0 0.\n\nSo the 0s in positions 2 and 8 (assuming 0-based) are replaced by 5.\n\nRow 7: input is 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 0s in positions 4 and 5 (assuming 0-based) are replaced by 7.\n\nSo in these cases, the 0s are replaced by 5 or 7 based on their position. But why?\n\nMaybe the replacement depends on the row and column. For example, in even rows, replace with 5, odd rows with 7? But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the position's coordinates. For example, if the row is even, replace with 5, else 7. But that's just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1, row 3 is the third row (assuming 0-based, it's row 2). The 0s are replaced with 5. Row 7 is the seventh row (0-based 6). The 0s are replaced with 7. So maybe if the row is even (0-based), replace with 5, else 7? But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the position's distance from the center of the grid. But the grid is 13x13, so the center is at (6,6). The 0s in row 3 (0-based 2) are closer to the center than those in row 6 (0-based 5). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced based on the value of the cell directly above or below. For example, in row 3, the cell above is 0 (row 2) and the cell below is 0 (row 4). So no help.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 0s with certain values based on their neighbors. For example, if the cell to the left is 4 and the cell to the right is 4, then replace with 5. If the cell above is 3 and the cell below is 3, replace with 7. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the presence of a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the third row has a 0 between two 4s, and the output replaces it with 5. In Example 3, the same pattern (between two 4s) is replaced with 7. So this suggests that the replacement is not consistent. Hence, perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 0s are replaced based on the value of the cell that is diagonally adjacent. For example, in Example 1, the third row's 0 is between two 4s. The cell above it is 0, and the cell below is 0. But that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell to the left and the cell to the right. For example, if both are 4, replace with 5. If both are 3, replace with 7. But in Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, and replaced with 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that when a 0 is in a position that is part of a horizontal line of 4s, it's replaced with 5, and when it's part of a horizontal line of 3s, it's replaced with 7. But in Example 3, the 0 is part of a vertical line of 4s, but replaced with 7. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, and the cell above and below. For example, if the left and right are 4, and the above and below are 0, then replace with 5. But that's just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to find a way to code this. Maybe the pattern is that 0s are replaced by 5 if they are between two 4s, and by 7 if between two 3s. But how to handle other cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced by the value of the cell to the left, if it's non-zero. For example, in Example 1, the 0 in the third row, second column is between 4 and 4. So the replacement is 5. But why 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell to the left and the cell to the right. For example, if the left is 4 and right is 4, then replace with 5. If left is 3 and right is 3, replace with 7. If left is 8 and right is 8, replace with 5. But this would explain some examples.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the examples:\n\nExample 2: input is a 6x6 grid. The third row is 0 8 8 8 0 0. The output is 0 8 8 8 0 0. So no replacement. Wait, but in Example 2, the input is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 8 0 8 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 8 5 8 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in the third row, the 0 is between 8 and 8. So according to the hypothesis, it should be replaced with 5. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the input is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n4 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 4 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n4 7 4 0 0 0\n4 7 4 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in the third row, the 0 is between 4 and 4. According to the hypothesis, it should be replaced with 5, but the output is 7. So this contradicts the hypothesis. Hence, the pattern is not consistent.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the replacement is not based solely on the left and right cells. So perhaps there's another factor.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the third row is 4 0 4 0 0 0. The output is 4 7 4 0 0 0. So the 0 between 4 and 4 is replaced with 7. But in Example 2, the same pattern is replaced with 5. So why the difference?\n\nMaybe the replacement depends on the position in the grid. Like, if the row is even, replace with 5, if odd, replace with 7. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 2, the third row is row index 2 (0-based), which is even. The replacement is 5. In Example 3, the third row is row index 2, which is even, but replaced with 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it depends on the column. For example, in Example 2, the 0 is in column 2 (0-based), replaced with 5. In Example 3, the 0 is in column 1 (0-based), replaced with 7. So that's not consistent.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the pattern is that when a 0 is between two 4s, and it's in a certain part of the grid, it's replaced with 5, but in other parts, replaced with 7. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell above and below. For example, in Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, but the cell above is 4 and the cell below is 4. So why is it replaced with 7?\n\nMaybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell to the left and right, and the value of the cell above and below. For example, if the left and right are 4, and the above and below are 4, replace with 5. But in Example 3, the cell above is 4, and the cell below is 4. So why is it replaced with 7?\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of patterns. For example, in the examples, the 0s are replaced with numbers that are 5 or 7, and these numbers are related to the surrounding cells. Perhaps the 5 is for 4s and 7 for 3s.\n\nIn Example 1, the 0s are between 4s and replaced with 5. In Example 3, the 0s are between 4s and replaced with 7. So that's conflicting. But in Example 4, the 0s are between 4s and replaced with 7.\n\nWait, in Example 4, the input has a 0 in the third row, third column. The surrounding cells are 4, 0, 4, and 3. The output replaces it with 7. So perhaps the replacement is based on the presence of a 3 in the surrounding cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell to the left and right, and the cell above and below. For example, if the left is 4, right is 4, and the cell above is 3, then replace with 7. But this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. The most consistent pattern I see is that when a 0 is between two 4s, it's replaced with 5 or 7, depending on other factors. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell in the same row and column. For example, if the cell to the left is 4 and the cell to the right is 4, replace with 5. If the cell to the left is 3 and the cell to the right is 3, replace with 7. But this would explain some examples, but not all.\n\nLet's try to code this. For each cell in the grid, if it's a 0, check the left and right cells. If both are 4, replace with 5. If both are 3, replace with 7. If both are 8, replace with 5. But what about other cases?\n\nBut in Example 3, the 0 is between 4s, but replaced with 7. So this would not fit. Hence, this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the sum of the left and right cells. For example, if the sum is 8 (4+4), replace with 5. If the sum is 6 (3+3), replace with 7. But this would explain some examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the 0 is between 8 and 8, sum is 16. But replaced with 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really difficult. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, the numbers 5 and 7 appear in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in the third row, second column. The input is 0 4 0 4 0 ... So the 0 is between two 4s. The output is 5. In Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, replaced with 7. So why the difference?\n\nMaybe the replacement is based on the position in the grid. For example, if the row is even, replace with 5, else 7. But in Example 3, the row is 2 (even), but replaced with 7. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the column. In Example 1, the 0 is in column 2 (0-based), replaced with 5. In Example 3, the 0 is in column 1 (0-based), replaced with 7. So that's not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to code a function that replaces 0s with 5 if they are between two 4s, and with 7 if between two 3s. But this might not cover all cases, but it's a starting point.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nFor each cell in the grid:\n\n- If the cell is 0, check its left and right neighbors. If both are 4, replace with 5. If both are 3, replace with 7. If both are 8, replace with 5. For other cases, leave as 0.\n\nBut how to handle other cases. For example, if the cell is between 4 and 3, or other combinations.\n\nBut given the examples, this might be the best approach I can think of.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut first, I need to handle the grid. The grid is 13x13. So for each cell (i, j), if it's 0, check if left and right are the same and non-zero. If so, replace with 5 or 7 based on the value.\n\nBut what about other cases, like if the cell is between 4 and 3? Or if the cell is between 4 and 0? In that case, leave it as 0.\n\nBut this might not cover all cases, but it's a start.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check left and right\n                if j > 0 and j < 12:\n                    left = transformed[i][j-1]\n                    right = transformed[i][j+1]\n                    if left == right and left != 0:\n                        if left == 4:\n                            transformed[i][j] = 5\n                        elif left == 3:\n                            transformed[i][j] = 7\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, but replaced with 7. According to this code, it would be replaced with 5. So this code would not handle that case.\n\nHmm. So this approach is not correct. So what's wrong here?\n\nIn Example 3, the input is:\n\nRow 2 (0-based row 1): 4 4 4 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 4 4 4 0 0 0.\n\nWait, no. The input for Example 3 is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n4 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 4 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n4 7 4 0 0 0\n4 7 4 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in the third row (i=2), the cell j=1 is 0. Its left is 4 (j=0), right is 4 (j=2). So according to the code, it should be replaced with 5. But the output is 7. So this code is not correct.\n\nSo what's different in this case? Maybe the code should also check the cells above and below.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the cell above and below. For example, if the cell is between 4s and the cell above is 4, replace with 5. If the cell above is 3, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell above and below. For example, if the cell is between two 4s and the cell above is 4, replace with 5. If the cell above is 3, replace with 7.\n\nBut in Example 3, the cell above is 4 (row 1, j=1 is 4). So according to this, replace with 5. But the output is 7.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell in the same column, but above or below. For example, if the cell is between two 4s and the cell above is 4, replace with 5. If the cell above is 3, replace with 7.\n\nBut in Example 3, the cell above is 4. So according to this, replace with 5. But the output is 7. So this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to consider that the pattern might be more complex, and perhaps the replacement is based on the presence of certain patterns in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 0s are replaced based on the presence of 4s and 2s, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced based on the value of the cell in the same row and column. For example, if the cell is in a row with 4s, replace with 5. If in a row with 3s, replace with 7.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The 0s in the third row are replaced with 5. In the seventh row, the 0s are replaced with 7. So maybe the replacement depends on the row. For example, if the row is even, replace with 5, odd with 7. But in Example 1, the third row is row 2 (0-based), which is even, replaced with 5. The seventh row is row 6 (0-based), which is even, replaced with 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the row number modulo 3. Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I think I should proceed with a code that replaces 0s between two 4s with 5 and between two 3s with 7, even if it doesn't cover all cases, but it's the best I can do.\n\nBut in Example 3, this code would replace the 0 between two 4s with 5, but the correct output is 7. So this suggests that the code is incorrect. But perhaps there's another condition.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, but also between two 4s in the same column. Let's look at the third row of Example 3:\n\nInput: 4 0 4 0 0 0 \u2192 output: 4 7 4 0 0 0.\n\nSo the 0 at j=1 is between 4 and 4. The cell above is 4 (row 1, j=1), and the cell below is 4 (row 3, j=1). So maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell above and below. If the cell above is 4 and the cell below is 4, replace with 7. But why?\n\nIn Example 1, the 0 is between two 4s, and the cell above is 0, and the cell below is 0. So it's replaced with 5. So this suggests that the replacement is based on both the left/right and above/below.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nMaybe the replacement is based on the sum of the left/right and above/below. For example, if the left and right are 4, and the above and below are 0, replace with 5. If the left and right are 4, and the above and below are 4, replace with 7.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s and the above and below are 4. So replaced with 7.\n\nIn Example 1, the 0 is between two 4s and the above and below are 0. So replaced with 5.\n\nSo this could be the pattern. So the code would check if the left and right are the same and non-zero, and if the above and below are the same and non-zero. If so, replace with 5 or 7 based on the value.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, for each 0 cell:\n\nCheck if left and right are the same and non-zero. If so, check if above and below are the same and non-zero. If so, replace with 5 or 7 based on the value of left/right.\n\nBut this is getting complex.\n\nAlternatively, if the left and right are 4, and the above and below are 4, replace with 7. If the left and right are 4 and the above and below are 0, replace with 5.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThis would require checking the four surrounding cells.\n\nSo, for each 0 cell (i, j):\n\nif j > 0 and j < 12:\n\n   left = grid[i][j-1]\n\n   right = grid[i][j+1]\n\n   if left == right and left != 0:\n\n       if i > 0 and i < 12:\n\n           above = grid[i-1][j]\n\n           below = grid[i+1][j]\n\n           if above == below and above != 0:\n\n               if left == 4:\n\n                   if above == 4:\n\n                       replace with 7\n\n                   else:\n\n                       replace with 5\n\n               elif left == 3:\n\n                   replace with 7\n\nBut this is getting too complex, and I'm not sure if it fits all examples.\n\nBut in Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, and the above and below are 4. So it would be replaced with 7. Which matches the example.\n\nIn Example 1, the 0 is between two 4s, and the above and below are 0. So it would not trigger the above condition, and thus replaced with 5.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nThis is getting too complicated, but I think this is the best approach I can think of.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check left and right\n                if j > 0 and j < 12:\n                    left = transformed[i][j-1]\n                    right = transformed[i][j+1]\n                    if left == right and left != 0:\n                        # Check above and below\n                        if i > 0 and i < 12:\n                            above = transformed[i-1][j]\n                            below = transformed[i+1][j]\n                            if above == below and above != 0:\n                                if left == 4:\n                                    if above == 4:\n                                        transformed[i][j] = 7\n                                    else:\n                                        transformed[i][j] = 5\n                                elif left == 3:\n                                    transformed[i][j] = 7\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nFor Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, and above and below are 4. So it would be replaced with 7. Which is correct.\n\nFor Example 1, the 0 is between two 4s, and above and below are 0. So the condition above is not met, so it would not be replaced with 7. But according to the example, it should be replaced with 5. So in this case, the code would not replace it, but the example shows it is replaced. So this suggests that the code is missing some cases.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nMaybe the code should also check if the above and below are 0. For example, if the left and right are 4, and the above and below are 0, replace with 5. But how to code that.\n\nAlternatively, if the left and right are 4, and the above or below is 0, replace with 5.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Given the time constraints, I think I should proceed with this code and see if it passes some of the examples.\n\nBut in Example 1, the 0 in the third row is between two 4s, and the above and below are 0. So the code would not replace it, but the example shows it should be replaced. So this code would not handle that case.\n\nThus, this approach is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision. Given the examples, the most consistent pattern I can see is that 0s between two 4s are replaced with 5 or 7, depending on the surrounding cells. But without a clear pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 5 if they are in even rows, and 7 if in odd rows. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: the 0 in the third row (row 2, 0-based) is even. Replaced with 5. The 0 in the seventh row (row 6, 0-based) is even, replaced with 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample 3: the 0 is in row 2 (0-based), even, replaced with 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThus, this approach is not correct.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I think I'll proceed with the initial code that replaces 0s between two 4s with 5, and between two 3s with 7, even if it doesn't cover all cases.\n\nBut in Example 3, this code would replace the 0 between two 4s with 5, but the correct output is 7. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe there's another condition. For example, if the 0 is in a row where the row number is even, replace with 5, else 7.\n\nIn Example 3, the row is 2 (even), but replaced with 7. So this is not.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision and write the code based on the best guess, even if it's not perfect.\n\nThe code that replaces 0s between two 4s with 5, and between two 3s with 7, and leaves others as 0.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check left and right\n                if j > 0 and j < 12:\n                    left = transformed[i][j-1]\n                    right = transformed[i][j+1]\n                    if left == right and left != 0:\n                        if left == 4:\n                            transformed[i][j] = 5\n                        elif left == 3:\n                            transformed[i][j] = 7\n    return transformed\n\nBut this code would not handle Example 3 correctly, but it might handle some other examples.\n\nBut in the test input, I need to see if this code would work. Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 4 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 4 4 4 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 3 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 3 0 2 2 2 0 0 3 3 3\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output for the test input is not provided, but I need to write the code that transforms it.\n\nBut based on the examples, the code would replace 0s between two 4s with 5. Let's see:\n\nFor example, in the second row of the test input, the 0 is between 4 and 4. So it would be replaced with 5. But in the input, the second row is 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output would have 0 4 4 4 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct.\n\nGiven the time, I think this is the best I can do. So the code would be as above.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function that maps input grids to output grids. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some 4s and 2s, and the output changes some of them to 5s and 7s. For instance, in the third row of the input, there's a 0 in the middle. The output changes that to 5. Similarly, in the seventh row, a 3 is replaced by 7. Wait, but in the input, there's a 3 in some positions. Hmm.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 8s and 4s. The output changes the middle 0 to 5. So maybe when there's a 0 in a certain position, it gets replaced by a different number based on surrounding cells?\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has 4s and 0s. The output changes the 0s to 7s. But in the third row, the middle cell is 0, and it becomes 7. But in the fourth row, the middle cell is 0 again, but it's 7 again. So maybe when there's a 0 in a position that's surrounded by 4s, it's replaced by 7?\n\nWait, but in Example 1, there's a 0 in the third row, second column. The output changes that to 5. But in the same row, there's a 4 and then a 5. So maybe the 5 is replacing a 0 that's between two 4s? Or maybe it's based on the surrounding numbers.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the transformation is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, in Example 2, the input has a 8 in the middle of a 3x3 block. The output changes the middle 0 to 5. Similarly, in Example 3, the input has a 4 in the middle of a 3x3 block, and the 0 is replaced by 7. So perhaps when a 0 is in a position that's surrounded by a certain number, it's replaced by another number.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the third row of the input is 0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 4 5 4 0 0 0 2 5 2 0 0 0. So the 0s in positions 2 and 8 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?) are replaced by 5. Maybe those positions are in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced based on their position relative to other numbers. For example, in Example 2, the input has a 8 in the middle of a 3x3 block. The output changes the middle 0 to 5. Similarly, in Example 3, the middle 0 is replaced by 7. So maybe the 0s in certain positions are being replaced by numbers based on the surrounding numbers.\n\nAnother angle: looking at the output of Example 1, the 5s and 7s are replacing 0s in certain positions. Let's check the positions where this happens. For example, in the third row, the 0s at positions 2 and 8 (assuming 0-based) are replaced by 5. But in the seventh row, the 0 is replaced by 7. So maybe the replacement depends on the surrounding numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced by numbers that are the average of their neighbors, or some other function. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 4: The input has some 0s that are replaced by 7s and 5s. For example, in the input, the third row has 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 3 3 3 0 0. The output is 0 4 7 7 4 0 0 3 3 3 0 0. So the 0s in positions 2 and 3 (third row) are replaced by 7s. Similarly, in the fourth row, the 0s are replaced by 4s and 7s. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the presence of certain numbers in adjacent cells. For example, if a 0 is between two 4s, it becomes 5. Or if it's between 3s and 2s, it becomes 7.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the third row of the input has 0 4 0 4 0 ... So the 0s are between 4s. The output replaces them with 5s. In Example 3, the input has a 4 in the middle, and the 0 is replaced by 7. But in that case, the 0 is in the middle of a 3x3 block of 4s. So maybe when a 0 is in a position that's surrounded by a certain number, it's replaced by a different number.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 0s are being replaced by numbers that are the sum of their neighboring cells divided by something. But that might not fit all examples. For example, in Example 2, the input has a 0 in the middle of a 3x3 block of 8s. The output replaces it with 5. If the sum of the surrounding 8s is 8*4=32, but 32 divided by something gives 5? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced based on the positions in the grid. Like, if a 0 is in a certain row or column, it's replaced by a different number. But that might not be the case.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output for the third row is 0 4 5 4 0 0 0 2 5 2 0 0 0. The 5s are in positions 2 and 8. Let's check the surrounding cells. For example, the 0 in position 2 (third row, second column) is between 4 (position 1) and 4 (position 3). So maybe when a 0 is between two 4s, it's replaced by 5. Similarly, in the seventh row of Example 1, the input has 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, the output for that row is 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 0s in the input are replaced by 7s. But in the input, the seventh row is 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 0s in positions 4 and 5 (assuming 0-based) are replaced by 7s. But why? Because they are between 3 and 3?\n\nIn Example 2, the input is a 6x6 grid. The output changes the middle 0 to 5. The input has 8s in the middle of a 3x3 block. The output replaces the 0 in the middle with 5. So maybe when a 0 is in the center of a 3x3 block of 8s, it becomes 5. Similarly, in Example 3, the input has a 4 in the center of a 3x3 block, and the 0 is replaced by 7.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that when a 0 is in a position that is surrounded by a certain number (like 4 or 8), it's replaced by a different number (like 5 or 7). But how to determine which numbers to replace?\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 0s are being replaced by numbers that are the sum of the surrounding numbers divided by something. For example, in Example 2, the 0 is surrounded by 8s. The sum of the surrounding 8s is 8*4=32, but 32 divided by 6.4 is 5. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the position's coordinates. For example, if a 0 is in a row or column that has certain properties. But that seems unlikely.\n\nLooking at Example 4, the input has a 0 in the third row, third column. The output replaces it with 7. The surrounding cells in that position are 4, 0, 4, and 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced by numbers that are the same as the numbers in the surrounding cells. For example, in Example 2, the 0 is in the middle of 8s. The output replaces it with 5, which is not the same as 8. So that's not it.\n\nAnother approach: Look for the positions where 0s are replaced. For example, in Example 1, the third row's 0s are in positions that are between 4s. In Example 3, the 0s are in positions between 4s. In Example 2, the 0 is between 8s. So perhaps the replacement is based on the value of the surrounding cells. For example, if a 0 is between two 4s, replace with 5. If between two 8s, replace with 5. But why 5?\n\nWait, in Example 1, the third row's 0s are between 4s. The output replaces them with 5. In Example 3, the 0 is between 4s, and replaced with 7. That's conflicting. So that can't be.\n\nHmm. Maybe the replacement depends on the position's coordinates. For example, if a 0 is in a certain row or column, it's replaced by a certain number. But that's not clear from the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced by numbers based on the presence of certain patterns. Like, if a 0 is part of a horizontal line of 4s, replace with 5. But in Example 3, the 0 is in the middle of a vertical line of 4s, and replaced with 7.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern where 0s are replaced by numbers based on their neighbors. For example, if a 0 is surrounded by 4s, replace with 5. If surrounded by 3s, replace with 7. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the sum of the surrounding cells. For example, in Example 2, the 0 is surrounded by 8s. The sum is 8*4=32. 32 divided by 6.4 is 5. Not sure.\n\nAnother thought: Looking at the outputs, the numbers 5 and 7 are appearing in the outputs. Maybe these are the results of some operation. For example, 4 + 1 = 5, 3 + 4 = 7. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced by the numbers that are in the same row or column. For example, in Example 1, the third row has 0 4 0 4 0 ... and the output is 0 4 5 4 0 ... So the 5 is between 4 and 4. So maybe the 5 is the average of the two 4s. But 4 + 4 = 8, divided by 2 is 4. Not 5. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is a specific value that's added when there's a certain pattern. Like, if a 0 is in a position that is between two 4s and is part of a horizontal line, replace with 5. Similarly, if between two 3s, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to code this? Maybe for each 0 in the grid, check its neighbors. If the neighbors are 4s, replace with 5. If the neighbors are 3s, replace with 7. But how to determine which neighbors.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the 5s are in positions where there are 4s on both sides. Similarly, the 7s are in positions where there are 3s on both sides. For example, in the seventh row of Example 1, the input is 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 0s between the 3s are replaced by 7s. So maybe when a 0 is between two same numbers (like 3s), it's replaced by 7. Similarly, when between 4s, replaced by 5.\n\nBut then in Example 3, the input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n4 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 4 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n4 7 4 0 0 0\n4 7 4 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 0s in the middle of the 4s are replaced by 7s. So that's between two 4s. But in this case, the replacement is 7. But in Example 1, between two 4s, it's replaced by 5. So that's conflicting. So this suggests that the replacement depends on other factors.\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the 0s between 4s are replaced by 5, but in Example 3, between 4s, replaced by 7. So maybe the replacement depends on the position in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 0s are in the third row, which is part of a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the surrounding cells. For example, if the surrounding cells are 4, then replace with 5. If the surrounding cells are 3, replace with 7. But why different values?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the distance from the center of the grid. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: Looking at the output of Example 4. The input has a 0 in the third row, third column. The output replaces it with 7. The surrounding cells are 4, 0, 4, and 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the presence of certain numbers in the same row or column. For example, in Example 1, the third row has 0 4 0 4 0 ... and the output is 0 4 5 4 0 ... So the 5 is in the middle. Maybe this is a pattern where if there's a 0 between two 4s, replace with 5, but if it's in a different position, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell to the left and right. For example, if a cell is 0 and its left and right are 4, replace with 5. If left and right are 3, replace with 7. But in Example 3, the 0 is between 4 and 4, but replaced with 7. So that contradicts.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Maybe the pattern is that 0s are replaced by numbers that are the sum of the surrounding cells divided by something. For example, in Example 2, the 0 is surrounded by 8s. The sum is 8*4=32. 32 divided by 6.4 is 5. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the number of surrounding cells that are non-zero. For example, if a 0 is surrounded by 4s, replace with 5. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the 0s are replaced by the value of the cell that is diagonally adjacent. For example, in Example 1, the third row's 0 is between 4s. The cell above it is 0, and the cell below is 0. But that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced by the value of the cell in the same column but a certain distance away. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the third row has a 0 that is between two 4s. The output replaces it with 5. In Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, but replaced with 7. So maybe the replacement depends on the row or column.\n\nLooking at the rows in Example 1:\n\nRow 2: 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 \u2192 output is same as input.\n\nRow 3: input is 0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 0 4 5 4 0 0 0 2 5 2 0 0 0.\n\nSo the 0s in positions 2 and 8 (assuming 0-based) are replaced by 5.\n\nRow 7: input is 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 0s in positions 4 and 5 (assuming 0-based) are replaced by 7.\n\nSo in these cases, the 0s are replaced by 5 or 7 based on their position. But why?\n\nMaybe the replacement depends on the row and column. For example, in even rows, replace with 5, odd rows with 7? But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the position's coordinates. For example, if the row is even, replace with 5, else 7. But that's just a guess.\n\nIn Example 1, row 3 is the third row (assuming 0-based, it's row 2). The 0s are replaced with 5. Row 7 is the seventh row (0-based 6). The 0s are replaced with 7. So maybe if the row is even (0-based), replace with 5, else 7? But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the position's distance from the center of the grid. But the grid is 13x13, so the center is at (6,6). The 0s in row 3 (0-based 2) are closer to the center than those in row 6 (0-based 5). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced based on the value of the cell directly above or below. For example, in row 3, the cell above is 0 (row 2) and the cell below is 0 (row 4). So no help.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 0s with certain values based on their neighbors. For example, if the cell to the left is 4 and the cell to the right is 4, then replace with 5. If the cell above is 3 and the cell below is 3, replace with 7. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the presence of a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the third row has a 0 between two 4s, and the output replaces it with 5. In Example 3, the same pattern (between two 4s) is replaced with 7. So this suggests that the replacement is not consistent. Hence, perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the 0s are replaced based on the value of the cell that is diagonally adjacent. For example, in Example 1, the third row's 0 is between two 4s. The cell above it is 0, and the cell below is 0. But that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell to the left and the cell to the right. For example, if both are 4, replace with 5. If both are 3, replace with 7. But in Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, and replaced with 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that when a 0 is in a position that is part of a horizontal line of 4s, it's replaced with 5, and when it's part of a horizontal line of 3s, it's replaced with 7. But in Example 3, the 0 is part of a vertical line of 4s, but replaced with 7. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell to the left and the cell to the right, and the cell above and below. For example, if the left and right are 4, and the above and below are 0, then replace with 5. But that's just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to find a way to code this. Maybe the pattern is that 0s are replaced by 5 if they are between two 4s, and by 7 if between two 3s. But how to handle other cases.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced by the value of the cell to the left, if it's non-zero. For example, in Example 1, the 0 in the third row, second column is between 4 and 4. So the replacement is 5. But why 5?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell to the left and the cell to the right. For example, if the left is 4 and right is 4, then replace with 5. If left is 3 and right is 3, replace with 7. If left is 8 and right is 8, replace with 5. But this would explain some examples.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with the examples:\n\nExample 2: input is a 6x6 grid. The third row is 0 8 8 8 0 0. The output is 0 8 8 8 0 0. So no replacement. Wait, but in Example 2, the input is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 8 0 8 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 8 5 8 0 0\n0 8 8 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in the third row, the 0 is between 8 and 8. So according to the hypothesis, it should be replaced with 5. Which matches the output.\n\nIn Example 3, the input is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n4 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 4 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n4 7 4 0 0 0\n4 7 4 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in the third row, the 0 is between 4 and 4. According to the hypothesis, it should be replaced with 5, but the output is 7. So this contradicts the hypothesis. Hence, the pattern is not consistent.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the replacement is not based solely on the left and right cells. So perhaps there's another factor.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the third row is 4 0 4 0 0 0. The output is 4 7 4 0 0 0. So the 0 between 4 and 4 is replaced with 7. But in Example 2, the same pattern is replaced with 5. So why the difference?\n\nMaybe the replacement depends on the position in the grid. Like, if the row is even, replace with 5, if odd, replace with 7. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 2, the third row is row index 2 (0-based), which is even. The replacement is 5. In Example 3, the third row is row index 2, which is even, but replaced with 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it depends on the column. For example, in Example 2, the 0 is in column 2 (0-based), replaced with 5. In Example 3, the 0 is in column 1 (0-based), replaced with 7. So that's not consistent.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe the pattern is that when a 0 is between two 4s, and it's in a certain part of the grid, it's replaced with 5, but in other parts, replaced with 7. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell above and below. For example, in Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, but the cell above is 4 and the cell below is 4. So why is it replaced with 7?\n\nMaybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell to the left and right, and the value of the cell above and below. For example, if the left and right are 4, and the above and below are 4, replace with 5. But in Example 3, the cell above is 4, and the cell below is 4. So why is it replaced with 7?\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of patterns. For example, in the examples, the 0s are replaced with numbers that are 5 or 7, and these numbers are related to the surrounding cells. Perhaps the 5 is for 4s and 7 for 3s.\n\nIn Example 1, the 0s are between 4s and replaced with 5. In Example 3, the 0s are between 4s and replaced with 7. So that's conflicting. But in Example 4, the 0s are between 4s and replaced with 7.\n\nWait, in Example 4, the input has a 0 in the third row, third column. The surrounding cells are 4, 0, 4, and 3. The output replaces it with 7. So perhaps the replacement is based on the presence of a 3 in the surrounding cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell to the left and right, and the cell above and below. For example, if the left is 4, right is 4, and the cell above is 3, then replace with 7. But this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. The most consistent pattern I see is that when a 0 is between two 4s, it's replaced with 5 or 7, depending on other factors. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell in the same row and column. For example, if the cell to the left is 4 and the cell to the right is 4, replace with 5. If the cell to the left is 3 and the cell to the right is 3, replace with 7. But this would explain some examples, but not all.\n\nLet's try to code this. For each cell in the grid, if it's a 0, check the left and right cells. If both are 4, replace with 5. If both are 3, replace with 7. If both are 8, replace with 5. But what about other cases?\n\nBut in Example 3, the 0 is between 4s, but replaced with 7. So this would not fit. Hence, this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the sum of the left and right cells. For example, if the sum is 8 (4+4), replace with 5. If the sum is 6 (3+3), replace with 7. But this would explain some examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the 0 is between 8 and 8, sum is 16. But replaced with 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really difficult. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, the numbers 5 and 7 appear in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 5 is in the third row, second column. The input is 0 4 0 4 0 ... So the 0 is between two 4s. The output is 5. In Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, replaced with 7. So why the difference?\n\nMaybe the replacement is based on the position in the grid. For example, if the row is even, replace with 5, else 7. But in Example 3, the row is 2 (even), but replaced with 7. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the column. In Example 1, the 0 is in column 2 (0-based), replaced with 5. In Example 3, the 0 is in column 1 (0-based), replaced with 7. So that's not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to code a function that replaces 0s with 5 if they are between two 4s, and with 7 if between two 3s. But this might not cover all cases, but it's a starting point.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\nFor each cell in the grid:\n\n- If the cell is 0, check its left and right neighbors. If both are 4, replace with 5. If both are 3, replace with 7. If both are 8, replace with 5. For other cases, leave as 0.\n\nBut how to handle other cases. For example, if the cell is between 4 and 3, or other combinations.\n\nBut given the examples, this might be the best approach I can think of.\n\nNow, let's code this.\n\nBut first, I need to handle the grid. The grid is 13x13. So for each cell (i, j), if it's 0, check if left and right are the same and non-zero. If so, replace with 5 or 7 based on the value.\n\nBut what about other cases, like if the cell is between 4 and 3? Or if the cell is between 4 and 0? In that case, leave it as 0.\n\nBut this might not cover all cases, but it's a start.\n\nSo, the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check left and right\n                if j > 0 and j < 12:\n                    left = transformed[i][j-1]\n                    right = transformed[i][j+1]\n                    if left == right and left != 0:\n                        if left == 4:\n                            transformed[i][j] = 5\n                        elif left == 3:\n                            transformed[i][j] = 7\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, but replaced with 7. According to this code, it would be replaced with 5. So this code would not handle that case.\n\nHmm. So this approach is not correct. So what's wrong here?\n\nIn Example 3, the input is:\n\nRow 2 (0-based row 1): 4 4 4 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 4 4 4 0 0 0.\n\nWait, no. The input for Example 3 is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n4 0 4 0 0 0\n4 0 4 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n4 7 4 0 0 0\n4 7 4 0 0 0\n4 4 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo in the third row (i=2), the cell j=1 is 0. Its left is 4 (j=0), right is 4 (j=2). So according to the code, it should be replaced with 5. But the output is 7. So this code is not correct.\n\nSo what's different in this case? Maybe the code should also check the cells above and below.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the cell above and below. For example, if the cell is between 4s and the cell above is 4, replace with 5. If the cell above is 3, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell above and below. For example, if the cell is between two 4s and the cell above is 4, replace with 5. If the cell above is 3, replace with 7.\n\nBut in Example 3, the cell above is 4 (row 1, j=1 is 4). So according to this, replace with 5. But the output is 7.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell in the same column, but above or below. For example, if the cell is between two 4s and the cell above is 4, replace with 5. If the cell above is 3, replace with 7.\n\nBut in Example 3, the cell above is 4. So according to this, replace with 5. But the output is 7. So this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to consider that the pattern might be more complex, and perhaps the replacement is based on the presence of certain patterns in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 0s are replaced based on the presence of 4s and 2s, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced based on the value of the cell in the same row and column. For example, if the cell is in a row with 4s, replace with 5. If in a row with 3s, replace with 7.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The 0s in the third row are replaced with 5. In the seventh row, the 0s are replaced with 7. So maybe the replacement depends on the row. For example, if the row is even, replace with 5, odd with 7. But in Example 1, the third row is row 2 (0-based), which is even, replaced with 5. The seventh row is row 6 (0-based), which is even, replaced with 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the row number modulo 3. Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I think I should proceed with a code that replaces 0s between two 4s with 5 and between two 3s with 7, even if it doesn't cover all cases, but it's the best I can do.\n\nBut in Example 3, this code would replace the 0 between two 4s with 5, but the correct output is 7. So this suggests that the code is incorrect. But perhaps there's another condition.\n\nWait, in Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, but also between two 4s in the same column. Let's look at the third row of Example 3:\n\nInput: 4 0 4 0 0 0 \u2192 output: 4 7 4 0 0 0.\n\nSo the 0 at j=1 is between 4 and 4. The cell above is 4 (row 1, j=1), and the cell below is 4 (row 3, j=1). So maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell above and below. If the cell above is 4 and the cell below is 4, replace with 7. But why?\n\nIn Example 1, the 0 is between two 4s, and the cell above is 0, and the cell below is 0. So it's replaced with 5. So this suggests that the replacement is based on both the left/right and above/below.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nMaybe the replacement is based on the sum of the left/right and above/below. For example, if the left and right are 4, and the above and below are 0, replace with 5. If the left and right are 4, and the above and below are 4, replace with 7.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s and the above and below are 4. So replaced with 7.\n\nIn Example 1, the 0 is between two 4s and the above and below are 0. So replaced with 5.\n\nSo this could be the pattern. So the code would check if the left and right are the same and non-zero, and if the above and below are the same and non-zero. If so, replace with 5 or 7 based on the value.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, for each 0 cell:\n\nCheck if left and right are the same and non-zero. If so, check if above and below are the same and non-zero. If so, replace with 5 or 7 based on the value of left/right.\n\nBut this is getting complex.\n\nAlternatively, if the left and right are 4, and the above and below are 4, replace with 7. If the left and right are 4 and the above and below are 0, replace with 5.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThis would require checking the four surrounding cells.\n\nSo, for each 0 cell (i, j):\n\nif j > 0 and j < 12:\n\n   left = grid[i][j-1]\n\n   right = grid[i][j+1]\n\n   if left == right and left != 0:\n\n       if i > 0 and i < 12:\n\n           above = grid[i-1][j]\n\n           below = grid[i+1][j]\n\n           if above == below and above != 0:\n\n               if left == 4:\n\n                   if above == 4:\n\n                       replace with 7\n\n                   else:\n\n                       replace with 5\n\n               elif left == 3:\n\n                   replace with 7\n\nBut this is getting too complex, and I'm not sure if it fits all examples.\n\nBut in Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, and the above and below are 4. So it would be replaced with 7. Which matches the example.\n\nIn Example 1, the 0 is between two 4s, and the above and below are 0. So it would not trigger the above condition, and thus replaced with 5.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nThis is getting too complicated, but I think this is the best approach I can think of.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check left and right\n                if j > 0 and j < 12:\n                    left = transformed[i][j-1]\n                    right = transformed[i][j+1]\n                    if left == right and left != 0:\n                        # Check above and below\n                        if i > 0 and i < 12:\n                            above = transformed[i-1][j]\n                            below = transformed[i+1][j]\n                            if above == below and above != 0:\n                                if left == 4:\n                                    if above == 4:\n                                        transformed[i][j] = 7\n                                    else:\n                                        transformed[i][j] = 5\n                                elif left == 3:\n                                    transformed[i][j] = 7\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nFor Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, and above and below are 4. So it would be replaced with 7. Which is correct.\n\nFor Example 1, the 0 is between two 4s, and above and below are 0. So the condition above is not met, so it would not be replaced with 7. But according to the example, it should be replaced with 5. So in this case, the code would not replace it, but the example shows it is replaced. So this suggests that the code is missing some cases.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nMaybe the code should also check if the above and below are 0. For example, if the left and right are 4, and the above and below are 0, replace with 5. But how to code that.\n\nAlternatively, if the left and right are 4, and the above or below is 0, replace with 5.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Given the time constraints, I think I should proceed with this code and see if it passes some of the examples.\n\nBut in Example 1, the 0 in the third row is between two 4s, and the above and below are 0. So the code would not replace it, but the example shows it should be replaced. So this code would not handle that case.\n\nThus, this approach is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision. Given the examples, the most consistent pattern I can see is that 0s between two 4s are replaced with 5 or 7, depending on the surrounding cells. But without a clear pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 5 if they are in even rows, and 7 if in odd rows. Let's check:\n\nExample 1: the 0 in the third row (row 2, 0-based) is even. Replaced with 5. The 0 in the seventh row (row 6, 0-based) is even, replaced with 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nExample 3: the 0 is in row 2 (0-based), even, replaced with 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThus, this approach is not correct.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I think I'll proceed with the initial code that replaces 0s between two 4s with 5, and between two 3s with 7, even if it doesn't cover all cases.\n\nBut in Example 3, this code would replace the 0 between two 4s with 5, but the correct output is 7. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe there's another condition. For example, if the 0 is in a row where the row number is even, replace with 5, else 7.\n\nIn Example 3, the row is 2 (even), but replaced with 7. So this is not.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision and write the code based on the best guess, even if it's not perfect.\n\nThe code that replaces 0s between two 4s with 5, and between two 3s with 7, and leaves others as 0.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check left and right\n                if j > 0 and j < 12:\n                    left = transformed[i][j-1]\n                    right = transformed[i][j+1]\n                    if left == right and left != 0:\n                        if left == 4:\n                            transformed[i][j] = 5\n                        elif left == 3:\n                            transformed[i][j] = 7\n    return transformed\n\nBut this code would not handle Example 3 correctly, but it might handle some other examples.\n\nBut in the test input, I need to see if this code would work. Let's look at the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 0 4 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 4 4 4 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 3 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 3 0 2 2 2 0 0 3 3 3\n3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output for the test input is not provided, but I need to write the code that transforms it.\n\nBut based on the examples, the code would replace 0s between two 4s with 5. Let's see:\n\nFor example, in the second row of the test input, the 0 is between 4 and 4. So it would be replaced with 5. But in the input, the second row is 0 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output would have 0 4 4 4 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct.\n\nGiven the time, I think this is the best I can do. So the code would be as above.\n"
