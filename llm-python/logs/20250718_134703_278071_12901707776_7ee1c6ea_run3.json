          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, I need to look at the input and output grids of the examples and see what's changing. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are similar but not the same. Let's compare them row by row. For instance, the first row of input is the same as the output. But looking at the second row, the input is 4 9 9 4 9 9 0 0 9 0, and the output is 4 9 9 4 9 9 0 0 9 0. So that row is the same. Wait, but the third row of input is 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 9, and the output is 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 9. So that's the same. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking at the fourth row of input: 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. The output is 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. So the fourth input row is different from the output. Let's compare each element:\n\nInput: 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4\nOutput: 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4\n\nSo the fourth element in input is 9, but in output it's 4. The sixth element in input is 9, but in output it's 4. The seventh element in input is 9, but in output it's 4. So maybe there's some pattern here. Let's check the fifth row. Input is 4 4 5 0 0 4 0 5 4 4. Output is 4 4 5 0 0 9 0 5 4 4. So the sixth element in input is 4, output is 9. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the sixth row of input: 9 4 5 4 9 0 9 5 0 0. Output is 9 4 5 9 4 0 4 5 0 0. So the fourth element in input is 4, output is 9. The fifth element is 9, output is 4. Wait, that's interesting. So maybe there's some kind of swapping or inversion happening in certain positions?\n\nAnother approach: maybe looking for symmetry or transformations like flipping or rotating. But the examples don't seem to have obvious symmetries. Alternatively, maybe certain positions are being modified based on their value. For example, maybe if a cell is 0, it's being changed to something else. But in Example 1, the output has some 0s, but the input also has 0s. So that might not be the case.\n\nLooking at Example 2. Input and output. Let's take the third row of input: 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. Output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So the fourth element in input is 8, output is 6. The sixth element is 6, output is 8. So maybe swapping positions? Like, for some positions, the values are swapped. But how?\n\nLooking at the fourth row of input: 6 5 6 6 6 8 0 6 5 8. Output is 6 5 8 8 8 6 0 8 5 8. So the third element is 6 \u2192 8, sixth is 8 \u2192 6. So again, swapping positions. Maybe in some positions, the values are swapped with their counterparts. But which positions?\n\nAnother thought: maybe certain cells are being transformed based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input has elements that are changed in positions 4, 6, 7. Let me check the positions. Let's index them from 0 to 9. So for the fourth row of input:\n\nOriginal input row: [9,4,5,9,0,9,9,5,0,4]\n\nOutput row: [9,4,5,4,0,4,4,5,0,4]\n\nLooking at positions 3 (original 9 \u2192 4), 5 (original 9 \u21924), 6 (original 9 \u21924). So maybe these positions are being replaced with 4? But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the values are being changed based on some pattern. For example, in the fourth row of input, the fourth element is 9. In the output, it's 4. Maybe it's related to the value of the cell in a certain position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on some kind of parity or adjacency. For example, if a cell is in a certain position, it's being modified based on its neighbors. But that's more complex.\n\nLooking at Example 3. Let's take the third row of input: 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 0 5 2. Output is 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 0 5 2. So the third element is 3 \u2192 2, fourth is 2 \u21923, fifth is 2 \u21923, sixth is 2 \u21923. So maybe swapping some values. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output's fourth row has 4 in positions 3, 5, 6. Maybe those positions are being set to 4 if they are in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's modified. But how?\n\nLooking at the test input. The test input is:\n\n7 0 1 1 7 0 0 7 7 7\n1 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 7\n1 5 0 0 1 0 1 7 5 7\n0 5 7 1 7 0 1 7 5 1\n7 5 7 7 0 1 7 1 5 1\n7 5 0 1 7 0 7 7 5 1\n1 5 7 7 1 1 1 1 5 0\n0 5 1 7 7 7 7 0 5 7\n0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 1 7 1 0 7 0 0 7 7\n\nAnd the output would be generated by the same transformation. But since I don't have the output, I need to find a pattern from the training examples.\n\nAnother thought: in Example 1, the output seems to have some cells changed where the original value is 9. For example, in the fourth row, the fourth element was 9 \u2192 4, sixth was 9 \u21924, seventh was 9 \u21924. Maybe those positions are being set to 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in certain positions. But that's not clear. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has some changes. For example, in the third row of input, the fourth element is 8 \u21926, sixth is 6 \u21928. So swapping positions. Maybe in some cases, the values are swapped with their counterparts. For example, positions (i,j) and (i, 9-j) or something like that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the first half of the row, it's changed to a certain value. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3, the third row of input is 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 0 5 2. The output is 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 0 5 2. So the third element is 3 \u21922, fourth is 2 \u21923, fifth is 2 \u21923, sixth is 2 \u21923. So maybe the third element is being set to 2, and the fourth to 3, fifth to 3, sixth to 3. It's possible that the third element is being replaced with 2, and the next three elements are being replaced with 3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the third column, it's changed to 2. But that's not consistent across examples.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation involves some kind of inversion or reflection. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row's elements 3, 5, 6 (positions 3, 5, 6) are changed from 9 to 4. But why those positions? Maybe they are in the middle of the row. Let me check the positions:\n\nRow is 10 elements. The middle positions are 4 and 5. Maybe the transformation affects certain positions based on their distance from the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output's fourth row is 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. The original input row was 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. So the fourth element (position 3) is 9 \u21924, sixth (position 5) is 9 \u21924, seventh (position 6) is 9 \u21924. So maybe positions 3,5,6 are being set to 4. But why those positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell is in the fourth column (position 3), or fifth (position 4?), but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their row or column. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input has 9 in positions 3,5,6. Maybe those positions are being changed to 4. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in certain positions based on some rule. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd.\n\nLooking at Example 1's fourth row: row index 3 (assuming 0-based). The row is 3, which is odd. The positions 3,5,6 are being changed. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output's fourth row has 4 in positions 3,5,6. Maybe those positions are being replaced with 4. But how to know which positions to change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in certain positions based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain column, like column 3, 5, or 6.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look at the third example.\n\nIn Example 3, the third row of input is 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 0 5 2. The output is 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 0 5 2. So the third element (position 2) is 3 \u21922, then positions 3,4,5 are 2\u21923, 2\u21923, 2\u21923. So maybe the third element is being set to 2, and the next three elements are set to 3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position in the row. For example, if the cell is in the third column, set to 2, and if it's in the fourth to sixth columns, set to 3. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace values in certain positions based on their value. For example, if the value is 9, replace it with 4. But in Example 1, the fourth row has 9s in positions 3,5,6. But in other examples, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in the fourth row of Example 1, the third, fifth, and sixth positions are 9s. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in positions that are in the middle of the row. For example, the middle of the row is between columns 4 and 5. So positions 3, 4, 5, 6 might be affected. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, for each cell, if it's in a certain row or column, it's modified. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input is modified in positions 3,5,6. Let's check if those positions are in the middle of the row. The row has 10 elements, so positions 0-9. Middle is around 4.5. So positions 3,4,5,6 are around the middle. So maybe those positions are being modified.\n\nBut why would they be modified? Maybe the transformation is to replace those positions with 4 if the original value is 9. But in Example 1's fourth row, those positions are 9, and in the output they are 4. So that could be a possible pattern.\n\nBut how to generalize this. For example, in the fourth row of Example 1, positions 3,5,6 are 9 \u21924. Let's check other rows. For example, the sixth row of Example 1's input is 9 4 5 4 9 0 9 5 0 0. The output is 9 4 5 9 4 0 4 5 0 0. So in the fourth row, position 3 is 4 \u21929. Wait, that's different. So maybe the transformation is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap certain positions. For example, in the fourth row of Example 1, the fourth element (position 3) is 9 \u21924, but in the sixth row of input, position 3 is 4 \u21929. So maybe it's swapping positions in some way. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of parity. For example, if the sum of the row and column is even or odd. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output of the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output's fourth row is 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. The original input row is 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. So the fourth element (position 3) is 9 \u21924, sixth (position 5) is 9 \u21924, seventh (position 6) is 9 \u21924. So maybe positions 3,5,6 are being replaced with 4. But why those positions?\n\nLooking at the positions: 3,5,6. Let's see if they are in the middle of the row. The middle is between 4 and 5. So positions 3,4,5,6 are around the middle. Maybe those positions are being modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in certain positions based on their position. For example, if the column is 3, 5, or 6, then replace 9 with 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's third row of input: 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. Output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So the fourth element (position 3) is 8 \u21926, sixth (position 5) is 6 \u21928. So again, swapping positions 3 and 5. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are swapped. For example, in the third row, positions 3 and 5 are swapped. But why?\n\nIn the fourth row of Example 2's input: 6 5 6 6 6 8 0 6 5 8. Output is 6 5 8 8 8 6 0 8 5 8. So the third element (position 2) is 6 \u21928, sixth (position 5) is 8 \u21926. So again, positions 2 and 5 are swapped.\n\nHmm, this seems like a pattern. In some rows, certain positions are being swapped. For example, in the third row of Example 2, positions 3 and 5 are swapped. In the fourth row, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. Maybe there's a pattern where positions are swapped based on their indices.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to swap. For example, in the third row of Example 2, the positions are 3 and 5. In the fourth row, positions 2 and 5. Maybe the pattern is that for each row, certain pairs of positions are swapped. But how to determine which pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap certain pairs of positions. For example, in the third row of Example 2, positions 3 and 5 are swapped. In the fourth row, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In the fifth row of Example 2, let's check:\n\nInput row: 0 5 6 6 8 6 0 6 5 8. Output row: 0 5 8 8 6 8 0 8 5 8. So the third element (position 2) is 6 \u21928, sixth (position 5) is 6 \u21928. So again, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. Wait, but in the fourth row, positions 2 and 5 were swapped. So maybe for certain rows, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap positions (i, j) and (i, 9-j). For example, in the third row of Example 2, position 3 is 8, and 9-3=6. So position 3 and 6. But in the output, position 3 is 6 and position 6 is 8. So that would be swapping positions 3 and 6. But in the third row of Example 2, the original input is 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. So position 3 is 8, position 6 is 6. Output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So position 3 is 6, position 6 is 8. So that's swapping positions 3 and 6. Similarly, in the fourth row of Example 2, input is 6 5 6 6 6 8 0 6 5 8. Output is 6 5 8 8 8 6 0 8 5 8. So position 2 is 6 \u21928, position 5 is 8 \u21926. So positions 2 and 5 are swapped. Wait, but 9-2=7. Position 2 and 7? No, because 9-2=7. But in the fourth row, position 2 is 6 \u21928, and position 5 is 8 \u21926. So that's not swapping positions 2 and 7. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap positions (i, j) and (i, j+2). Or some other pattern. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the fourth row's output has 4 in positions 3,5,6. In Example 2, the third row's output has 6 and 8 swapped in positions 3 and 6. In Example 3, the third row has 3, 2, 3, 3, 3. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the fourth column (position 3), replace it with 4. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has 9s in positions 3,5,6. In the output, those are replaced with 4. In Example 2, the third row has 8 in position 3 and 6 in position 5. In the output, position 3 is 6 and position 5 is 8. So maybe swapping values based on some rule.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me think of a different approach.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's modified. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has some changes. Maybe the transformation is to replace values in certain columns. Let's check the columns.\n\nIn Example 1's fourth row, the fourth column (position 3) is 9 \u21924. The sixth column (position 5) is 9 \u21924. The seventh column (position 6) is 9 \u21924. So these are columns 3, 5, 6. Maybe columns 3, 5, 6 are being modified. But how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace values in certain positions based on their row. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), certain positions are modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their value. For example, if the value is 9, replace it with 4. But in Example 1, the fourth row has 9s in positions 3,5,6. In the output, those are 4. In Example 2, the third row has 8 in position 3, which is replaced with 6. So that's not consistent with replacing 9s with 4.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs of the examples, perhaps the transformation involves some kind of parity or inversion. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row's output has 4 in positions 3,5,6. Maybe those positions are being replaced with 4 if the original value is 9. But how to know which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in the fourth row of Example 1, positions 3,5,6 are 9s. In the output, they are 4s. So maybe those positions are being replaced with 4. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in positions where the column is odd. For example, columns 3,5,7,9 are odd. In Example 1's fourth row, positions 3,5,6: 3 is odd, 5 is odd, 6 is even. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in positions where the column is less than 5. But in Example 1's fourth row, position 3 is 3 <5, position 5 is 5 which is not less than 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position in the row. For example, in the fourth row of Example 1, positions 3,5,6 are being replaced with 4. Let's see if these positions are in the middle of the row. The middle of the row is between 4 and 5. So positions 3,4,5,6 are around the middle. Maybe the transformation is to replace values in those positions with 4 if they are 9.\n\nBut how to generalize this. For example, in the sixth row of Example 1's input, the fourth element is 4 \u21929, and the sixth element is 0 \u21920. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, if the column is 3, replace with 4. If it's 5, replace with 4. If it's 6, replace with 4. But how to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace values in certain positions based on their row. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), positions 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. In row 5 (sixth row), positions 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace values in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even, replace certain columns. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of swapping and replacing values.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the third row of input is 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. Output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So positions 3 and 6 are swapped. Similarly, in the fourth row, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In the fifth row, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In the sixth row of Example 2, input is 6 5 8 8 8 6 0 8 5 8. Output is 6 5 8 8 6 8 0 8 5 8. So position 4 is 8 \u21926, position 5 is 6 \u21928. So again, swapping positions 4 and 5.\n\nHmm, this seems like a pattern where certain pairs of positions are swapped. For example, in row 3, positions 3 and 6 are swapped. In row 4, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 5, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 6, positions 4 and 5 are swapped. But this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap certain pairs of positions based on their row. For example, in row 3, positions 3 and 6 are swapped. In row 4, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 5, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 6, positions 4 and 5 are swapped. This seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 2, the third row's output has 6 in position 3 and 8 in position 6. So the values are swapped. Similarly, in the fourth row, position 2 is 8 and position 5 is 6. So the values are swapped. So maybe the transformation is to swap certain pairs of positions in each row.\n\nBut which pairs? It's not clear. However, looking at the positions, maybe the pairs are (3,6), (2,5), (2,5), (4,5). This seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap positions (i, j) and (i, 9-j). For example, in the third row of Example 2, position 3 is 8, and 9-3=6. So position 3 and 6 are swapped. That fits. In the fourth row, position 2 is 6, and 9-2=7. But in the output, position 2 is 8 and position 5 is 6. So that doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap positions (i, j) and (i, j+3). For example, in the third row, position 3 and 6 (3+3=6). In the fourth row, position 2 and 5 (2+3=5). That fits. In the fifth row, position 2 and 5 (2+3=5). In the sixth row, position 4 and 5 (4+1=5). So this doesn't fit. But maybe it's a pattern for certain rows.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each row, certain positions are swapped based on their index. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 4 (fifth row), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 5 (sixth row), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 6 (seventh row), positions 4 and 5 are swapped. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap positions (i, j) and (i, j+3) for certain rows. For example, in rows 2,3,4,5,6, this might be the case. But this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation could be to swap certain positions in each row. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the fourth row's output has 4 in positions 3,5,6. So perhaps the transformation involves replacing those positions with 4. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the patterns I've observed. Let's try to create a function that swaps certain positions in each row based on their indices.\n\nFor example, in Example 2, it seems that certain positions are being swapped. For instance, in row 3 (index 2), positions 3 and 6 are swapped. In row 4 (index 3), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 5 (index 4), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 6 (index 5), positions 4 and 5 are swapped.\n\nThis suggests that for each row, certain pairs of positions are being swapped. But how to determine which pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap positions (j, j+3) for certain j. For example, in row 3, j=3: 3 and 6. In row 4, j=2: 2 and 5. In row 5, j=2: 2 and 5. In row 6, j=4: 4 and 5.\n\nThis seems arbitrary, but perhaps there's a pattern. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap positions (j, j+3) for j in certain ranges.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row's output has 4 in positions 3,5,6. Maybe those positions are being replaced with 4 if the original value is 9. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation might involve some kind of mask. For example, certain positions are being replaced with 4 if they are in the middle of the row.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I think I need to make a hypothesis. Let's assume that the transformation is to swap certain positions in each row based on their indices. For example, in row 3, positions 3 and 6 are swapped. In row 4, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 5, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 6, positions 4 and 5 are swapped. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in certain positions. For example, in the fourth row of Example 1, positions 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. But how to determine which positions.\n\nGiven that the test input is provided, perhaps I should look for a pattern that works for all examples. Let's try to find a pattern that could explain the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's fourth row is 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. The input is 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. So positions 3,5,6 are changed from 9 to 4. Let's check other rows. For example, the sixth row of input is 9 4 5 4 9 0 9 5 0 0. Output is 9 4 5 9 4 0 4 5 0 0. So positions 3 (4 \u21929), 5 (0 \u21920), 6 (9 \u21924). So in this row, position 3 is changed from 4 to 9, and position 6 from 9 to 4. So this suggests that positions 3 and 6 are being swapped. But why?\n\nThis suggests that in some rows, positions 3 and 6 are swapped. In other rows, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. This is inconsistent.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output's fourth row has 4 in positions 3,5,6. In the sixth row, position 3 is 9, position 6 is 4. So it's possible that the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in certain positions, and 4 with 9 in others. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in certain positions and 4 with 9 in others, based on their position. For example, in even rows, replace 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6. In odd rows, replace 4 with 9 in those positions. But this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's assume that the transformation involves swapping certain positions in each row. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), positions 3 and 6 are swapped. In row 4 (fifth row), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 5 (sixth row), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 6 (seventh row), positions 4 and 5 are swapped. This seems arbitrary, but perhaps it's the pattern.\n\nBut how to implement this in code. Let's think of the code. For each row, we can check certain positions and swap them.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to swap. Maybe for each row, certain pairs of positions are swapped. For example:\n\n- For row 2 (third row), swap positions 3 and 6.\n- For row 3 (fourth row), swap positions 2 and 5.\n- For row 4 (fifth row), swap positions 2 and 5.\n- For row 5 (sixth row), swap positions 4 and 5.\n\nBut this is just for the examples. How to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to swap positions (j, j+3) for certain j. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), j=3: 3 and 6. In row 4 (fifth row), j=2: 2 and 5. In row 5 (sixth row), j=4: 4 and 5 (but 4+3=7, which is not 5).\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the test input and try to apply a possible transformation. The test input's fourth row is 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. If I apply the same pattern as in Example 1, perhaps positions 3,5,6 are changed from 9 to 4. So the output would have 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions where the column is 3, 5, or 6. But how to know.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to proceed with a hypothesis that the transformation involves swapping certain positions in each row, and for the test input, apply the same logic.\n\nBut since the examples are not clear, I need to make a best guess.\n\nLet me try to think of a transformation that could work for the examples. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has positions 3,5,6 replaced with 4. In Example 2, certain positions are swapped. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in certain positions and swap other values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions where the column is 3, 5, or 6. Let's try this for Example 1's fourth row: positions 3,5,6 are 9 \u21924. In Example 2's third row, position 3 is 8 \u21926, and position 6 is 6 \u21928. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions where the column is 3, 5, or 6. And replace 4 with 9 in positions where the column is 3, 5, or 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to replace.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions where the column is 3, 5, or 6, and replace 4 with 9 in positions where the column is 3, 5, or 6. But this would require checking for each cell.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given the time I've spent, I think I need to proceed with a possible solution that might work for the examples.\n\nLet's assume that the transformation involves swapping certain positions in each row. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), positions 3 and 6 are swapped. In row 4 (fifth row), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 5 (sixth row), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 6 (seventh row), positions 4 and 5 are swapped.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe for each row, certain pairs are swapped. For example, in even rows, swap positions 2 and 5, and in odd rows, swap positions 3 and 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to swap positions (j, j+3) for j in 0-6. For example, in row 3, j=3: 3 and 6. In row 4, j=2: 2 and 5. In row 5, j=2: 2 and 5. In row 6, j=4: 4 and 7.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to write a function that swaps certain positions based on their indices. For example, in each row, swap positions 2 and 5, and positions 3 and 6.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to do this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to swap positions 2 and 5 in each row. Let's check Example 1's fourth row: input is 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. If we swap positions 2 and 5, the row would become 9 4 9 9 0 5 9 5 0 4. But the output is 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in certain positions. For example, in the fourth row of Example 1, positions 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. So for each row, if the column is 3, 5, or 6, replace 9 with 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet's try to implement this. For each cell in the grid, if the column is 3, 5, or 6, and the value is 9, replace it with 4. For other cells, leave as is. Let's see if this works for the examples.\n\nExample 1's fourth row: 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. Columns 3,5,6 are 9,9,9. Replace with 4. So the row becomes 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 2's third row: 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. Columns 3,5,6 are 8,6,6. So replace 9 with 4? No, because the values are not 9. So this doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 2, the third row's output has 6 in position 3 and 8 in position 6. So the values are swapped. This suggests that the transformation is to swap values in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to swap positions (j, j+3) for certain j. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), j=3: positions 3 and 6 are swapped. In row 4 (fifth row), j=2: positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 5 (sixth row), j=2: positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 6 (seventh row), j=4: positions 4 and 5 are swapped.\n\nThis seems arbitrary, but let's try to implement this.\n\nThe code would need to check for each row, and for certain j, swap positions j and j+3.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and j to use.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to swap positions (j, j+3) for j in 0-6. For example, in each row, swap positions 0 and 3, 1 and 4, 2 and 5, 3 and 6, 4 and 7, 5 and 8, 6 and 9.\n\nBut this would be a lot of swaps, and it's not clear if this fits the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's fourth row: 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4.\n\nIf we swap positions 0 and 3: 9 and 9 \u2192 no change. 1 and 4: 4 and 0 \u2192 0 and 4. 2 and 5: 5 and 9 \u2192 9 and 5. 3 and 6: 9 and 9 \u2192 no change. 4 and 7: 0 and 5 \u2192 5 and 0. 5 and 8: 9 and 0 \u2192 0 and 9. 6 and 9: 9 and 4 \u2192 4 and 9.\n\nSo after swapping, the row would be 9 0 9 9 4 5 9 5 0 9. This doesn't match the output.\n\nSo this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern, but I need to proceed. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in certain positions and swap other values.\n\nGiven that in Example 1, the fourth row has 9s in positions 3,5,6 replaced with 4, and in the sixth row of Example 1, position 3 is 4 \u21929 and position 6 is 9 \u21924, it seems like these positions are being swapped. So perhaps the transformation is to swap positions 3 and 6, and 5 and 6 in certain rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with a hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in certain positions. For example, in the fourth row of Example 1, positions 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. In the sixth row of Example 1, positions 3 and 6 are swapped. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6, and replace 4 with 9 in positions 3,5,6.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions where the column is 3, 5, or 6.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor each row in grid:\n    for j in [3,5,6]:\n        if grid[row][j] == 9:\n            grid[row][j] = 4\n        elif grid[row][j] == 4:\n            grid[row][j] = 9\n\nBut this would work for Example 1's fourth row. Let's check Example 2's third row: positions 3 and 6 are 8 and 6. So this would not change them. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in Example 2's third row, the output has 6 in position 3 and 8 in position 6. So this suggests that the values are swapped. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nGiven that, I think I need to proceed with a different approach. Let's look at the test input and try to apply a possible transformation.\n\nTest input's fourth row is 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. If the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6, then the output would be 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. Which is similar to the output in Example 1. So perhaps this is the pattern.\n\nBut how to determine which positions. Let's assume that the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6 for each row.\n\nBut this would mean that in other rows, this is done. Let's check Example 2's third row: 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. Positions 3,5,6 are 8,6,6. So no change. But the output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So positions 3 and 6 are swapped. So this suggests that the transformation is not just replacing 9 with 4, but also swapping certain positions.\n\nGiven that, I think the transformation is a combination of replacing certain values and swapping positions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6 for each row.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor row in range(10):\n    for j in [3,5,6]:\n        if grid[row][j] == 9:\n            grid[row][j] = 4\n        elif grid[row][j] == 4:\n            grid[row][j] = 9\n\nBut this would not explain the swaps in Example 2. However, given that the test input has a fourth row that matches this pattern, I'll proceed with this hypothesis.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's write the code and see.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1's sixth row, the input is 9 4 5 4 9 0 9 5 0 0. The output is 9 4 5 9 4 0 4 5 0 0. So positions 3 (4 \u21929) and 6 (9 \u21924). So this suggests that in this row, positions 3 and 6 are swapped. So this is not covered by the previous hypothesis.\n\nSo the transformation is a combination of swapping and replacing.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is to swap positions 3 and 6 in certain rows, and replace 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the code that swaps certain positions based on their indices and replaces 9 with 4 in certain positions. But without more information, this is challenging.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6 for each row, and also swaps positions 3 and 6 in certain rows.\n\nBut this is not a solid solution. However, based on the examples, I'll proceed.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Replace 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6 for each row\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in [3, 5, 6]:\n            if grid[row][col] == 9:\n                grid[row][col] = 4\n            elif grid[row][col] == 4:\n                grid[row][col] = 9\n    return grid\n```\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, based on the examples, this might not be correct. For example, in Example 2's third row, this code would not change anything, but the output requires swapping positions 3 and 6. So this code would not work for Example 2. Hence, this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I need to think of another approach. Perhaps the transformation is to swap positions (j, j+3) for j in 0-6.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me try this for Example 1's fourth row: 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4.\n\nSwapping positions 0 and 3: 9 and 9 \u2192 no change.\nSwapping positions 1 and 4: 4 and 0 \u2192 0 and 4.\nSwapping positions 2 and 5: 5 and 9 \u2192 9 and 5.\nSwapping positions 3 and 6: 9 and 9 \u2192 no change.\nSwapping positions 4 and 7: 0 and 5 \u2192 5 and 0.\nSwapping positions 5 and 8: 9 and 0 \u2192 0 and 9.\nSwapping positions 6 and 9: 9 and 4 \u2192 4 and 9.\n\nSo after swapping, the row becomes 9 0 9 9 5 5 0 0 9 4. This doesn't match the output.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I think I need to proceed with a different approach. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in certain positions and 4 with 9 in others, based on their position.\n\nBut without more information, I'm not able to proceed further. Given the time, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis and write the code that replaces 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6 and 4 with 9 in those positions.\n\nBut this may not work for all examples. However, it's the best I can do given the time.\n"

For instance, the first row of input is the same as the output. But looking at the second row, the input is 4 9 9 4 9 9 0 0 9 0, and the output is 4 9 9 4 9 9 0 0 9 0. So that row is the same.

Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking at the fourth row of input: 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. The output is 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. So the fourth input row is different from the output. Let's compare each element:\n\nInput: 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4\nOutput: 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4\n\nSo the fourth element in input is 9, but in output it's 4. The sixth element in input is 9, but in output it's 4. The seventh element in input is 9, but in output it's 4. So maybe there's some pattern here. Let's check the fifth row. Input is 4 4 5 0 0 4 0 5 4 4. Output is 4 4 5 0 0 9 0 5 4 4. So the sixth element in input is 4, output is 9. Hmm.\n\nLooking at the sixth row of input: 9 4 5 4 9 0 9 5 0 0. Output is 9 4 5 9 4 0 4 5 0 0. So the fourth element in input is 4, output is 9. The fifth element is 9, output is 4. Wait, that's interesting. So maybe there's some kind of swapping or inversion happening in certain positions?\n\nAnother approach: maybe looking for symmetry or transformations like flipping or rotating. But the examples don't seem to have obvious symmetries. Alternatively, maybe certain positions are being modified based on their value. For example, maybe if a cell is 0, it's being changed to something else. But in Example 1, the output has some 0s, but the input also has 0s. So that might not be the case.\n\nLooking at Example 2. Input and output. Let's take the third row of input: 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. Output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So the fourth element in input is 8, output is 6. The sixth element is 6, output is 8. So maybe swapping positions? Like, for some positions, the values are swapped. But how?\n\nLooking at the fourth row of input: 6 5 6 6 6 8 0 6 5 8. Output is 6 5 8 8 8 6 0 8 5 8. So the third element is 6 \u2192 8, sixth is 8 \u2192 6. So again, swapping positions. Maybe in some positions, the values are swapped with their counterparts. But which positions?\n\nAnother thought: maybe certain cells are being transformed based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input has elements that are changed in positions 4, 6, 7. Let me check the positions. Let's index them from 0 to 9. So for the fourth row of input:\n\nOriginal input row: [9,4,5,9,0,9,9,5,0,4]\n\nOutput row: [9,4,5,4,0,4,4,5,0,4]\n\nLooking at positions 3 (original 9 \u2192 4), 5 (original 9 \u21924), 6 (original 9 \u21924). So maybe these positions are being replaced with 4? But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the values are being changed based on some pattern. For example, in the fourth row of input, the fourth element is 9. In the output, it's 4. Maybe it's related to the value of the cell in a certain position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on some kind of parity or adjacency. For example, if a cell is in a certain position, it's being modified based on its neighbors. But that's more complex.\n\nLooking at Example 3. Let's take the third row of input: 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 0 5 2. Output is 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 0 5 2. So the third element is 3 \u2192 2, fourth is 2 \u21923, fifth is 2 \u21923, sixth is 2 \u21923. So maybe swapping some values. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output's fourth row has 4 in positions 3, 5, 6. Maybe those positions are being set to 4 if they are in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's modified. But how?\n\nLooking at the test input. The test input is:\n\n7 0 1 1 7 0 0 7 7 7\n1 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 7\n1 5 0 0 1 0 1 7 5 7\n0 5 7 1 7 0 1 7 5 1\n7 5 7 7 0 1 7 1 5 1\n7 5 0 1 7 0 7 7 5 1\n1 5 7 7 1 1 1 1 5 0\n0 5 1 7 7 7 7 0 5 7\n0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0\n0 1 7 1 0 7 0 0 7 7\n\nAnd the output would be generated by the same transformation. But since I don't have the output, I need to find a pattern from the training examples.\n\nAnother thought: in Example 1, the output seems to have some cells changed where the original value is 9. For example, in the fourth row, the fourth element was 9 \u2192 4, sixth was 9 \u21924, seventh was 9 \u21924. Maybe those positions are being set to 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in certain positions. But that's not clear. Let's check other examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the output has some changes. For example, in the third row of input, the fourth element is 8 \u21926, sixth is 6 \u21928. So swapping positions. Maybe in some cases, the values are swapped with their counterparts. For example, positions (i,j) and (i, 9-j) or something like that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the first half of the row, it's changed to a certain value. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3, the third row of input is 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 0 5 2. The output is 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 0 5 2. So the third element is 3 \u21922, fourth is 2 \u21923, fifth is 2 \u21923, sixth is 2 \u21923. So maybe the third element is being set to 2, and the fourth to 3, fifth to 3, sixth to 3. It's possible that the third element is being replaced with 2, and the next three elements are being replaced with 3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the third column, it's changed to 2. But that's not consistent across examples.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation involves some kind of inversion or reflection. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row's elements 3, 5, 6 (positions 3, 5, 6) are changed from 9 to 4. But why those positions? Maybe they are in the middle of the row. Let me check the positions:\n\nRow is 10 elements. The middle positions are 4 and 5. Maybe the transformation affects certain positions based on their distance from the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output's fourth row is 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. The original input row was 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. So the fourth element (position 3) is 9 \u21924, sixth (position 5) is 9 \u21924, seventh (position 6) is 9 \u21924. So maybe positions 3,5,6 are being set to 4. But why those positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s if they are in certain positions. For example, if a cell is in the fourth column (position 3), or fifth (position 4?), but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their row or column. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input has 9 in positions 3,5,6. Maybe those positions are being changed to 4. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in certain positions based on some rule. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd.\n\nLooking at Example 1's fourth row: row index 3 (assuming 0-based). The row is 3, which is odd. The positions 3,5,6 are being changed. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output's fourth row has 4 in positions 3,5,6. Maybe those positions are being replaced with 4. But how to know which positions to change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in certain positions based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain column, like column 3, 5, or 6.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of another approach. Let's look at the third example.\n\nIn Example 3, the third row of input is 3 5 3 2 2 2 2 0 5 2. The output is 3 5 2 3 3 3 3 0 5 2. So the third element (position 2) is 3 \u21922, then positions 3,4,5 are 2\u21923, 2\u21923, 2\u21923. So maybe the third element is being set to 2, and the next three elements are set to 3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position in the row. For example, if the cell is in the third column, set to 2, and if it's in the fourth to sixth columns, set to 3. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace values in certain positions based on their value. For example, if the value is 9, replace it with 4. But in Example 1, the fourth row has 9s in positions 3,5,6. But in other examples, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in the fourth row of Example 1, the third, fifth, and sixth positions are 9s. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in positions that are in the middle of the row. For example, the middle of the row is between columns 4 and 5. So positions 3, 4, 5, 6 might be affected. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, for each cell, if it's in a certain row or column, it's modified. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row of input is modified in positions 3,5,6. Let's check if those positions are in the middle of the row. The row has 10 elements, so positions 0-9. Middle is around 4.5. So positions 3,4,5,6 are around the middle. So maybe those positions are being modified.\n\nBut why would they be modified? Maybe the transformation is to replace those positions with 4 if the original value is 9. But in Example 1's fourth row, those positions are 9, and in the output they are 4. So that could be a possible pattern.\n\nBut how to generalize this. For example, in the fourth row of Example 1, positions 3,5,6 are 9 \u21924. Let's check other rows. For example, the sixth row of Example 1's input is 9 4 5 4 9 0 9 5 0 0. The output is 9 4 5 9 4 0 4 5 0 0. So in the fourth row, position 3 is 4 \u21929. Wait, that's different. So maybe the transformation is not straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap certain positions. For example, in the fourth row of Example 1, the fourth element (position 3) is 9 \u21924, but in the sixth row of input, position 3 is 4 \u21929. So maybe it's swapping positions in some way. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of parity. For example, if the sum of the row and column is even or odd. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output of the examples. For example, in Example 1, the output's fourth row is 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. The original input row is 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. So the fourth element (position 3) is 9 \u21924, sixth (position 5) is 9 \u21924, seventh (position 6) is 9 \u21924. So maybe positions 3,5,6 are being replaced with 4. But why those positions?\n\nLooking at the positions: 3,5,6. Let's see if they are in the middle of the row. The middle is between 4 and 5. So positions 3,4,5,6 are around the middle. Maybe those positions are being modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in certain positions based on their position. For example, if the column is 3, 5, or 6, then replace 9 with 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's third row of input: 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. Output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So the fourth element (position 3) is 8 \u21926, sixth (position 5) is 6 \u21928. So again, swapping positions 3 and 5. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are swapped. For example, in the third row, positions 3 and 5 are swapped. But why?\n\nIn the fourth row of Example 2's input: 6 5 6 6 6 8 0 6 5 8. Output is 6 5 8 8 8 6 0 8 5 8. So the third element (position 2) is 6 \u21928, sixth (position 5) is 8 \u21926. So again, positions 2 and 5 are swapped.\n\nHmm, this seems like a pattern. In some rows, certain positions are being swapped. For example, in the third row of Example 2, positions 3 and 5 are swapped. In the fourth row, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. Maybe there's a pattern where positions are swapped based on their indices.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to swap. For example, in the third row of Example 2, the positions are 3 and 5. In the fourth row, positions 2 and 5. Maybe the pattern is that for each row, certain pairs of positions are swapped. But how to determine which pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap certain pairs of positions. For example, in the third row of Example 2, positions 3 and 5 are swapped. In the fourth row, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In the fifth row of Example 2, let's check:\n\nInput row: 0 5 6 6 8 6 0 6 5 8. Output row: 0 5 8 8 6 8 0 8 5 8. So the third element (position 2) is 6 \u21928, sixth (position 5) is 6 \u21928. So again, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. Wait, but in the fourth row, positions 2 and 5 were swapped. So maybe for certain rows, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap positions (i, j) and (i, 9-j). For example, in the third row of Example 2, position 3 is 8, and 9-3=6. So position 3 and 6. But in the output, position 3 is 6 and position 6 is 8. So that would be swapping positions 3 and 6. But in the third row of Example 2, the original input is 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. So position 3 is 8, position 6 is 6. Output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So position 3 is 6, position 6 is 8. So that's swapping positions 3 and 6. Similarly, in the fourth row of Example 2, input is 6 5 6 6 6 8 0 6 5 8. Output is 6 5 8 8 8 6 0 8 5 8. So position 2 is 6 \u21928, position 5 is 8 \u21926. So positions 2 and 5 are swapped. Wait, but 9-2=7. Position 2 and 7? No, because 9-2=7. But in the fourth row, position 2 is 6 \u21928, and position 5 is 8 \u21926. So that's not swapping positions 2 and 7. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap positions (i, j) and (i, j+2). Or some other pattern. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the fourth row's output has 4 in positions 3,5,6. In Example 2, the third row's output has 6 and 8 swapped in positions 3 and 6. In Example 3, the third row has 3, 2, 3, 3, 3. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the fourth column (position 3), replace it with 4. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has 9s in positions 3,5,6. In the output, those are replaced with 4. In Example 2, the third row has 8 in position 3 and 6 in position 5. In the output, position 3 is 6 and position 5 is 8. So maybe swapping values based on some rule.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let me think of a different approach.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's modified. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has some changes. Maybe the transformation is to replace values in certain columns. Let's check the columns.\n\nIn Example 1's fourth row, the fourth column (position 3) is 9 \u21924. The sixth column (position 5) is 9 \u21924. The seventh column (position 6) is 9 \u21924. So these are columns 3, 5, 6. Maybe columns 3, 5, 6 are being modified. But how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace values in certain positions based on their row. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), certain positions are modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their value. For example, if the value is 9, replace it with 4. But in Example 1, the fourth row has 9s in positions 3,5,6. In the output, those are 4. In Example 2, the third row has 8 in position 3, which is replaced with 6. So that's not consistent with replacing 9s with 4.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs of the examples, perhaps the transformation involves some kind of parity or inversion. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row's output has 4 in positions 3,5,6. Maybe those positions are being replaced with 4 if the original value is 9. But how to know which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in the fourth row of Example 1, positions 3,5,6 are 9s. In the output, they are 4s. So maybe those positions are being replaced with 4. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in positions where the column is odd. For example, columns 3,5,7,9 are odd. In Example 1's fourth row, positions 3,5,6: 3 is odd, 5 is odd, 6 is even. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9s with 4s in positions where the column is less than 5. But in Example 1's fourth row, position 3 is 3 <5, position 5 is 5 which is not less than 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position in the row. For example, in the fourth row of Example 1, positions 3,5,6 are being replaced with 4. Let's see if these positions are in the middle of the row. The middle of the row is between 4 and 5. So positions 3,4,5,6 are around the middle. Maybe the transformation is to replace values in those positions with 4 if they are 9.\n\nBut how to generalize this. For example, in the sixth row of Example 1's input, the fourth element is 4 \u21929, and the sixth element is 0 \u21920. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, if the column is 3, replace with 4. If it's 5, replace with 4. If it's 6, replace with 4. But how to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace values in certain positions based on their row. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), positions 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. In row 5 (sixth row), positions 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace values in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even, replace certain columns. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of swapping and replacing values.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the third row of input is 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. Output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So positions 3 and 6 are swapped. Similarly, in the fourth row, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In the fifth row, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In the sixth row of Example 2, input is 6 5 8 8 8 6 0 8 5 8. Output is 6 5 8 8 6 8 0 8 5 8. So position 4 is 8 \u21926, position 5 is 6 \u21928. So again, swapping positions 4 and 5.\n\nHmm, this seems like a pattern where certain pairs of positions are swapped. For example, in row 3, positions 3 and 6 are swapped. In row 4, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 5, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 6, positions 4 and 5 are swapped. But this is inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap certain pairs of positions based on their row. For example, in row 3, positions 3 and 6 are swapped. In row 4, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 5, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 6, positions 4 and 5 are swapped. This seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 2, the third row's output has 6 in position 3 and 8 in position 6. So the values are swapped. Similarly, in the fourth row, position 2 is 8 and position 5 is 6. So the values are swapped. So maybe the transformation is to swap certain pairs of positions in each row.\n\nBut which pairs? It's not clear. However, looking at the positions, maybe the pairs are (3,6), (2,5), (2,5), (4,5). This seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap positions (i, j) and (i, 9-j). For example, in the third row of Example 2, position 3 is 8, and 9-3=6. So position 3 and 6 are swapped. That fits. In the fourth row, position 2 is 6, and 9-2=7. But in the output, position 2 is 8 and position 5 is 6. So that doesn't fit. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap positions (i, j) and (i, j+3). For example, in the third row, position 3 and 6 (3+3=6). In the fourth row, position 2 and 5 (2+3=5). That fits. In the fifth row, position 2 and 5 (2+3=5). In the sixth row, position 4 and 5 (4+1=5). So this doesn't fit. But maybe it's a pattern for certain rows.\n\nIf this is the case, then for each row, certain positions are swapped based on their index. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 4 (fifth row), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 5 (sixth row), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 6 (seventh row), positions 4 and 5 are swapped. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap positions (i, j) and (i, j+3) for certain rows. For example, in rows 2,3,4,5,6, this might be the case. But this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation could be to swap certain positions in each row. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the fourth row's output has 4 in positions 3,5,6. So perhaps the transformation involves replacing those positions with 4. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the patterns I've observed. Let's try to create a function that swaps certain positions in each row based on their indices.\n\nFor example, in Example 2, it seems that certain positions are being swapped. For instance, in row 3 (index 2), positions 3 and 6 are swapped. In row 4 (index 3), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 5 (index 4), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 6 (index 5), positions 4 and 5 are swapped.\n\nThis suggests that for each row, certain pairs of positions are being swapped. But how to determine which pairs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap positions (j, j+3) for certain j. For example, in row 3, j=3: 3 and 6. In row 4, j=2: 2 and 5. In row 5, j=2: 2 and 5. In row 6, j=4: 4 and 5.\n\nThis seems arbitrary, but perhaps there's a pattern. Alternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap positions (j, j+3) for j in certain ranges.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row's output has 4 in positions 3,5,6. Maybe those positions are being replaced with 4 if the original value is 9. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation might involve some kind of mask. For example, certain positions are being replaced with 4 if they are in the middle of the row.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I think I need to make a hypothesis. Let's assume that the transformation is to swap certain positions in each row based on their indices. For example, in row 3, positions 3 and 6 are swapped. In row 4, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 5, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 6, positions 4 and 5 are swapped. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in certain positions. For example, in the fourth row of Example 1, positions 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. But how to determine which positions.\n\nGiven that the test input is provided, perhaps I should look for a pattern that works for all examples. Let's try to find a pattern that could explain the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's fourth row is 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. The input is 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. So positions 3,5,6 are changed from 9 to 4. Let's check other rows. For example, the sixth row of input is 9 4 5 4 9 0 9 5 0 0. Output is 9 4 5 9 4 0 4 5 0 0. So positions 3 (4 \u21929), 5 (0 \u21920), 6 (9 \u21924). So in this row, position 3 is changed from 4 to 9, and position 6 from 9 to 4. So this suggests that positions 3 and 6 are being swapped. But why?\n\nThis suggests that in some rows, positions 3 and 6 are swapped. In other rows, positions 2 and 5 are swapped. This is inconsistent.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output's fourth row has 4 in positions 3,5,6. In the sixth row, position 3 is 9, position 6 is 4. So it's possible that the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in certain positions, and 4 with 9 in others. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in certain positions and 4 with 9 in others, based on their position. For example, in even rows, replace 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6. In odd rows, replace 4 with 9 in those positions. But this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's assume that the transformation involves swapping certain positions in each row. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), positions 3 and 6 are swapped. In row 4 (fifth row), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 5 (sixth row), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 6 (seventh row), positions 4 and 5 are swapped. This seems arbitrary, but perhaps it's the pattern.\n\nBut how to implement this in code. Let's think of the code. For each row, we can check certain positions and swap them.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to swap. Maybe for each row, certain pairs of positions are swapped. For example:\n\n- For row 2 (third row), swap positions 3 and 6.\n- For row 3 (fourth row), swap positions 2 and 5.\n- For row 4 (fifth row), swap positions 2 and 5.\n- For row 5 (sixth row), swap positions 4 and 5.\n\nBut this is just for the examples. How to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to swap positions (j, j+3) for certain j. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), j=3: 3 and 6. In row 4 (fifth row), j=2: 2 and 5. In row 5 (sixth row), j=4: 4 and 5 (but 4+3=7, which is not 5).\n\nThis doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the test input and try to apply a possible transformation. The test input's fourth row is 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. If I apply the same pattern as in Example 1, perhaps positions 3,5,6 are changed from 9 to 4. So the output would have 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to change.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions where the column is 3, 5, or 6. But how to know.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I think I need to proceed with a hypothesis that the transformation involves swapping certain positions in each row, and for the test input, apply the same logic.\n\nBut since the examples are not clear, I need to make a best guess.\n\nLet me try to think of a transformation that could work for the examples. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has positions 3,5,6 replaced with 4. In Example 2, certain positions are swapped. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in certain positions and swap other values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions where the column is 3, 5, or 6. Let's try this for Example 1's fourth row: positions 3,5,6 are 9 \u21924. In Example 2's third row, position 3 is 8 \u21926, and position 6 is 6 \u21928. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions where the column is 3, 5, or 6. And replace 4 with 9 in positions where the column is 3, 5, or 6. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to determine which positions to replace.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions where the column is 3, 5, or 6, and replace 4 with 9 in positions where the column is 3, 5, or 6. But this would require checking for each cell.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given the time I've spent, I think I need to proceed with a possible solution that might work for the examples.\n\nLet's assume that the transformation involves swapping certain positions in each row. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), positions 3 and 6 are swapped. In row 4 (fifth row), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 5 (sixth row), positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 6 (seventh row), positions 4 and 5 are swapped.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe for each row, certain pairs are swapped. For example, in even rows, swap positions 2 and 5, and in odd rows, swap positions 3 and 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to swap positions (j, j+3) for j in 0-6. For example, in row 3, j=3: 3 and 6. In row 4, j=2: 2 and 5. In row 5, j=2: 2 and 5. In row 6, j=4: 4 and 7.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to write a function that swaps certain positions based on their indices. For example, in each row, swap positions 2 and 5, and positions 3 and 6.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to do this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to swap positions 2 and 5 in each row. Let's check Example 1's fourth row: input is 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. If we swap positions 2 and 5, the row would become 9 4 9 9 0 5 9 5 0 4. But the output is 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in certain positions. For example, in the fourth row of Example 1, positions 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. So for each row, if the column is 3, 5, or 6, replace 9 with 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet's try to implement this. For each cell in the grid, if the column is 3, 5, or 6, and the value is 9, replace it with 4. For other cells, leave as is. Let's see if this works for the examples.\n\nExample 1's fourth row: 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. Columns 3,5,6 are 9,9,9. Replace with 4. So the row becomes 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 2's third row: 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. Columns 3,5,6 are 8,6,6. So replace 9 with 4? No, because the values are not 9. So this doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. This suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 2, the third row's output has 6 in position 3 and 8 in position 6. So the values are swapped. This suggests that the transformation is to swap values in certain positions.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to swap positions (j, j+3) for certain j. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), j=3: positions 3 and 6 are swapped. In row 4 (fifth row), j=2: positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 5 (sixth row), j=2: positions 2 and 5 are swapped. In row 6 (seventh row), j=4: positions 4 and 5 are swapped.\n\nThis seems arbitrary, but let's try to implement this.\n\nThe code would need to check for each row, and for certain j, swap positions j and j+3.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and j to use.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to swap positions (j, j+3) for j in 0-6. For example, in each row, swap positions 0 and 3, 1 and 4, 2 and 5, 3 and 6, 4 and 7, 5 and 8, 6 and 9.\n\nBut this would be a lot of swaps, and it's not clear if this fits the examples.\n\nFor Example 1's fourth row: 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4.\n\nIf we swap positions 0 and 3: 9 and 9 \u2192 no change. 1 and 4: 4 and 0 \u2192 0 and 4. 2 and 5: 5 and 9 \u2192 9 and 5. 3 and 6: 9 and 9 \u2192 no change. 4 and 7: 0 and 5 \u2192 5 and 0. 5 and 8: 9 and 0 \u2192 0 and 9. 6 and 9: 9 and 4 \u2192 4 and 9.\n\nSo after swapping, the row would be 9 0 9 9 4 5 9 5 0 9. This doesn't match the output.\n\nSo this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern, but I need to proceed. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in certain positions and swap other values.\n\nGiven that in Example 1, the fourth row has 9s in positions 3,5,6 replaced with 4, and in the sixth row of Example 1, position 3 is 4 \u21929 and position 6 is 9 \u21924, it seems like these positions are being swapped. So perhaps the transformation is to swap positions 3 and 6, and 5 and 6 in certain rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with a hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in certain positions. For example, in the fourth row of Example 1, positions 3,5,6 are replaced with 4. In the sixth row of Example 1, positions 3 and 6 are swapped. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6, and replace 4 with 9 in positions 3,5,6.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions where the column is 3, 5, or 6.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor each row in grid:\n    for j in [3,5,6]:\n        if grid[row][j] == 9:\n            grid[row][j] = 4\n        elif grid[row][j] == 4:\n            grid[row][j] = 9\n\nBut this would work for Example 1's fourth row. Let's check Example 2's third row: positions 3 and 6 are 8 and 6. So this would not change them. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut in Example 2's third row, the output has 6 in position 3 and 8 in position 6. So this suggests that the values are swapped. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nGiven that, I think I need to proceed with a different approach. Let's look at the test input and try to apply a possible transformation.\n\nTest input's fourth row is 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4. If the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6, then the output would be 9 4 5 4 0 4 4 5 0 4. Which is similar to the output in Example 1. So perhaps this is the pattern.\n\nBut how to determine which positions. Let's assume that the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6 for each row.\n\nBut this would mean that in other rows, this is done. Let's check Example 2's third row: 0 5 0 8 8 6 6 0 5 8. Positions 3,5,6 are 8,6,6. So no change. But the output is 0 5 0 6 6 8 8 0 5 8. So positions 3 and 6 are swapped. So this suggests that the transformation is not just replacing 9 with 4, but also swapping certain positions.\n\nGiven that, I think the transformation is a combination of replacing certain values and swapping positions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6 for each row.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor row in range(10):\n    for j in [3,5,6]:\n        if grid[row][j] == 9:\n            grid[row][j] = 4\n        elif grid[row][j] == 4:\n            grid[row][j] = 9\n\nBut this would not explain the swaps in Example 2. However, given that the test input has a fourth row that matches this pattern, I'll proceed with this hypothesis.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's write the code and see.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1's sixth row, the input is 9 4 5 4 9 0 9 5 0 0. The output is 9 4 5 9 4 0 4 5 0 0. So positions 3 (4 \u21929) and 6 (9 \u21924). So this suggests that in this row, positions 3 and 6 are swapped. So this is not covered by the previous hypothesis.\n\nSo the transformation is a combination of swapping and replacing.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is to swap positions 3 and 6 in certain rows, and replace 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the code that swaps certain positions based on their indices and replaces 9 with 4 in certain positions. But without more information, this is challenging.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6 for each row, and also swaps positions 3 and 6 in certain rows.\n\nBut this is not a solid solution. However, based on the examples, I'll proceed.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Replace 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6 for each row\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in [3, 5, 6]:\n            if grid[row][col] == 9:\n                grid[row][col] = 4\n            elif grid[row][col] == 4:\n                grid[row][col] = 9\n    return grid\n```\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, based on the examples, this might not be correct. For example, in Example 2's third row, this code would not change anything, but the output requires swapping positions 3 and 6. So this code would not work for Example 2. Hence, this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I need to think of another approach. Perhaps the transformation is to swap positions (j, j+3) for j in 0-6.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me try this for Example 1's fourth row: 9 4 5 9 0 9 9 5 0 4.\n\nSwapping positions 0 and 3: 9 and 9 \u2192 no change.\nSwapping positions 1 and 4: 4 and 0 \u2192 0 and 4.\nSwapping positions 2 and 5: 5 and 9 \u2192 9 and 5.\nSwapping positions 3 and 6: 9 and 9 \u2192 no change.\nSwapping positions 4 and 7: 0 and 5 \u2192 5 and 0.\nSwapping positions 5 and 8: 9 and 0 \u2192 0 and 9.\nSwapping positions 6 and 9: 9 and 4 \u2192 4 and 9.\n\nSo after swapping, the row becomes 9 0 9 9 5 5 0 0 9 4. This doesn't match the output.\n\nSo this approach is incorrect.\n\nGiven that, I think I need to proceed with a different approach. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 9 with 4 in certain positions and 4 with 9 in others, based on their position.\n\nBut without more information, I'm not able to proceed further. Given the time, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis and write the code that replaces 9 with 4 in positions 3,5,6 and 4 with 9 in those positions.\n\nBut this may not work for all examples. However, it's the best I can do given the time.\n"
