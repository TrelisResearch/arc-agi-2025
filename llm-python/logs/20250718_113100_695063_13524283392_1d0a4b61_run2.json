The second and second-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n3. The third and third-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n4. The fourth and fourth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n5. The fifth and fifth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n6. The sixth and sixth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n7. The seventh and seventh-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n8. The eighth and eighth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n9. The ninth and ninth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n10. The tenth and tenth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n11. The eleventh and eleventh-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n12. The twelfth and twelfth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n13. The thirteenth and thirteenth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n14. The fourteenth and fourteenth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n15. The fifteenth and fifteenth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n16. The sixteenth and sixteenth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n17. The seventeenth and seventeenth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n18. The eighteenth and eighteenth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n19. The nineteenth and nineteenth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n20. The twentieth and twentieth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n21. The twenty-first and twenty-first-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n22. The twenty-second and twenty-second-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n23. The twenty-third and twenty-third-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n24. The twenty-fourth and twenty-fourth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n25. The twenty-fifth row of the input grid is identical to the output grid.\n\nFrom this, I observe that the output grid is identical to the input grid. However, this is not the case for all training examples. For example, in Example 2, the output grid is not identical to the input grid. Therefore, I must conclude that the transformation is not simply copying the input grid.\n\nAfter further analysis, I observe that the output grid is a transformation of the input grid where certain patterns are preserved and others are modified. However, I am not able to identify a clear pattern that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\nBased on this, I will implement a transformation that copies the input grid, as this is the most straightforward transformation that matches the first few examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Return a copy of the input grid\n    return [row[:] for row in grid]\n```",

The second and second-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n3. The third and third-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n4. The fourth and fourth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n5. The fifth and fifth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n6. The sixth and sixth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n7. The seventh and seventh-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n8. The eighth and eighth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n9. The ninth and ninth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n10. The tenth and tenth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n11. The eleventh and eleventh-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n12. The twelfth and twelfth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n13. The thirteenth and thirteenth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n14. The fourteenth and fourteenth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n15. The fifteenth and fifteenth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n16. The sixteenth and sixteenth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n17. The seventeenth and seventeenth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n18. The eighteenth and eighteenth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n19. The nineteenth and nineteenth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n20. The twentieth and twentieth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n21. The twenty-first and twenty-first-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n22. The twenty-second and twenty-second-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n23. The twenty-third and twenty-third-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n24. The twenty-fourth and twenty-fourth-last rows of the input grid are identical to the output grid.\n25. The twenty-fifth row of the input grid is identical to the output grid.\n\nFrom this, I observe that the output grid is identical to the input grid. However, this is not the case for all training examples. For example, in Example 2, the output grid is not identical to the input grid. Therefore, I must conclude that the transformation is not simply copying the input grid.\n\nAfter further analysis, I observe that the output grid is a transformation of the input grid where certain patterns are preserved and others are modified. However, I am not able to identify a clear pattern that maps the input grid to the output grid.\n\nBased on this, I will implement a transformation that copies the input grid, as this is the most straightforward transformation that matches the first few examples.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Return a copy of the input grid\n    return [row[:] for row in grid]\n```",
