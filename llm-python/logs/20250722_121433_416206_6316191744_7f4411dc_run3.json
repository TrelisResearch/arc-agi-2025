Removing or modifying certain values (especially 0s)\n2. Preserving some values (especially 7s and 6s)\n3. Creating new patterns based on the original values\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that the transformation seems to be:\n- Keeping certain values (like 7s) in their original positions\n- Removing or modifying other values (like 0s)\n- Creating new patterns based on the original values\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Keeps 7s in their original positions\n- Sets all other values to 0\n- Preserves the original grid size (13x13)\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new 13x13 grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    \n    # Keep 7s in their original positions\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new 13x13 grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    \n    # Keep 7s in their original positions\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
