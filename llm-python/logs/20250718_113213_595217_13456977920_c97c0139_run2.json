The output grid always has a 17x19 size\n2. There's a pattern of expanding or propagating values from a central point\n3. The value 2 in the input seems to be transformed into a pattern of 8s and 2s in the output\n4. The transformation seems to involve some kind of wave or expansion pattern\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that expands the value 2 into a pattern of 8s and 2s, with some kind of wave-like propagation.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(17)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid\n    for i in range(17):\n        for j in range(20):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            \n            # If the value is 2, propagate it to the output grid\n            if val == 2:\n                # Create a wave-like pattern of 8s and 2s\n                # This is a simple pattern that expands from the center\n                # This is a simplified version based on the examples\n                # The actual pattern might be more complex\n                # For this solution, we'll create a wave that expands outward\n                # from the position of the 2 in the input grid\n                # This is a simplified version that may not perfectly match all examples\n                # but captures the general pattern\n                for x in range(17):\n                    for y in range(19):\n                        # Create a wave pattern that expands from the center\n                        # This is a simplified version\n                        distance = abs(x - i) + abs(y - j)\n                        if distance <= 4:\n                            output[x][y] = 8\n                        elif distance == 5:\n                            output[x][y] = 2\n                        # Keep other cells as 0\n    return output\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that:\n1. The output grid always has a 17x19 size\n2. There's a pattern of expanding or propagating values from a central point\n3. The value 2 in the input seems to be transformed into a pattern of 8s and 2s in the output\n4. The transformation seems to involve some kind of wave or expansion pattern\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that expands the value 2 into a pattern of 8s and 2s, with some kind of wave-like propagation.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(19)] for _ in range(17)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid\n    for i in range(17):\n        for j in range(20):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            \n            # If the value is 2, propagate it to the output grid\n            if val == 2:\n                # Create a wave-like pattern of 8s and 2s\n                # This is a simple pattern that expands from the center\n                # This is a simplified version based on the examples\n                # The actual pattern might be more complex\n                # For this solution, we'll create a wave that expands outward\n                # from the position of the 2 in the input grid\n                # This is a simplified version that may not perfectly match all examples\n                # but captures the general pattern\n                for x in range(17):\n                    for y in range(19):\n                        # Create a wave pattern that expands from the center\n                        # This is a simplified version\n                        distance = abs(x - i) + abs(y - j)\n                        if distance <= 4:\n                            output[x][y] = 8\n                        elif distance == 5:\n                            output[x][y] = 2\n                        # Keep other cells as 0\n    return output\n```",
