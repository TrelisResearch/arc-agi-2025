              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe that the transformation involves several patterns:\n\n1. **Preservation of certain values**: Values like 0, 3, and 8 seem to be preserved in certain regions.\n2. **Replacement of specific values**: Values like 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 are replaced or modified in specific patterns.\n3. **Regional transformations**: There are transformations that occur in specific regions of the grid, such as replacing values in certain blocks or patterns.\n4. **Symmetry and structure**: The transformation seems to involve maintaining certain structural patterns while modifying others.\n\nBased on these observations, I implement a transformation that:\n- Preserves certain values (like 0, 3, and 8)\n- Replaces other values based on their position and context\n- Maintains structural patterns while modifying others\n\nHere's the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a deep copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation logic\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            # Preserve 0, 3, and 8\n            if grid[i][j] in {0, 3, 8}:\n                continue\n            \n            # Replace 1 with 2 in certain patterns\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Check if it's in a specific pattern (e.g., surrounded by 3s)\n                if (i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 3) and (i < 29 and grid[i+1][j] == 3) and (j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 3) and (j < 29 and grid[i][j+1] == 3):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            \n            # Replace 2 with 1 in certain patterns\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Check if it's in a specific pattern (e.g., surrounded by 3s)\n                if (i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 3) and (i < 29 and grid[i+1][j] == 3) and (j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 3) and (j < 29 and grid[i][j+1] == 3):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            \n            # Replace 4 with 2 in certain patterns\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Check if it's in a specific pattern (e.g., surrounded by 3s)\n                if (i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 3) and (i < 29 and grid[i+1][j] == 3) and (j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 3) and (j < 29 and grid[i][j+1] == 3):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            \n            # Replace 5 with 1 in certain patterns\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Check if it's in a specific pattern (e.g., surrounded by 3s)\n                if (i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 3) and (i < 29 and grid[i+1][j] == 3) and (j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 3) and (j < 29 and grid[i][j+1] == 3):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            \n            # Replace 6 with 1 in certain patterns\n            if grid[i][j] == 6:\n                # Check if it's in a specific pattern (e.g., surrounded by 3s)\n                if (i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 3) and (i < 29 and grid[i+1][j] == 3) and (j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 3) and (j < 29 and grid[i][j+1] == 3):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            \n            # Replace 7 with 1 in certain patterns\n            if grid[i][j] == 7:\n                # Check if it's in a specific pattern (e.g., surrounded by 3s)\n                if (i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 3) and (i < 29 and grid[i+1][j] == 3) and (j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 3) and (j < 29 and grid[i][j+1] == 3):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            \n            # Replace 9 with 1 in certain patterns\n            if grid[i][j] == 9:\n                # Check if it's in a specific pattern (e.g., surrounded by 3s)\n                if (i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 3) and (i < 29 and grid[i+1][j] == 3) and (j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 3) and (j < 29 and grid[i][j+1] == 3):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
