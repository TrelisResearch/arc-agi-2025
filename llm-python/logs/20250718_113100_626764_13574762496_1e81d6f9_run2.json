The first column (index 0) remains unchanged in all examples\n2. The fourth column (index 3) contains the value 5 in the input and remains 5 in the output\n3. The value 3 appears in the 13th column (index 12) in some examples\n4. The value 8 appears in the 8th column (index 7) in some examples\n5. The value 4 appears in the 9th column (index 8) in some examples\n6. The value 7 appears in the 12th column (index 11) in some examples\n7.

The value 0 appears in many positions and seems to be preserved\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves preserving certain values in specific columns while possibly modifying others.
