The output grid always has 0s in the first and last rows\n2. The 8s in the input are being transformed into 2s in the output\n3. The transformation seems to be related to the position and spacing of the 8s\n4. There's a pattern of 2s forming a kind of \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape in the output\n5. The transformation appears to be more complex than a simple replacement of 8s with 2s\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces 8s with 2s in specific positions, creating a pattern that resembles a cross or plus shape.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

The output grid always has 0s in the first and last rows\n2. The 8s in the input are being transformed into 2s in the output\n3. The transformation seems to be related to the position and spacing of the 8s\n4. There's a pattern of 2s forming a kind of \"cross\" or \"plus\" shape in the output\n5. The transformation appears to be more complex than a simple replacement of 8s with 2s\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces 8s with 2s in specific positions, creating a pattern that resembles a cross or plus shape.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
