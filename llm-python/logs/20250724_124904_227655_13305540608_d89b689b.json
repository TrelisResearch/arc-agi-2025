    "content": "Let me analyze the training examples to identify the pattern.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nExample 1:\n- Input has 7, 6, 8(2x2 block), 4, 9\n- Output has 6, 7, 4, 9 arranged differently\n\nExample 2:\n- Input has 5, 9, 8(2x2 block), 2, 1\n- Output has 5, 9, 2, 1 arranged differently\n\nExample 3:\n- Input has 1, 4, 8(2x2 block), 3, 6\n- Output has 1, 4, 3, 6 arranged differently\n\nLet me look more carefully at the positioning:\n\nIn the outputs, I notice:\n- The non-zero values are placed in rows 4 and 5 (0-indexed)\n- They're placed in a specific pattern in columns 4, 5, 6\n- The 2x2 blocks of 8s seem to be ignored or treated as background\n- It looks like the corner values are being extracted and rearranged\n\nLet me trace this more systematically:\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput corners/edges: 7 (top-right), 6 (left of center), 4 (bottom-left), 9 (bottom-right)\nOutput: 6,7 in row 4 cols 4,5 and 4,9 in row 5 cols 4,5\n\nActually, let me look at this differently:\n- It seems like we're taking certain non-zero values from the input and placing them in a specific pattern in the output\n- The 8,8 blocks appear consistently in the middle area but don't appear in output\n- The output seems to take values from corners or edges and place them in rows 4-5, columns 4-5\n\nLet me look at the specific positions:\nRow 4: [0, 0, 0, 0, a, b, 0, 0, 0, 0]\nRow 5: [0, 0, 0, 0, c, d, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nIn Example 1: a=6, b=7, c=4, d=9\nIn Example 2: a=5, b=9, c=2, d=1\nIn Example 3: a=1, b=4, c=3, d=6\n\nSo it looks like we're:\n1. Extracting specific values from the input grid\n2. Placing them in positions (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nLet me see the pattern of which values are extracted:\nExample 1: 6, 7, 4, 9\nExample 2: 5, 9, 2, 1\nExample 3: 1, 4, 3, 6\n\nLooking at positions in input:\nExample 1: 6 at (3,1), 7 at (0,8), 4 at (8,1), 9 at (0,9) or 9 at (9,9)\nActually 7 at (0,8), 6 at (3,1), 4 at (8,1), 9 at (9,9)\n\nHmm, let me try a different approach. Looking at which non-8 values are on the grid and how they map:\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. Find the four non-zero, non-8 values in the grid\n2. Place them in order in the center area (rows 4-5, columns 4-5)\n\nLet me check if there's a positional logic:\n- Top-left quadrant value goes to (4,4)\n- Top-right quadrant value goes to (4,5) \n- Bottom-left quadrant value goes to (5,4)\n- Bottom-right quadrant value goes to (5,5)\n\nActually looking more carefully:\nIn Example 1: 6 at (3,1) [top-left area], 7 at (0,8) [top-right area], 4 at (8,1) [bottom-left], 9 at (9,9) [bottom-right]\nOutput: (4,4)=6, (4,5)=7, (5,4)=4, (5,5)=9\n\nThis seems right! Let me verify with other examples.\n\nExample 2: 5 at (0,2) [top-left], 9 at (1,8) [top-right], 2 at (8,1) [bottom-left], 1 at (6,9) [bottom-right]\nOutput: (4,4)=5, (4,5)=9, (5,4)=2, (5,5)=1\n\nExample 3: 1 at (0,3) [top-left], 4 at (0,9) [top-right], 3 at (7,2) [bottom-left], 6 at (9,9) [bottom-right]  \nOutput: (4,4)=1, (4,5)=4, (5,4)=3, (5,5)=6\n\nYes! The pattern is:\n1. Find the four non-zero, non-8 values\n2. Based on their approximate quadrants, place them in the center area\n3. Top-left quadrant \u2192 (4,4)\n4. Top-right quadrant \u2192 (4,5)\n5. Bottom-left quadrant \u2192 (5,4)\n6. Bottom-right quadrant \u2192 (5,5)\n\nTo determine quadrants, I'll use (row < 5, col < 5) for top-left, etc.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Find non-zero, non-8 values and their positions\n    non_eight_values = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0 and grid[i][j] != 8:\n                non_eight_values.append((grid[i][j], i, j))\n    \n    # Sort values by their quadrants\n    top_left = []\n    top_right = []\n    bottom_left = []\n    bottom_right = []\n    \n    for value, row, col in non_eight_values:\n        if row < 5 and col < 5:\n            top_left.append((value, row, col))\n        elif row < 5 and col >= 5:\n            top_right.append((value, row, col))\n        elif row >= 5 and col < 5:\n            bottom_left.append((value, row, col))\n        else:\n            bottom_right.append((value, row, col))\n    \n    # Place values in output grid\n    # Take one value from each quadrant (the first one found)\n    if top_left:\n        output[4][4] = top_left[0][0]\n    if top_right:\n        output[4][5] = top_right[0][0]\n    if bottom_left:\n        output[5][4] = bottom_left[0][0]\n    if bottom_right:\n        output[5][5] = bottom_right[0][0]\n    \n    return output\n```",

Extracting specific values from the input grid\n2. Placing them in positions (4,4), (4,5), (5,4), (5,5)\n\nLet me see the pattern of which values are extracted:\nExample 1: 6, 7, 4, 9\nExample 2: 5, 9, 2, 1\nExample 3: 1, 4, 3, 6\n\nLooking at positions in input:\nExample 1: 6 at (3,1), 7 at (0,8), 4 at (8,1), 9 at (0,9) or 9 at (9,9)\nActually 7 at (0,8), 6 at (3,1), 4 at (8,1), 9 at (9,9)\n\nHmm, let me try a different approach. Looking at which non-8 values are on the grid and how they map:\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. Find the four non-zero, non-8 values in the grid\n2. Place them in order in the center area (rows 4-5, columns 4-5)\n\nLet me check if there's a positional logic:\n- Top-left quadrant value goes to (4,4)\n- Top-right quadrant value goes to (4,5) \n- Bottom-left quadrant value goes to (5,4)\n- Bottom-right quadrant value goes to (5,5)\n\nActually looking more carefully:\nIn Example 1: 6 at (3,1) [top-left area], 7 at (0,8) [top-right area], 4 at (8,1) [bottom-left], 9 at (9,9) [bottom-right]\nOutput: (4,4)=6, (4,5)=7, (5,4)=4, (5,5)=9\n\nThis seems right! Let me verify with other examples.\n\nExample 2: 5 at (0,2) [top-left], 9 at (1,8) [top-right], 2 at (8,1) [bottom-left], 1 at (6,9) [bottom-right]\nOutput: (4,4)=5, (4,5)=9, (5,4)=2, (5,5)=1\n\nExample 3: 1 at (0,3) [top-left], 4 at (0,9) [top-right], 3 at (7,2) [bottom-left], 6 at (9,9) [bottom-right]  \nOutput: (4,4)=1, (4,5)=4, (5,4)=3, (5,5)=6\n\nYes! The pattern is:\n1. Find the four non-zero, non-8 values\n2. Based on their approximate quadrants, place them in the center area\n3. Top-left quadrant \u2192 (4,4)\n4. Top-right quadrant \u2192 (4,5)\n5. Bottom-left quadrant \u2192 (5,4)\n6. Bottom-right quadrant \u2192 (5,5)\n\nTo determine quadrants, I'll use (row < 5, col < 5) for top-left, etc.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Find non-zero, non-8 values and their positions\n    non_eight_values = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0 and grid[i][j] != 8:\n                non_eight_values.append((grid[i][j], i, j))\n    \n    # Sort values by their quadrants\n    top_left = []\n    top_right = []\n    bottom_left = []\n    bottom_right = []\n    \n    for value, row, col in non_eight_values:\n        if row < 5 and col < 5:\n            top_left.append((value, row, col))\n        elif row < 5 and col >= 5:\n            top_right.append((value, row, col))\n        elif row >= 5 and col < 5:\n            bottom_left.append((value, row, col))\n        else:\n            bottom_right.append((value, row, col))\n    \n    # Place values in output grid\n    # Take one value from each quadrant (the first one found)\n    if top_left:\n        output[4][4] = top_left[0][0]\n    if top_right:\n        output[4][5] = top_right[0][0]\n    if bottom_left:\n        output[5][4] = bottom_left[0][0]\n    if bottom_right:\n        output[5][5] = bottom_right[0][0]\n    \n    return output\n```",
