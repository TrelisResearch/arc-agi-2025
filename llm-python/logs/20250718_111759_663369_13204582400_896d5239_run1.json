Numbers 3 and 8 seem to be the key values that get transformed\n2. The transformation appears to be a propagation or diffusion process\n3. The value 3 tends to propagate to 8s, and then 8s propagate to other 8s\n4. The transformation seems to be a kind of \"spread\" or \"infection\" process where certain values spread to neighboring cells\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that spreads 3s to 8s and then spreads 8s to other 8s in a way that matches the training examples.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # First pass: spread 3s to 8s\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                # Spread to adjacent cells\n                if i > 0 and grid_np[i-1][j] == 0:\n                    grid_np[i-1][j] = 8\n                if i < 12 and grid_np[i+1][j] == 0:\n                    grid_np[i+1][j] = 8\n                if j > 0 and grid_np[i][j-1] == 0:\n                    grid_np[i][j-1] = 8\n                if j < 11 and grid_np[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    grid_np[i][j+1] = 8\n    \n    # Second pass: spread 8s to other 8s\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                # Spread to adjacent cells\n                if i > 0 and grid_np[i-1][j] == 0:\n                    grid_np[i-1][j] = 8\n                if i < 12 and grid_np[i+1][j] == 0:\n                    grid_np[i+1][j] = 8\n                if j > 0 and grid_np[i][j-1] == 0:\n                    grid_np[i][j-1] = 8\n                if j < 11 and grid_np[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    grid_np[i][j+1] = 8\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # First pass: spread 3s to 8s\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                if i > 0 and grid_np[i-1][j] == 0:\n                    grid_np[i-1][j] = 8\n                if i < 12 and grid_np[i+1][j] == 0:\n                    grid_np[i+1][j] = 8\n                if j > 0 and grid_np[i][j-1] == 0:\n                    grid_np[i][j-1] = 8\n                if j < 11 and grid_np[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    grid_np[i][j+1] = 8\n    \n    # Second pass: spread 8s to other 8s\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(12):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                if i > 0 and grid_np[i-1][j] == 0:\n                    grid_np[i-1][j] = 8\n                if i < 12 and grid_np[i+1][j] == 0:\n                    grid_np[i+1][j] = 8\n                if j > 0 and grid_np[i][j-1] == 0:\n                    grid_np[i][j-1] = 8\n                if j < 11 and grid_np[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    grid_np[i][j+1] = 8\n    \n    return transformed.tolist()\n```",
