In Example 2, 8s are preserved in some positions and transformed into 1s in others.\n3. **Transformation of 1s and 3s**: In Example 3, 1s are transformed into 1s in some positions and into 0s in others. 3s are preserved in some positions and transformed into 0s in others.\n4. **Transformation of 4s and 5s**: In Example 2, 4s are transformed into 1s in some positions and into 0s in others.\n5. **Transformation of 6s and 7s**: These values don't appear in the training examples, so they might be left unchanged.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Preserving 0s\n- Transforming 2s and 8s in specific patterns\n- Transforming 1s and 3s in specific patterns\n- Transforming 4s in specific patterns\n\nI'll implement a transformation that preserves 0s and transforms other values based on their positions and values.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

In Example 2, 8s are preserved in some positions and transformed into 1s in others.\n3. **Transformation of 1s and 3s**: In Example 3, 1s are transformed into 1s in some positions and into 0s in others. 3s are preserved in some positions and transformed into 0s in others.\n4. **Transformation of 4s and 5s**: In Example 2, 4s are transformed into 1s in some positions and into 0s in others.\n5. **Transformation of 6s and 7s**: These values don't appear in the training examples, so they might be left unchanged.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Preserving 0s\n- Transforming 2s and 8s in specific patterns\n- Transforming 1s and 3s in specific patterns\n- Transforming 4s in specific patterns\n\nI'll implement a transformation that preserves 0s and transforms other values based on their positions and values.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
