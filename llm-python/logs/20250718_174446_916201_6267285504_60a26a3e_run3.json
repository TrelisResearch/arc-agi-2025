The output grid seems to have 1s replacing certain 2s in specific positions\n2. There appears to be a pattern where 2s are replaced by 1s in certain configurations\n3. The transformation seems to be more about replacing certain patterns rather than simple value substitution\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain patterns of 2s with 1s in specific configurations.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(15):\n            # Check if the cell is a 2 and if it's part of a specific pattern\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Check if it's part of a 2x2 square pattern\n                if (i < 9 and j < 14 and \n                    grid[i][j+1] == 2 and \n                    grid[i+1][j] == 2 and \n                    grid[i+1][j+1] == 2):\n                    # Replace the 2s with 1s in the 2x2 square\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = 1\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = 1\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j+1] = 1\n                # Check if it's part of a vertical line of 2s\n                elif (i < 9 and j < 14 and \n                      grid[i+1][j] == 2 and \n                      grid[i+2][j] == 2):\n                    # Replace the 2s with 1s in the vertical line\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = 1\n                    transformed_grid[i+2][j] = 1\n                # Check if it's part of a horizontal line of 2s\n                elif (i < 9 and j < 14 and \n                      grid[i][j+1] == 2 and \n                      grid[i][j+2] == 2):\n                    # Replace the 2s with 1s in the horizontal line\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = 1\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+2] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
