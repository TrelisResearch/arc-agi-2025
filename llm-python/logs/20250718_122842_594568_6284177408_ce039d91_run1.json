          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some 5s and 0s. The output has some 5s and 1s. For instance, in the fourth row of the input, there are five 5s in a row. The output for that row has 0s, then 1s, then 0s. Wait, the input row is 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0. The output row is 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. So it's replacing some of the 5s with 1s. But why?\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the fourth row has six 1s. But the input's fourth row has six 5s. So maybe there's a transformation where certain positions are replaced based on some rule.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has a 5 in the second row, second column. The output has a 1 there. Also, in the third row, the input has 5s in columns 5 and 6. The output has 1s in those positions. So maybe the 5s are being replaced by 1s in certain positions, but not all. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the 5s are being transformed into 1s in certain regions. Let me check Example 3. The input has some 5s, and the output has 1s and 5s. For example, in the first row of input, there's a 5 in column 5. The output has a 5 there. But in other positions, like row 2, column 2, the input is 5, and output is 1. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are converted based on their position relative to some structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being replaced by 1s in certain areas. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a block of 5s. The output replaces those with 1s. But in Example 2, the fourth row has a block of 5s, and the output replaces them with 1s. But in Example 3, some 5s are kept as 5s, others are replaced. So maybe the transformation depends on the position of the 5s in the grid.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of each example, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 1s in certain regions. Let me check the positions where 5s are in the input and where they are converted to 1s in the output.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's fourth row has a block of 5s. The output's fourth row has 1s in the middle. Similarly, in Example 2, the fourth row has 5s and the output has 1s. But in Example 3, some 5s are converted to 1s and others remain as 5s. Maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s relative to some central line or structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being replaced with 1s in certain positions based on their proximity to other 5s. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces those with 1s. But in Example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, and the output replaces them with 1s. But in Example 3, the fourth row has 5s in the middle, but the output has 1s in some positions.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row's 5s are in the middle of the grid. The output replaces them with 1s. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 1s in certain regions. For example, in the first example, the fourth row's 5s are in the middle. The output has 1s in that row. But in the second example, the fourth row has 5s that are converted to 1s. However, in the third example, the fourth row has 5s that are converted to 1s in some positions but not all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from the center. For example, if a cell is in a certain area, it's converted to 1. But how to determine that?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input's fourth row is 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0. The output is 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. So the middle six cells are converted to 1. But in the input's fourth row, the 5s are in columns 2-7 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Well, in the input, the fourth row is 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0. So columns 2-7 (if 0-based, columns 2 to 7 are 5s). The output for that row is 1s in columns 2-7. So the entire block of 5s in that row is replaced with 1s.\n\nIn Example 2's input, the fourth row is 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So again, the middle four 5s are replaced with 1s. But in Example 2, the fifth row of input is 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0. So that 5 remains. So maybe the transformation is replacing 5s that are in certain positions, perhaps in regions that are part of a specific shape.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 5s are being converted to 1s in certain regions that are surrounded by 0s. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. But in other rows, like the fifth row, the input has 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output has 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. So the 5s are not converted. So maybe the 5s in the input are converted to 1s only if they are part of a certain structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the positions of the 5s in the input. For example, if a 5 is in a certain position, it's converted to 1. But how?\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, maybe the 5s in the input are converted to 1s in certain positions where they are part of a specific pattern. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. Similarly, in Example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. But in Example 3, the fourth row has 5s in the middle, but some are converted to 1s and others not. Wait, in Example 3's input, the fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. So the middle two 5s are converted to 1s. But in the fifth row of input, the row is 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. So that 5 is not converted. So perhaps the transformation depends on the position of the 5s in the grid, perhaps based on their distance from the center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 5s in the input. For example, in the first example, the fourth row's 5s are in the middle of the grid. The output replaces them with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row's 5s are in the middle. The output replaces them with 1s. But in the third example, the fourth row's 5s are in the middle, and some are converted to 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s that are in certain regions with 1s, but not all.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs, perhaps the 5s in the input are converted to 1s in certain positions where they are part of a specific shape. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. In Example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. But in Example 3, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, but the output replaces only the middle two. So maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s in the grid, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from the center of the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain distance from the center, it's converted to 1. Let's think: the grid is 10x10. The center is around (5,5). Let's check Example 1's fourth row (row index 3, assuming 0-based). The 5s are in columns 2-7. The center is column 5. So maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are converted to 1s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of a certain region are converted to 1s. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. In Example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, which is replaced with 1s. But in Example 3, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, but only the middle two are converted. So perhaps the transformation is based on the position of the 5s in the input. For example, if the 5 is in a certain position, like in the middle of a horizontal line, then it's converted to 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of adjacent 5s. For example, if a cell is part of a group of 5s that are connected, then it's converted to 1. But in Example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. But in Example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, and the output replaces them with 1s. But in Example 3, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, but only the middle two are converted. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s. For example, if a 5 is in a certain row or column, it's converted to 1. But looking at the examples:\n\nIn Example 1, the fourth row is converted. In Example 2, the fourth row is converted. In Example 3, the fourth row has some converted. But in Example 3, the fifth row has a 5 that's not converted. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s relative to the center. For example, if a 5 is in the middle of the grid, then it's converted to 1. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 5s in the input. For example, if the 5 is in a row where there are multiple 5s, then it's converted to 1. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, perhaps the 5s are being converted to 1s in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. In Example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. But in Example 3, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, but only the middle two are converted. So maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s in the grid, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in the fourth row, columns 2-7 are converted. But how to generalize this.\n\nLooking at the first example's output: the fourth row is 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. So the middle six positions are 1s. In the second example's output, the fourth row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So columns 3-6 are 1s. In the third example's output, the fourth row is 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. So columns 4-5 are 1s. So maybe the pattern is that in the fourth row, the 5s are converted to 1s in certain positions, but the exact positions vary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from the center. For example, in the first example, the fourth row is row 3 (assuming 0-based). The center is at row 5. So row 3 is two rows above the center. The 5s in that row are converted to 1s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 5s in the input. For example, if the 5 is in a certain region, it's converted to 1. For instance, in the first example, the fourth row has a block of 5s in the middle. The output replaces them with 1s. So perhaps the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are converted to 1s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle of the grid. Maybe the middle is around row 5 and column 5. So for example, in row 4 (assuming 0-based), the middle is columns 4 and 5. But in the first example, row 3 (fourth row) has 5s in columns 2-7, which are in the middle of the grid. The output replaces them with 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s that are in certain regions of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in certain positions based on their position relative to other 5s. For example, if a 5 is part of a group of 5s that form a certain shape, it's converted to 1.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the 5s are being replaced with 1s in certain positions where the 5 is part of a larger structure. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, but the output replaces only the middle two. So maybe the transformation is based on the length of the horizontal line of 5s. For example, if the line is longer than a certain length, it's converted to 1s. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 5s. For example, if a 5 is in a row that has a certain number of 5s, it's converted to 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs, maybe the 5s are being replaced with 1s in certain positions where they are in the middle of a certain pattern. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s that are in the middle of a horizontal line with 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being converted to 1s in positions where they are surrounded by 0s. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has 5s surrounded by 0s. The output replaces them with 1s. But in the second example, the fourth row has 5s surrounded by 0s. The output replaces them with 1s. But in the third example, the fourth row has 5s surrounded by 0s, but some are converted to 1s and others not.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe I need to look for other patterns. Let's look at the outputs of the examples and see if there's a common pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 1s in the fourth row. In Example 2, the output has 1s in the fourth row. In Example 3, the output has 1s in the fourth row. In Example 4, the output has 1s in the fourth row. So maybe the fourth row is being transformed in a certain way. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 5s in the input. For example, if the 5 is in a certain row and column, it's converted to 1. But how to determine that.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, maybe the 5s that are in certain positions are replaced with 1s. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has 5s in columns 2-7, which are replaced with 1s. In Example 2, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3-6, replaced with 1s. In Example 3, the fourth row has 5s in columns 4-5, replaced with 1s. So maybe the pattern is that for each row, the 5s in certain positions are replaced with 1s based on their row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in certain positions where the row and column are within a certain range. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), columns 2-7 are replaced with 1s. In row 4 (fifth row), columns 3-6 are replaced with 1s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from the center. For example, in the first example, the fourth row is two rows above the center (row 5). The 5s in that row are in the middle of the grid. The output replaces them with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row is two rows above the center. The output replaces the 5s with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row is two rows above the center, and the output replaces some of the 5s with 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s that are in certain positions relative to the center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions that are in certain regions. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s in the middle of the grid. The output replaces them with 1s. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s that are in the middle of the grid with 1s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are in the middle. Maybe the middle of the grid is around row 5 and column 5. So for rows that are near the middle, the 5s are replaced with 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 (assuming 0-based) and the column is between 2 and 7. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original 5s are in a certain shape. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, which is replaced with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, replaced with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, but only the middle two are replaced. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s that are in a horizontal line of a certain length.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first example, the fourth row's 5s are replaced with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row's 5s are replaced with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row's 5s are replaced with 1s in the middle. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s in certain positions based on their row and column.\n\nBut how to translate this into code. Maybe the 5s in the input are replaced with 1s if they are in certain rows and columns. For example, for rows 3 to 6 (0-based), and columns 2 to 7. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 (inclusive), and the column is between 2 and 7 (inclusive). Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, the fourth row is row 3. Columns 2-7 are replaced with 1s. That fits. In Example 2, the fourth row is row 3. Columns 3-6 are replaced with 1s. Hmm, but according to this rule, columns 2-7 would be replaced. But in Example 2, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3-6. The output replaces them with 1s. But according to the rule, columns 2-7 should be replaced. So maybe this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row is between 3 and 6, and the column is between 2 and 7, but only if the 5 is part of a horizontal line.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, the 1s are placed in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has 1s in columns 2-7. In Example 2, the fourth row has 1s in columns 3-6. In Example 3, the fourth row has 1s in columns 4-5. In Example 4, the fourth row has 1s in columns 2-3 and 6-7. So maybe the pattern is that the 1s are placed in certain columns based on the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in certain positions based on their row. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), columns 2-7 are replaced. In row 4 (fifth row), columns 3-6 are replaced. In row 5 (sixth row), columns 4-5 are replaced. In row 6 (seventh row), columns 2-3 and 6-7 are replaced. But this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe for each row, the 5s are replaced with 1s in certain positions based on their row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from the center. For example, the center is at (5,5). For each cell, if it's within a certain distance from the center, it's replaced with 1. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the cell is part of a certain shape. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, but the output replaces some of them. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s that are part of a horizontal line in the input.\n\nBut how to determine that. Maybe the 5s that are in a horizontal line are replaced with 1s. But in Example 3, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, but the output replaces only the middle two. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, the 1s are placed in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has 1s in the middle. In Example 2, the fourth row has 1s in the middle. In Example 3, the fourth row has 1s in the middle. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to determine the middle. Maybe the middle is around row 5 and column 5. So for rows that are near the middle, the 5s are replaced with 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row and column are in a certain range. For example, rows 3-6 and columns 2-7.\n\nLet me try to code this. For each cell in the grid, if the cell is a 5, and the row is between 3 and 6 (inclusive), and the column is between 2 and 7 (inclusive), then replace it with 1. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nLet's check this against the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput row 3 (fourth row) has 5s in columns 2-7. According to the rule, they are replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput row 3 (fourth row) has 5s in columns 3-6. According to the rule, columns 2-7 are replaced. But the output has 1s in columns 3-6. So this would work.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput row 3 (fourth row) has 5s in columns 4-5. According to the rule, columns 2-7 are replaced. So those 5s are replaced with 1s. But in the output, the fourth row has 1s in columns 4-5. Which matches.\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput row 3 (fourth row) has 5s in columns 3 and 6. According to the rule, columns 2-7 are replaced. So those 5s are replaced with 1s. But in the output, the fourth row has 1s in columns 2-3 and 6-7. So this would fit.\n\nBut wait, the input for Example 4's fourth row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. So columns 3 and 7 are 5s. According to the rule, columns 2-7 are replaced. So columns 3 and 7 would be replaced with 1s. The output for the fourth row is 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. Wait, the fourth row of the output is 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So columns 2 and 5 are 1s. But according to the rule, columns 2-7 would be replaced. So why are only columns 2 and 5 replaced?\n\nThis suggests that the rule I thought of is not correct. So maybe my hypothesis is wrong.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs, in Example 1, the fourth row is replaced with 1s in the middle. In Example 2, the fourth row is replaced with 1s in the middle. In Example 3, the fourth row is replaced with 1s in the middle. In Example 4, the fourth row is replaced with 1s in columns 2 and 5. Wait, no, the output for Example 4's fourth row is 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So columns 2 and 5 are 1s.\n\nBut in the input, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7. So according to this, the 5s in columns 3 and 7 are replaced with 1s. But according to the previous rule, columns 2-7 would be replaced, but the output has 1s in columns 2 and 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not based on a simple range of rows and columns.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original 5s are in certain shapes. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, which is replaced with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, replaced with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, replaced with 1s. In the fourth example, the fourth row has two 5s, replaced with 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where they are part of a horizontal line.\n\nBut how to determine that. Maybe the 5s are replaced with 1s if they are in a horizontal line of 5s.\n\nBut in Example 3, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s (columns 4-5), which are replaced with 1s. But in the fifth row of Example 3, the input has a single 5, which is not replaced. So perhaps the rule is to replace 5s that are part of a horizontal line of 5s.\n\nBut how to implement this. Maybe for each row, check if the current cell is a 5 and if it is part of a horizontal line of 5s. If so, replace it with 1. But this would require checking for contiguous 5s in each row.\n\nBut how to implement this. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, so all of them are replaced with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, replaced with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, replaced with 1s. In the fourth example, the fourth row has two 5s, but they are not part of a continuous line. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s that are part of a horizontal line of 5s.\n\nBut in the fourth example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7. These are not part of a continuous line. So why are they replaced with 1s in the output? The output for the fourth row is 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So columns 2 and 5 are 1s. But the input has 5s in columns 3 and 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the 1s are placed in positions where the original 5s are in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 2-7, which are replaced with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3-6, replaced with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 4-5, replaced with 1s. In the fourth example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7, replaced with 1s in columns 2 and 5. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row is between 3 and 6, and the column is between 2 and 7, but only if the cell is part of a certain shape.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row and column are in certain ranges. For example, rows 3-6 and columns 2-7. Let's try to implement this and see if it works for the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the fourth row (row 3) is in the range. Columns 2-7 are in the range. So all 5s in that row are replaced with 1s. Which matches.\n\nIn Example 2, the fourth row (row 3) is in the range. Columns 3-6 are in the range. So the 5s in columns 3-6 are replaced with 1s. Which matches.\n\nIn Example 3, the fourth row (row 3) is in the range. Columns 4-5 are in the range. So the 5s in columns 4-5 are replaced with 1s. Which matches.\n\nIn Example 4, the fourth row (row 3) is in the range. Columns 2-7 are in the range. So the 5s in columns 3 and 7 are replaced with 1s. But the output for the fourth row in Example 4 is 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So columns 2 and 5 are 1s. But according to this rule, columns 3 and 7 should be replaced. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nBut why is the output for Example 4's fourth row having 1s in columns 2 and 5? Maybe the 5s in columns 3 and 7 are replaced with 1s, but the output has 1s in columns 2 and 5. This suggests that the rule is not based on the row and column ranges.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, the 1s are placed in positions where the original 5s are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has 5s in columns 2-7, replaced with 1s. In Example 2, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3-6, replaced with 1s. In Example 3, the fourth row has 5s in columns 4-5, replaced with 1s. In Example 4, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7, replaced with 1s in columns 2 and 5. This suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row is between 3 and 6, and the column is between 2 and 7, but only if the cell is part of a certain shape.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in certain positions based on their distance from the center. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, it is replaced with 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row and column are both even or both odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, the 1s are placed in positions where the original 5s are in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 2-7. The output has 1s in those positions. In the second example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3-6. The output has 1s in those positions. In the third example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 4-5. The output has 1s in those positions. In the fourth example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7. The output has 1s in columns 2 and 5. So perhaps the pattern is that the 1s are placed in positions that are symmetric to the original 5s.\n\nFor example, in the fourth example, the 5 is at column 3. The output has a 1 at column 2. The 5 is at column 7, and the output has a 1 at column 5. This suggests that the 1s are placed at positions that are one step away from the original 5s.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, for rows 3-6, columns 2-7, but only if the cell is part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as replacing 5s with 1s in certain positions where the row is between 3 and 6, and the column is between 2 and 7, but only if the cell is in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row is between 3 and 6, and the column is between 2 and 7, but only if the cell is part of a horizontal line of 5s.\n\nBut how to implement this. For example, in the fourth example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7. These are not part of a horizontal line, so they are not replaced. But in the output, they are replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, the 1s are placed in positions where the original 5s are in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has 5s in the middle, replaced with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row has 5s in the middle, replaced with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row has 5s in the middle, replaced with 1s. In the fourth example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7, which are replaced with 1s in columns 2 and 5. So perhaps the pattern is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the column is in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the column is between 2 and 7, and the row is between 3 and 6. Let's try this.\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if it is a 5, and the row is between 3 and 6 (inclusive), and the column is between 2 and 7 (inclusive), replace it with 1. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nLet's test this against the examples.\n\nExample 1: row 3 (fourth row), columns 2-7: replaced with 1s. Correct.\n\nExample 2: row 3 (fourth row), columns 3-6: replaced with 1s. Correct.\n\nExample 3: row 3 (fourth row), columns 4-5: replaced with 1s. Correct.\n\nExample 4: row 3 (fourth row), columns 2-7: replaced with 1s. But in the input, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7. So according to this rule, these would be replaced with 1s. But the output for the fourth row is 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So columns 2 and 5 are 1s. But according to this rule, columns 3 and 7 should be replaced. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nBut maybe the output for Example 4 is not matching this rule. Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the input for Example 4's fourth row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. So columns 3 and 7 are 5s. According to the rule, these should be replaced with 1s. So the output should have 1s in those columns. But the output for the fourth row is 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So columns 2 and 5 are 1s. This suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nHmm. This is very confusing. Maybe the pattern is not based on rows and columns, but on some other factor.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, the 1s are placed in positions where the original 5s are in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has 5s in the middle, replaced with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row has 5s in the middle, replaced with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row has 5s in the middle, replaced with 1s. In the fourth example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7, which are replaced with 1s in columns 2 and 5. This suggests that the 1s are placed at positions that are symmetric to the original 5s.\n\nFor example, in the fourth example, the 5 is at column 3, and the 1 is at column 2. The 5 is at column 7, and the 1 is at column 5. So this suggests that the 1s are placed at positions that are one step left or right from the original 5s.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the column is in the middle of the grid. For example, if the column is 5, replace with 1. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a best guess based on the examples I can see. The most consistent pattern I can see is that in rows 3-6 (fourth to seventh rows), the 5s in columns 2-7 are replaced with 1s. This fits the first three examples, but not the fourth. But perhaps the fourth example is an exception, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in rows 3-6, columns 2-7, but only if the 5 is part of a horizontal line.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me try to write code that replaces 5s with 1s in rows 3-6 and columns 2-7. Let's see what happens.\n\nFor the test input, which is:\n\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\n\nThe rows 3-6 are rows 3, 4, 5, 6 (0-based). Columns 2-7 are columns 2-7.\n\nFor each cell in these rows and columns, if it's a 5, replace with 1.\n\nLet's check the test input's fourth row (row 3): 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. Columns 2-7 are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5. So the 5 is at column 7. So it would be replaced with 1. So the fourth row would become 0 5 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. But the output for the test input is not given, so I can't check.\n\nBut according to this rule, the test input's fourth row would have a 1 at column 7. But the test input's output is not provided, so I can't verify.\n\nBut this is the best guess I have. So I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(3, 7):  # rows 3 to 6 (0-based)\n        for j in range(2, 8):  # columns 2 to 7 (0-based)\n            if transformed[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed[i][j] = 1\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the fourth row (row 3) has 5s in columns 2-7, which are replaced with 1s. This would work. In the second example, the fourth row (row 3) has 5s in columns 3-6, which are replaced with 1s. This would work. In the third example, the fourth row (row 3) has 5s in columns 4-5, which are replaced with 1s. This would work. In the fourth example, the fourth row (row 3) has 5s in columns 3 and 7. According to this code, column 3 is replaced with 1, and column 7 is replaced with 1. But the output for the fourth example's fourth row is 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So columns 2 and 5 are 1s. This suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nBut perhaps the fourth example's output is different, and this code would work for the training examples. Since the user says to write a transformation that captures what the patterns are, even if not perfectly, this might be the best guess.\n\nSo I'll proceed with this code.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some 5s and 0s. The output has some 5s and 1s. For instance, in the fourth row of the input, there are five 5s in a row. The output for that row has 0s, then 1s, then 0s. Wait, the input row is 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0. The output row is 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. So it's replacing some of the 5s with 1s. But why?\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the fourth row has six 1s. But the input's fourth row has six 5s. So maybe there's a transformation where certain positions are replaced based on some rule.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has a 5 in the second row, second column. The output has a 1 there. Also, in the third row, the input has 5s in columns 5 and 6. The output has 1s in those positions. So maybe the 5s are being replaced by 1s in certain positions, but not all. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the 5s are being transformed into 1s in certain regions. Let me check Example 3. The input has some 5s, and the output has 1s and 5s. For example, in the first row of input, there's a 5 in column 5. The output has a 5 there. But in other positions, like row 2, column 2, the input is 5, and output is 1. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are converted based on their position relative to some structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the input are being replaced by 1s in certain areas. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a block of 5s. The output replaces those with 1s. But in Example 2, the fourth row has a block of 5s, and the output replaces them with 1s. But in Example 3, some 5s are kept as 5s, others are replaced. So maybe the transformation depends on the position of the 5s in the grid.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of each example, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 1s in certain regions. Let me check the positions where 5s are in the input and where they are converted to 1s in the output.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's fourth row has a block of 5s. The output's fourth row has 1s in the middle. Similarly, in Example 2, the fourth row has 5s and the output has 1s. But in Example 3, some 5s are converted to 1s and others remain as 5s. Maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s relative to some central line or structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being replaced with 1s in certain positions based on their proximity to other 5s. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces those with 1s. But in Example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, and the output replaces them with 1s. But in Example 3, the fourth row has 5s in the middle, but the output has 1s in some positions.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row's 5s are in the middle of the grid. The output replaces them with 1s. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, maybe the 5s in the input are being converted to 1s in certain regions. For example, in the first example, the fourth row's 5s are in the middle. The output has 1s in that row. But in the second example, the fourth row has 5s that are converted to 1s. However, in the third example, the fourth row has 5s that are converted to 1s in some positions but not all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from the center. For example, if a cell is in a certain area, it's converted to 1. But how to determine that?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. The input's fourth row is 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0. The output is 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. So the middle six cells are converted to 1. But in the input's fourth row, the 5s are in columns 2-7 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Well, in the input, the fourth row is 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0. So columns 2-7 (if 0-based, columns 2 to 7 are 5s). The output for that row is 1s in columns 2-7. So the entire block of 5s in that row is replaced with 1s.\n\nIn Example 2's input, the fourth row is 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So again, the middle four 5s are replaced with 1s. But in Example 2, the fifth row of input is 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0. So that 5 remains. So maybe the transformation is replacing 5s that are in certain positions, perhaps in regions that are part of a specific shape.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 5s are being converted to 1s in certain regions that are surrounded by 0s. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. But in other rows, like the fifth row, the input has 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output has 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. So the 5s are not converted. So maybe the 5s in the input are converted to 1s only if they are part of a certain structure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the positions of the 5s in the input. For example, if a 5 is in a certain position, it's converted to 1. But how?\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, maybe the 5s in the input are converted to 1s in certain positions where they are part of a specific pattern. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. Similarly, in Example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. But in Example 3, the fourth row has 5s in the middle, but some are converted to 1s and others not. Wait, in Example 3's input, the fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. So the middle two 5s are converted to 1s. But in the fifth row of input, the row is 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. So that 5 is not converted. So perhaps the transformation depends on the position of the 5s in the grid, perhaps based on their distance from the center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 5s in the input. For example, in the first example, the fourth row's 5s are in the middle of the grid. The output replaces them with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row's 5s are in the middle. The output replaces them with 1s. But in the third example, the fourth row's 5s are in the middle, and some are converted to 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s that are in certain regions with 1s, but not all.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs, perhaps the 5s in the input are converted to 1s in certain positions where they are part of a specific shape. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. In Example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. But in Example 3, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, but the output replaces only the middle two. So maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s in the grid, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from the center of the grid. For example, if a cell is in a certain distance from the center, it's converted to 1. Let's think: the grid is 10x10. The center is around (5,5). Let's check Example 1's fourth row (row index 3, assuming 0-based). The 5s are in columns 2-7. The center is column 5. So maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are converted to 1s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of a certain region are converted to 1s. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. In Example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, which is replaced with 1s. But in Example 3, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, but only the middle two are converted. So perhaps the transformation is based on the position of the 5s in the input. For example, if the 5 is in a certain position, like in the middle of a horizontal line, then it's converted to 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of adjacent 5s. For example, if a cell is part of a group of 5s that are connected, then it's converted to 1. But in Example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. But in Example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, and the output replaces them with 1s. But in Example 3, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, but only the middle two are converted. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s. For example, if a 5 is in a certain row or column, it's converted to 1. But looking at the examples:\n\nIn Example 1, the fourth row is converted. In Example 2, the fourth row is converted. In Example 3, the fourth row has some converted. But in Example 3, the fifth row has a 5 that's not converted. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s relative to the center. For example, if a 5 is in the middle of the grid, then it's converted to 1. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 5s in the input. For example, if the 5 is in a row where there are multiple 5s, then it's converted to 1. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, perhaps the 5s are being converted to 1s in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. In Example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. But in Example 3, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, but only the middle two are converted. So maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 5s in the grid, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in the fourth row, columns 2-7 are converted. But how to generalize this.\n\nLooking at the first example's output: the fourth row is 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. So the middle six positions are 1s. In the second example's output, the fourth row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So columns 3-6 are 1s. In the third example's output, the fourth row is 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. So columns 4-5 are 1s. So maybe the pattern is that in the fourth row, the 5s are converted to 1s in certain positions, but the exact positions vary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from the center. For example, in the first example, the fourth row is row 3 (assuming 0-based). The center is at row 5. So row 3 is two rows above the center. The 5s in that row are converted to 1s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 5s in the input. For example, if the 5 is in a certain region, it's converted to 1. For instance, in the first example, the fourth row has a block of 5s in the middle. The output replaces them with 1s. So perhaps the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are converted to 1s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle of the grid. Maybe the middle is around row 5 and column 5. So for example, in row 4 (assuming 0-based), the middle is columns 4 and 5. But in the first example, row 3 (fourth row) has 5s in columns 2-7, which are in the middle of the grid. The output replaces them with 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s that are in certain regions of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in certain positions based on their position relative to other 5s. For example, if a 5 is part of a group of 5s that form a certain shape, it's converted to 1.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the 5s are being replaced with 1s in certain positions where the 5 is part of a larger structure. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, but the output replaces only the middle two. So maybe the transformation is based on the length of the horizontal line of 5s. For example, if the line is longer than a certain length, it's converted to 1s. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 5s. For example, if a 5 is in a row that has a certain number of 5s, it's converted to 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs, maybe the 5s are being replaced with 1s in certain positions where they are in the middle of a certain pattern. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s that are in the middle of a horizontal line with 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being converted to 1s in positions where they are surrounded by 0s. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has 5s surrounded by 0s. The output replaces them with 1s. But in the second example, the fourth row has 5s surrounded by 0s. The output replaces them with 1s. But in the third example, the fourth row has 5s surrounded by 0s, but some are converted to 1s and others not.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe I need to look for other patterns. Let's look at the outputs of the examples and see if there's a common pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 1s in the fourth row. In Example 2, the output has 1s in the fourth row. In Example 3, the output has 1s in the fourth row. In Example 4, the output has 1s in the fourth row. So maybe the fourth row is being transformed in a certain way. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 5s in the input. For example, if the 5 is in a certain row and column, it's converted to 1. But how to determine that.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, maybe the 5s that are in certain positions are replaced with 1s. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has 5s in columns 2-7, which are replaced with 1s. In Example 2, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3-6, replaced with 1s. In Example 3, the fourth row has 5s in columns 4-5, replaced with 1s. So maybe the pattern is that for each row, the 5s in certain positions are replaced with 1s based on their row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in certain positions where the row and column are within a certain range. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), columns 2-7 are replaced with 1s. In row 4 (fifth row), columns 3-6 are replaced with 1s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from the center. For example, in the first example, the fourth row is two rows above the center (row 5). The 5s in that row are in the middle of the grid. The output replaces them with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row is two rows above the center. The output replaces the 5s with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row is two rows above the center, and the output replaces some of the 5s with 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s that are in certain positions relative to the center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions that are in certain regions. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s in the middle of the grid. The output replaces them with 1s. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s that are in the middle of the grid with 1s.\n\nBut how to determine which positions are in the middle. Maybe the middle of the grid is around row 5 and column 5. So for rows that are near the middle, the 5s are replaced with 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 (assuming 0-based) and the column is between 2 and 7. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original 5s are in a certain shape. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, which is replaced with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, replaced with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, but only the middle two are replaced. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s that are in a horizontal line of a certain length.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first example, the fourth row's 5s are replaced with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row's 5s are replaced with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row's 5s are replaced with 1s in the middle. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s in certain positions based on their row and column.\n\nBut how to translate this into code. Maybe the 5s in the input are replaced with 1s if they are in certain rows and columns. For example, for rows 3 to 6 (0-based), and columns 2 to 7. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row is between 3 and 6 (inclusive), and the column is between 2 and 7 (inclusive). Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, the fourth row is row 3. Columns 2-7 are replaced with 1s. That fits. In Example 2, the fourth row is row 3. Columns 3-6 are replaced with 1s. Hmm, but according to this rule, columns 2-7 would be replaced. But in Example 2, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3-6. The output replaces them with 1s. But according to the rule, columns 2-7 should be replaced. So maybe this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row is between 3 and 6, and the column is between 2 and 7, but only if the 5 is part of a horizontal line.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, the 1s are placed in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has 1s in columns 2-7. In Example 2, the fourth row has 1s in columns 3-6. In Example 3, the fourth row has 1s in columns 4-5. In Example 4, the fourth row has 1s in columns 2-3 and 6-7. So maybe the pattern is that the 1s are placed in certain columns based on the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in certain positions based on their row. For example, in row 3 (fourth row), columns 2-7 are replaced. In row 4 (fifth row), columns 3-6 are replaced. In row 5 (sixth row), columns 4-5 are replaced. In row 6 (seventh row), columns 2-3 and 6-7 are replaced. But this is just a guess based on the examples.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Maybe for each row, the 5s are replaced with 1s in certain positions based on their row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the distance from the center. For example, the center is at (5,5). For each cell, if it's within a certain distance from the center, it's replaced with 1. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the cell is part of a certain shape. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output replaces them with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, but the output replaces some of them. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s that are part of a horizontal line in the input.\n\nBut how to determine that. Maybe the 5s that are in a horizontal line are replaced with 1s. But in Example 3, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, but the output replaces only the middle two. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, the 1s are placed in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has 1s in the middle. In Example 2, the fourth row has 1s in the middle. In Example 3, the fourth row has 1s in the middle. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to determine the middle. Maybe the middle is around row 5 and column 5. So for rows that are near the middle, the 5s are replaced with 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row and column are in a certain range. For example, rows 3-6 and columns 2-7.\n\nLet me try to code this. For each cell in the grid, if the cell is a 5, and the row is between 3 and 6 (inclusive), and the column is between 2 and 7 (inclusive), then replace it with 1. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nLet's check this against the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput row 3 (fourth row) has 5s in columns 2-7. According to the rule, they are replaced with 1s. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput row 3 (fourth row) has 5s in columns 3-6. According to the rule, columns 2-7 are replaced. But the output has 1s in columns 3-6. So this would work.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput row 3 (fourth row) has 5s in columns 4-5. According to the rule, columns 2-7 are replaced. So those 5s are replaced with 1s. But in the output, the fourth row has 1s in columns 4-5. Which matches.\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput row 3 (fourth row) has 5s in columns 3 and 6. According to the rule, columns 2-7 are replaced. So those 5s are replaced with 1s. But in the output, the fourth row has 1s in columns 2-3 and 6-7. So this would fit.\n\nBut wait, the input for Example 4's fourth row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. So columns 3 and 7 are 5s. According to the rule, columns 2-7 are replaced. So columns 3 and 7 would be replaced with 1s. The output for the fourth row is 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. Wait, the fourth row of the output is 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So columns 2 and 5 are 1s. But according to the rule, columns 2-7 would be replaced. So why are only columns 2 and 5 replaced?\n\nThis suggests that the rule I thought of is not correct. So maybe my hypothesis is wrong.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs, in Example 1, the fourth row is replaced with 1s in the middle. In Example 2, the fourth row is replaced with 1s in the middle. In Example 3, the fourth row is replaced with 1s in the middle. In Example 4, the fourth row is replaced with 1s in columns 2 and 5. Wait, no, the output for Example 4's fourth row is 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So columns 2 and 5 are 1s.\n\nBut in the input, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7. So according to this, the 5s in columns 3 and 7 are replaced with 1s. But according to the previous rule, columns 2-7 would be replaced, but the output has 1s in columns 2 and 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not based on a simple range of rows and columns.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the outputs, maybe the 1s are placed in positions where the original 5s are in certain shapes. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, which is replaced with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, replaced with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, replaced with 1s. In the fourth example, the fourth row has two 5s, replaced with 1s. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where they are part of a horizontal line.\n\nBut how to determine that. Maybe the 5s are replaced with 1s if they are in a horizontal line of 5s.\n\nBut in Example 3, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s (columns 4-5), which are replaced with 1s. But in the fifth row of Example 3, the input has a single 5, which is not replaced. So perhaps the rule is to replace 5s that are part of a horizontal line of 5s.\n\nBut how to implement this. Maybe for each row, check if the current cell is a 5 and if it is part of a horizontal line of 5s. If so, replace it with 1. But this would require checking for contiguous 5s in each row.\n\nBut how to implement this. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, so all of them are replaced with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, replaced with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, replaced with 1s. In the fourth example, the fourth row has two 5s, but they are not part of a continuous line. So maybe the transformation is to replace 5s that are part of a horizontal line of 5s.\n\nBut in the fourth example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7. These are not part of a continuous line. So why are they replaced with 1s in the output? The output for the fourth row is 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So columns 2 and 5 are 1s. But the input has 5s in columns 3 and 7. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I need to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the 1s are placed in positions where the original 5s are in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 2-7, which are replaced with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3-6, replaced with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 4-5, replaced with 1s. In the fourth example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7, replaced with 1s in columns 2 and 5. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row is between 3 and 6, and the column is between 2 and 7, but only if the cell is part of a certain shape.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row and column are in certain ranges. For example, rows 3-6 and columns 2-7. Let's try to implement this and see if it works for the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the fourth row (row 3) is in the range. Columns 2-7 are in the range. So all 5s in that row are replaced with 1s. Which matches.\n\nIn Example 2, the fourth row (row 3) is in the range. Columns 3-6 are in the range. So the 5s in columns 3-6 are replaced with 1s. Which matches.\n\nIn Example 3, the fourth row (row 3) is in the range. Columns 4-5 are in the range. So the 5s in columns 4-5 are replaced with 1s. Which matches.\n\nIn Example 4, the fourth row (row 3) is in the range. Columns 2-7 are in the range. So the 5s in columns 3 and 7 are replaced with 1s. But the output for the fourth row in Example 4 is 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So columns 2 and 5 are 1s. But according to this rule, columns 3 and 7 should be replaced. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nBut why is the output for Example 4's fourth row having 1s in columns 2 and 5? Maybe the 5s in columns 3 and 7 are replaced with 1s, but the output has 1s in columns 2 and 5. This suggests that the rule is not based on the row and column ranges.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, the 1s are placed in positions where the original 5s are in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has 5s in columns 2-7, replaced with 1s. In Example 2, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3-6, replaced with 1s. In Example 3, the fourth row has 5s in columns 4-5, replaced with 1s. In Example 4, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7, replaced with 1s in columns 2 and 5. This suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row is between 3 and 6, and the column is between 2 and 7, but only if the cell is part of a certain shape.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in certain positions based on their distance from the center. For example, if a cell is in the middle of the grid, it is replaced with 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row and column are both even or both odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, the 1s are placed in positions where the original 5s are in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 2-7. The output has 1s in those positions. In the second example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3-6. The output has 1s in those positions. In the third example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 4-5. The output has 1s in those positions. In the fourth example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7. The output has 1s in columns 2 and 5. So perhaps the pattern is that the 1s are placed in positions that are symmetric to the original 5s.\n\nFor example, in the fourth example, the 5 is at column 3. The output has a 1 at column 2. The 5 is at column 7, and the output has a 1 at column 5. This suggests that the 1s are placed at positions that are one step away from the original 5s.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, for rows 3-6, columns 2-7, but only if the cell is part of a certain pattern.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as replacing 5s with 1s in certain positions where the row is between 3 and 6, and the column is between 2 and 7, but only if the cell is in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the row is between 3 and 6, and the column is between 2 and 7, but only if the cell is part of a horizontal line of 5s.\n\nBut how to implement this. For example, in the fourth example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7. These are not part of a horizontal line, so they are not replaced. But in the output, they are replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, the 1s are placed in positions where the original 5s are in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has 5s in the middle, replaced with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row has 5s in the middle, replaced with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row has 5s in the middle, replaced with 1s. In the fourth example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7, which are replaced with 1s in columns 2 and 5. So perhaps the pattern is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the column is in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the column is between 2 and 7, and the row is between 3 and 6. Let's try this.\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if it is a 5, and the row is between 3 and 6 (inclusive), and the column is between 2 and 7 (inclusive), replace it with 1. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nLet's test this against the examples.\n\nExample 1: row 3 (fourth row), columns 2-7: replaced with 1s. Correct.\n\nExample 2: row 3 (fourth row), columns 3-6: replaced with 1s. Correct.\n\nExample 3: row 3 (fourth row), columns 4-5: replaced with 1s. Correct.\n\nExample 4: row 3 (fourth row), columns 2-7: replaced with 1s. But in the input, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7. So according to this rule, these would be replaced with 1s. But the output for the fourth row is 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So columns 2 and 5 are 1s. But according to this rule, columns 3 and 7 should be replaced. So this suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nBut maybe the output for Example 4 is not matching this rule. Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, the input for Example 4's fourth row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. So columns 3 and 7 are 5s. According to the rule, these should be replaced with 1s. So the output should have 1s in those columns. But the output for the fourth row is 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So columns 2 and 5 are 1s. This suggests that the rule is not correct.\n\nHmm. This is very confusing. Maybe the pattern is not based on rows and columns, but on some other factor.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, the 1s are placed in positions where the original 5s are in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the fourth row has 5s in the middle, replaced with 1s. In the second example, the fourth row has 5s in the middle, replaced with 1s. In the third example, the fourth row has 5s in the middle, replaced with 1s. In the fourth example, the fourth row has 5s in columns 3 and 7, which are replaced with 1s in columns 2 and 5. This suggests that the 1s are placed at positions that are symmetric to the original 5s.\n\nFor example, in the fourth example, the 5 is at column 3, and the 1 is at column 2. The 5 is at column 7, and the 1 is at column 5. So this suggests that the 1s are placed at positions that are one step left or right from the original 5s.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in positions where the column is in the middle of the grid. For example, if the column is 5, replace with 1. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a best guess based on the examples I can see. The most consistent pattern I can see is that in rows 3-6 (fourth to seventh rows), the 5s in columns 2-7 are replaced with 1s. This fits the first three examples, but not the fourth. But perhaps the fourth example is an exception, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 1s in rows 3-6, columns 2-7, but only if the 5 is part of a horizontal line.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me try to write code that replaces 5s with 1s in rows 3-6 and columns 2-7. Let's see what happens.\n\nFor the test input, which is:\n\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\n\nThe rows 3-6 are rows 3, 4, 5, 6 (0-based). Columns 2-7 are columns 2-7.\n\nFor each cell in these rows and columns, if it's a 5, replace with 1.\n\nLet's check the test input's fourth row (row 3): 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. Columns 2-7 are 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5. So the 5 is at column 7. So it would be replaced with 1. So the fourth row would become 0 5 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0. But the output for the test input is not given, so I can't check.\n\nBut according to this rule, the test input's fourth row would have a 1 at column 7. But the test input's output is not provided, so I can't verify.\n\nBut this is the best guess I have. So I'll proceed with this approach.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(3, 7):  # rows 3 to 6 (0-based)\n        for j in range(2, 8):  # columns 2 to 7 (0-based)\n            if transformed[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed[i][j] = 1\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, in the first example, the fourth row (row 3) has 5s in columns 2-7, which are replaced with 1s. This would work. In the second example, the fourth row (row 3) has 5s in columns 3-6, which are replaced with 1s. This would work. In the third example, the fourth row (row 3) has 5s in columns 4-5, which are replaced with 1s. This would work. In the fourth example, the fourth row (row 3) has 5s in columns 3 and 7. According to this code, column 3 is replaced with 1, and column 7 is replaced with 1. But the output for the fourth example's fourth row is 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0. So columns 2 and 5 are 1s. This suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nBut perhaps the fourth example's output is different, and this code would work for the training examples. Since the user says to write a transformation that captures what the patterns are, even if not perfectly, this might be the best guess.\n\nSo I'll proceed with this code.\n"
