The transformation seems to involve propagating values from certain positions to neighboring cells.\n2. There are instances where values are expanded or spread out in specific patterns.\n3. Values like 4, 6, 8, and 3 seem to be transformed into other values in specific regions.\n4. There are patterns where certain values are replaced or expanded in specific areas of the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading values from certain positions to neighboring cells, and replacing values in specific regions based on their original positions.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Propagate values from certain positions to neighboring cells\n    # This is a simplified version of the pattern observed in the examples\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value to neighboring cells\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 30 and 0 <= nj < 30:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    # Replace certain values based on their original positions\n    # This is a simplified version of the pattern observed in the examples\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace with 2 in specific patterns\n                if i >= 15 and j >= 15:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 6:\n                # Replace with 8 in specific patterns\n                if i >= 15 and j >= 15:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace with 8 in specific patterns\n                if i >= 15 and j >= 15:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace with 6 in specific patterns\n                if i >= 15 and j >= 15:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 30 and 0 <= nj < 30:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 4:\n                if i >= 15 and j >= 15:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 6:\n                if i >= 15 and j >= 15:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                if i >= 15 and j >= 15:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                if i >= 15 and j >= 15:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",

The transformation seems to involve propagating values from certain positions to neighboring cells.\n2. There are instances where values are expanded or spread out in specific patterns.\n3. Values like 4, 6, 8, and 3 seem to be transformed into other values in specific regions.\n4. There are patterns where certain values are replaced or expanded in specific areas of the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading values from certain positions to neighboring cells, and replacing values in specific regions based on their original positions.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Propagate values from certain positions to neighboring cells\n    # This is a simplified version of the pattern observed in the examples\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value to neighboring cells\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 30 and 0 <= nj < 30:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    # Replace certain values based on their original positions\n    # This is a simplified version of the pattern observed in the examples\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace with 2 in specific patterns\n                if i >= 15 and j >= 15:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 6:\n                # Replace with 8 in specific patterns\n                if i >= 15 and j >= 15:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace with 8 in specific patterns\n                if i >= 15 and j >= 15:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace with 6 in specific patterns\n                if i >= 15 and j >= 15:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 30 and 0 <= nj < 30:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 4:\n                if i >= 15 and j >= 15:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 6:\n                if i >= 15 and j >= 15:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                if i >= 15 and j >= 15:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                if i >= 15 and j >= 15:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
