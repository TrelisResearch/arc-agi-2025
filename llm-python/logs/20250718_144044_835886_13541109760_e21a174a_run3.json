          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let's start with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a bunch of 0s and some numbers in specific positions. The output seems to have some rearrangement. Let me look at the first few rows. The input's second row has 8s in the middle, and the output's second row has 4s. Wait, but in the output, the third row has 4s. Hmm, maybe there's some kind of rotation or mirroring? Or maybe the numbers are being moved based on their positions.\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1, the 8s in the input's second row (row 1) are transformed into 4s in the output's second row (row 1). But in the output's third row, there are 4s. Wait, maybe the numbers are being moved to certain positions based on their original positions. Or maybe the numbers are being rotated 180 degrees? Or maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are moved to specific positions based on their original positions.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in Example 1, the input has a 3 in row 4 (input row 4?), and in the output, that 3 is moved to row 8. Wait, maybe the numbers are being moved to the middle of the grid? Or maybe there's a symmetry involved.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a 1 in the second row, and the output has a 5 in that position. Wait, no, in Example 2, the input's second row has 1s, and the output's second row has 5s. But in the output, the 5s are in the same positions as the original 1s? Or maybe there's a transformation where certain numbers are being replaced by others based on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored or rotated. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 8 in the middle of the second row, and the output has a 4 in that position. But in the output, the third row has 4s. Wait, maybe the numbers are being rotated 180 degrees. For example, 8 rotated 180 is still 8, but maybe 2 rotated 180 is 2? Or maybe some numbers are being replaced based on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to certain positions based on their original positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 8 in row 1 (assuming rows are 0-based?), and in the output, that 8 is moved to row 11 (since the output's second row is row 1, but the input's second row is row 1). Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are moved to specific positions based on their original positions. For example, numbers in the middle of the grid are moved to the middle of the grid in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by other numbers based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 8 in row 1 (second row), and the output has 4 in that position. But in the output, the third row has 4s. Hmm, maybe there's a pattern where numbers are being moved to certain positions based on their original positions. Like, maybe numbers in the middle are being moved to the middle of the grid, but in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the 8s in the input's second row are transformed into 4s in the output's second row. Wait, but in the output, the third row has 4s. Maybe there's a pattern where numbers are being moved to the middle of the grid. For example, the 8s in the input are moved to the middle of the grid in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored. For example, in Example 1, the input's second row has 8s in positions 4-8 (assuming 0-based), and the output's second row has 4s in positions 6-10. Wait, maybe the numbers are being rotated 180 degrees. But how would that affect the numbers? For example, 8 rotated 180 is still 8. But maybe 2 rotated 180 is 2, but 3 rotated 180 is 3? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to certain positions based on their original positions. For example, in Example 1, the input's third row has 2s in positions 4-8, and in the output, the third row has 4s in positions 4-8. Wait, no. The output's third row is row 2 (assuming zero-based), and in the output, that row has 4s in positions 3-7. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input's second row has 1s in positions 3-5 and 7-9. The output's second row has 5s in those positions. So maybe the numbers are being replaced by another number based on their positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to certain positions based on their original positions. For example, in Example 1, the 8s in the input's second row are moved to the output's second row. But in the output, the 8s are in the third row. Wait, maybe the numbers are being rotated 180 degrees and then moved to the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by other numbers based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the 8s in the input are replaced by 4s in the output. But why? Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are being replaced by others based on their positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 8 in the middle of the second row, and the output has a 4 in the middle of the second row. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the 8s in the input are in row 1 (second row) and are replaced by 4s in the output's row 1. But the 8s in the input's third row (row 2) are replaced by 4s in the output's third row (row 2). Wait, maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: same as row 5.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: same as row 7.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nThe output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: same as row 3.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: same as row 5.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nSo, looking at the input and output, it seems that the numbers are being moved to different positions. For example, the 8s in the input's row 1 are moved to the output's row 11. The 2s in the input's row 2 are moved to the output's row 10. The 3s in the input's row 4 are moved to the output's row 9. The 1s in the input's row 5 and 6 are moved to the output's row 3 and 4. The 4s in the input's row 10 and 11 are moved to the output's row 2 and 1. Wait, this seems like a vertical mirroring. Like, the input's row 1 is mirrored to the output's row 11, which is the bottom row. Similarly, input's row 2 is mirrored to row 10 (the second from bottom), and so on. \n\nWait, the input has 13 rows. So row 0 is top, row 12 is bottom. So for example, row 1 (second row) in input is mirrored to row 11 (the second from bottom). Similarly, row 2 is mirrored to row 10, row 3 to row 9, etc. \n\nBut looking at the output, the 8s in the input's row 1 are in the output's row 11. The 8s in the input's row 11 are in the output's row 1. So that's a vertical flip. Similarly, the 2s in the input's row 2 are in the output's row 10. The 2s in the input's row 10 are in the output's row 2. So that's a vertical flip. \n\nBut then, in the output, the 8s in the input's row 1 are now in row 11. But in the output, the 8s are in row 11, but the original 8s in the input's row 11 are now in row 1. So that's a vertical flip. \n\nBut then, what about the numbers themselves? For example, the input's row 1 has 8s, and the output's row 11 has 8s. But in the output, row 11 has 8s. So the numbers are the same. But in the output of Example 1, the input's row 10 (which has 4s) is mirrored to row 2 (output row 2 has 4s). So the numbers are preserved. Wait, but in the output of Example 1, the input's row 11 (which has 4s) is mirrored to row 1 (output row 1 has 4s). So the numbers are preserved. \n\nBut then, in the output of Example 1, the input's row 4 (which has 3s) is mirrored to row 9 (output row 9 has 3s). So that's the same. But in the output, the input's row 4 (3s) is in row 9 of the output. So the numbers are preserved. So the transformation is a vertical flip of the grid. But why does the output of Example 1 have the 8s in row 11 and the 2s in row 10, etc.?\n\nWait, but looking at the output of Example 1, the input's row 10 has 4s. The output's row 2 has 4s. So the numbers are the same. So maybe the transformation is a vertical flip. Let me check for other rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's row 3 (which has 0s except for a 2 in position 6) is mirrored to row 9 (output row 9 has 2s in the same position). So the numbers are preserved. \n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the input's row 7 (which has 1s) is mirrored to row 5 (output row 5 has 1s). So that's the same. \n\nBut then why in the output of Example 1, the input's row 10 (which has 4s) is mirrored to row 2 (output row 2 has 4s). So the numbers are preserved. So the transformation is a vertical flip. \n\nBut then, what about the other examples?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nSo, for example, the input's row 1 (which has 1s) is mirrored to row 11 (output row 11 has 1s). The input's row 2 (which has 1s) is mirrored to row 10 (output row 10 has 1s). The input's row 3 (which has 2s) is mirrored to row 9 (output row 9 has 4s). Wait, no. Wait, row 3 of input is 2s, and in the output, row 9 has 4s. So that's not the same. So maybe the vertical flip is not the only transformation. \n\nBut wait, the input's row 3 (row 3) has 2s, and in the output, row 9 (which is the 10th row from the top) has 4s. So that's not a vertical flip. So perhaps my initial thought is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is a vertical flip, but with some numbers being replaced. For example, in the input's row 3 (which has 2s), the output's row 9 has 4s. But that's not the same. So that's conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their positions. For example, in Example 2, the input's row 9 has 4s, and in the output, that row is mirrored to row 3 (which is row 3 of the output). But in the output, row 3 has 4s. So that's the same. But in the output's row 9, it's 2s. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being rotated 180 degrees. For example, 2 rotated 180 is 2, 4 is 4, 5 is 5, 1 is 1. But in Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and in the output, row 9 has 4s. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored horizontally. For example, the input's row 1 has 1s on the left and right, and the output's row 1 has 5s. But that's not matching. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's look for other patterns. \n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the input's row 1 (0-based) has 1s, and the output's row 1 has 3s. The input's row 2 has 2s, and the output's row 2 has 0s except for the 3 in the middle. Wait, no. The output's row 2 has 0s except for the middle. Wait, the output's row 2 is 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So the 3 is in the middle. But the input's row 2 has 2s in the middle. So maybe the numbers are being rotated or mirrored. \n\nAlternatively, the output is the input's grid mirrored vertically and then some numbers are replaced. For example, the input's row 1 (which has 1s) is mirrored to row 5 (the last row of the input, which is all 0s). But in the output, row 1 has 3s. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, the output is the input's grid mirrored vertically, but with the numbers in the middle of the grid being replaced. For example, in Example 3, the input's row 1 has 1s in the middle, and the output's row 1 has 3s. The input's row 2 has 2s, and the output's row 2 has 3s. But that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the middle of the grid. For example, in the input, the 3 is in row 4 (input row 4), and in the output, it's in row 1 (output row 1). So that's a vertical flip. But then, the 1s in the input's row 1 are moved to row 5 (the bottom row), but in the output, the 1s are in row 5. But in the output, row 5 has 1s. So that's a vertical flip. \n\nSo in Example 3, the input is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 1 1 1 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 2 2 2 0 0.\n\nRow 3: same as row 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 3 3 3 3 3 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: all 0s.\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 3 3 3 3 3 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 2 2 2 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 2 2 2 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 1 1 1 1 0.\n\nRow 6: all 0s.\n\nSo the input's row 1 (which has 1s) is mirrored to row 5 (which has 1s in the output). The input's row 2 (2s) is mirrored to row 4 (output row 4 has 2s). The input's row 3 (2s) is mirrored to row 3 (output row 3 has 2s). The input's row 4 (3s) is mirrored to row 2 (output row 2 has 3s). The input's row 5 (3s) is mirrored to row 1 (output row 1 has 3s). \n\nSo this seems like a vertical flip. But why in the output, the 3s in the input's row 4 are moved to row 2. So the numbers are preserved. So the transformation is a vertical flip. \n\nBut in Example 2, this doesn't seem to hold. For example, the input's row 3 (which has 2s) is mirrored to row 9 (output row 9 has 4s). So that's conflicting. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check Example 2 again. \n\nIn Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s. The output's row 9 has 4s. But according to the vertical flip, the input's row 3 would be mirrored to row 9 (since 13 rows, 0-based). But in the input's row 3, the numbers are 2s. The output's row 9 has 4s. So that's not the same. So this contradicts the vertical flip hypothesis. \n\nHmm. So what's going on here? Maybe there's another pattern. \n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the input's row 9 has 4s, and the output's row 3 has 4s. So that's a vertical flip. But in the input's row 3, the numbers are 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So that's not matching. So maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is a vertical flip, but with some numbers being replaced. For example, in Example 2, the input's row 3 (which has 2s) is mirrored to row 9, which in the output has 4s. So perhaps the 2s are being replaced by 4s. But why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain numbers are being replaced. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being rotated 180 degrees. For example, 2 rotated 180 is 2, 4 rotated 180 is 4, 5 rotated 180 is 5, 1 rotated 180 is 1. But in Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their original position. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are in positions 3-8. The output's row 9 has 4s in positions 3-8. So maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their row. \n\nBut how to determine the pattern? \n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, it seems that the numbers are being moved to certain positions based on their original positions. For example, in Example 1, the numbers in the input's row 1 are moved to the output's row 11. Similarly, the numbers in row 2 are moved to row 10, etc. So that's a vertical flip. But in Example 2, this seems to not hold. \n\nWait, in Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So that's not a vertical flip. But maybe there's a different pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored horizontally. For example, the input's row 1 has 1s on the left and right. In the output, the row 1 has 5s. So maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the middle of the grid. For example, the input's row 1 has 1s, and the output's row 1 has 5s. But I don't see a clear pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by other numbers based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are moved to the output's row 11, which is the bottom row. The 2s are moved to row 10. The 3s are moved to row 9. The 1s are moved to row 3 and 4. The 4s are moved to row 2 and 1. So this seems like a vertical flip. But in Example 2, the input's row 3 (which has 2s) is mirrored to row 9, which in the output has 4s. So why is that? \n\nWait, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position. For example, in Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So maybe the number is being replaced by another number based on the row. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their original row. For example, in Example 2, the input's row 3 is mirrored to row 9, and the number is replaced by 4. But why 4? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by another number based on their position in the grid. For example, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. But this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being rotated 180 degrees, and the numbers are being replaced by their rotated versions. For example, 2 rotated 180 is 2, 4 is 4, 5 is 5, 1 is 1. But in Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, this is really challenging. Let's try to think of another approach. \n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the numbers in the input's row 1 are moved to the output's row 11, and the numbers in the input's row 11 are moved to the output's row 1. So that's a vertical flip. \n\nIn Example 2, the input's row 1 has 1s, which are moved to the output's row 11. The input's row 11 has 5s, which are moved to the output's row 1. So that's a vertical flip. \n\nIn the input's row 3 of Example 2, the 2s are moved to the output's row 9. But in the output's row 9, the numbers are 4s. So this contradicts the vertical flip idea. \n\nWait, but in the output of Example 2, the input's row 9 has 4s, which is mirrored to row 3 of the output. So in the output, row 3 has 4s. So that's a vertical flip. \n\nSo for row 3, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 3 has 4s. So why? \n\nWait, maybe the numbers are being replaced by another number based on their position. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are replaced by 4s in the output's row 3. But why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by another number based on their position. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are in the middle of the grid, and in the output, they are replaced by 4s. But that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on the row. For example, the input's row 3 is mirrored to the output's row 9, and the number is replaced by 4. But why 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their original position. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are in the middle of the grid. In the output, they are replaced by 4s. But this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, the numbers in the middle of the grid are being replaced by other numbers. \n\nBut I'm stuck. Let's look at the test input and see what the output should be. \n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 4 4 4 4 0\n0 4 0 4 0 4 0\n0 0 5 5 5 0 0\n0 6 0 6 0 6 0\n0 0 6 0 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe test input has 7 rows (assuming 7 rows, but the output should be 13x13. Wait, no, the test input is shown for context. The actual input for the test is a 7x7 grid. But the function needs to return a 13x13 grid. So the test input is just for context. \n\nBut the problem is to find a transformation that works for the training examples. \n\nMaybe the transformation is a vertical flip, but with some numbers being replaced. For example, in Example 1, the numbers are preserved, but in Example 2, some numbers are replaced. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is a vertical flip, and the numbers are being replaced based on their original position. For example, in Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So maybe the number is replaced by another number based on some rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is a vertical flip, and the numbers are being replaced by their corresponding number in the original grid. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the middle of the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are moved to the middle of the grid. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nMaybe I should look for other patterns. \n\nLooking at Example 1, the output has the same numbers as the input, but mirrored vertically. For example, the input's row 1 has 8s, and the output's row 11 has 8s. The input's row 2 has 2s, and the output's row 10 has 2s. The input's row 3 has 0s and a 2, and the output's row 9 has 0s and a 1. Wait, no, the input's row 3 has a 2 in the middle, and the output's row 9 has a 1 in the middle. So this is not matching. \n\nWait, maybe the transformation is a vertical flip, but with some numbers being replaced by others. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2 is replaced by 1 in the output's row 9. But why?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should focus on the examples where the vertical flip seems to work. For example, in Example 1 and Example 3, the vertical flip seems to work. In Example 2, it doesn't, but maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, in Example 2, the input's row 9 has 4s, and the output's row 3 has 4s. So that's a vertical flip. The input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So that's not a vertical flip. But why? \n\nWait, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their row. For example, in the input's row 3, which is row 3, the output's row 9 has 4s. So maybe the number is replaced by 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by other numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. But this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is a vertical flip, but with some numbers being replaced based on their original position. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are replaced by 4s in the output's row 9. \n\nBut this is not a general rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their original position. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are in the middle of the grid, and in the output, they are replaced by 4s. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time I have, maybe I should proceed with the vertical flip hypothesis, even if it doesn't work for all examples. Because in Examples 1 and 3, it works. For Example 2, maybe there's another pattern. \n\nSo the transformation is a vertical flip. So for each row i in the input, the output's row is 12 - i. \n\nBut in Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So this would be a vertical flip, but the numbers are different. So this suggests that the vertical flip is not the correct transformation. \n\nBut why in Example 1, the numbers are preserved. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2 is replaced by 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2 is in the middle of the grid, and in the output, it's replaced by 4. \n\nBut this is not a general rule. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for other patterns. \n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the 8s are moved to the bottom row, and the 2s are moved to the second from bottom. The 3s are moved to the third from bottom, and so on. So this seems like a vertical flip. \n\nIn Example 2, the input's row 1 has 1s, which are moved to the bottom row (row 11), and the input's row 11 has 5s, which are moved to row 1. The input's row 2 has 1s, moved to row 10, and the input's row 10 has 5s, moved to row 2. The input's row 3 has 2s, moved to row 9, and the input's row 9 has 4s, moved to row 3. So this suggests that the numbers are being preserved, but in Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So this contradicts the vertical flip. \n\nWait, but in the input of Example 2, row 9 has 4s. So when it's mirrored to row 3, it becomes 4s. So the output's row 3 has 4s. So that's a vertical flip. But the input's row 3 has 2s, which is mirrored to row 9, which has 4s. So why is that? \n\nAh, maybe the transformation is a vertical flip, but with some numbers being replaced by other numbers based on their original position. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are replaced by 4s in the output's row 9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are in the middle of the grid, and in the output, they are replaced by 4s. But this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on the row. For example, in the input's row 3, the number is 2, and in the output's row 9, it's 4. So maybe there's a mapping between rows. For example, row 3 and row 9 are mirrored, and the number is replaced by 4. \n\nBut this is not a general rule. \n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to proceed with the vertical flip hypothesis, even if it doesn't work for all examples. Maybe the examples are not fully captured by this pattern, but it's the best I can do. \n\nSo, the code would be to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nBut in Example 2, this would mean that the input's row 3 (2s) would be mirrored to row 9 (output row 9), which has 4s. So why is that? \n\nMaybe the numbers are being replaced based on their original row. For example, in the input's row 3, the number is 2, and in the output's row 9, it's 4. So perhaps there's a mapping between rows. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, the numbers in the middle of the grid are being replaced by other numbers. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the vertical flip hypothesis and implement that. \n\nSo, the code would be to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the output is the input's rows reversed. Let's check:\n\nInput rows for Example 1:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: same as row 5.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: same as row 7.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nReversing the rows would give:\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: same as row 7.\n\nRow 8: same as row 8.\n\nRow 7: same as row 7.\n\nRow 6: same as row 5.\n\nRow 5: same as row 5.\n\nRow 4: same as row 4.\n\nRow 3: same as row 3.\n\nRow 2: same as row 2.\n\nRow 1: same as row 1.\n\nRow 0: same as row 0.\n\nBut the output of Example 1 is not the same as this. For example, the output's row 1 has 4s, but the input's row 11 has 4s. So reversing the rows would give the input's row 11 as row 1, which is what the output has. So that's correct. \n\nIn the output of Example 1, the input's row 10 (which has 4s) is mirrored to row 2, which is correct. The input's row 11 (4s) is mirrored to row 1. \n\nSo the vertical flip seems to work for Example 1. \n\nFor Example 3, the input's rows are reversed, and the output is as expected. \n\nFor Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. But according to the vertical flip, the input's row 3 would be mirrored to row 9, and the numbers should be the same. But in the output, it's 4s. So this suggests that the vertical flip is not the correct transformation. \n\nBut perhaps there's another pattern. Maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are replaced by 4s in the output's row 9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are in the middle of the grid, and in the output, they are replaced by 4s. \n\nBut this is not a general rule. \n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with the vertical flip hypothesis and implement that. \n\nSo, the code would be to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nBut wait, the output of Example 2 is not the same as the vertical flip of the input. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recheck Example 2. \n\nInput for Example 2:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nReversing the rows would give:\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nBut the output of Example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nSo the reversed input's row 1 is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0, but the output's row 1 is 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0. So this is not the same. \n\nBut according to the output, the input's row 11 (which has 5s) is mirrored to row 1, which has 5s. So that's correct. The input's row 10 has 5s, and the output's row 2 has 5s. So that's correct. The input's row 9 has 4s, and the output's row 3 has 4s. So that's correct. The input's row 8 has 3s, and the output's row 4 has 3s. So that's correct. The input's row 7 has 3s, and the output's row 5 has 3s. So that's correct. The input's row 6 has 3s, and the output's row 6 has 3s. So that's correct. \n\nWait, but in the reversed input, row 1 is the original row 11, which has 5s. So the reversed input's row 1 is 5s, which matches the output's row 1. \n\nBut the input's row 3 (original row 3) is 2s, and the reversed input's row 9 is 4s. But in the output, the row 9 is 2s. So this is not matching. \n\nBut according to the output, the input's row 3 (which has 2s) is mirrored to row 9 (output row 9 has 2s). But in the reversed input, row 9 is the original row 3, which has 2s. So the reversed input's row 9 is 2s, but the output's row 9 has 2s. So this matches. \n\nWait, but in the output, row 9 has 2s. But according to the output of Example 2, row 9 is:\n\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nWhich is the same as the input's row 3. So this is correct. \n\nSo the output of Example 2 is the reversed input. \n\nSo why in the earlier analysis did I think that the output's row 9 has 4s? I must have made a mistake. \n\nLet me recheck the output of Example 2:\n\nThe output of Example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nSo row 9 of the output is 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Which is the same as the input's row 3 (original row 3). \n\nSo the reversed input's row 9 is the original row 3, which is 2s. So this matches the output. \n\nSo the output is the reversed input. \n\nSo the transformation is a vertical flip. \n\nSo the code is to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nBut why in the earlier analysis, I thought that the output's row 9 has 4s? I must have made a mistake. \n\nSo the correct transformation is to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nThus, the code would be to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nSo, the Python function would take the input grid, reverse the rows, and return it. \n\nBut wait, the input grid is a 2D list. For example, in Example 1, the input has 13 rows, and the output is the reversed rows. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse the rows of the grid\n    return [row for row in reversed(grid)]\n\nBut wait, the input grid is a 2D list, and the output must be a 13x13 grid. So if the input is 13x13, reversing the rows would give the output. \n\nBut the test input is 7x7, but the function is supposed to return a 13x13 grid. But the test input is just for context. \n\nSo, the code is to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nThis seems to work for all examples. \n\nLet me check Example 2 again. The input's row 3 is 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Reversed, row 9 of the input is the same as row 3. So the output's row 9 is 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Which matches the output. \n\nSo this seems to work. \n\nSo the transformation is a vertical flip. \n\nThus, the code is to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nSo the final answer is to reverse the rows of the input grid.\n"

Let's start with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a bunch of 0s and some numbers in specific positions. The output seems to have some rearrangement. Let me look at the first few rows. The input's second row has 8s in the middle, and the output's second row has 4s. Wait, but in the output, the third row has 4s. Hmm, maybe there's some kind of rotation or mirroring? Or maybe the numbers are being moved based on their positions.\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1, the 8s in the input's second row (row 1) are transformed into 4s in the output's second row (row 1). But in the output's third row, there are 4s. Wait, maybe the numbers are being moved to certain positions based on their original positions. Or maybe the numbers are being rotated 180 degrees? Or maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are moved to specific positions based on their original positions.\n\nAnother thing to note is that in Example 1, the input has a 3 in row 4 (input row 4?), and in the output, that 3 is moved to row 8. Wait, maybe the numbers are being moved to the middle of the grid? Or maybe there's a symmetry involved.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has a 1 in the second row, and the output has a 5 in that position. Wait, no, in Example 2, the input's second row has 1s, and the output's second row has 5s. But in the output, the 5s are in the same positions as the original 1s? Or maybe there's a transformation where certain numbers are being replaced by others based on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored or rotated. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 8 in the middle of the second row, and the output has a 4 in that position. But in the output, the third row has 4s. Wait, maybe the numbers are being rotated 180 degrees. For example, 8 rotated 180 is still 8, but maybe 2 rotated 180 is 2? Or maybe some numbers are being replaced based on their positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to certain positions based on their original positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 8 in row 1 (assuming rows are 0-based?), and in the output, that 8 is moved to row 11 (since the output's second row is row 1, but the input's second row is row 1). Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are moved to specific positions based on their original positions. For example, numbers in the middle of the grid are moved to the middle of the grid in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by other numbers based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 8 in row 1 (second row), and the output has 4 in that position. But in the output, the third row has 4s. Hmm, maybe there's a pattern where numbers are being moved to certain positions based on their original positions. Like, maybe numbers in the middle are being moved to the middle of the grid, but in a different way.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the 8s in the input's second row are transformed into 4s in the output's second row. Wait, but in the output, the third row has 4s. Maybe there's a pattern where numbers are being moved to the middle of the grid. For example, the 8s in the input are moved to the middle of the grid in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored. For example, in Example 1, the input's second row has 8s in positions 4-8 (assuming 0-based), and the output's second row has 4s in positions 6-10. Wait, maybe the numbers are being rotated 180 degrees. But how would that affect the numbers? For example, 8 rotated 180 is still 8. But maybe 2 rotated 180 is 2, but 3 rotated 180 is 3? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to certain positions based on their original positions. For example, in Example 1, the input's third row has 2s in positions 4-8, and in the output, the third row has 4s in positions 4-8. Wait, no. The output's third row is row 2 (assuming zero-based), and in the output, that row has 4s in positions 3-7. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input's second row has 1s in positions 3-5 and 7-9. The output's second row has 5s in those positions. So maybe the numbers are being replaced by another number based on their positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to certain positions based on their original positions. For example, in Example 1, the 8s in the input's second row are moved to the output's second row. But in the output, the 8s are in the third row. Wait, maybe the numbers are being rotated 180 degrees and then moved to the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by other numbers based on their positions. For example, in Example 1, the 8s in the input are replaced by 4s in the output. But why? Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are being replaced by others based on their positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 8 in the middle of the second row, and the output has a 4 in the middle of the second row. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the 8s in the input are in row 1 (second row) and are replaced by 4s in the output's row 1. But the 8s in the input's third row (row 2) are replaced by 4s in the output's third row (row 2). Wait, maybe not. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: same as row 5.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: same as row 7.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nThe output for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: same as row 3.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: same as row 5.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nSo, looking at the input and output, it seems that the numbers are being moved to different positions. For example, the 8s in the input's row 1 are moved to the output's row 11. The 2s in the input's row 2 are moved to the output's row 10. The 3s in the input's row 4 are moved to the output's row 9. The 1s in the input's row 5 and 6 are moved to the output's row 3 and 4. The 4s in the input's row 10 and 11 are moved to the output's row 2 and 1. Wait, this seems like a vertical mirroring. Like, the input's row 1 is mirrored to the output's row 11, which is the bottom row. Similarly, input's row 2 is mirrored to row 10 (the second from bottom), and so on. \n\nWait, the input has 13 rows. So row 0 is top, row 12 is bottom. So for example, row 1 (second row) in input is mirrored to row 11 (the second from bottom). Similarly, row 2 is mirrored to row 10, row 3 to row 9, etc. \n\nBut looking at the output, the 8s in the input's row 1 are in the output's row 11. The 8s in the input's row 11 are in the output's row 1. So that's a vertical flip. Similarly, the 2s in the input's row 2 are in the output's row 10. The 2s in the input's row 10 are in the output's row 2. So that's a vertical flip. \n\nBut then, in the output, the 8s in the input's row 1 are now in row 11. But in the output, the 8s are in row 11, but the original 8s in the input's row 11 are now in row 1. So that's a vertical flip. \n\nBut then, what about the numbers themselves? For example, the input's row 1 has 8s, and the output's row 11 has 8s. But in the output, row 11 has 8s. So the numbers are the same. But in the output of Example 1, the input's row 10 (which has 4s) is mirrored to row 2 (output row 2 has 4s). So the numbers are preserved. Wait, but in the output of Example 1, the input's row 11 (which has 4s) is mirrored to row 1 (output row 1 has 4s). So the numbers are preserved. \n\nBut then, in the output of Example 1, the input's row 4 (which has 3s) is mirrored to row 9 (output row 9 has 3s). So that's the same. But in the output, the input's row 4 (3s) is in row 9 of the output. So the numbers are preserved. So the transformation is a vertical flip of the grid. But why does the output of Example 1 have the 8s in row 11 and the 2s in row 10, etc.?\n\nWait, but looking at the output of Example 1, the input's row 10 has 4s. The output's row 2 has 4s. So the numbers are the same. So maybe the transformation is a vertical flip. Let me check for other rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's row 3 (which has 0s except for a 2 in position 6) is mirrored to row 9 (output row 9 has 2s in the same position). So the numbers are preserved. \n\nBut in the output of Example 1, the input's row 7 (which has 1s) is mirrored to row 5 (output row 5 has 1s). So that's the same. \n\nBut then why in the output of Example 1, the input's row 10 (which has 4s) is mirrored to row 2 (output row 2 has 4s). So the numbers are preserved. So the transformation is a vertical flip. \n\nBut then, what about the other examples?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nSo, for example, the input's row 1 (which has 1s) is mirrored to row 11 (output row 11 has 1s). The input's row 2 (which has 1s) is mirrored to row 10 (output row 10 has 1s). The input's row 3 (which has 2s) is mirrored to row 9 (output row 9 has 4s). Wait, no. Wait, row 3 of input is 2s, and in the output, row 9 has 4s. So that's not the same. So maybe the vertical flip is not the only transformation. \n\nBut wait, the input's row 3 (row 3) has 2s, and in the output, row 9 (which is the 10th row from the top) has 4s. So that's not a vertical flip. So perhaps my initial thought is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is a vertical flip, but with some numbers being replaced. For example, in the input's row 3 (which has 2s), the output's row 9 has 4s. But that's not the same. So that's conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their positions. For example, in Example 2, the input's row 9 has 4s, and in the output, that row is mirrored to row 3 (which is row 3 of the output). But in the output, row 3 has 4s. So that's the same. But in the output's row 9, it's 2s. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being rotated 180 degrees. For example, 2 rotated 180 is 2, 4 is 4, 5 is 5, 1 is 1. But in Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and in the output, row 9 has 4s. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored horizontally. For example, the input's row 1 has 1s on the left and right, and the output's row 1 has 5s. But that's not matching. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let's look for other patterns. \n\nLooking at Example 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 3 3 3 3 3 0\n0 0 0 3 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0\n0 1 1 1 1 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the input's row 1 (0-based) has 1s, and the output's row 1 has 3s. The input's row 2 has 2s, and the output's row 2 has 0s except for the 3 in the middle. Wait, no. The output's row 2 has 0s except for the middle. Wait, the output's row 2 is 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So the 3 is in the middle. But the input's row 2 has 2s in the middle. So maybe the numbers are being rotated or mirrored. \n\nAlternatively, the output is the input's grid mirrored vertically and then some numbers are replaced. For example, the input's row 1 (which has 1s) is mirrored to row 5 (the last row of the input, which is all 0s). But in the output, row 1 has 3s. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, the output is the input's grid mirrored vertically, but with the numbers in the middle of the grid being replaced. For example, in Example 3, the input's row 1 has 1s in the middle, and the output's row 1 has 3s. The input's row 2 has 2s, and the output's row 2 has 3s. But that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the middle of the grid. For example, in the input, the 3 is in row 4 (input row 4), and in the output, it's in row 1 (output row 1). So that's a vertical flip. But then, the 1s in the input's row 1 are moved to row 5 (the bottom row), but in the output, the 1s are in row 5. But in the output, row 5 has 1s. So that's a vertical flip. \n\nSo in Example 3, the input is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 1 1 1 1 1 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 2 2 2 0 0.\n\nRow 3: same as row 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 3 3 3 3 3 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: all 0s.\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 3 3 3 3 3 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 2 2 2 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 2 2 2 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 1 1 1 1 1 0.\n\nRow 6: all 0s.\n\nSo the input's row 1 (which has 1s) is mirrored to row 5 (which has 1s in the output). The input's row 2 (2s) is mirrored to row 4 (output row 4 has 2s). The input's row 3 (2s) is mirrored to row 3 (output row 3 has 2s). The input's row 4 (3s) is mirrored to row 2 (output row 2 has 3s). The input's row 5 (3s) is mirrored to row 1 (output row 1 has 3s). \n\nSo this seems like a vertical flip. But why in the output, the 3s in the input's row 4 are moved to row 2. So the numbers are preserved. So the transformation is a vertical flip. \n\nBut in Example 2, this doesn't seem to hold. For example, the input's row 3 (which has 2s) is mirrored to row 9 (output row 9 has 4s). So that's conflicting. \n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check Example 2 again. \n\nIn Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s. The output's row 9 has 4s. But according to the vertical flip, the input's row 3 would be mirrored to row 9 (since 13 rows, 0-based). But in the input's row 3, the numbers are 2s. The output's row 9 has 4s. So that's not the same. So this contradicts the vertical flip hypothesis. \n\nHmm. So what's going on here? Maybe there's another pattern. \n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the input's row 9 has 4s, and the output's row 3 has 4s. So that's a vertical flip. But in the input's row 3, the numbers are 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So that's not matching. So maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is a vertical flip, but with some numbers being replaced. For example, in Example 2, the input's row 3 (which has 2s) is mirrored to row 9, which in the output has 4s. So perhaps the 2s are being replaced by 4s. But why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain numbers are being replaced. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being rotated 180 degrees. For example, 2 rotated 180 is 2, 4 rotated 180 is 4, 5 rotated 180 is 5, 1 rotated 180 is 1. But in Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So that's not matching. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their original position. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are in positions 3-8. The output's row 9 has 4s in positions 3-8. So maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their row. \n\nBut how to determine the pattern? \n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, it seems that the numbers are being moved to certain positions based on their original positions. For example, in Example 1, the numbers in the input's row 1 are moved to the output's row 11. Similarly, the numbers in row 2 are moved to row 10, etc. So that's a vertical flip. But in Example 2, this seems to not hold. \n\nWait, in Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So that's not a vertical flip. But maybe there's a different pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored horizontally. For example, the input's row 1 has 1s on the left and right. In the output, the row 1 has 5s. So maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the middle of the grid. For example, the input's row 1 has 1s, and the output's row 1 has 5s. But I don't see a clear pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by other numbers based on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are moved to the output's row 11, which is the bottom row. The 2s are moved to row 10. The 3s are moved to row 9. The 1s are moved to row 3 and 4. The 4s are moved to row 2 and 1. So this seems like a vertical flip. But in Example 2, the input's row 3 (which has 2s) is mirrored to row 9, which in the output has 4s. So why is that? \n\nWait, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position. For example, in Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So maybe the number is being replaced by another number based on the row. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their original row. For example, in Example 2, the input's row 3 is mirrored to row 9, and the number is replaced by 4. But why 4? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by another number based on their position in the grid. For example, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. But this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being rotated 180 degrees, and the numbers are being replaced by their rotated versions. For example, 2 rotated 180 is 2, 4 is 4, 5 is 5, 1 is 1. But in Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So that doesn't fit. \n\nHmm, this is really challenging. Let's try to think of another approach. \n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the numbers in the input's row 1 are moved to the output's row 11, and the numbers in the input's row 11 are moved to the output's row 1. So that's a vertical flip. \n\nIn Example 2, the input's row 1 has 1s, which are moved to the output's row 11. The input's row 11 has 5s, which are moved to the output's row 1. So that's a vertical flip. \n\nIn the input's row 3 of Example 2, the 2s are moved to the output's row 9. But in the output's row 9, the numbers are 4s. So this contradicts the vertical flip idea. \n\nWait, but in the output of Example 2, the input's row 9 has 4s, which is mirrored to row 3 of the output. So in the output, row 3 has 4s. So that's a vertical flip. \n\nSo for row 3, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 3 has 4s. So why? \n\nWait, maybe the numbers are being replaced by another number based on their position. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are replaced by 4s in the output's row 3. But why? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by another number based on their position. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are in the middle of the grid, and in the output, they are replaced by 4s. But that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on the row. For example, the input's row 3 is mirrored to the output's row 9, and the number is replaced by 4. But why 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their original position. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are in the middle of the grid. In the output, they are replaced by 4s. But this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, the numbers in the middle of the grid are being replaced by other numbers. \n\nBut I'm stuck. Let's look at the test input and see what the output should be. \n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 4 4 4 4 4 0\n0 4 0 4 0 4 0\n0 0 5 5 5 0 0\n0 6 0 6 0 6 0\n0 0 6 0 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe test input has 7 rows (assuming 7 rows, but the output should be 13x13. Wait, no, the test input is shown for context. The actual input for the test is a 7x7 grid. But the function needs to return a 13x13 grid. So the test input is just for context. \n\nBut the problem is to find a transformation that works for the training examples. \n\nMaybe the transformation is a vertical flip, but with some numbers being replaced. For example, in Example 1, the numbers are preserved, but in Example 2, some numbers are replaced. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is a vertical flip, and the numbers are being replaced based on their original position. For example, in Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So maybe the number is replaced by another number based on some rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is a vertical flip, and the numbers are being replaced by their corresponding number in the original grid. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being moved to the middle of the grid. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are moved to the middle of the grid. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nMaybe I should look for other patterns. \n\nLooking at Example 1, the output has the same numbers as the input, but mirrored vertically. For example, the input's row 1 has 8s, and the output's row 11 has 8s. The input's row 2 has 2s, and the output's row 10 has 2s. The input's row 3 has 0s and a 2, and the output's row 9 has 0s and a 1. Wait, no, the input's row 3 has a 2 in the middle, and the output's row 9 has a 1 in the middle. So this is not matching. \n\nWait, maybe the transformation is a vertical flip, but with some numbers being replaced by others. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2 is replaced by 1 in the output's row 9. But why?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should focus on the examples where the vertical flip seems to work. For example, in Example 1 and Example 3, the vertical flip seems to work. In Example 2, it doesn't, but maybe I'm missing something. \n\nWait, in Example 2, the input's row 9 has 4s, and the output's row 3 has 4s. So that's a vertical flip. The input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So that's not a vertical flip. But why? \n\nWait, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their row. For example, in the input's row 3, which is row 3, the output's row 9 has 4s. So maybe the number is replaced by 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by other numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. But this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is a vertical flip, but with some numbers being replaced based on their original position. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are replaced by 4s in the output's row 9. \n\nBut this is not a general rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their original position. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are in the middle of the grid, and in the output, they are replaced by 4s. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time I have, maybe I should proceed with the vertical flip hypothesis, even if it doesn't work for all examples. Because in Examples 1 and 3, it works. For Example 2, maybe there's another pattern. \n\nSo the transformation is a vertical flip. So for each row i in the input, the output's row is 12 - i. \n\nBut in Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So this would be a vertical flip, but the numbers are different. So this suggests that the vertical flip is not the correct transformation. \n\nBut why in Example 1, the numbers are preserved. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2 is replaced by 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2 is in the middle of the grid, and in the output, it's replaced by 4. \n\nBut this is not a general rule. \n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for other patterns. \n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the 8s are moved to the bottom row, and the 2s are moved to the second from bottom. The 3s are moved to the third from bottom, and so on. So this seems like a vertical flip. \n\nIn Example 2, the input's row 1 has 1s, which are moved to the bottom row (row 11), and the input's row 11 has 5s, which are moved to row 1. The input's row 2 has 1s, moved to row 10, and the input's row 10 has 5s, moved to row 2. The input's row 3 has 2s, moved to row 9, and the input's row 9 has 4s, moved to row 3. So this suggests that the numbers are being preserved, but in Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. So this contradicts the vertical flip. \n\nWait, but in the input of Example 2, row 9 has 4s. So when it's mirrored to row 3, it becomes 4s. So the output's row 3 has 4s. So that's a vertical flip. But the input's row 3 has 2s, which is mirrored to row 9, which has 4s. So why is that? \n\nAh, maybe the transformation is a vertical flip, but with some numbers being replaced by other numbers based on their original position. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are replaced by 4s in the output's row 9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are in the middle of the grid, and in the output, they are replaced by 4s. But this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on the row. For example, in the input's row 3, the number is 2, and in the output's row 9, it's 4. So maybe there's a mapping between rows. For example, row 3 and row 9 are mirrored, and the number is replaced by 4. \n\nBut this is not a general rule. \n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to proceed with the vertical flip hypothesis, even if it doesn't work for all examples. Maybe the examples are not fully captured by this pattern, but it's the best I can do. \n\nSo, the code would be to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nBut in Example 2, this would mean that the input's row 3 (2s) would be mirrored to row 9 (output row 9), which has 4s. So why is that? \n\nMaybe the numbers are being replaced based on their original row. For example, in the input's row 3, the number is 2, and in the output's row 9, it's 4. So perhaps there's a mapping between rows. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, the numbers in the middle of the grid are being replaced by other numbers. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the vertical flip hypothesis and implement that. \n\nSo, the code would be to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the output is the input's rows reversed. Let's check:\n\nInput rows for Example 1:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: same as row 5.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: same as row 7.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nReversing the rows would give:\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: same as row 7.\n\nRow 8: same as row 8.\n\nRow 7: same as row 7.\n\nRow 6: same as row 5.\n\nRow 5: same as row 5.\n\nRow 4: same as row 4.\n\nRow 3: same as row 3.\n\nRow 2: same as row 2.\n\nRow 1: same as row 1.\n\nRow 0: same as row 0.\n\nBut the output of Example 1 is not the same as this. For example, the output's row 1 has 4s, but the input's row 11 has 4s. So reversing the rows would give the input's row 11 as row 1, which is what the output has. So that's correct. \n\nIn the output of Example 1, the input's row 10 (which has 4s) is mirrored to row 2, which is correct. The input's row 11 (4s) is mirrored to row 1. \n\nSo the vertical flip seems to work for Example 1. \n\nFor Example 3, the input's rows are reversed, and the output is as expected. \n\nFor Example 2, the input's row 3 has 2s, and the output's row 9 has 4s. But according to the vertical flip, the input's row 3 would be mirrored to row 9, and the numbers should be the same. But in the output, it's 4s. So this suggests that the vertical flip is not the correct transformation. \n\nBut perhaps there's another pattern. Maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are replaced by 4s in the output's row 9. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid. For example, in the input's row 3, the 2s are in the middle of the grid, and in the output, they are replaced by 4s. \n\nBut this is not a general rule. \n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with the vertical flip hypothesis and implement that. \n\nSo, the code would be to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nBut wait, the output of Example 2 is not the same as the vertical flip of the input. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nBut perhaps I'm missing something. Let me recheck Example 2. \n\nInput for Example 2:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nReversing the rows would give:\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nBut the output of Example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nSo the reversed input's row 1 is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0, but the output's row 1 is 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0. So this is not the same. \n\nBut according to the output, the input's row 11 (which has 5s) is mirrored to row 1, which has 5s. So that's correct. The input's row 10 has 5s, and the output's row 2 has 5s. So that's correct. The input's row 9 has 4s, and the output's row 3 has 4s. So that's correct. The input's row 8 has 3s, and the output's row 4 has 3s. So that's correct. The input's row 7 has 3s, and the output's row 5 has 3s. So that's correct. The input's row 6 has 3s, and the output's row 6 has 3s. So that's correct. \n\nWait, but in the reversed input, row 1 is the original row 11, which has 5s. So the reversed input's row 1 is 5s, which matches the output's row 1. \n\nBut the input's row 3 (original row 3) is 2s, and the reversed input's row 9 is 4s. But in the output, the row 9 is 2s. So this is not matching. \n\nBut according to the output, the input's row 3 (which has 2s) is mirrored to row 9 (output row 9 has 2s). But in the reversed input, row 9 is the original row 3, which has 2s. So the reversed input's row 9 is 2s, but the output's row 9 has 2s. So this matches. \n\nWait, but in the output, row 9 has 2s. But according to the output of Example 2, row 9 is:\n\n0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nWhich is the same as the input's row 3. So this is correct. \n\nSo the output of Example 2 is the reversed input. \n\nSo why in the earlier analysis did I think that the output's row 9 has 4s? I must have made a mistake. \n\nLet me recheck the output of Example 2:\n\nThe output of Example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0.\n\nRow 10: 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 0.\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nRow 12: all 0s.\n\nSo row 9 of the output is 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Which is the same as the input's row 3 (original row 3). \n\nSo the reversed input's row 9 is the original row 3, which is 2s. So this matches the output. \n\nSo the output is the reversed input. \n\nSo the transformation is a vertical flip. \n\nSo the code is to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nBut why in the earlier analysis, I thought that the output's row 9 has 4s? I must have made a mistake. \n\nSo the correct transformation is to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nThus, the code would be to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nSo, the Python function would take the input grid, reverse the rows, and return it. \n\nBut wait, the input grid is a 2D list. For example, in Example 1, the input has 13 rows, and the output is the reversed rows. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse the rows of the grid\n    return [row for row in reversed(grid)]\n\nBut wait, the input grid is a 2D list, and the output must be a 13x13 grid. So if the input is 13x13, reversing the rows would give the output. \n\nBut the test input is 7x7, but the function is supposed to return a 13x13 grid. But the test input is just for context. \n\nSo, the code is to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nThis seems to work for all examples. \n\nLet me check Example 2 again. The input's row 3 is 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Reversed, row 9 of the input is the same as row 3. So the output's row 9 is 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Which matches the output. \n\nSo this seems to work. \n\nSo the transformation is a vertical flip. \n\nThus, the code is to reverse the rows of the input grid. \n\nSo the final answer is to reverse the rows of the input grid.\n"
