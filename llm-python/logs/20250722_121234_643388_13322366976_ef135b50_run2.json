          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that:\n1. The output grid often has 9s in specific positions where the input had 2s\n2. The 9s seem to appear in patterns that are similar to the 2s but with some modification\n3. The 9s appear in positions that are adjacent to the 2s, but not exactly in the same positions\n4. The 9s seem to form a kind of \"bridge\" or \"connection\" between the 2s and the 0s\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain 2s with 9s in specific patterns, likely based on their position relative to other 2s.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Check if the cell is a 2\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Check if the cell is in a position that should be replaced with 9\n                # This is a pattern-based approach based on the training examples\n                # We check if the cell is in a position that is adjacent to other 2s\n                # and not in the first few rows or columns\n                if i > 2 and j > 2:\n                    # Check if the cell is in a position that should be replaced with 9\n                    # This is a simplified pattern based on the training examples\n                    # We check if the cell is in a position that is adjacent to other 2s\n                    # and not in the first few rows or columns\n                    if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 9\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Check if the cell is a 2\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Check if the cell is in a position that should be replaced with 9\n                # This is a pattern-based approach based on the training examples\n                # We check if the cell is in a position that is adjacent to other 2s\n                # and not in the first few rows or columns\n                if i > 2 and j > 2:\n                    # Check if the cell is in a position that should be replaced with 9\n                    # This is a simplified pattern based on the training examples\n                    # We check if the cell is in a position that is adjacent to other 2s\n                    # and not in the first few rows or columns\n                    if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 9\n    \n    return transformed\n```",
