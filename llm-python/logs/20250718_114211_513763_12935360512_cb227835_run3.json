The number 8 appears in the input and is preserved in the output, but often with additional numbers around it.\n3. The number 3 appears in the output in a pattern that seems to spread out from a central point in a spiral or wave pattern.\n4. The transformation seems to involve spreading out numbers from a central point in a spiral or wave pattern.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads out numbers from a central point in a spiral pattern.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the position of the 8 in the input grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Start spreading from this position\n                x, y = i, j\n                directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # Right, Down, Left, Up\n                direction_index = 0\n                steps = 1\n                \n                while True:\n                    # Check if we've reached the edge of the grid\n                    if x < 0 or x >= 13 or y < 0 or y >= 13:\n                        break\n                    \n                    # Check if the position is already filled\n                    if transformed_grid[x][y] != 0:\n                        # Change direction\n                        direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 4\n                        steps = 1\n                        continue\n                    \n                    # Spread the number 3 in a spiral pattern\n                    if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                        transformed_grid[x][y] = 8\n                    else:\n                        transformed_grid[x][y] = 3\n                    \n                    # Move in the current direction\n                    x += directions[direction_index][0]\n                    y += directions[direction_index][1]\n                    steps += 1\n                    \n                    # Change direction after a certain number of steps\n                    if steps % 3 == 0:\n                        direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 4\n                        steps = 1\n                \n                break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the position of the 8 in the input grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Start spreading from this position\n                x, y = i, j\n                directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]  # Right, Down, Left, Up\n                direction_index = 0\n                steps = 1\n                \n                while True:\n                    # Check if we've reached the edge of the grid\n                    if x < 0 or x >= 13 or y < 0 or y >= 13:\n                        break\n                    \n                    # Check if the position is already filled\n                    if transformed_grid[x][y] != 0:\n                        # Change direction\n                        direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 4\n                        steps = 1\n                        continue\n                    \n                    # Spread the number 3 in a spiral pattern\n                    if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                        transformed_grid[x][y] = 8\n                    else:\n                        transformed_grid[x][y] = 3\n                    \n                    # Move in the current direction\n                    x += directions[direction_index][0]\n                    y += directions[direction_index][1]\n                    steps += 1\n                    \n                    # Change direction after a certain number of steps\n                    if steps % 3 == 0:\n                        direction_index = (direction_index + 1) % 4\n                        steps = 1\n                \n                break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
