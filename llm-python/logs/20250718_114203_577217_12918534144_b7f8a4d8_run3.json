There are patterns where specific values (like 2, 3, 4) are replaced with other values (like 3, 4, 5) in certain positions.\n3. There are also patterns where values are replaced in a way that creates new shapes or patterns.\n4. The transformation appears to be more complex than a simple value replacement, involving spatial relationships and patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with others in a structured way, focusing on the patterns observed in the training examples.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a deep copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified version that captures some of the observed patterns\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(28):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n                if (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace 3 with 4 in certain positions\n                if (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                elif (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 5 in certain positions\n                if (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with 6 in certain positions\n                if (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a deep copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified version that captures some of the observed patterns\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(28):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n                if (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace 3 with 4 in certain positions\n                if (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                elif (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 5 in certain positions\n                if (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with 6 in certain positions\n                if (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with others in a structured way.\n2. There are patterns where specific values (like 2, 3, 4) are replaced with other values (like 3, 4, 5) in certain positions.\n3. There are also patterns where values are replaced in a way that creates new shapes or patterns.\n4. The transformation appears to be more complex than a simple value replacement, involving spatial relationships and patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with others in a structured way, focusing on the patterns observed in the training examples.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a deep copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified version that captures some of the observed patterns\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(28):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n                if (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace 3 with 4 in certain positions\n                if (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                elif (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 5 in certain positions\n                if (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with 6 in certain positions\n                if (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a deep copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules based on observed patterns\n    # This is a simplified version that captures some of the observed patterns\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(28):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n                if (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n                elif (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                # Replace 3 with 4 in certain positions\n                if (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n                elif (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 5 in certain positions\n                if (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n                elif (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with 6 in certain positions\n                if (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 1):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif (i % 4 == 1) and (j % 4 == 2):\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
