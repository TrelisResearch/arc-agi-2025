    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, there are two examples given. Let me look at them carefully.\n\nFirst example input:\n3 3 8\n3 7 0\n5 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 5\n0 7 3\n8 3 3\n\nHmm. Let me write down the input and output grids for clarity.\n\nInput rows:\nRow 0: 3, 3, 8\nRow 1: 3, 7, 0\nRow 2: 5, 0, 0\n\nOutput rows:\nRow 0: 0, 0, 5\nRow 1: 0, 7, 3\nRow 2: 8, 3, 3\n\nLooking at the positions. Let's see what each cell in the output corresponds to in the input.\n\nFor example, output[0][0] is 0. Where does that come from? The input's row 2, column 0 is 5. Not sure yet. Let's check other positions.\n\nLooking at output row 0: 0, 0, 5. The third element is 5, which was in the input's row 2, column 0. Wait, input row 2 is [5,0,0]. So output row 0's third element is 5, which is input row 2, column 0. Maybe there's some kind of rotation or reflection?\n\nAnother thing: the output's row 0 is [0,0,5]. The input's row 0 is [3,3,8]. Maybe the output is some kind of transformation of the input's elements. Let's check other positions.\n\nLooking at output row 1: [0,7,3]. The middle element is 7, which is the same as input row 1, column 1. The third element is 3, which is input row 0, column 0. The first element is 0, which is input row 2, column 1? Wait, input row 2, column 1 is 0. So output row 1, column 0 is 0, which is input row 2, column 1. Hmm, maybe there's some kind of pattern where elements are moved from different positions.\n\nAnother observation: the output seems to have some elements that are from different rows and columns. Let's think about possible transformations. Maybe the output is a rotated version of the input? Let's check.\n\nIf we rotate the input 90 degrees clockwise, what would that look like?\n\nOriginal input:\nRow 0: 3 3 8\nRow 1: 3 7 0\nRow 2: 5 0 0\n\nRotated 90 degrees clockwise would be:\n\nOriginal columns become rows in reverse order. So the first column of the original (3,3,5) becomes the last row in reverse: 5,3,3. Then the second column (3,7,0) becomes the middle row reversed: 0,7,3. Third column (8,0,0) becomes first row reversed: 0,0,8. So the rotated grid would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 8\nRow 1: 0 7 3\nRow 2: 5 3 3\n\nBut the output for example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 5\nRow 1: 0 7 3\nRow 2: 8 3 3\n\nHmm, not quite matching. But maybe there's a combination of rotation and some other operations. Let's see.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is a reflection or some permutation of the input's elements. Let's look for possible permutations.\n\nLooking at the output row 0: 0 0 5. The input's row 2 is 5 0 0. So the third element of output row 0 is 5, which is the first element of input row 2. The first two elements of output row 0 are 0, which are the second and third elements of input row 2. So maybe the output row 0 is the input row 2 reversed? Input row 2 is [5,0,0], reversed is [0,0,5]. Which matches output row 0. So that's a possibility.\n\nThen output row 1 is [0,7,3]. The input row 1 is [3,7,0]. So the middle element is 7, same as input. The third element is 3, which is input row 0, column 0. The first element is 0, which is input row 2, column 1. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a combination of different rows. Let's check output row 2: [8,3,3]. The input row 0 is [3,3,8]. So the first element is 8, which is the third element of input row 0. The next two elements are 3 and 3, which are the first two elements of input row 0. So output row 2 is the input row 0 reversed? Input row 0 reversed is [8,3,3], which matches output row 2.\n\nSo for output row 0: input row 2 reversed. Output row 2: input row 0 reversed. Output row 1: input row 1? But output row 1 is [0,7,3], while input row 1 is [3,7,0]. So maybe the first element is 0 (from input row 2, column 1?), and third element is 3 (input row 0, column 0). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of different rows. Let me think of the output as a combination of the input's rows in a certain order, but with some transformations.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the output for example 1. The output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 5 \u2192 which is input row 2 reversed (5,0,0 \u2192 reversed is 0,0,5)\nRow 1: 0 7 3 \u2192 maybe input row 1's middle element is 7, and the first element is 0 (from input row 2, column 1?), third element is 3 (from input row 0, column 0)\nRow 2: 8 3 3 \u2192 input row 0 reversed (3,3,8 \u2192 reversed is 8,3,3)\n\nSo maybe the output is:\n\nRow 0: reversed row 2\nRow 1: some combination of row 1 and others?\nRow 2: reversed row 0\n\nBut what about row 1? Let's check the input row 1: [3,7,0]. The output row 1 is [0,7,3]. So the middle element is 7, same as input. The first element is 0, which is input row 2, column 1. The third element is 3, which is input row 0, column 0. So maybe it's taking elements from different rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row 1 is the input row 1's middle element (7) in the middle, and then the first and third elements are swapped with elements from other rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input's rows in a certain way. For example, the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: reversed row 2\nRow 1: row 1's middle element, and then first and third elements from other rows?\nRow 2: reversed row 0\n\nBut this seems a bit arbitrary. Let me check example 2.\n\nExample 2 input:\n5 5 2\n1 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 1\n2 5 5\n\nSo input rows:\n\nRow 0: 5,5,2\nRow 1: 1,0,0\nRow 2: 0,0,0\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,0 \u2192 same as input row 2.\nRow 1: 0,0,1 \u2192 maybe input row 1's third element (0) is changed? Or perhaps row 1's third element is 1? Wait, input row 1 is [1,0,0], so third element is 0. But output row 1 is [0,0,1]. So third element is 1, which is not present in input. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking elements from different rows. For example, output row 1 is [0,0,1]. The third element is 1, which is input row 1's first element. The first two elements are 0, which are from input row 2. So maybe output row 1 is [input row 2's first two elements, input row 1's first element]?\n\nBut that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input's rows in a certain order, but with some transformations.\n\nLooking at output row 0: 0 0 0 \u2192 same as input row 2. Output row 2: 2 5 5 \u2192 which is input row 0 reversed? Input row 0 is [5,5,2], reversed is [2,5,5], which matches output row 2.\n\nSo for example 2, output row 0 is input row 2, output row 2 is input row 0 reversed. Then output row 1 is [0,0,1]. Where does that come from? Input row 1 is [1,0,0]. So maybe the third element is 1, which is the first element of input row 1. The first two elements are 0, which are from input row 2. So maybe output row 1 is [input row 2's first two elements, input row 1's first element]. But that would be [0,0,1], which matches.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So for example 2, the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: input row 2\nRow 1: input row 2's first two elements, then input row 1's first element\nRow 2: input row 0 reversed.\n\nHmm. So maybe the pattern is that the output is:\n\nRow 0: input row 2\nRow 1: input row 2's first two elements, then input row 1's first element\nRow 2: input row 0 reversed.\n\nBut how does that fit with example 1?\n\nIn example 1, output row 0 is input row 2 reversed. Output row 2 is input row 0 reversed. So maybe the pattern is that the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: input row 2 reversed\nRow 1: input row 2's first two elements, then input row 1's first element\nRow 2: input row 0 reversed.\n\nBut that doesn't fit with example 2. Wait, example 2's output row 0 is input row 2. So maybe the pattern is different. Maybe the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: input row 2 reversed if some condition, or input row 2 otherwise?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input's rows in a certain way, with some transformations. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at example 1's output row 0: input row 2 reversed. Output row 2: input row 0 reversed. Output row 1: input row 1's middle element (7) in the middle, and then first and third elements from other rows.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Let's think of the output as a combination of the input's rows, but with some transformations.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is a rotation of the input. Let's try to think of possible rotations.\n\nFor example, if the input is rotated 180 degrees, then each row is reversed and the order of the rows is reversed. Let's check for example 1:\n\nOriginal input:\nRow 0: 3 3 8\nRow 1: 3 7 0\nRow 2: 5 0 0\n\nRotated 180 degrees would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 5 (original row 2 reversed)\nRow 1: 0 7 3 (original row 1 reversed)\nRow 2: 8 3 3 (original row 0 reversed)\n\nWhich matches the output of example 1. Because the output for example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 5 \u2192 original row 2 reversed\nRow 1: 0 7 3 \u2192 original row 1 reversed\nRow 2: 8 3 3 \u2192 original row 0 reversed\n\nSo that's exactly the output. So the output is the input rotated 180 degrees. Let's check example 2.\n\nExample 2 input:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 2\nRow 1: 1 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0\n\nRotated 180 degrees would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 (original row 2 reversed)\nRow 1: 0 0 1 (original row 1 reversed)\nRow 2: 2 5 5 (original row 0 reversed)\n\nWhich matches the output of example 2. The output for example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 1\nRow 2: 2 5 5\n\nYes! So this seems to fit. So the transformation is to rotate the input grid 180 degrees. That is, each row is reversed, and the order of the rows is reversed.\n\nSo the steps to transform the input grid would be:\n\n- Reverse each row of the input grid.\n- Reverse the order of the rows.\n\nSo for example, the input grid is:\n\nOriginal rows: [row0, row1, row2]\nAfter reversing each row: [row0_reversed, row1_reversed, row2_reversed]\nThen reverse the order of the rows: [row2_reversed, row1_reversed, row0_reversed]\n\nWhich is exactly what the examples show.\n\nSo the function would take the input grid, reverse each row, then reverse the list of rows.\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,8] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [8,3,3]\nRow 1: [3,7,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,7,3]\nRow 2: [5,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows:\n\nRow 0 becomes [0,0,5] (original row 2 reversed)\nRow 1 becomes [0,7,3] (original row 1 reversed)\nRow 2 becomes [8,3,3] (original row 0 reversed)\n\nWhich matches the output of example 1.\n\nExample 2:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [5,5,2] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [2,5,5]\nRow 1: [1,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,1]\nRow 2: [0,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nReverse the order of the rows:\n\nRow 0 becomes [0,0,0] (original row 2 reversed)\nRow 1 becomes [0,0,1] (original row 1 reversed)\nRow 2 becomes [2,5,5] (original row 0 reversed)\n\nWhich matches the output of example 2.\n\nSo the transformation is to reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nTherefore, the Python function can be written as follows:\n\nTake the input grid, for each row, reverse it, then reverse the list of rows.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse each row\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    # Reverse the order of the rows\n    transformed = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return transformed\n\nTesting this with the examples:\n\nFor example 1, the input grid is:\n\n[\n [3,3,8],\n [3,7,0],\n [5,0,0]\n]\n\nreversed_rows would be:\n\n[\n [8,3,3],\n [0,7,3],\n [0,0,5]\n]\n\nthen reversed_rows[::-1] is:\n\n[\n [0,0,5],\n [0,7,3],\n [8,3,3]\n]\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nSimilarly for example 2.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct transformation.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\n6 3 5\n6 8 0\n4 0 0\n\nApplying the same transformation:\n\nOriginal grid:\n\nRow 0: [6,3,5] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [5,3,6]\nRow 1: [6,8,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,8,6]\nRow 2: [4,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,4]\n\nReversed order of rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,4]\nRow 1: [0,8,6]\nRow 2: [5,3,6]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[\n [0,0,4],\n [0,8,6],\n [5,3,6]\n]\n\nBut the test input is not part of the training examples, so the code should handle it correctly.\n\nTherefore, the code should be as above.\n"

Maybe the output is some kind of transformation of the input's elements. Let's check other positions.\n\nLooking at output row 1: [0,7,3].

Let's think about possible transformations. Maybe the output is a rotated version of the input? Let's check.\n\nIf we rotate the input 90 degrees clockwise, what would that look like?\n\nOriginal input:\nRow 0: 3 3 8\nRow 1: 3 7 0\nRow 2: 5 0 0\n\nRotated 90 degrees clockwise would be:\n\nOriginal columns become rows in reverse order. So the first column of the original (3,3,5) becomes the last row in reverse: 5,3,3. Then the second column (3,7,0) becomes the middle row reversed: 0,7,3. Third column (8,0,0) becomes first row reversed: 0,0,8.

The first two elements of output row 0 are 0, which are the second and third elements of input row 2. So maybe the output row 0 is the input row 2 reversed?

So the middle element is 7, same as input. The third element is 3, which is input row 0, column 0. The first element is 0, which is input row 2, column 1. Not sure.\n\nWait, maybe the output is a combination of different rows. Let's check output row 2: [8,3,3]. The input row 0 is [3,3,8]. So the first element is 8, which is the third element of input row 0. The next two elements are 3 and 3, which are the first two elements of input row 0. So output row 2 is the input row 0 reversed? Input row 0 reversed is [8,3,3], which matches output row 2.\n\nSo for output row 0: input row 2 reversed. Output row 2: input row 0 reversed. Output row 1: input row 1? But output row 1 is [0,7,3], while input row 1 is [3,7,0]. So maybe the first element is 0 (from input row 2, column 1?), and third element is 3 (input row 0, column 0). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of different rows. Let me think of the output as a combination of the input's rows in a certain order, but with some transformations.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the output for example 1. The output is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 5 \u2192 which is input row 2 reversed (5,0,0 \u2192 reversed is 0,0,5)\nRow 1: 0 7 3 \u2192 maybe input row 1's middle element is 7, and the first element is 0 (from input row 2, column 1?), third element is 3 (from input row 0, column 0)\nRow 2: 8 3 3 \u2192 input row 0 reversed (3,3,8 \u2192 reversed is 8,3,3)\n\nSo maybe the output is:\n\nRow 0: reversed row 2\nRow 1: some combination of row 1 and others?\nRow 2: reversed row 0\n\nBut what about row 1? Let's check the input row 1: [3,7,0]. The output row 1 is [0,7,3]. So the middle element is 7, same as input. The first element is 0, which is input row 2, column 1. The third element is 3, which is input row 0, column 0. So maybe it's taking elements from different rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output row 1 is the input row 1's middle element (7) in the middle, and then the first and third elements are swapped with elements from other rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input's rows in a certain way. For example, the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: reversed row 2\nRow 1: row 1's middle element, and then first and third elements from other rows?\nRow 2: reversed row 0\n\nBut this seems a bit arbitrary. Let me check example 2.\n\nExample 2 input:\n5 5 2\n1 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0\n0 0 1\n2 5 5\n\nSo input rows:\n\nRow 0: 5,5,2\nRow 1: 1,0,0\nRow 2: 0,0,0\n\nOutput rows:\n\nRow 0: 0,0,0 \u2192 same as input row 2.\nRow 1: 0,0,1 \u2192 maybe input row 1's third element (0) is changed? Or perhaps row 1's third element is 1? Wait, input row 1 is [1,0,0], so third element is 0. But output row 1 is [0,0,1]. So third element is 1, which is not present in input. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking elements from different rows. For example, output row 1 is [0,0,1]. The third element is 1, which is input row 1's first element. The first two elements are 0, which are from input row 2. So maybe output row 1 is [input row 2's first two elements, input row 1's first element]?\n\nBut that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input's rows in a certain order, but with some transformations.\n\nLooking at output row 0: 0 0 0 \u2192 same as input row 2. Output row 2: 2 5 5 \u2192 which is input row 0 reversed? Input row 0 is [5,5,2], reversed is [2,5,5], which matches output row 2.\n\nSo for example 2, output row 0 is input row 2, output row 2 is input row 0 reversed. Then output row 1 is [0,0,1]. Where does that come from? Input row 1 is [1,0,0]. So maybe the third element is 1, which is the first element of input row 1. The first two elements are 0, which are from input row 2. So maybe output row 1 is [input row 2's first two elements, input row 1's first element]. But that would be [0,0,1], which matches.\n\nSo this seems to fit. So for example 2, the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: input row 2\nRow 1: input row 2's first two elements, then input row 1's first element\nRow 2: input row 0 reversed.\n\nHmm. So maybe the pattern is that the output is:\n\nRow 0: input row 2\nRow 1: input row 2's first two elements, then input row 1's first element\nRow 2: input row 0 reversed.\n\nBut how does that fit with example 1?\n\nIn example 1, output row 0 is input row 2 reversed. Output row 2 is input row 0 reversed. So maybe the pattern is that the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: input row 2 reversed\nRow 1: input row 2's first two elements, then input row 1's first element\nRow 2: input row 0 reversed.\n\nBut that doesn't fit with example 2. Wait, example 2's output row 0 is input row 2. So maybe the pattern is different. Maybe the output rows are:\n\nRow 0: input row 2 reversed if some condition, or input row 2 otherwise?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input's rows in a certain way, with some transformations. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at example 1's output row 0: input row 2 reversed. Output row 2: input row 0 reversed. Output row 1: input row 1's middle element (7) in the middle, and then first and third elements from other rows.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Let's think of the output as a combination of the input's rows, but with some transformations.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is a rotation of the input. Let's try to think of possible rotations.\n\nFor example, if the input is rotated 180 degrees, then each row is reversed and the order of the rows is reversed. Let's check for example 1:\n\nOriginal input:\nRow 0: 3 3 8\nRow 1: 3 7 0\nRow 2: 5 0 0\n\nRotated 180 degrees would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 5 (original row 2 reversed)\nRow 1: 0 7 3 (original row 1 reversed)\nRow 2: 8 3 3 (original row 0 reversed)\n\nWhich matches the output of example 1. Because the output for example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 5 \u2192 original row 2 reversed\nRow 1: 0 7 3 \u2192 original row 1 reversed\nRow 2: 8 3 3 \u2192 original row 0 reversed\n\nSo that's exactly the output. So the output is the input rotated 180 degrees. Let's check example 2.\n\nExample 2 input:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 2\nRow 1: 1 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0\n\nRotated 180 degrees would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 (original row 2 reversed)\nRow 1: 0 0 1 (original row 1 reversed)\nRow 2: 2 5 5 (original row 0 reversed)\n\nWhich matches the output of example 2. The output for example 2 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 1\nRow 2: 2 5 5\n\nYes! So this seems to fit. So the transformation is to rotate the input grid 180 degrees. That is, each row is reversed, and the order of the rows is reversed.\n\nSo the steps to transform the input grid would be:\n\n- Reverse each row of the input grid.\n- Reverse the order of the rows.\n\nSo for example, the input grid is:\n\nOriginal rows: [row0, row1, row2]\nAfter reversing each row: [row0_reversed, row1_reversed, row2_reversed]\nThen reverse the order of the rows: [row2_reversed, row1_reversed, row0_reversed]\n\nWhich is exactly what the examples show.\n\nSo the function would take the input grid, reverse each row, then reverse the list of rows.\n\nLet me test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [3,3,8] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [8,3,3]\nRow 1: [3,7,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,7,3]\nRow 2: [5,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,5]\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows:\n\nRow 0 becomes [0,0,5] (original row 2 reversed)\nRow 1 becomes [0,7,3] (original row 1 reversed)\nRow 2 becomes [8,3,3] (original row 0 reversed)\n\nWhich matches the output of example 1.\n\nExample 2:\n\nOriginal input rows:\n\nRow 0: [5,5,2] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [2,5,5]\nRow 1: [1,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,1]\nRow 2: [0,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,0]\n\nReverse the order of the rows:\n\nRow 0 becomes [0,0,0] (original row 2 reversed)\nRow 1 becomes [0,0,1] (original row 1 reversed)\nRow 2 becomes [2,5,5] (original row 0 reversed)\n\nWhich matches the output of example 2.\n\nSo the transformation is to reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nTherefore, the Python function can be written as follows:\n\nTake the input grid, for each row, reverse it, then reverse the list of rows.\n\nSo, for example, in code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse each row\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    # Reverse the order of the rows\n    transformed = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return transformed\n\nTesting this with the examples:\n\nFor example 1, the input grid is:\n\n[\n [3,3,8],\n [3,7,0],\n [5,0,0]\n]\n\nreversed_rows would be:\n\n[\n [8,3,3],\n [0,7,3],\n [0,0,5]\n]\n\nthen reversed_rows[::-1] is:\n\n[\n [0,0,5],\n [0,7,3],\n [8,3,3]\n]\n\nWhich matches the output.\n\nSimilarly for example 2.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct transformation.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\n6 3 5\n6 8 0\n4 0 0\n\nApplying the same transformation:\n\nOriginal grid:\n\nRow 0: [6,3,5] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [5,3,6]\nRow 1: [6,8,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,8,6]\nRow 2: [4,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,4]\n\nReversed order of rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,0,4]\nRow 1: [0,8,6]\nRow 2: [5,3,6]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n[\n [0,0,4],\n [0,8,6],\n [5,3,6]\n]\n\nBut the test input is not part of the training examples, so the code should handle it correctly.\n\nTherefore, the code should be as above.\n"
