          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from the input to the output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 7x11. The input has a certain pattern of 2s and 0s. The output seems to have some changes. Let me compare row by row.\n\nLooking at the first row of Example 1's input and output: they are the same. The second row input is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2, and the output is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. Wait, so the second row of the output is different. Let me check the third row. Input is same as output. Fourth row input is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2, output is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. Hmm, so rows 2 and 4 are changing. Wait, but in the output, the second row is different. Maybe there's a pattern where certain rows are being modified.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. Comparing to the input's second row: 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the input's second row has 0s in positions 2, 4, 8, 10. The output's second row has 2s in positions 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10? Wait, maybe not. Let me write them out:\n\nInput row 2: [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\nOutput row 2: [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nSo the output row 2 has 2s in positions 0,1,2, then 0 at 3, then 2 at 4, 0 at 5, 2 at 6, 0 at 7, 2 at 8, 0 at 9, 2 at 10. Wait, but the original input's row 2 has 2s in positions 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10. The output row 2 has 2s in positions 0,1,2,4,6,8,10. So the difference is that in positions 1 and 3, the output has 2s where the input had 0s? Or maybe not. Wait, the input's row 2 has 0 at position 1 (second element). The output has 2 there. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being flipped.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern of flipping certain cells based on their position. Let me check other rows. For example, in Example 1, the output's sixth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The input's sixth row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So in the output, the first three elements are 2,0,2. The input's first three are 2,2,2. So the output's first element is same as input, but the second is 0 instead of 2. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some symmetry or pattern. Let me look at the output of Example 1 and compare to the input. The output seems to have some rows that are similar to the input but with some changes. For example, the second row in the output has more 2s in the first three positions. Maybe the pattern is that every other row is being modified in a certain way.\n\nLooking at Example 2 and 3, perhaps there's a pattern where certain rows are being altered. For example, in Example 2, the input and output have different rows. Let me check the first row of Example 2. The input is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2. The output is the same. The second row input is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2. The output is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the output's second row has 2s in positions 5 and 7 (original input had 0 there). So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being changed based on their row and column indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of checkerboard pattern, or flipping certain cells based on their position. Let me think about the positions. For example, in the input of Example 1, the output seems to have 2s in certain positions where the original had 0s. Maybe the transformation is that for certain positions, the value is flipped between 0 and 2. But how?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by applying a certain transformation to each cell. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's changed. Let me look for possible patterns.\n\nLooking at the input and output of Example 1. The output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The input's second row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the output's second row has 2s in positions 0,1,2,4,6,8,10. The input's second row has 2s in positions 0,2,4,5,6,8,10. So the difference is that in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. Wait, maybe the output is changing the cells where the column index is even or odd. Let me check.\n\nWait, for the second row in Example 1's input: columns 0-10. The original input has 0 at column 1, 3, 7, 9. The output has 2 at column 1, 3, 7, 9? No. Wait, the output's second row is [2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2]. So columns 0,1,2 are 2, then 0 at column 3, 2 at 4, 0 at 5, 2 at 6, 0 at 7, 2 at 8, 0 at 9, 2 at 10. So the positions where the output has 0 are columns 3,5,7,9. The input's second row had 0s at columns 1,3,7,9. So in the output, the 0s are at columns 3,5,7,9. So maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are being moved to certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for even rows, certain columns are being modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are being flipped. Let me look at the output of Example 1's second row. The original input's second row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The output is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three elements are 2,2,2. The original had 2,0,2. So the second element (column 1) is changed from 0 to 2. Then column 3 is 0 (same as original?), but original had 0 there. Wait, original had 0 in column 3. The output has 0 there. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that's consistent across all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2. The output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the output's second row has 2 in column 5 (original had 0), and 0 in column 7. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being changed based on their row and column indices.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 1, the output's sixth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The input's sixth row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the output has 0 in column 1 (original had 2), and 2 in column 5 (original had 0). So again, maybe certain positions are being flipped.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the cells in even columns are flipped. But I need to find a pattern that applies to all examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1's second row, the 0s are at positions 3,5,7,9. In the input, the 0s were at positions 1,3,7,9. So the 0s are shifted. Maybe the transformation is that in even rows, certain columns are being changed. Or maybe the pattern is that for rows with even indices, certain columns are being modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the cells in even columns are kept as is, and odd columns are flipped. But that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1's second row: columns 0,1,2 are 2,2,2. Original input's columns 0,1,2 were 2,0,2. So column 1 is changed from 0 to 2. Then column 3 is 0 (same as original), column 4 is 2 (same as original), column 5 is 0 (original had 2?), no, original input's second row was 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So column 5 (index 5) is 2. The output's second row has 0 in column 5. So that's a change. So this is getting confusing.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for certain positions (like columns 1, 5, 9), the values are being flipped. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of symmetry. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have some rows that are mirrored or rotated. But I need to see more examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the output's second row has 0s in columns 9 and 11 (assuming 0-based). Wait, maybe not. Let me check the exact positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every other row, certain columns are being changed. For example, in Example 1, the second row is modified, but the fourth row is also modified. In Example 2, the second row is modified, and others as well.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the cells at even positions (columns 0, 2, 4, etc.) are kept, and the odd positions are flipped. But this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped. For example, in Example 1's second row, column 1 is flipped from 0 to 2. Column 5 is flipped from 2 to 0. Column 9 is flipped from 0 to 2. Wait, but in the output of Example 1's second row, column 5 is 0. So that's a flip. Similarly, column 1 is 2, column 5 is 0, column 9 is 2. So maybe those columns are being toggled.\n\nBut how to determine which columns? Let me check other examples. In Example 2's second row, the input has 0 in column 5 (original input's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2). The output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So column 5 is 2 (original was 0). So that's a flip. So maybe columns 1, 5, 9 are being toggled. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped. Let me check. For example, in Example 1's second row, columns 1, 5, 9 are 0, 2, 0. Flipping them would give 2, 0, 2. Which matches the output's second row (columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2). So that's possible.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's second row: [2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2]. Columns 1 is 2, 5 is 0, 9 is 2. Which would be the flipped values of the original input's columns 1 (0), 5 (2), 9 (0). So yes, flipping them. That seems to fit.\n\nNow check the fourth row of Example 1's input and output. Input's fourth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. Output's fourth row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So columns 1,5,9 are 0, 2, 0. Flipping them gives 2, 0, 2. Which matches the output. So this seems to be a pattern.\n\nSo the hypothesis is that for each row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped (0 becomes 2 and vice versa). But wait, what about other rows? Let's check the sixth row of Example 1. Input's sixth row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. Output's sixth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. Flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output's sixth row has columns 1 as 0, 5 as 2, 9 as 2. Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, the output's sixth row is [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. So columns 1 is 0, 5 is 2, 9 is 2. So the original input's sixth row columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. Flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output's sixth row has 0, 2, 2. So that doesn't fit. Hmm, so this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nWait, maybe the columns are different. Maybe columns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9? Or maybe columns 1, 5, 9 are being flipped for certain rows. Or maybe the pattern is that for even rows, certain columns are flipped.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row is even. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1's second row (row index 1, which is odd?), but maybe the rows are 0-based. Let me think. Let's assume rows are 0-based. For example, in Example 1, the input has 7 rows. Let's check the second row (row index 1) and the sixth row (row index 5). \n\nFor row index 1 (second row), columns 1,5,9 are flipped. For row index 5 (sixth row), maybe those columns are not flipped. But the sixth row's output has columns 1,5,9 as 0, 2, 2. Original input's sixth row columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. So if they are flipped, they should be 0, 2, 0. But the output is 0, 2, 2. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern is not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped. For example, rows 1, 3, 5. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1, the second row (row 1) has columns 1,5,9 flipped. The fourth row (row 3) also has them flipped. The sixth row (row 5) has them flipped? Let's see the output of the sixth row. Original input's sixth row: [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. Output is [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. So columns 1,5,9 are 0, 2, 2. Original columns 1,5,9 were 2, 0, 2. So flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output has 0, 2, 2. So that's not matching. So maybe the pattern is not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row index is even. Let's check:\n\nRow 0 (first row): input and output are same. So no change. So maybe even rows are not modified. But for row 1 (second row), which is odd, columns 1,5,9 are flipped. For row 2 (third row), which is even, no change. So the output for row 2 is same as input. Which matches the example. For row 3 (fourth row), which is odd, columns 1,5,9 are flipped. Which matches. For row 5 (sixth row), which is odd, columns 1,5,9 are flipped. But the output for row 5 is [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. So columns 1 is 0 (original was 2), column 5 is 2 (original was 0), column 9 is 2 (original was 0). So flipping them would give 0, 2, 2. Which is the case. So this seems to fit.\n\nWait, original input's sixth row (row 5) columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. Flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output's sixth row has 0, 2, 2. So that's not matching. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal input's sixth row (row 5) is [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. So columns 1 is 2 (index 1), column 5 is 0 (index 5), column 9 is 0 (index 9). Wait, no. The row is 11 elements. Let me index them 0-10. So for the sixth row (row 5), the input is:\n\n[2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nSo column 1 is 2, column 5 is 0, column 9 is 0. So flipping them would give 0, 2, 2. Which matches the output's sixth row: [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. So columns 1 is 0, 5 is 2, 9 is 2. Yes, that's correct. So the pattern is that for rows with odd indices (row 1, 3, 5, etc.), the columns 1,5,9 are flipped. \n\nSo the hypothesis is: for each row, if the row index is odd, then flip the values in columns 1, 5, 9. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the output's sixth row is row 5 (0-based), which is odd. So columns 1,5,9 are flipped. That seems to fit. \n\nLet me check Example 2's input and output. Let's take the second row (row 1, which is odd). Input's second row is [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2]. The output's second row is [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. So columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. Flipping them gives 0, 2, 0. But the output's second row has columns 1 as 2, 5 as 2, 9 as 0. Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, original input's second row (row 1) columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. Flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output's second row for columns 1 is 2, column 5 is 2, column 9 is 0. So that's not matching. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is different. Maybe for rows with even indices, columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped. Or maybe the columns are different. Maybe columns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row is even. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1's second row (row index 1, which is odd), so no flip. But in the output, the second row has those columns flipped. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row is even. But then for Example 1's second row (row 1, odd), it's not flipped, but the output shows it is. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me check the output of Example 2's second row. The input's second row is [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2]. The output's second row is [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. So the columns 1,5,9 are 2, 2, 0. Original input's columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. So flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output's columns are 2, 2, 0. That doesn't fit. So perhaps the pattern is not based on row parity.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 1 and Example 2, maybe the transformation is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the column index is odd. Or maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row index is even.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the column index is even. Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row index is odd. Let me check for Example 2's second row (row index 1, odd). The input's columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. Flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output's columns are 2, 2, 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's second row: the 0s are at columns 3, 5, 7, 9. The input's second row had 0s at 1, 3, 7, 9. So the 0s are moving to columns 3,5,7,9. Maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the 0s are being shifted to certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells at even columns are kept, and odd columns are flipped. But that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row has 2s in columns 0,1,2,4,6,8,10. The input's second row had 2s in 0,2,4,5,6,8,10. So the difference is that column 1 and 3 are 2 in the output, but in the input, column 1 was 0 and column 3 was 0. So maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the cells in columns 1,3,5,7,9 are flipped.\n\nBut how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 are flipped. Let me check.\n\nFor Example 1's second row, columns 1,3,5,7,9 are 0, 0, 2, 0, 0. Flipping them would give 2, 2, 0, 2, 2. So the output's second row would have those columns as 2, 2, 0, 2, 2. But the output's second row has columns 1,3,5,7,9 as 2, 0, 0, 0, 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's think about the output of Example 1 and Example 2.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's second row is [2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2]. The input's second row is [2,0,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,2]. So the output's second row has 2s in columns 0,1,2,4,6,8,10. The input's second row has 2s in columns 0,2,4,5,6,8,10. So the difference is that in columns 1, 5, 9, the input has 0 and the output has 2. Wait, column 5 in input is 2, but in output it's 0. So that's a flip. So maybe the pattern is that for certain columns, the values are flipped.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped. Let me check for the second row in Example 1. Columns 1,5,9 are 0, 2, 0. Flipping them gives 2, 0, 2. Which matches the output. For the sixth row in Example 1, columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 0. Flipping gives 0, 2, 2. Which matches the output.\n\nFor Example 2's second row: input columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. Flipping gives 0, 2, 0. But the output's second row has columns 1,5,9 as 2, 2, 0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe this pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row is even. Let's see. For Example 1's second row (row index 1, odd), no flip. But the output shows it is flipped. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the column index is odd. But that would be columns 1,3,5,7,9. Which is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's look at the test input and see what the output would be. But the test input is not provided, so I can't do that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row is even. Let's try to see:\n\nFor Example 1's second row (row index 1, odd), no flip. But the output shows it is flipped. So that's not it.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the column index is even. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row index is even. Let's check for Example 1's first row (row 0, even). The input and output are the same. So no flip. That fits. For row 1 (odd), no flip. But in the output, it is flipped. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row index is odd. So for row 1, 3, 5, etc. Let's check Example 1's second row (row 1, odd). Flipping columns 1,5,9 gives the correct output. For row 5 (sixth row), which is odd, flipping gives the correct output. For Example 2's second row (row 1, odd), flipping columns 1,5,9 gives 0, 2, 0. But the output's second row has 2, 2, 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in analyzing Example 2's second row. Let me recheck.\n\nExample 2's input second row is [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2]. So columns 0-14 (since it's 15 elements). Wait, the input is 15 elements per row? But the output for Example 2 is 15 elements per row. But the original problem says that the output must be 7x11. Wait, no, the training examples are different. Let me check the input and output of Example 2.\n\nWait, the input for Example 2 is 7 rows, each with 15 elements. The output is also 7 rows with 15 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 7x11. So this suggests that the examples provided may be different. Wait, no. The problem says that the test input is 7x11, but the training examples have different dimensions. But the problem says that the function must produce a 7x11 output grid. So maybe the training examples are not 7x11, but the test input is. But the examples provided are for training, and the function must produce 7x11 for any input.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the function must produce a 7x11 output grid. The training examples may have different dimensions. For example, Example 1 has input and output as 7x11. Example 2 and 3 have input and output as 9x15? Or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the first example's input is given as 7 rows, each with 11 elements. Let me check:\n\nExample 1's input:\nEach line has 11 numbers. So 7 rows x 11 columns.\n\nExample 2's input:\nThe input has 9 rows, each with 15 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 7x11. So perhaps the training examples are not the same as the test input. But the function must produce a 7x11 grid for any input. So perhaps the training examples are not for the same task as the test input.\n\nThis suggests that the training examples may not be directly applicable to the test input. But the user provided the test input as part of the problem.\n\nBut the user says that the function must produce a 7x11 output grid, regardless of the input. So the function must take any input grid (possibly of any size) and return a 7x11 grid.\n\nBut the training examples may have different input and output dimensions. So perhaps the training examples are not directly applicable to the test input.\n\nBut the user says that the function should produce a 7x11 output grid. So perhaps the pattern is that the output is a 7x11 grid, and the transformation is applied to the input grid to produce this.\n\nBut how to determine the transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the input grid with certain cells flipped, and the output is always 7x11. So perhaps the transformation is to flip certain cells based on their position.\n\nBut without seeing the test output, it's hard to know. But the user says to focus on the training examples.\n\nLet me try to think of another approach. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern. For example, the output has a certain pattern of 2s and 0s that repeats in certain ways. Maybe it's a pattern where certain rows are mirrored or have certain symmetries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain patterns in the input with others. For example, in Example 1's input, the output has a pattern where the second row has 2s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the cells at even positions are kept, and odd positions are flipped. But that would be for columns.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, perhaps the best approach is to implement the hypothesis that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row is odd.\n\nEven though it doesn't fit all examples, it fits some, and perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis of Example 2.\n\nLet me recheck Example 2's second row. The input is:\n\nInput row 2 (second row) for Example 2 is:\n\n2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2\n\nWhich is 15 elements. So columns 0-14. The output's second row is:\n\n2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\n\nSo columns 1,5,9 are 2, 2, 2. Original input's columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. So flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output's columns 1,5,9 are 2, 2, 2. So this doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that for each row, the cells at columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row index is even. Let's check.\n\nFor Example 1's first row (row 0, even), no change. For row 1 (odd), no change. But the output's second row is changed, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern in the rows.\n\nThe output of Example 1 has the following rows:\n\nRow 0: same as input.\n\nRow 1: changed.\n\nRow 2: same as input.\n\nRow 3: changed.\n\nRow 4: same as input.\n\nRow 5: changed.\n\nRow 6: same as input.\n\nSo the pattern is that rows 1, 3, 5 are modified. These are the odd rows (0-based). So maybe for odd rows, certain columns are flipped.\n\nIn Example 1's row 1, the columns 1,5,9 are flipped.\n\nIn row 3, the same.\n\nIn row 5, the same.\n\nBut in Example 2's row 1, this doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern is that for odd rows, columns 1,5,9 are flipped.\n\nBut why does it fit for Example 1 but not for Example 2?\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in my analysis of Example 2's output. Let me recheck.\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\nInput row 1 (second row) is:\n\n2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2\n\nOutput row 1 is:\n\n2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\n\nSo the output row 1 has columns 1,5,9 as 2, 2, 0. Original input's columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. So flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output has 2, 2, 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the columns are not 1,5,9 but 1, 3, 5, 7, 9? Let me check.\n\nFor Example 1's row 1, columns 1,3,5,7,9 are 0, 0, 2, 0, 0. Flipping them would give 2, 2, 0, 2, 2. But the output's row 1 has columns 1,3,5,7,9 as 2, 0, 0, 0, 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for odd rows, columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped, but in Example 2's row 1, the columns 5 is flipped from 0 to 2, and column 9 is flipped from 2 to 0. So that would mean that in the input, column 5 is 0 and column 9 is 2. Flipping them gives 2 and 0. So the output has 2 in column 5 and 0 in column 9. Which matches. But the input's column 1 is 2, so flipping it would give 0. But the output's column 1 is 2. So this doesn't fit. So this is confusing.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for odd rows, columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped, but in Example 2's row 1, the input's column 1 is 2, and the output's column 1 is 2. So it's not flipped. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples that do fit. The pattern that seems to work for Example 1 is that for odd rows, columns 1,5,9 are flipped. Even though it doesn't fit Example 2, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis of Example 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the column index is odd. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row is even. But this also doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide a solution, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for odd rows, columns 1,5,9 are flipped. This seems to fit Example 1 and possibly others, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- if the row index is odd (1-based?), or 0-based, let's assume 0-based.\n\n- for each column in 1,5,9:\n\n- if the value is 0, set to 2, else 2 to 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, in Python, for each row in the grid:\n\nfor i in range(7):\n\n    for j in [1, 5, 9]:\n\n        if grid[i][j] == 0:\n\n            grid[i][j] = 2\n\n        else:\n\n            grid[i][j] = 0\n\nBut wait, this would flip the values in those columns for odd rows. But how to determine which rows.\n\nWait, in Example 1, rows 1, 3, 5 (0-based) are odd, so they are modified. Let's implement this.\n\nBut the output must be 7x11. So the code would take the input grid, and for each row, if it is odd (0-based), then flip columns 1,5,9.\n\nThis would produce a 7x11 grid, as required.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(7):\n        for j in [1, 5, 9]:\n            if i % 2 == 1:  # if the row is odd (0-based)\n                transformed[i][j] = 2 - transformed[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the second row (i=1) is odd, so columns 1,5,9 are flipped. This would work for that. For the sixth row (i=5, which is odd), it would flip those columns.\n\nBut in Example 2's second row (i=1, odd), the columns 1,5,9 are flipped. Let's see what the input's second row is. For example, if the input's second row has 2 in column 1, then it would be flipped to 0. But in the output of Example 2's second row, column 1 is 2. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing Example 2. Let me recheck.\n\nExample 2's input second row is:\n\n2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2\n\nWait, this is 15 elements, but the output is 15 elements. But the function must return a 7x11 grid. So perhaps the training examples are not for the same task as the test input. But the user says that the test input is 7x11, so the function must produce a 7x11 grid.\n\nBut the training examples have different dimensions. So perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row is odd. This would work for the examples where it fits.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with this code, even if it doesn't fit all examples. It's the best I can do based on the available information.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from the input to the output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 7x11. The input has a certain pattern of 2s and 0s. The output seems to have some changes. Let me compare row by row.\n\nLooking at the first row of Example 1's input and output: they are the same. The second row input is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2, and the output is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. Wait, so the second row of the output is different. Let me check the third row. Input is same as output. Fourth row input is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2, output is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. Hmm, so rows 2 and 4 are changing. Wait, but in the output, the second row is different. Maybe there's a pattern where certain rows are being modified.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. Comparing to the input's second row: 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the input's second row has 0s in positions 2, 4, 8, 10. The output's second row has 2s in positions 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10? Wait, maybe not. Let me write them out:\n\nInput row 2: [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\nOutput row 2: [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nSo the output row 2 has 2s in positions 0,1,2, then 0 at 3, then 2 at 4, 0 at 5, 2 at 6, 0 at 7, 2 at 8, 0 at 9, 2 at 10. Wait, but the original input's row 2 has 2s in positions 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10. The output row 2 has 2s in positions 0,1,2,4,6,8,10. So the difference is that in positions 1 and 3, the output has 2s where the input had 0s? Or maybe not. Wait, the input's row 2 has 0 at position 1 (second element). The output has 2 there. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being flipped.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern of flipping certain cells based on their position. Let me check other rows. For example, in Example 1, the output's sixth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The input's sixth row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So in the output, the first three elements are 2,0,2. The input's first three are 2,2,2. So the output's first element is same as input, but the second is 0 instead of 2. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some symmetry or pattern. Let me look at the output of Example 1 and compare to the input. The output seems to have some rows that are similar to the input but with some changes. For example, the second row in the output has more 2s in the first three positions. Maybe the pattern is that every other row is being modified in a certain way.\n\nLooking at Example 2 and 3, perhaps there's a pattern where certain rows are being altered. For example, in Example 2, the input and output have different rows. Let me check the first row of Example 2. The input is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2. The output is the same. The second row input is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2. The output is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the output's second row has 2s in positions 5 and 7 (original input had 0 there). So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being changed based on their row and column indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of checkerboard pattern, or flipping certain cells based on their position. Let me think about the positions. For example, in the input of Example 1, the output seems to have 2s in certain positions where the original had 0s. Maybe the transformation is that for certain positions, the value is flipped between 0 and 2. But how?\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by applying a certain transformation to each cell. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's changed. Let me look for possible patterns.\n\nLooking at the input and output of Example 1. The output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The input's second row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the output's second row has 2s in positions 0,1,2,4,6,8,10. The input's second row has 2s in positions 0,2,4,5,6,8,10. So the difference is that in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc. Wait, maybe the output is changing the cells where the column index is even or odd. Let me check.\n\nWait, for the second row in Example 1's input: columns 0-10. The original input has 0 at column 1, 3, 7, 9. The output has 2 at column 1, 3, 7, 9? No. Wait, the output's second row is [2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2]. So columns 0,1,2 are 2, then 0 at column 3, 2 at 4, 0 at 5, 2 at 6, 0 at 7, 2 at 8, 0 at 9, 2 at 10. So the positions where the output has 0 are columns 3,5,7,9. The input's second row had 0s at columns 1,3,7,9. So in the output, the 0s are at columns 3,5,7,9. So maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are being moved to certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for even rows, certain columns are being modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain positions are being flipped. Let me look at the output of Example 1's second row. The original input's second row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The output is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three elements are 2,2,2. The original had 2,0,2. So the second element (column 1) is changed from 0 to 2. Then column 3 is 0 (same as original?), but original had 0 there. Wait, original had 0 in column 3. The output has 0 there. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that's consistent across all examples.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2. The output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the output's second row has 2 in column 5 (original had 0), and 0 in column 7. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being changed based on their row and column indices.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 1, the output's sixth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The input's sixth row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the output has 0 in column 1 (original had 2), and 2 in column 5 (original had 0). So again, maybe certain positions are being flipped.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the cells in even columns are flipped. But I need to find a pattern that applies to all examples.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1's second row, the 0s are at positions 3,5,7,9. In the input, the 0s were at positions 1,3,7,9. So the 0s are shifted. Maybe the transformation is that in even rows, certain columns are being changed. Or maybe the pattern is that for rows with even indices, certain columns are being modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the cells in even columns are kept as is, and odd columns are flipped. But that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1's second row: columns 0,1,2 are 2,2,2. Original input's columns 0,1,2 were 2,0,2. So column 1 is changed from 0 to 2. Then column 3 is 0 (same as original), column 4 is 2 (same as original), column 5 is 0 (original had 2?), no, original input's second row was 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So column 5 (index 5) is 2. The output's second row has 0 in column 5. So that's a change. So this is getting confusing.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for certain positions (like columns 1, 5, 9), the values are being flipped. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of symmetry. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have some rows that are mirrored or rotated. But I need to see more examples.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the output's second row has 0s in columns 9 and 11 (assuming 0-based). Wait, maybe not. Let me check the exact positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every other row, certain columns are being changed. For example, in Example 1, the second row is modified, but the fourth row is also modified. In Example 2, the second row is modified, and others as well.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the cells at even positions (columns 0, 2, 4, etc.) are kept, and the odd positions are flipped. But this might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped. For example, in Example 1's second row, column 1 is flipped from 0 to 2. Column 5 is flipped from 2 to 0. Column 9 is flipped from 0 to 2. Wait, but in the output of Example 1's second row, column 5 is 0. So that's a flip. Similarly, column 1 is 2, column 5 is 0, column 9 is 2. So maybe those columns are being toggled.\n\nBut how to determine which columns? Let me check other examples. In Example 2's second row, the input has 0 in column 5 (original input's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2). The output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So column 5 is 2 (original was 0). So that's a flip. So maybe columns 1, 5, 9 are being toggled. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped. Let me check. For example, in Example 1's second row, columns 1, 5, 9 are 0, 2, 0. Flipping them would give 2, 0, 2. Which matches the output's second row (columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2). So that's possible.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's second row: [2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2]. Columns 1 is 2, 5 is 0, 9 is 2. Which would be the flipped values of the original input's columns 1 (0), 5 (2), 9 (0). So yes, flipping them. That seems to fit.\n\nNow check the fourth row of Example 1's input and output. Input's fourth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. Output's fourth row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So columns 1,5,9 are 0, 2, 0. Flipping them gives 2, 0, 2. Which matches the output. So this seems to be a pattern.\n\nSo the hypothesis is that for each row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped (0 becomes 2 and vice versa). But wait, what about other rows? Let's check the sixth row of Example 1. Input's sixth row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. Output's sixth row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. Flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output's sixth row has columns 1 as 0, 5 as 2, 9 as 2. Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, the output's sixth row is [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. So columns 1 is 0, 5 is 2, 9 is 2. So the original input's sixth row columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. Flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output's sixth row has 0, 2, 2. So that doesn't fit. Hmm, so this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nWait, maybe the columns are different. Maybe columns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9? Or maybe columns 1, 5, 9 are being flipped for certain rows. Or maybe the pattern is that for even rows, certain columns are flipped.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row is even. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1's second row (row index 1, which is odd?), but maybe the rows are 0-based. Let me think. Let's assume rows are 0-based. For example, in Example 1, the input has 7 rows. Let's check the second row (row index 1) and the sixth row (row index 5). \n\nFor row index 1 (second row), columns 1,5,9 are flipped. For row index 5 (sixth row), maybe those columns are not flipped. But the sixth row's output has columns 1,5,9 as 0, 2, 2. Original input's sixth row columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. So if they are flipped, they should be 0, 2, 0. But the output is 0, 2, 2. So that doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern is not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped. For example, rows 1, 3, 5. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1, the second row (row 1) has columns 1,5,9 flipped. The fourth row (row 3) also has them flipped. The sixth row (row 5) has them flipped? Let's see the output of the sixth row. Original input's sixth row: [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. Output is [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. So columns 1,5,9 are 0, 2, 2. Original columns 1,5,9 were 2, 0, 2. So flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output has 0, 2, 2. So that's not matching. So maybe the pattern is not that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row index is even. Let's check:\n\nRow 0 (first row): input and output are same. So no change. So maybe even rows are not modified. But for row 1 (second row), which is odd, columns 1,5,9 are flipped. For row 2 (third row), which is even, no change. So the output for row 2 is same as input. Which matches the example. For row 3 (fourth row), which is odd, columns 1,5,9 are flipped. Which matches. For row 5 (sixth row), which is odd, columns 1,5,9 are flipped. But the output for row 5 is [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. So columns 1 is 0 (original was 2), column 5 is 2 (original was 0), column 9 is 2 (original was 0). So flipping them would give 0, 2, 2. Which is the case. So this seems to fit.\n\nWait, original input's sixth row (row 5) columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. Flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output's sixth row has 0, 2, 2. So that's not matching. Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recheck.\n\nOriginal input's sixth row (row 5) is [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. So columns 1 is 2 (index 1), column 5 is 0 (index 5), column 9 is 0 (index 9). Wait, no. The row is 11 elements. Let me index them 0-10. So for the sixth row (row 5), the input is:\n\n[2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nSo column 1 is 2, column 5 is 0, column 9 is 0. So flipping them would give 0, 2, 2. Which matches the output's sixth row: [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. So columns 1 is 0, 5 is 2, 9 is 2. Yes, that's correct. So the pattern is that for rows with odd indices (row 1, 3, 5, etc.), the columns 1,5,9 are flipped. \n\nSo the hypothesis is: for each row, if the row index is odd, then flip the values in columns 1, 5, 9. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the output's sixth row is row 5 (0-based), which is odd. So columns 1,5,9 are flipped. That seems to fit. \n\nLet me check Example 2's input and output. Let's take the second row (row 1, which is odd). Input's second row is [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2]. The output's second row is [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. So columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. Flipping them gives 0, 2, 0. But the output's second row has columns 1 as 2, 5 as 2, 9 as 0. Wait, that doesn't fit. Wait, original input's second row (row 1) columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. Flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output's second row for columns 1 is 2, column 5 is 2, column 9 is 0. So that's not matching. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the pattern is different. Maybe for rows with even indices, columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped. Or maybe the columns are different. Maybe columns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row is even. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1's second row (row index 1, which is odd), so no flip. But in the output, the second row has those columns flipped. So that contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row is even. But then for Example 1's second row (row 1, odd), it's not flipped, but the output shows it is. So that can't be.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me check the output of Example 2's second row. The input's second row is [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2]. The output's second row is [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. So the columns 1,5,9 are 2, 2, 0. Original input's columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. So flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output's columns are 2, 2, 0. That doesn't fit. So perhaps the pattern is not based on row parity.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 1 and Example 2, maybe the transformation is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the column index is odd. Or maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row index is even.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the column index is even. Or something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row index is odd. Let me check for Example 2's second row (row index 1, odd). The input's columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. Flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output's columns are 2, 2, 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's second row: the 0s are at columns 3, 5, 7, 9. The input's second row had 0s at 1, 3, 7, 9. So the 0s are moving to columns 3,5,7,9. Maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the 0s are being shifted to certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells at even columns are kept, and odd columns are flipped. But that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row has 2s in columns 0,1,2,4,6,8,10. The input's second row had 2s in 0,2,4,5,6,8,10. So the difference is that column 1 and 3 are 2 in the output, but in the input, column 1 was 0 and column 3 was 0. So maybe the pattern is that for certain rows, the cells in columns 1,3,5,7,9 are flipped.\n\nBut how to determine which rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 are flipped. Let me check.\n\nFor Example 1's second row, columns 1,3,5,7,9 are 0, 0, 2, 0, 0. Flipping them would give 2, 2, 0, 2, 2. So the output's second row would have those columns as 2, 2, 0, 2, 2. But the output's second row has columns 1,3,5,7,9 as 2, 0, 0, 0, 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's think about the output of Example 1 and Example 2.\n\nIn Example 1, the output's second row is [2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2]. The input's second row is [2,0,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,2]. So the output's second row has 2s in columns 0,1,2,4,6,8,10. The input's second row has 2s in columns 0,2,4,5,6,8,10. So the difference is that in columns 1, 5, 9, the input has 0 and the output has 2. Wait, column 5 in input is 2, but in output it's 0. So that's a flip. So maybe the pattern is that for certain columns, the values are flipped.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped. Let me check for the second row in Example 1. Columns 1,5,9 are 0, 2, 0. Flipping them gives 2, 0, 2. Which matches the output. For the sixth row in Example 1, columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 0. Flipping gives 0, 2, 2. Which matches the output.\n\nFor Example 2's second row: input columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. Flipping gives 0, 2, 0. But the output's second row has columns 1,5,9 as 2, 2, 0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm. Maybe this pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row is even. Let's see. For Example 1's second row (row index 1, odd), no flip. But the output shows it is flipped. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the column index is odd. But that would be columns 1,3,5,7,9. Which is not the case.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's look at the test input and see what the output would be. But the test input is not provided, so I can't do that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row is even. Let's try to see:\n\nFor Example 1's second row (row index 1, odd), no flip. But the output shows it is flipped. So that's not it.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the column index is even. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row index is even. Let's check for Example 1's first row (row 0, even). The input and output are the same. So no flip. That fits. For row 1 (odd), no flip. But in the output, it is flipped. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row index is odd. So for row 1, 3, 5, etc. Let's check Example 1's second row (row 1, odd). Flipping columns 1,5,9 gives the correct output. For row 5 (sixth row), which is odd, flipping gives the correct output. For Example 2's second row (row 1, odd), flipping columns 1,5,9 gives 0, 2, 0. But the output's second row has 2, 2, 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in analyzing Example 2's second row. Let me recheck.\n\nExample 2's input second row is [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2]. So columns 0-14 (since it's 15 elements). Wait, the input is 15 elements per row? But the output for Example 2 is 15 elements per row. But the original problem says that the output must be 7x11. Wait, no, the training examples are different. Let me check the input and output of Example 2.\n\nWait, the input for Example 2 is 7 rows, each with 15 elements. The output is also 7 rows with 15 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 7x11. So this suggests that the examples provided may be different. Wait, no. The problem says that the test input is 7x11, but the training examples have different dimensions. But the problem says that the function must produce a 7x11 output grid. So maybe the training examples are not 7x11, but the test input is. But the examples provided are for training, and the function must produce 7x11 for any input.\n\nThis is confusing. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says that the function must produce a 7x11 output grid. The training examples may have different dimensions. For example, Example 1 has input and output as 7x11. Example 2 and 3 have input and output as 9x15? Or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, the first example's input is given as 7 rows, each with 11 elements. Let me check:\n\nExample 1's input:\nEach line has 11 numbers. So 7 rows x 11 columns.\n\nExample 2's input:\nThe input has 9 rows, each with 15 elements. But the problem says that the output must be 7x11. So perhaps the training examples are not the same as the test input. But the function must produce a 7x11 grid for any input. So perhaps the training examples are not for the same task as the test input.\n\nThis suggests that the training examples may not be directly applicable to the test input. But the user provided the test input as part of the problem.\n\nBut the user says that the function must produce a 7x11 output grid, regardless of the input. So the function must take any input grid (possibly of any size) and return a 7x11 grid.\n\nBut the training examples may have different input and output dimensions. So perhaps the training examples are not directly applicable to the test input.\n\nBut the user says that the function should produce a 7x11 output grid. So perhaps the pattern is that the output is a 7x11 grid, and the transformation is applied to the input grid to produce this.\n\nBut how to determine the transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the input grid with certain cells flipped, and the output is always 7x11. So perhaps the transformation is to flip certain cells based on their position.\n\nBut without seeing the test output, it's hard to know. But the user says to focus on the training examples.\n\nLet me try to think of another approach. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern. For example, the output has a certain pattern of 2s and 0s that repeats in certain ways. Maybe it's a pattern where certain rows are mirrored or have certain symmetries.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain patterns in the input with others. For example, in Example 1's input, the output has a pattern where the second row has 2s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each row, the cells at even positions are kept, and odd positions are flipped. But that would be for columns.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, perhaps the best approach is to implement the hypothesis that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row is odd.\n\nEven though it doesn't fit all examples, it fits some, and perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis of Example 2.\n\nLet me recheck Example 2's second row. The input is:\n\nInput row 2 (second row) for Example 2 is:\n\n2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2\n\nWhich is 15 elements. So columns 0-14. The output's second row is:\n\n2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\n\nSo columns 1,5,9 are 2, 2, 2. Original input's columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. So flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output's columns 1,5,9 are 2, 2, 2. So this doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. Maybe the pattern is that for each row, the cells at columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row index is even. Let's check.\n\nFor Example 1's first row (row 0, even), no change. For row 1 (odd), no change. But the output's second row is changed, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for a different approach. Let's look at the output of Example 1 and see if there's a pattern in the rows.\n\nThe output of Example 1 has the following rows:\n\nRow 0: same as input.\n\nRow 1: changed.\n\nRow 2: same as input.\n\nRow 3: changed.\n\nRow 4: same as input.\n\nRow 5: changed.\n\nRow 6: same as input.\n\nSo the pattern is that rows 1, 3, 5 are modified. These are the odd rows (0-based). So maybe for odd rows, certain columns are flipped.\n\nIn Example 1's row 1, the columns 1,5,9 are flipped.\n\nIn row 3, the same.\n\nIn row 5, the same.\n\nBut in Example 2's row 1, this doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern is that for odd rows, columns 1,5,9 are flipped.\n\nBut why does it fit for Example 1 but not for Example 2?\n\nMaybe there's a mistake in my analysis of Example 2's output. Let me recheck.\n\nExample 2's input is:\n\nInput row 1 (second row) is:\n\n2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2\n\nOutput row 1 is:\n\n2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\n\nSo the output row 1 has columns 1,5,9 as 2, 2, 0. Original input's columns 1,5,9 are 2, 0, 2. So flipping them would give 0, 2, 0. But the output has 2, 2, 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe the columns are not 1,5,9 but 1, 3, 5, 7, 9? Let me check.\n\nFor Example 1's row 1, columns 1,3,5,7,9 are 0, 0, 2, 0, 0. Flipping them would give 2, 2, 0, 2, 2. But the output's row 1 has columns 1,3,5,7,9 as 2, 0, 0, 0, 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for odd rows, columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped, but in Example 2's row 1, the columns 5 is flipped from 0 to 2, and column 9 is flipped from 2 to 0. So that would mean that in the input, column 5 is 0 and column 9 is 2. Flipping them gives 2 and 0. So the output has 2 in column 5 and 0 in column 9. Which matches. But the input's column 1 is 2, so flipping it would give 0. But the output's column 1 is 2. So this doesn't fit. So this is confusing.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for odd rows, columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped, but in Example 2's row 1, the input's column 1 is 2, and the output's column 1 is 2. So it's not flipped. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples that do fit. The pattern that seems to work for Example 1 is that for odd rows, columns 1,5,9 are flipped. Even though it doesn't fit Example 2, perhaps there's a mistake in my analysis of Example 2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the column index is odd. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for every row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row is even. But this also doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide a solution, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for odd rows, columns 1,5,9 are flipped. This seems to fit Example 1 and possibly others, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n\n- if the row index is odd (1-based?), or 0-based, let's assume 0-based.\n\n- for each column in 1,5,9:\n\n- if the value is 0, set to 2, else 2 to 0.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, in Python, for each row in the grid:\n\nfor i in range(7):\n\n    for j in [1, 5, 9]:\n\n        if grid[i][j] == 0:\n\n            grid[i][j] = 2\n\n        else:\n\n            grid[i][j] = 0\n\nBut wait, this would flip the values in those columns for odd rows. But how to determine which rows.\n\nWait, in Example 1, rows 1, 3, 5 (0-based) are odd, so they are modified. Let's implement this.\n\nBut the output must be 7x11. So the code would take the input grid, and for each row, if it is odd (0-based), then flip columns 1,5,9.\n\nThis would produce a 7x11 grid, as required.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(7):\n        for j in [1, 5, 9]:\n            if i % 2 == 1:  # if the row is odd (0-based)\n                transformed[i][j] = 2 - transformed[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the second row (i=1) is odd, so columns 1,5,9 are flipped. This would work for that. For the sixth row (i=5, which is odd), it would flip those columns.\n\nBut in Example 2's second row (i=1, odd), the columns 1,5,9 are flipped. Let's see what the input's second row is. For example, if the input's second row has 2 in column 1, then it would be flipped to 0. But in the output of Example 2's second row, column 1 is 2. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing Example 2. Let me recheck.\n\nExample 2's input second row is:\n\n2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2\n\nWait, this is 15 elements, but the output is 15 elements. But the function must return a 7x11 grid. So perhaps the training examples are not for the same task as the test input. But the user says that the test input is 7x11, so the function must produce a 7x11 grid.\n\nBut the training examples have different dimensions. So perhaps the pattern is that for each row, the cells in columns 1, 5, 9 are flipped if the row is odd. This would work for the examples where it fits.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with this code, even if it doesn't fit all examples. It's the best I can do based on the available information.\n"
