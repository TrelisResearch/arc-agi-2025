Create a border of 8s around the grid\n2. Fill the interior with 0s\n3. The output size matches the input size\n\nLet me verify this:\n- All inputs are filled with 0s\n- All outputs have 8s on the perimeter/border\n- All outputs have 0s in the interior\n\nActually, let me recheck the dimensions:\n- Example 1: 3\u00d73 \u2192 3\u00d73 \u2713\n- Example 2: 4\u00d74 \u2192 3\u00d73 (This doesn't match!)\n- Example 3: 5\u00d75 \u2192 4\u00d74 (This doesn't match!)\n- Example 4: 6\u00d76 \u2192 6\u00d76 \u2713\n\nWait, I need to look more carefully. The problem statement says \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\" This is a key constraint!\n\nSo regardless of input size, I should always output a 3\u00d73 grid.\n\nLooking again:\n- Example 1: 3\u00d73 input \u2192 3\u00d73 output with border of 8s\n- Example 2: 4\u00d74 input \u2192 3\u00d73 output with border of 8s  \n- Example 3: 5\u00d75 input \u2192 4\u00d74 output... but I must produce 3\u00d73\n\nLet me re-read... Actually the requirement is that I produce a 3\u00d73 output, but the examples show different output sizes. Let me follow the requirement to always produce 3\u00d73.\n\nThe pattern for a 3\u00d73 output seems to be:\n- Create a 3\u00d73 grid\n- Set border cells to 8\n- Set center cell to 0\n\nThis matches Example 1 perfectly. For other examples, maybe the rule is the same - always create the same 3\u00d73 pattern regardless of input.\n\nLet me check if there's a different pattern:\n- Example 2 output is 3\u00d73 with 8s on border, 0 in positions (1,1) and (2,1) - not just center\n- Example 3 output is 4\u00d74 - but I must output 3\u00d73\n\nI think the key insight is that the output is always the same 3\u00d73 pattern: border of 8s with 0s inside, but looking more carefully at example 2, it has 8s on the border but 0 at positions (1,1) and (2,1).\n\nLet me reconsider what the consistent pattern is for producing a 3\u00d73 output:\n\nActually, re-reading the problem: \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\" \n\nSo I should ignore the shown output dimensions and always produce 3\u00d73.\n\nLooking at Example 1 (which is already 3\u00d73):\nOutput pattern:\n```\n8 8 8\n8 0 8  \n8 8 8\n```\n\nThis looks like a consistent pattern: border of 8s, interior 0s.\n\nLet me assume this is the transformation rule:\n1. Always produce a 3\u00d73 grid\n2. Set all border cells to 8\n3. Set all interior cells to 0\n\nFor a 3\u00d73 grid, only the center cell (1,1) is interior.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Always create a 3x3 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[8 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Set interior cells to 0\n    # For a 3x3 grid, only the center cell is interior\n    transformed_grid[1][1] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The border (outermost cells) of the output grid is filled with 8s\n3.

Looking at the actual outputs:\n- Example 1 (3\u00d73): All border cells are 8, only center cell is 0\n- Example 2 (4\u00d74): All border cells are 8, inner 2\u00d72 has 0s but the pattern shows 8 0 8 in the middle rows\n- Actually, let me look more carefully at the outputs...\n\nLooking at the outputs again:\n- Example 1 (3\u00d73): \n  ```\n  8 8 8\n  8 0 8  \n  8 8 8\n  ```\n- Example 2 (4\u00d74):\n  ```\n  8 8 8 8\n  8 0 0 8\n  8 0 0 8  \n  8 8 8 8\n  ```\n\nNo, that's not right either. Let me re-read the examples carefully...\n\nExample 2 shows a 4\u00d74 input but the output is 3\u00d73? Let me check again.\n\nActually, looking more carefully:\n- Example 1: 3\u00d73 input \u2192 3\u00d73 output (border 8s, center 0)\n- Example 2: 4\u00d74 input \u2192 3\u00d73 output \n- Example 3: 5\u00d75 input \u2192 4\u00d74 output\n- Example 4: 6\u00d76 input \u2192 6\u00d76 output\n\nWait, the instruction says \"Your transformation must always produce a 3\u00d73 output grid.\" This is a key constraint!\n\nSo regardless of input size, I need to produce a 3\u00d73 output. Let me re-analyze:\n\nLooking at the pattern:\n- The output is always a 3\u00d73 grid\n- The border (first and last rows/columns) is filled with 8s\n- The center cell is 0\n- The middle cells of edges seem to follow a pattern\n\nLooking at example 1 (3\u00d73 input \u2192 3\u00d73 output):\n```\n8 8 8\n8 0 8\n8 8 8\n```\n\nThis looks like a standard border pattern.
