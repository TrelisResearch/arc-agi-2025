          "Analyzing the examples:\n\n- Input and output grids are always size 5x11.\n- Two non-zero integers appear on the same row in input (one near left, one near right).\n- In output, the row containing these two numbers is expanded into a \u201cbar\u201d:\n  - The left number is repeated from the start of the row up to column 4 inclusive (positions 0 to 4).\n  - Column 5 is set to 5.\n  - The right number is repeated from column 6 to column 10 inclusive.\n- All other rows remain unchanged.\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Input row 1: positions 0 = 1, position 10 = 2\n- Output row 1: 1 1 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2\n\nIn Example 2:\n- Input row 3: positions 0 = 3, position 10 = 7\n- Output row 3: 3 3 3 3 3 5 7 7 7 7 7\n\nConclusion:\n- Find the row(s) which contain two colored values at positions 0 and 10.\n- In the output, overwrite that row to: [left_color]*5 + [5] + [right_color]*5.\n- All other cells remain as input.\n\nFor the test input:\n- There are actually two such rows:\n  - Row 1: 4 ... 8\n  - Row 4: 6 ... 9\n- Since the training examples only show one such row with transformed bar, I\u2019ll apply this for each row that meets the condition (non-zero at col 0 and col 10).\n\nIf no row has both sides filled, output remains input grid unchanged.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create output as a copy of input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for r in range(len(grid)):\n        left = grid[r][0]\n        right = grid[r][10]\n        # If both ends non-zero, transform the row into bar pattern\n        if left != 0 and right != 0:\n            transformed_grid[r] = [left]*5 + [5] + [right]*5\n    return transformed_grid\n```"

            "text": "You are solving an ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) task. \nI will show you training examples with input and output grids, plus a test input grid. Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 5\u00d711 output grid.**\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n1 1 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 3 3 3 3 5 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

              "Analyzing the examples:\n\n- Input and output grids are always size 5x11.\n- Two non-zero integers appear on the same row in input (one near left, one near right).\n- In output, the row containing these two numbers is expanded into a \u201cbar\u201d:\n  - The left number is repeated from the start of the row up to column 4 inclusive (positions 0 to 4).\n  - Column 5 is set to 5.\n  - The right number is repeated from column 6 to column 10 inclusive.\n- All other rows remain unchanged.\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Input row 1: positions 0 = 1, position 10 = 2\n- Output row 1: 1 1 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2\n\nIn Example 2:\n- Input row 3: positions 0 = 3, position 10 = 7\n- Output row 3: 3 3 3 3 3 5 7 7 7 7 7\n\nConclusion:\n- Find the row(s) which contain two colored values at positions 0 and 10.\n- In the output, overwrite that row to: [left_color]*5 + [5] + [right_color]*5.\n- All other cells remain as input.\n\nFor the test input:\n- There are actually two such rows:\n  - Row 1: 4 ... 8\n  - Row 4: 6 ... 9\n- Since the training examples only show one such row with transformed bar, I\u2019ll apply this for each row that meets the condition (non-zero at col 0 and col 10).\n\nIf no row has both sides filled, output remains input grid unchanged.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create output as a copy of input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for r in range(len(grid)):\n        left = grid[r][0]\n        right = grid[r][10]\n        # If both ends non-zero, transform the row into bar pattern\n        if left != 0 and right != 0:\n            transformed_grid[r] = [left]*5 + [5] + [right]*5\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
