          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 10x10 grid of numbers, and the output is another 10x10 grid. The task is to find a transformation that maps input to output. Let me compare some elements.\n\nLooking at the first row of Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput first row: 3 1 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 3\nOutput first row: 3 1 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 3\n\nHmm, the first element is 3 in both. The second is 1 in both. The third is 0 in input, 2 in output. Then the fourth is 3, same. The ninth element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The rest are same. So maybe the third and ninth elements are being modified. But why?\n\nLooking at other rows. Let's check the third row of input and output:\n\nInput third row: 0 1 1 1 0 3 0 0 0 3\nOutput third row: 2 1 1 1 5 3 2 2 2 3\n\nSo the first element is 0 \u2192 2, fifth is 0 \u21925, and the seventh is 0\u21922, eighth 0\u21922, ninth 0\u21922. So maybe some kind of replacement based on neighboring cells?\n\nAlternatively, maybe some kind of transformation where certain positions are replaced based on their value or their neighbors. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2's first input row: 0 3 3 0 3 1 0 1 1 3\nOutput first row: 2 3 3 2 3 1 2 1 1 3\n\nSo the first element 0 becomes 2, fourth 0 becomes 2, and the seventh 0 becomes 2. The fifth element is 3 \u21923. So maybe positions where the original value is 0 are being replaced with 2, but that's not the case for all. For example, in Example 1's first row, the third element was 0 \u21922, ninth 0\u21922. But in Example 2's first row, first, fourth, seventh are 0 \u21922. But in Example 3's input, the first row is 0 3 0 3 0 0 1 3 3 1. The output is 2 3 2 3 2 2 1 3 3 1. So first element 0\u21922, fifth 0\u21922, sixth 0\u21922. So maybe positions where the original value is 0 are being replaced with 2, but not always. Wait, but in Example 1's first row, the third element is 0 \u21922, and ninth is 0\u21922. But in Example 2's first row, first, fourth, seventh are 0\u21922. So maybe the positions that are 0 are being replaced with 2, but sometimes other values are modified as well. But that's not the case. For example, in Example 2's second row input is 1 3 0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0. Output is 1 3 2 2 1 1 3 1 2 2. So the third element is 0\u21922, fourth 0\u21922, ninth 0\u21922. So maybe whenever a cell is 0, it becomes 2. But then why in Example 1's first row, the third element is 0\u21922, and the ninth is 0\u21922. But in Example 3's first row, the first element is 0\u21922, fifth is 0\u21922, sixth is 0\u21922. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 2s. But then why in Example 2's first row, the seventh element is 0\u21922. So that seems to fit. But then in Example 1's first row, the third element is 0\u21922, and the ninth is 0\u21922. So that's consistent. But then what about other numbers? Let's check.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, there are some 5s. For example, in the second row of output, the fifth element is 5. The input for that row is 1 0 0 3 3 0 1 3 1 1. The fifth element is 3 in input, but in output it's 5. So maybe that's not just replacing 0s with 2s. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output. For example, in Example 1, the third row of input is 0 1 1 1 0 3 0 0 0 3. The output is 2 1 1 1 5 3 2 2 2 3. So the first element is 0\u21922, fifth 0\u21925, seventh 0\u21922, eighth 0\u21922, ninth 0\u21922. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 2s, but some are replaced with 5s. Wait, but why fifth element is 5? Maybe it's based on the value of neighboring cells. Or maybe some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of operation on the input. For example, in Example 1, the first row of input is 3 1 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 3. The output is 3 1 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 3. So the third and ninth elements are 0\u21922. But in the output, the fifth element is 3, same as input. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 2s. But then why in the third row of input, the fifth element is 0\u21925. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe there's another pattern. Let's check other examples. In Example 2, the output for the third row is 1 2 1 2 2 1 3 5 3 3. The input for that row is 1 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 3 3. So the second element is 0\u21922, fourth 0\u21922, eighth 0\u21925. So again, 0s are being replaced with 2 or 5. Hmm. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with some value based on their position or neighboring cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each cell's value is modified based on the number of adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that are 0. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of convolution or kernel. But that's probably too complex.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output. For example, in Example 1's first row, the third and ninth elements are 0 \u2192 2. So maybe for each cell, if the original value is 0, replace it with 2. But then why in Example 2's third row, the fifth element is 0\u21925? Because in that row, the fifth element is 0 in input and 5 in output. So that contradicts the idea that all 0s are replaced with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different rule. Let's look at the output for the third row of Example 1: the fifth element is 5. The original input for that row is 0 1 1 1 0 3 0 0 0 3. The fifth element is 0. So maybe the fifth element is 0, and the cell to the left is 1, to the right is 3. Maybe the value is determined by some function of the surrounding cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by replacing each cell with the sum of its neighbors plus itself. But that's just a guess. Let's try for Example 1's third row, fifth element. Original value is 0. The cell is in position (row 2, column 4) (assuming 0-based). Let's check the neighbors. The cell to the left is 1 (column 3), right is 3 (column 5), up is row 1, column 4: 3, down is row 3, column 4: 0. So maybe sum of neighbors? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of thresholding. For example, if a cell is 0, it becomes 2, if it's 1, it becomes 2, but that's not the case.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, there are some 5s. For instance, in the second row of output, fifth element is 5. The input for that row is 1 0 0 3 3 0 1 3 1 1. The fifth element is 3 in input. So that's not a 0. So that's not a 0. So that's not related to 0s. So maybe the 5s are generated from other rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each cell's value is replaced with the number of adjacent cells that are 0. For example, in the third row of Example 1, the fifth element is 0. The adjacent cells: up (row 1, column 4 is 3), down (row 3, column 4 is 0), left (row 3, column 3 is 1), right (row 3, column 5 is 3). So the number of 0s in adjacent cells is 1 (the cell itself is 0). But the output is 5. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of morphological operation, like erosion or dilation. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, there are some 5s. For example, in Example 1's output, the fifth element of the third row is 5. The input is 0. So maybe when a cell is 0, it's replaced with 2, but if it's surrounded by certain numbers, it becomes 5. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell in the input plus some function. For example, in Example 1's first row, third element is 0 \u2192 2. So 0 + 2 = 2. But then the fifth element in the third row of input is 0 \u21925. So 0 +5=5. So maybe the value is increased by some amount based on the cell's position or neighbors.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell in the input plus the number of adjacent 0s. Let's try that. For the third row of Example 1, fifth element is 0. The adjacent cells: up is 3 (row 1, column 4), down is 0 (row 3, column 4?), left is 1, right is 3. So the number of adjacent 0s is 1 (the cell itself is 0). So adding 1 to 0 gives 1, but the output is 5. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell in the input plus the number of adjacent cells that are 0. For example, if the cell is 0, then adding the number of adjacent 0s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each cell is replaced with the sum of its neighboring cells. For example, in the third row of Example 1, fifth element is 0. The neighbors are up (row 1, column 4 is 3), down (row 3, column 4 is 0), left (row 3, column 3 is 1), right (row 3, column 5 is 3). The sum of these is 3 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 7. But the output is 5. Not matching.\n\nThis approach is not working. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs, there are some 2s and 5s. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s and 5s. Maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For instance, if a cell is 0, it becomes 2, but if it's surrounded by certain values, it becomes 5. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the parity of the cell's position. For example, cells in even rows or columns are modified in a certain way. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell in the input plus 2 if it's 0, but that doesn't explain the 5s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of convolution with a kernel. For example, using a 3x3 kernel to compute the output value. But without knowing the kernel, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the outputs. For example, in Example 1's output, the third row has 2 1 1 1 5 3 2 2 2 3. The fifth element is 5. Maybe that's because the cell is in a position where it's surrounded by certain values. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output for each cell. For example, in Example 1's first row, the third element is 0 \u2192 2. So difference is +2. The ninth element is 0 \u21922, same difference. The fifth element is 3 \u21923, no change. The second element is 1 \u21921, no change. The first element is 3 \u21923. So maybe for cells that are 0, they are increased by 2. But in Example 2's first row, the first element is 0 \u21922 (same), fourth element is 0 \u21922, seventh is 0 \u21922. So that fits. But in Example 2's third row, the fifth element is 0 \u21925. So that would be a difference of +5. So why is that?\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different rule for different positions. For example, maybe cells in certain positions (like the fifth column) are modified differently. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell in the input plus 2 if it's 0, and plus some other value if it's not 0. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the number of 0s in the entire grid. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that depends on the cell's value and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with 2, and if it's 1, it's replaced with 2, but if it's surrounded by certain values, it's replaced with 5. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, but some cells are replaced with 5. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and 5 is introduced in certain cases. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1's second row. Input row is 1 0 0 3 3 0 1 3 1 1. Output is 1 2 2 3 3 5 1 3 1 1. So the second and third elements are 0 \u21922, sixth is 0 \u21925. So maybe the sixth element is 0 and is replaced with 5 because it's in a certain position. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s, and 1s with 2s, and 3s with 3s, but in some cases, 0s are replaced with 5s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and 5s are introduced when there are certain conditions. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and other values are modified based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is 3 and has a 0 in a neighboring cell, it becomes 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output for cells that are not 0. For example, in Example 1's first row, the fifth element is 3 in input and 3 in output. So no change. The seventh element is 3 in input and 3 in output. So no change. The fourth element is 3 in input and 3 in output. So maybe those cells are unchanged.\n\nIn Example 2's first row, the fifth element is 3 in input and 3 in output. So no change. The seventh element is 0 \u21922. So that's a change.\n\nIn Example 3's first row, the first element is 0 \u21922, fifth is 0\u21922, sixth is 0\u21922. So again, 0s are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut in Example 2's third row, the fifth element is 0 \u21925. So why is that?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, but if the cell is in a certain position (like the fifth column), it's replaced with 5. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of morphological operation, like dilation. For example, replacing 0s with 2s and 1s with 2s. But then why are some 0s replaced with 5s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 is introduced when there's a certain pattern. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, the 5s seem to appear in positions where there are multiple 0s around them. For example, in Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0. The cell to the left is 1, to the right is 3, up is 3, down is 0. So maybe the number of 0s in the surrounding area is 1 (the cell itself), but the output is 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are introduced when the cell is surrounded by certain values. For example, in Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0. The cell to the left is 1, to the right is 3. The cell above is 3, below is 0. Maybe the sum of the surrounding cells is 3+1+3+0 =7, but that's not 5.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should try to look for a pattern that can be applied to all examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs, there are 2s and 5s. Let me check if the 5s are in positions where the original cell is 0 and the cell to the left is 1, and to the right is 3. For example, in Example 1's third row, fifth element is 0. To the left is 1, to the right is 3. So maybe the value is 1+3=4, but output is 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 is introduced when there are certain conditions. But without more data, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: think about the transformation as a function that applies to each cell. For example, for each cell (i,j), the output value is some function of the input value at (i,j) and possibly its neighbors.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern for the 5s. In Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0 \u21925. In Example 2's third row, the eighth element is 0 \u21925. In Example 3's third row, the fourth element is 0 \u21925. So maybe the 5s are introduced when the cell is 0 and the cell is in a certain position, like the fifth column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are introduced when the cell is 0 and the cell is in a certain row or column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is the sum of the neighboring cells. For example, in Example 1's third row, fifth element is 0. The neighboring cells are up (3), down (0), left (1), right (3). Sum is 3+0+1+3 =7. Not 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is the number of neighboring cells that are 0. In this case, the cell itself is 0, and the down cell is 0. So two zeros. But the output is 5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of neighboring cells that are 3. In this case, up is 3, right is 3. So two 3s. But output is 5. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let me look at the outputs for the 5s. For example, in Example 1's third row, fifth element is 5. The original input is 0. What about the cells around it? Let me check:\n\nOriginal input for row 2 (third row in the example) is [0,1,1,1,0,3,0,0,0,3]. So the fifth element is 0. The cell to the left is 1, to the right is 3. The cell above (row 1, column 4) is 3, and the cell below (row 3, column 4) is 0. So the surrounding cells are 3 (up), 1 (left), 3 (right), 0 (down). So maybe the sum of these is 3+1+3+0=7, but the output is 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of 0s in the entire grid. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that depends on the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, then the output is (i + j) % 5 + 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 with 5, but that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: look for the difference between input and output in the third example. For example, in Example 3's first row input is 0 3 0 3 0 0 1 3 3 1. Output is 2 3 2 3 2 2 1 3 3 1. So the first element is 0 \u21922, fifth is 0\u21922, sixth is 0\u21922. So again, 0s are replaced with 2s. But in the third row of Example 3, the fourth element is 0 \u21925. So that's different.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 5s are introduced when the cell is 0 and the cell is in the fifth column. But how to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and replace each 1 with 2, and replace each 3 with 3, and replace each 5 with 5. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell in the input plus 2 if it's 0, plus 3 if it's 1, and so on. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and any other value is unchanged. But in Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0 \u21925, which would not fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for the examples I can see.\n\nLet me try to look for a pattern where 0s are replaced with 2s, and some other cells are replaced with 5s. For example, in Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0 \u21925. Maybe that's because it's in the fifth column. Let's check other examples. In Example 2's third row, the eighth element is 0 \u21925. The eighth column is column 8 (0-based), which is the ninth column if we count from 1. Not sure. In Example 3's third row, the fourth element is 0 \u21925. Column 4 (0-based). So maybe the fifth column is where 0s are replaced with 5s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and if the cell is in the fifth column, replace it with 5. But how to verify?\n\nIn Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0 \u21925. So that's column 4 (0-based). If that's the fifth column, then maybe that's the case. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and if the cell is in a certain position, like the fifth column, replace it with 5. But without more data, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by some kind of morphological operation where each 0 is replaced with 2, and each 1 is replaced with 2, and each 3 is replaced with 3, and other values are replaced with 5. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell in the input plus 2, but if the cell is 0, it becomes 2, and if it's 1, it becomes 2, and so on. But that would mean that 0 becomes 2, 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 4, etc. But in Example 1's first row, the third element is 0 \u21922, which fits. But in Example 2's third row, the fifth element is 0 \u21925, which would not fit.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs, there are 5s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's third row, fifth element is 5. Let me look at the input for that row. The input is 0 1 1 1 0 3 0 0 0 3. The fifth element is 0. The cell to the left is 1, to the right is 3. The cell above is 3, and below is 0. So maybe the sum of the surrounding cells is 3+1+3+0 =7, but the output is 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of convolution with a kernel that averages the surrounding cells. For example, if the cell is 0, the average of the surrounding cells is (3+1+3+0)/4 = 1.75, but the output is 5. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the cell in the input plus the number of 0s in the entire grid. But that would be a global transformation, which is unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 is introduced when the cell is 0 and its neighbors are 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Maybe I should try to think of a transformation that replaces 0s with 2s and other values with their original values, and see if that works for some examples.\n\nLet me try that. For Example 1, the input first row is 3 1 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 3 \u2192 output is 3 1 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 3. So this would work for the 0s. For the third row of Example 1, input is 0 1 1 1 0 3 0 0 0 3 \u2192 output is 2 1 1 1 5 3 2 2 2 3. So the fifth element is 0 \u21925, which would not fit this pattern. So this suggests that there's more to the transformation.\n\nBut maybe the 5s are a special case. For example, if the cell is 0 and it's in a certain position, like the fifth column, then it's replaced with 5. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 with 5, and other values remain the same. But this doesn't explain the 5s in the outputs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 with 5, and other values are unchanged. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to handle the 5s? Maybe the 5s are introduced when there are certain patterns in the input. For example, if a cell is 0 and it has a 3 in the neighboring cells.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, the 5s seem to appear in positions where the cell is surrounded by 3s. For example, in Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0. The neighboring cells are 3 (up), 1 (left), 3 (right), 0 (down). So maybe the sum of the neighboring cells is 3+1+3+0 =7. But the output is 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is the number of 3s in the neighboring cells. In this case, there are two 3s (up and right), so 2. Not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to write a function that replaces 0s with 2s, and see if that passes some examples, and then try to adjust for the 5s.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0 \u21922. But the output is 5. So that would not work. So this suggests that the transformation is more complex.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s, and 1s with 2s, and 3s with 3s, and 5s are introduced when the cell is 0 and the cell is in a certain position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 is introduced when the cell is 0 and it's in a certain row or column. But without knowing the pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 is introduced when the cell is 0 and it's surrounded by 3s. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for other patterns. For example, in Example 1's output, the third row has 5 in the fifth element. The input for that row is 0 1 1 1 0 3 0 0 0 3. The fifth element is 0. The cell to the left is 1, to the right is 3. The cell above is 3, below is 0. So maybe the sum of the left and right is 1+3=4, and the output is 5. So maybe it's 4+1=5. But why add 1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the cell to the left and right. 1+3=4, but output is 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the cell to the left and right plus 1. 1+3+1=5. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see. Let's try to write a function that replaces 0s with 2s, and 1s with 2s, and other values remain the same. But this would not explain the 5s in the outputs. However, perhaps the 5s are a result of some other transformation that I'm not seeing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 is introduced when the cell is 0 and it's in the fifth column. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are a result of some other rule, like the number of 0s in the row. For example, in Example 1's third row, there are three 0s. So maybe the fifth element is replaced with 3 + 2 =5. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and other values are unchanged. This would work for some examples, but not all. However, this is the best I can do given the information.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = [2 if x == 0 else x for x in row]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not explain the 5s in the outputs. However, looking at Example 1's third row, the output is 2 1 1 1 5 3 2 2 2 3. So the fifth element is 5, but according to this code, it would be 2. So this code would not work for that example.\n\nSo this suggests that there's more to the transformation. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0 with 2, 1 with 2, and 3 with 3, and 5 is introduced when the cell is 0 and it has a certain condition.\n\nBut I'm not able to find that condition. Given the time, perhaps I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's second row: 1 2 2 3 3 5 1 3 1 1. The sixth element is 0 in input, replaced with 5. So maybe when the cell is 0 and it's in the sixth column, it's replaced with 5. But how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0 with 2, 1 with 2, and 3 with 3, and for cells that are 0 and are in certain positions (like the fifth or sixth column), replace with 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0 with 2, and for cells that are 0 and have a 3 in the neighboring cells, replace with 5. But this is also a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        new_row = []\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if the cell is in a certain position or has certain neighbors\n                # This is just a guess\n                # For example, if it's in the fifth column, replace with 5\n                if j == 4:  # fifth column (0-based)\n                    new_row.append(5)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(2)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. In Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0 (j=4), so it would be replaced with 5, which matches the output. In Example 2's third row, the eighth element is 0 (j=7), which is not the fifth column, so it would be replaced with 2, but the output is 5. So this doesn't work.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not based on column position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0 with 2, and if the cell is 0 and it's surrounded by 3s, replace with 5. But how to check that.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0. The cell to the left is 1, to the right is 3. The cell above is 3, below is 0. So the cell to the right is 3, and the cell above is 3. So maybe if there are two 3s in the neighbors, replace with 5.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think I have to proceed with a hypothesis that replaces 0 with 2, and some other cells with 5 based on certain conditions, but I'm not sure. However, since the problem requires writing a transformation that works for the training examples, I'll try to find a pattern that fits at least some of the examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the 5s seem to appear in positions where the cell is 0 and it has a 3 in the neighboring cells. For example, in Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0, and the cell to the right is 3, and the cell above is 3. So maybe the number of 3s in the neighboring cells is 2, and the output is 5.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0 with 2, and if the cell is 0 and has at least one 3 in the neighboring cells, replace with 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor each cell, if it's 0, check its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right). If any of them is 3, replace with 5. Otherwise, replace with 2.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample 1's third row, fifth element is 0. Neighbors are up (3), down (0), left (1), right (3). So there are two 3s. So replace with 5. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 2's third row, eighth element is 0. Let's check the input for that row. Input row is 1 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 3 3. So the eighth element is 0. Its neighbors are up (row 1, column 7 is 3), down (row 3, column 7 is 3), left (row 3, column 6 is 1), right (row 3, column 8 is 3). So there are 3s in up, down, and right. So replace with 5. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 3's third row, fourth element is 0. Input row is 0 3 1 0 1 0 3 0 3 0. The fourth element is 0. Neighbors are up (row 2, column 3 is 1), down (row 4, column 3 is 0), left (row 3, column 3 is 1), right (row 3, column 4 is 1). So no 3s in neighbors. So replace with 2. But the output for that position is 5. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So this doesn't fit all cases.\n\nBut in Example 3's third row, the fourth element is 0, and the output is 5. So according to this hypothesis, it should be 2. But the output is 5. So this suggests that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nThis is very challenging. Given the time, I think I need to make a best guess based on the patterns I see.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and replace each 1 with 2, and replace each 3 with 3, and replace each 5 with 5, and other values remain the same. But this doesn't explain the 5s in the outputs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and replace each 1 with 2, and replace each 3 with 3, and replace each 5 with 5, and other values are unchanged. But this would not explain the 5s in the outputs.\n\nBut given that the examples have 5s in the outputs, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0 with 2, and replace 1 with 2, and replace 3 with 3, and replace 5 with 5, and other values remain the same. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn this case, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = [x if x not in [0, 1, 3, 5] else 2 if x == 0 or x == 1 else x for x in row]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct, as it would not explain the 5s in the outputs.\n\nAt this point, I think the best I can do is to write a function that replaces 0 with 2, and other values remain the same, even though it doesn't explain the 5s in the outputs. However, this might not pass the training examples. But given the time constraints, this is the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 is introduced when the cell is 0 and it has a 3 in the neighboring cells. But how to code this.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        new_row = []\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check neighbors for 3\n                has_3 = False\n                # Check up\n                if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 3:\n                    has_3 = True\n                # Check down\n                if i < 9 and grid[i+1][j] == 3:\n                    has_3 = True\n                # Check left\n                if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 3:\n                    has_3 = True\n                # Check right\n                if j < 9 and grid[i][j+1] == 3:\n                    has_3 = True\n                if has_3:\n                    new_row.append(5)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(2)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's third row, fifth element (i=2, j=4). The cell is 0. Check neighbors:\n\nUp: i=1, j=4: 3 (from input row 1: 1 0 0 3 3 0 1 3 1 1 \u2192 j=4 is 3). So has_3 is True. So append 5. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 2's third row, eighth element (i=2, j=7). Input is 1 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 3 3. The cell is 0. Check neighbors:\n\nUp: i=1, j=7: 1 (from input row 1: 1 3 0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 \u2192 j=7 is 1. No 3.\n\nDown: i=3, j=7: 3 (from input row 3: 1 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 3 3 \u2192 j=7 is 0. Wait, no. Wait, the input for row 2 (third row) is 1 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 3 3. So j=7 is 0. Down is i=3, j=7. Let me check the input for row 3 (third row in example 2? No, example 2's input is:\n\nInput for example 2 is:\n\n0 3 3 0 3 1 0 1 1 3\n1 3 0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 3 3\n0 0 3 3 1 3 3 3 0 1\n0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 1\n3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 3 3 3 0 3 0 3 3\n3 1 1 1 3 0 1 1 1 3\n0 0 1 3 1 0 0 3 3 3\n0 3 3 0 3 3 1 3 1 1\n\nSo for example 2's third row (i=2), the row is 1 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 3 3. So j=7 is 0. Down is i=3, j=7: row 3 is 0 0 3 3 1 3 3 3 0 1. So j=7 is 3. So down is 3. So has_3 is True. So append 5. Which matches the output.\n\nFor Example 3's third row, the fourth element is 0. Let's check the input. The input for example 3's third row is 0 3 1 0 1 0 3 0 3 0. So i=2, j=3. Check neighbors:\n\nUp: i=1, j=3: 1 (from input row 1: 0 3 0 3 0 0 1 3 3 1 \u2192 j=3 is 3. Wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nExample 3's input is:\n\n0 3 0 3 0 0 1 3 3 1\n0 1 1 1 1 3 0 0 1 1\n0 3 1 0 1 0 3 0 3 0\n3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 0 0\n1 1 3 1 3 0 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 3 0 3 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 1 1 3 0 1 0\n3 0 1 3 3 1 0 3 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 3 3 1 1 3\n0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nSo for example 3's third row (i=2), the row is 0 3 1 0 1 0 3 0 3 0. So j=3 is 0. Check neighbors:\n\nUp: i=1, j=3: 1 (from row 1: 0 3 0 3 0 0 1 3 3 1 \u2192 j=3 is 3? Wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nRow 1: 0 3 0 3 0 0 1 3 3 1 \u2192 j=0 to 9.\n\nFor j=3 in row 1: value is 3.\n\nSo up is 3. Down is i=3, j=3: row 3 is 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 \u2192 j=3 is 0.\n\nLeft is j=2: 1. Right is j=4: 1.\n\nSo up is 3, down is 0, left is 1, right is 1. So has_3 is True. So the cell is replaced with 5. But in the output for example 3's third row, the fourth element is 5. So this would match. But according to the previous example, the output for example 3's third row is 2 3 1 5 1 5 3 5 3 2. So the fourth element is 5, which matches. So this suggests that the code would work for this case.\n\nSo this seems to work for the examples I've checked.\n\nSo the code replaces 0 with 2 if it has no 3 in the neighboring cells, and with 5 if it has at least one 3 in the neighboring cells.\n\nThis seems to fit the examples. Let's test this for the other cases.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, third element is 0. Neighbors are up: row 0, j=2 is 1 (input row 0: 3 1 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 3 \u2192 j=2 is 0. Wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nExample 1's input is:\n\nRow 0: 3 1 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 3\n\nSo for the third element (j=2), the value is 0. Neighbors are up (no, since it's the first row), down (row 1, j=2: 0), left (j=1: 1), right (j=3: 3). So down is 0, left is 1, right is 3. So has_3 is True. So the cell would be replaced with 5. But in the output, it's 2. Wait, this contradicts.\n\nWait, the output for example 1's first row is 3 1 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 3. The third element is 2. But according to this code, since the cell is 0 and has a 3 in the right neighbor, it should be replaced with 5. But the output is 2. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So in this case, the code would replace the third element with 5, but the output is 2. So this indicates that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nBut why? Let's recheck the example.\n\nIn example 1's first row, input is 3 1 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 3. The third element is 0 (j=2). The neighbors are:\n\nUp: none (since it's row 0).\n\nDown: row 1, j=2 is 0.\n\nLeft: j=1 is 1.\n\nRight: j=3 is 3.\n\nSo has_3 is True. So according to the code, it should be 5. But the output is 2. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nThis means that my hypothesis is wrong. So I need to rethink.\n\nMaybe the condition is not based on the presence of 3s in the neighboring cells, but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should replace 0 with 2 if it has no 3 in the neighboring cells, and with 5 if it has at least two 3s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn the first row of example 1, the third element has one 3 (right neighbor), so it would be replaced with 2. But according to the code, it would be replaced with 5. So this is conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that the condition is not based on the presence of 3s, but something else.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0 with 2 and 1 with 2, and other values remain the same, and see if it passes some examples, even though it doesn't pass others.\n\nBut this is not satisfactory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0 with 2, and replace 1 with 2, and replace 3 with 3, and replace 5 with 5, and other values are unchanged. But this would not explain the 5s in the outputs.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0 with 2, and 1 with 2, and other values are unchanged, even though it doesn't explain the 5s.\n\nBut this would not work for example 1's third row, where the fifth element is 0 \u21925.\n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is more complex, and I'm unable to determine it.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0 with 2, and 1 with 2, and other values are unchanged. This is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 10x10 grid of numbers, and the output is another 10x10 grid. The task is to find a transformation that maps input to output. Let me compare some elements.\n\nLooking at the first row of Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput first row: 3 1 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 3\nOutput first row: 3 1 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 3\n\nHmm, the first element is 3 in both. The second is 1 in both. The third is 0 in input, 2 in output. Then the fourth is 3, same. The ninth element is 0 in input, 2 in output. The rest are same. So maybe the third and ninth elements are being modified. But why?\n\nLooking at other rows. Let's check the third row of input and output:\n\nInput third row: 0 1 1 1 0 3 0 0 0 3\nOutput third row: 2 1 1 1 5 3 2 2 2 3\n\nSo the first element is 0 \u2192 2, fifth is 0 \u21925, and the seventh is 0\u21922, eighth 0\u21922, ninth 0\u21922. So maybe some kind of replacement based on neighboring cells?\n\nAlternatively, maybe some kind of transformation where certain positions are replaced based on their value or their neighbors. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2's first input row: 0 3 3 0 3 1 0 1 1 3\nOutput first row: 2 3 3 2 3 1 2 1 1 3\n\nSo the first element 0 becomes 2, fourth 0 becomes 2, and the seventh 0 becomes 2. The fifth element is 3 \u21923. So maybe positions where the original value is 0 are being replaced with 2, but that's not the case for all. For example, in Example 1's first row, the third element was 0 \u21922, ninth 0\u21922. But in Example 2's first row, first, fourth, seventh are 0 \u21922. But in Example 3's input, the first row is 0 3 0 3 0 0 1 3 3 1. The output is 2 3 2 3 2 2 1 3 3 1. So first element 0\u21922, fifth 0\u21922, sixth 0\u21922. So maybe positions where the original value is 0 are being replaced with 2, but not always. Wait, but in Example 1's first row, the third element is 0 \u21922, and ninth is 0\u21922. But in Example 2's first row, first, fourth, seventh are 0\u21922. So maybe the positions that are 0 are being replaced with 2, but sometimes other values are modified as well. But that's not the case. For example, in Example 2's second row input is 1 3 0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0. Output is 1 3 2 2 1 1 3 1 2 2. So the third element is 0\u21922, fourth 0\u21922, ninth 0\u21922. So maybe whenever a cell is 0, it becomes 2. But then why in Example 1's first row, the third element is 0\u21922, and the ninth is 0\u21922. But in Example 3's first row, the first element is 0\u21922, fifth is 0\u21922, sixth is 0\u21922. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 2s. But then why in Example 2's first row, the seventh element is 0\u21922. So that seems to fit. But then in Example 1's first row, the third element is 0\u21922, and the ninth is 0\u21922. So that's consistent. But then what about other numbers? Let's check.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, there are some 5s. For example, in the second row of output, the fifth element is 5. The input for that row is 1 0 0 3 3 0 1 3 1 1. The fifth element is 3 in input, but in output it's 5. So maybe that's not just replacing 0s with 2s. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output. For example, in Example 1, the third row of input is 0 1 1 1 0 3 0 0 0 3. The output is 2 1 1 1 5 3 2 2 2 3. So the first element is 0\u21922, fifth 0\u21925, seventh 0\u21922, eighth 0\u21922, ninth 0\u21922. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 2s, but some are replaced with 5s. Wait, but why fifth element is 5? Maybe it's based on the value of neighboring cells. Or maybe some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of operation on the input. For example, in Example 1, the first row of input is 3 1 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 3. The output is 3 1 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 3. So the third and ninth elements are 0\u21922. But in the output, the fifth element is 3, same as input. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 2s. But then why in the third row of input, the fifth element is 0\u21925. That's conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe there's another pattern. Let's check other examples. In Example 2, the output for the third row is 1 2 1 2 2 1 3 5 3 3. The input for that row is 1 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 3 3. So the second element is 0\u21922, fourth 0\u21922, eighth 0\u21925. So again, 0s are being replaced with 2 or 5. Hmm. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with some value based on their position or neighboring cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each cell's value is modified based on the number of adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) that are 0. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of convolution or kernel. But that's probably too complex.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output. For example, in Example 1's first row, the third and ninth elements are 0 \u2192 2. So maybe for each cell, if the original value is 0, replace it with 2. But then why in Example 2's third row, the fifth element is 0\u21925? Because in that row, the fifth element is 0 in input and 5 in output. So that contradicts the idea that all 0s are replaced with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a different rule. Let's look at the output for the third row of Example 1: the fifth element is 5. The original input for that row is 0 1 1 1 0 3 0 0 0 3. The fifth element is 0. So maybe the fifth element is 0, and the cell to the left is 1, to the right is 3. Maybe the value is determined by some function of the surrounding cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by replacing each cell with the sum of its neighbors plus itself. But that's just a guess. Let's try for Example 1's third row, fifth element. Original value is 0. The cell is in position (row 2, column 4) (assuming 0-based). Let's check the neighbors. The cell to the left is 1 (column 3), right is 3 (column 5), up is row 1, column 4: 3, down is row 3, column 4: 0. So maybe sum of neighbors? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of thresholding. For example, if a cell is 0, it becomes 2, if it's 1, it becomes 2, but that's not the case.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, there are some 5s. For instance, in the second row of output, fifth element is 5. The input for that row is 1 0 0 3 3 0 1 3 1 1. The fifth element is 3 in input. So that's not a 0. So that's not a 0. So that's not related to 0s. So maybe the 5s are generated from other rules.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each cell's value is replaced with the number of adjacent cells that are 0. For example, in the third row of Example 1, the fifth element is 0. The adjacent cells: up (row 1, column 4 is 3), down (row 3, column 4 is 0), left (row 3, column 3 is 1), right (row 3, column 5 is 3). So the number of 0s in adjacent cells is 1 (the cell itself is 0). But the output is 5. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of morphological operation, like erosion or dilation. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, there are some 5s. For example, in Example 1's output, the fifth element of the third row is 5. The input is 0. So maybe when a cell is 0, it's replaced with 2, but if it's surrounded by certain numbers, it becomes 5. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell in the input plus some function. For example, in Example 1's first row, third element is 0 \u2192 2. So 0 + 2 = 2. But then the fifth element in the third row of input is 0 \u21925. So 0 +5=5. So maybe the value is increased by some amount based on the cell's position or neighbors.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell in the input plus the number of adjacent 0s. Let's try that. For the third row of Example 1, fifth element is 0. The adjacent cells: up is 3 (row 1, column 4), down is 0 (row 3, column 4?), left is 1, right is 3. So the number of adjacent 0s is 1 (the cell itself is 0). So adding 1 to 0 gives 1, but the output is 5. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell in the input plus the number of adjacent cells that are 0. For example, if the cell is 0, then adding the number of adjacent 0s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each cell is replaced with the sum of its neighboring cells. For example, in the third row of Example 1, fifth element is 0. The neighbors are up (row 1, column 4 is 3), down (row 3, column 4 is 0), left (row 3, column 3 is 1), right (row 3, column 5 is 3). The sum of these is 3 + 0 + 1 + 3 = 7. But the output is 5. Not matching.\n\nThis approach is not working. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs, there are some 2s and 5s. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s and 5s. Maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For instance, if a cell is 0, it becomes 2, but if it's surrounded by certain values, it becomes 5. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the parity of the cell's position. For example, cells in even rows or columns are modified in a certain way. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell in the input plus 2 if it's 0, but that doesn't explain the 5s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of convolution with a kernel. For example, using a 3x3 kernel to compute the output value. But without knowing the kernel, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, looking for patterns in the outputs. For example, in Example 1's output, the third row has 2 1 1 1 5 3 2 2 2 3. The fifth element is 5. Maybe that's because the cell is in a position where it's surrounded by certain values. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output for each cell. For example, in Example 1's first row, the third element is 0 \u2192 2. So difference is +2. The ninth element is 0 \u21922, same difference. The fifth element is 3 \u21923, no change. The second element is 1 \u21921, no change. The first element is 3 \u21923. So maybe for cells that are 0, they are increased by 2. But in Example 2's first row, the first element is 0 \u21922 (same), fourth element is 0 \u21922, seventh is 0 \u21922. So that fits. But in Example 2's third row, the fifth element is 0 \u21925. So that would be a difference of +5. So why is that?\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different rule for different positions. For example, maybe cells in certain positions (like the fifth column) are modified differently. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell in the input plus 2 if it's 0, and plus some other value if it's not 0. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the number of 0s in the entire grid. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that depends on the cell's value and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with 2, and if it's 1, it's replaced with 2, but if it's surrounded by certain values, it's replaced with 5. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, but some cells are replaced with 5. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and 5 is introduced in certain cases. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1's second row. Input row is 1 0 0 3 3 0 1 3 1 1. Output is 1 2 2 3 3 5 1 3 1 1. So the second and third elements are 0 \u21922, sixth is 0 \u21925. So maybe the sixth element is 0 and is replaced with 5 because it's in a certain position. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 2s, and 1s with 2s, and 3s with 3s, but in some cases, 0s are replaced with 5s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and 5s are introduced when there are certain conditions. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and other values are modified based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is 3 and has a 0 in a neighboring cell, it becomes 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output for cells that are not 0. For example, in Example 1's first row, the fifth element is 3 in input and 3 in output. So no change. The seventh element is 3 in input and 3 in output. So no change. The fourth element is 3 in input and 3 in output. So maybe those cells are unchanged.\n\nIn Example 2's first row, the fifth element is 3 in input and 3 in output. So no change. The seventh element is 0 \u21922. So that's a change.\n\nIn Example 3's first row, the first element is 0 \u21922, fifth is 0\u21922, sixth is 0\u21922. So again, 0s are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut in Example 2's third row, the fifth element is 0 \u21925. So why is that?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, but if the cell is in a certain position (like the fifth column), it's replaced with 5. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of morphological operation, like dilation. For example, replacing 0s with 2s and 1s with 2s. But then why are some 0s replaced with 5s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 is introduced when there's a certain pattern. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, the 5s seem to appear in positions where there are multiple 0s around them. For example, in Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0. The cell to the left is 1, to the right is 3, up is 3, down is 0. So maybe the number of 0s in the surrounding area is 1 (the cell itself), but the output is 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are introduced when the cell is surrounded by certain values. For example, in Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0. The cell to the left is 1, to the right is 3. The cell above is 3, below is 0. Maybe the sum of the surrounding cells is 3+1+3+0 =7, but that's not 5.\n\nThis is getting frustrating. Maybe I should try to look for a pattern that can be applied to all examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs, there are 2s and 5s. Let me check if the 5s are in positions where the original cell is 0 and the cell to the left is 1, and to the right is 3. For example, in Example 1's third row, fifth element is 0. To the left is 1, to the right is 3. So maybe the value is 1+3=4, but output is 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 is introduced when there are certain conditions. But without more data, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: think about the transformation as a function that applies to each cell. For example, for each cell (i,j), the output value is some function of the input value at (i,j) and possibly its neighbors.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern for the 5s. In Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0 \u21925. In Example 2's third row, the eighth element is 0 \u21925. In Example 3's third row, the fourth element is 0 \u21925. So maybe the 5s are introduced when the cell is 0 and the cell is in a certain position, like the fifth column?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are introduced when the cell is 0 and the cell is in a certain row or column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is the sum of the neighboring cells. For example, in Example 1's third row, fifth element is 0. The neighboring cells are up (3), down (0), left (1), right (3). Sum is 3+0+1+3 =7. Not 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is the number of neighboring cells that are 0. In this case, the cell itself is 0, and the down cell is 0. So two zeros. But the output is 5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the number of neighboring cells that are 3. In this case, up is 3, right is 3. So two 3s. But output is 5. No.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let me look at the outputs for the 5s. For example, in Example 1's third row, fifth element is 5. The original input is 0. What about the cells around it? Let me check:\n\nOriginal input for row 2 (third row in the example) is [0,1,1,1,0,3,0,0,0,3]. So the fifth element is 0. The cell to the left is 1, to the right is 3. The cell above (row 1, column 4) is 3, and the cell below (row 3, column 4) is 0. So the surrounding cells are 3 (up), 1 (left), 3 (right), 0 (down). So maybe the sum of these is 3+1+3+0=7, but the output is 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the number of 0s in the entire grid. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that depends on the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in row i and column j, then the output is (i + j) % 5 + 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 with 5, but that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: look for the difference between input and output in the third example. For example, in Example 3's first row input is 0 3 0 3 0 0 1 3 3 1. Output is 2 3 2 3 2 2 1 3 3 1. So the first element is 0 \u21922, fifth is 0\u21922, sixth is 0\u21922. So again, 0s are replaced with 2s. But in the third row of Example 3, the fourth element is 0 \u21925. So that's different.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 5s are introduced when the cell is 0 and the cell is in the fifth column. But how to confirm?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and replace each 1 with 2, and replace each 3 with 3, and replace each 5 with 5. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell in the input plus 2 if it's 0, plus 3 if it's 1, and so on. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and any other value is unchanged. But in Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0 \u21925, which would not fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for the examples I can see.\n\nLet me try to look for a pattern where 0s are replaced with 2s, and some other cells are replaced with 5s. For example, in Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0 \u21925. Maybe that's because it's in the fifth column. Let's check other examples. In Example 2's third row, the eighth element is 0 \u21925. The eighth column is column 8 (0-based), which is the ninth column if we count from 1. Not sure. In Example 3's third row, the fourth element is 0 \u21925. Column 4 (0-based). So maybe the fifth column is where 0s are replaced with 5s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and if the cell is in the fifth column, replace it with 5. But how to verify?\n\nIn Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0 \u21925. So that's column 4 (0-based). If that's the fifth column, then maybe that's the case. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and if the cell is in a certain position, like the fifth column, replace it with 5. But without more data, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by some kind of morphological operation where each 0 is replaced with 2, and each 1 is replaced with 2, and each 3 is replaced with 3, and other values are replaced with 5. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each cell with the value of the cell in the input plus 2, but if the cell is 0, it becomes 2, and if it's 1, it becomes 2, and so on. But that would mean that 0 becomes 2, 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 4, etc. But in Example 1's first row, the third element is 0 \u21922, which fits. But in Example 2's third row, the fifth element is 0 \u21925, which would not fit.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should think of another approach.\n\nLooking at the outputs, there are 5s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's third row, fifth element is 5. Let me look at the input for that row. The input is 0 1 1 1 0 3 0 0 0 3. The fifth element is 0. The cell to the left is 1, to the right is 3. The cell above is 3, and below is 0. So maybe the sum of the surrounding cells is 3+1+3+0 =7, but the output is 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of convolution with a kernel that averages the surrounding cells. For example, if the cell is 0, the average of the surrounding cells is (3+1+3+0)/4 = 1.75, but the output is 5. Not matching.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each cell is replaced with the value of the cell in the input plus the number of 0s in the entire grid. But that would be a global transformation, which is unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 is introduced when the cell is 0 and its neighbors are 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Maybe I should try to think of a transformation that replaces 0s with 2s and other values with their original values, and see if that works for some examples.\n\nLet me try that. For Example 1, the input first row is 3 1 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 3 \u2192 output is 3 1 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 3. So this would work for the 0s. For the third row of Example 1, input is 0 1 1 1 0 3 0 0 0 3 \u2192 output is 2 1 1 1 5 3 2 2 2 3. So the fifth element is 0 \u21925, which would not fit this pattern. So this suggests that there's more to the transformation.\n\nBut maybe the 5s are a special case. For example, if the cell is 0 and it's in a certain position, like the fifth column, then it's replaced with 5. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 with 5, and other values remain the same. But this doesn't explain the 5s in the outputs.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 with 5, and other values are unchanged. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to handle the 5s? Maybe the 5s are introduced when there are certain patterns in the input. For example, if a cell is 0 and it has a 3 in the neighboring cells.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the outputs, the 5s seem to appear in positions where the cell is surrounded by 3s. For example, in Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0. The neighboring cells are 3 (up), 1 (left), 3 (right), 0 (down). So maybe the sum of the neighboring cells is 3+1+3+0 =7. But the output is 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is the number of 3s in the neighboring cells. In this case, there are two 3s (up and right), so 2. Not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to write a function that replaces 0s with 2s, and see if that passes some examples, and then try to adjust for the 5s.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0 \u21922. But the output is 5. So that would not work. So this suggests that the transformation is more complex.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s, and 1s with 2s, and 3s with 3s, and 5s are introduced when the cell is 0 and the cell is in a certain position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 is introduced when the cell is 0 and it's in a certain row or column. But without knowing the pattern, it's hard to code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 is introduced when the cell is 0 and it's surrounded by 3s. But again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for other patterns. For example, in Example 1's output, the third row has 5 in the fifth element. The input for that row is 0 1 1 1 0 3 0 0 0 3. The fifth element is 0. The cell to the left is 1, to the right is 3. The cell above is 3, below is 0. So maybe the sum of the left and right is 1+3=4, and the output is 5. So maybe it's 4+1=5. But why add 1?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the sum of the cell to the left and right. 1+3=4, but output is 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the sum of the cell to the left and right plus 1. 1+3+1=5. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see. Let's try to write a function that replaces 0s with 2s, and 1s with 2s, and other values remain the same. But this would not explain the 5s in the outputs. However, perhaps the 5s are a result of some other transformation that I'm not seeing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 is introduced when the cell is 0 and it's in the fifth column. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are a result of some other rule, like the number of 0s in the row. For example, in Example 1's third row, there are three 0s. So maybe the fifth element is replaced with 3 + 2 =5. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the assumption that the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and other values are unchanged. This would work for some examples, but not all. However, this is the best I can do given the information.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = [2 if x == 0 else x for x in row]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not explain the 5s in the outputs. However, looking at Example 1's third row, the output is 2 1 1 1 5 3 2 2 2 3. So the fifth element is 5, but according to this code, it would be 2. So this code would not work for that example.\n\nSo this suggests that there's more to the transformation. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0 with 2, 1 with 2, and 3 with 3, and 5 is introduced when the cell is 0 and it has a certain condition.\n\nBut I'm not able to find that condition. Given the time, perhaps I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1's second row: 1 2 2 3 3 5 1 3 1 1. The sixth element is 0 in input, replaced with 5. So maybe when the cell is 0 and it's in the sixth column, it's replaced with 5. But how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0 with 2, 1 with 2, and 3 with 3, and for cells that are 0 and are in certain positions (like the fifth or sixth column), replace with 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0 with 2, and for cells that are 0 and have a 3 in the neighboring cells, replace with 5. But this is also a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        new_row = []\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if the cell is in a certain position or has certain neighbors\n                # This is just a guess\n                # For example, if it's in the fifth column, replace with 5\n                if j == 4:  # fifth column (0-based)\n                    new_row.append(5)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(2)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. In Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0 (j=4), so it would be replaced with 5, which matches the output. In Example 2's third row, the eighth element is 0 (j=7), which is not the fifth column, so it would be replaced with 2, but the output is 5. So this doesn't work.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not based on column position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0 with 2, and if the cell is 0 and it's surrounded by 3s, replace with 5. But how to check that.\n\nIn Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0. The cell to the left is 1, to the right is 3. The cell above is 3, below is 0. So the cell to the right is 3, and the cell above is 3. So maybe if there are two 3s in the neighbors, replace with 5.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think I have to proceed with a hypothesis that replaces 0 with 2, and some other cells with 5 based on certain conditions, but I'm not sure. However, since the problem requires writing a transformation that works for the training examples, I'll try to find a pattern that fits at least some of the examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the 5s seem to appear in positions where the cell is 0 and it has a 3 in the neighboring cells. For example, in Example 1's third row, the fifth element is 0, and the cell to the right is 3, and the cell above is 3. So maybe the number of 3s in the neighboring cells is 2, and the output is 5.\n\nBut how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0 with 2, and if the cell is 0 and has at least one 3 in the neighboring cells, replace with 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor each cell, if it's 0, check its neighboring cells (up, down, left, right). If any of them is 3, replace with 5. Otherwise, replace with 2.\n\nLet's test this hypothesis.\n\nExample 1's third row, fifth element is 0. Neighbors are up (3), down (0), left (1), right (3). So there are two 3s. So replace with 5. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 2's third row, eighth element is 0. Let's check the input for that row. Input row is 1 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 3 3. So the eighth element is 0. Its neighbors are up (row 1, column 7 is 3), down (row 3, column 7 is 3), left (row 3, column 6 is 1), right (row 3, column 8 is 3). So there are 3s in up, down, and right. So replace with 5. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 3's third row, fourth element is 0. Input row is 0 3 1 0 1 0 3 0 3 0. The fourth element is 0. Neighbors are up (row 2, column 3 is 1), down (row 4, column 3 is 0), left (row 3, column 3 is 1), right (row 3, column 4 is 1). So no 3s in neighbors. So replace with 2. But the output for that position is 5. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So this doesn't fit all cases.\n\nBut in Example 3's third row, the fourth element is 0, and the output is 5. So according to this hypothesis, it should be 2. But the output is 5. So this suggests that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nThis is very challenging. Given the time, I think I need to make a best guess based on the patterns I see.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and replace each 1 with 2, and replace each 3 with 3, and replace each 5 with 5, and other values remain the same. But this doesn't explain the 5s in the outputs.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and replace each 1 with 2, and replace each 3 with 3, and replace each 5 with 5, and other values are unchanged. But this would not explain the 5s in the outputs.\n\nBut given that the examples have 5s in the outputs, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0 with 2, and replace 1 with 2, and replace 3 with 3, and replace 5 with 5, and other values remain the same. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn this case, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = [x if x not in [0, 1, 3, 5] else 2 if x == 0 or x == 1 else x for x in row]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct, as it would not explain the 5s in the outputs.\n\nAt this point, I think the best I can do is to write a function that replaces 0 with 2, and other values remain the same, even though it doesn't explain the 5s in the outputs. However, this might not pass the training examples. But given the time constraints, this is the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace each 0 with 2, and each 1 with 2, and each 3 with 3, and each 5 is introduced when the cell is 0 and it has a 3 in the neighboring cells. But how to code this.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        new_row = []\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check neighbors for 3\n                has_3 = False\n                # Check up\n                if i > 0 and grid[i-1][j] == 3:\n                    has_3 = True\n                # Check down\n                if i < 9 and grid[i+1][j] == 3:\n                    has_3 = True\n                # Check left\n                if j > 0 and grid[i][j-1] == 3:\n                    has_3 = True\n                # Check right\n                if j < 9 and grid[i][j+1] == 3:\n                    has_3 = True\n                if has_3:\n                    new_row.append(5)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(2)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(grid[i][j])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's third row, fifth element (i=2, j=4). The cell is 0. Check neighbors:\n\nUp: i=1, j=4: 3 (from input row 1: 1 0 0 3 3 0 1 3 1 1 \u2192 j=4 is 3). So has_3 is True. So append 5. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 2's third row, eighth element (i=2, j=7). Input is 1 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 3 3. The cell is 0. Check neighbors:\n\nUp: i=1, j=7: 1 (from input row 1: 1 3 0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0 \u2192 j=7 is 1. No 3.\n\nDown: i=3, j=7: 3 (from input row 3: 1 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 3 3 \u2192 j=7 is 0. Wait, no. Wait, the input for row 2 (third row) is 1 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 3 3. So j=7 is 0. Down is i=3, j=7. Let me check the input for row 3 (third row in example 2? No, example 2's input is:\n\nInput for example 2 is:\n\n0 3 3 0 3 1 0 1 1 3\n1 3 0 0 1 1 3 1 0 0\n1 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 3 3\n0 0 3 3 1 3 3 3 0 1\n0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 3 1\n3 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 3 3 3 0 3 0 3 3\n3 1 1 1 3 0 1 1 1 3\n0 0 1 3 1 0 0 3 3 3\n0 3 3 0 3 3 1 3 1 1\n\nSo for example 2's third row (i=2), the row is 1 0 1 0 0 1 3 0 3 3. So j=7 is 0. Down is i=3, j=7: row 3 is 0 0 3 3 1 3 3 3 0 1. So j=7 is 3. So down is 3. So has_3 is True. So append 5. Which matches the output.\n\nFor Example 3's third row, the fourth element is 0. Let's check the input. The input for example 3's third row is 0 3 1 0 1 0 3 0 3 0. So i=2, j=3. Check neighbors:\n\nUp: i=1, j=3: 1 (from input row 1: 0 3 0 3 0 0 1 3 3 1 \u2192 j=3 is 3. Wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nExample 3's input is:\n\n0 3 0 3 0 0 1 3 3 1\n0 1 1 1 1 3 0 0 1 1\n0 3 1 0 1 0 3 0 3 0\n3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 0 0\n1 1 3 1 3 0 0 0 1 0\n1 0 1 0 3 0 3 3 0 3\n0 0 0 0 1 1 3 0 1 0\n3 0 1 3 3 1 0 3 0 0\n1 1 0 0 1 3 3 1 1 3\n0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nSo for example 3's third row (i=2), the row is 0 3 1 0 1 0 3 0 3 0. So j=3 is 0. Check neighbors:\n\nUp: i=1, j=3: 1 (from row 1: 0 3 0 3 0 0 1 3 3 1 \u2192 j=3 is 3? Wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nRow 1: 0 3 0 3 0 0 1 3 3 1 \u2192 j=0 to 9.\n\nFor j=3 in row 1: value is 3.\n\nSo up is 3. Down is i=3, j=3: row 3 is 3 3 3 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 \u2192 j=3 is 0.\n\nLeft is j=2: 1. Right is j=4: 1.\n\nSo up is 3, down is 0, left is 1, right is 1. So has_3 is True. So the cell is replaced with 5. But in the output for example 3's third row, the fourth element is 5. So this would match. But according to the previous example, the output for example 3's third row is 2 3 1 5 1 5 3 5 3 2. So the fourth element is 5, which matches. So this suggests that the code would work for this case.\n\nSo this seems to work for the examples I've checked.\n\nSo the code replaces 0 with 2 if it has no 3 in the neighboring cells, and with 5 if it has at least one 3 in the neighboring cells.\n\nThis seems to fit the examples. Let's test this for the other cases.\n\nIn Example 1's first row, third element is 0. Neighbors are up: row 0, j=2 is 1 (input row 0: 3 1 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 3 \u2192 j=2 is 0. Wait, no. Let me recheck.\n\nExample 1's input is:\n\nRow 0: 3 1 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 3\n\nSo for the third element (j=2), the value is 0. Neighbors are up (no, since it's the first row), down (row 1, j=2: 0), left (j=1: 1), right (j=3: 3). So down is 0, left is 1, right is 3. So has_3 is True. So the cell would be replaced with 5. But in the output, it's 2. Wait, this contradicts.\n\nWait, the output for example 1's first row is 3 1 2 3 3 3 3 3 2 3. The third element is 2. But according to this code, since the cell is 0 and has a 3 in the right neighbor, it should be replaced with 5. But the output is 2. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So in this case, the code would replace the third element with 5, but the output is 2. So this indicates that the hypothesis is wrong.\n\nBut why? Let's recheck the example.\n\nIn example 1's first row, input is 3 1 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 3. The third element is 0 (j=2). The neighbors are:\n\nUp: none (since it's row 0).\n\nDown: row 1, j=2 is 0.\n\nLeft: j=1 is 1.\n\nRight: j=3 is 3.\n\nSo has_3 is True. So according to the code, it should be 5. But the output is 2. So this suggests that the code is incorrect.\n\nThis means that my hypothesis is wrong. So I need to rethink.\n\nMaybe the condition is not based on the presence of 3s in the neighboring cells, but something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should replace 0 with 2 if it has no 3 in the neighboring cells, and with 5 if it has at least two 3s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn the first row of example 1, the third element has one 3 (right neighbor), so it would be replaced with 2. But according to the code, it would be replaced with 5. So this is conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that the condition is not based on the presence of 3s, but something else.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0 with 2 and 1 with 2, and other values remain the same, and see if it passes some examples, even though it doesn't pass others.\n\nBut this is not satisfactory.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0 with 2, and replace 1 with 2, and replace 3 with 3, and replace 5 with 5, and other values are unchanged. But this would not explain the 5s in the outputs.\n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0 with 2, and 1 with 2, and other values are unchanged, even though it doesn't explain the 5s.\n\nBut this would not work for example 1's third row, where the fifth element is 0 \u21925.\n\nSo this suggests that the transformation is more complex, and I'm unable to determine it.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0 with 2, and 1 with 2, and other values are unchanged. This is the best I can do.\n"
