          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify patterns that map the input grids to the output grids.\n\nLet me first examine the structure:\n- All input grids are 9\u00d79\n- All output grids are 1\u00d75\n- Values in grids are 0, 1, 2\n\nLet me look at each example more carefully:\n\nExample 1:\n- Input: 9\u00d79 grid with patterns of 1s and 2s\n- Output: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample 2:\n- Input: 9\u00d79 grid with patterns of 1s and 2s\n- Output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nExample 3:\n- Input: 9\u00d79 grid with patterns of 1s and 2s\n- Output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nLet me look for patterns. I notice that:\n1. The output is always 5 elements\n2. The output seems to be binary (0s and 1s)\n3. The pattern might be related to counting or detecting specific configurations\n\nLet me think about possible transformations:\n- Counting connected components of 1s or 2s\n- Checking for specific patterns in certain regions\n- Analyzing rows/columns for specific properties\n\nLooking more carefully, I notice the output might be related to whether there are connected components in certain sections of the grid.\n\nLet me try a hypothesis: maybe we're checking if there are connected components of 1s in different horizontal sections of the grid.\n\nLet me divide the 9\u00d79 grid into 5 horizontal sections and check if each section contains at least one connected component of 1s.\n\nActually, let me try a different approach. Let me check columns - divide the 9 columns into 5 groups and see if there are 1s in those column groups.\n\nColumns 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8\n\nLet me check Example 1:\nColumns 0-1: has 1s (column 1)\nColumns 2-3: has 1s (column 2)  \nColumns 4-5: has 1s (columns 4,5)\nColumns 6-7: has 1s (column 6)\nColumns 8: has 1s (column 8)\n\nThat would give [1,1,1,1,1] but output is [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nLet me try checking for 2s instead:\nColumns 0-1: has 2s (column 0)\nColumns 2-3: no 2s\nColumns 4-5: has 2s (columns 4,5)\nColumns 6-7: has 2s (columns 6,7)\nColumns 8: has 2s (column 8)\n\nThat gives [1,0,1,1,1] but output is [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nLet me try a different approach. What if I look at the grid as 5 vertical sections of varying widths?\n\nActually, let me reconsider horizontal sections:\nRows 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8\n\nExample 1:\nRows 0-1: has 1s\nRows 2-3: has 1s\nRows 4-5: has 1s\nRows 6-7: no 1s\nRows 8: has 1s\n\nThat gives [1,1,1,0,1] but output is [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nLet me try a different grouping or different logic.\n\nWhat if I'm looking for connected components that span certain areas?\n\nLet me try: check if there's a connected component of 1s that touches each of 5 horizontal strips.\n\nActually, let me look at this differently. What if the output represents some property of the distribution of 1s across the grid?\n\nLet me check for the presence of 1s in specific column ranges:\nMaybe columns [0,1], [2,3], [4,5], [6,7], [8] but looking for connected components or specific patterns.\n\nLet me try another approach: count how many separate groups of 1s exist in each column group.\n\nActually, let me step back and look at what makes examples 2 and 3 have the same output [1,1,1,1,0] while example 1 has [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nLet me try checking if there exists at least one connected component of 1s in each of 5 regions.\n\nWhat if I divide the 9\u00d79 grid into 5 vertical strips:\n- Columns 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8\n- And check if there's a connected component of 1s in each strip\n\nBut I need to implement connected component detection for that.\n\nLet me try a simpler approach first - just check if there's any 1 in each column group:\nColumns [0,1], [2,3], [4,5], [6,7], [8]\n\nExample 1:\nColumns 0-1: has 1s (at positions like (1,1), (2,1), (8,1))\nColumns 2-3: has 1s (at positions like (0,2), (1,2), (2,2))\nColumns 4-5: has 1s (at positions like (5,4), (6,4), (5,5), (6,5))\nColumns 6-7: has 1s (at positions like (2,7), (3,7))\nColumns 8: has 1s (at positions like (0,8), (3,8), (8,8))\n\nThis would give [1,1,1,1,1] but output is [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nHmm, let me reconsider what \"connected component\" means. Maybe I need to do actual connected component analysis.\n\nLet me try a different hypothesis. What if I look at the maximum number of connected components of 1s in each column section?\n\nOr maybe I'm supposed to check if there's a connected component that spans a certain width or height?\n\nLet me try a very different approach: what if the output represents whether there are 1s in the corners or specific positions?\n\nActually, let me re-examine the problem more systematically. Let me check if there are connected components of 1s that are at least 2x2 in size in each column section.\n\nLet me try to implement a connected components approach:\n\nFor each column section, I'll check if there's a connected component of 1s of size at least 2.\n\nBut first, let me try something simpler and see if it works.\n\nLooking at the outputs again:\n[1,1,0,0,0] \n[1,1,1,1,0]\n[1,1,1,1,0]\n\nThe last position is always 0. The first two are always 1.\n\nLet me check what's in the rightmost column (column 8):\nExample 1: 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 - has 1s\nExample 2: 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0 - has 1s\nExample 3: 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2 - has 1s\n\nSo it's not simply about presence of 1s in the last column.\n\nLet me try one more approach: maybe the output represents whether there's a 2x2 square of 1s in certain regions.\n\nLet me divide the grid into 5 vertical regions:\nColumns 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8\nAnd check if there's a 2x2 square of 1s in each region.\n\nExample 1:\nColumns 0-1: 2x2 squares of 1s at rows 1-2? Yes, positions (1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2) - but (1,2) and (2,2) are in column 2. So no 2x2 in columns 0-1.\nActually, positions (1,0),(1,1),(2,0),(2,1) - (1,0) and (2,0) are 0, (1,1) and (2,1) are 1. Not a 2x2 square.\n\nLet me check positions (1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2) - but column 2 is not in range 0-1.\n\nWait, let me recheck the grid indexing. Grid[row][col].\n\nExample 1 input:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 1 1 0 0",

              "content": "Looking at the training examples, I need to analyze the patterns that map 9\u00d79 input grids to 1\u00d75 output grids.\n\nLet me examine each example carefully:\n\nExample 1:\n- Input: 9\u00d79 grid with various patterns of 0s, 1s, and 2s\n- Output: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample 2:\n- Input: 9\u00d79 grid with various patterns of 0s, 1s, and 2s\n- Output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nExample 3:\n- Input: 9\u00d79 grid with various patterns of 0s, 1s, and 2s\n- Output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nLet me look for patterns:\n1. The output is always 1\u00d75\n2. Outputs seem to be binary (0s and 1s)\n3. Let me check if there's a pattern based on rows/columns or specific regions\n\nLooking more carefully at the relationship:\n- Maybe it's counting something in specific regions of the grid\n- Perhaps it's based on the presence of certain numbers in specific areas\n- Could be related to connectivity or patterns of 1s and 2s\n\nLet me try a hypothesis: maybe the output represents whether certain conditions are met in different vertical sections of the grid.\n\nLooking at the grid structure (9 columns), if I divide it into 5 sections:\n- Columns 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8 (or similar groupings)\n\nLet me check if the output corresponds to the presence of 1s in these regions:\n- Output position 0: presence of 1s in leftmost region\n- Output position 1: presence of 1s in next region\n- etc.\n\nActually, let me look at a simpler pattern. Looking at the outputs:\n- Example 1: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0] \n- Example 2: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n- Example 3: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nThe first two positions are often 1. Let me check what determines if a position is 1 or 0.\n\nAnother approach: let me divide the 9\u00d79 grid into 5 vertical strips and check for the presence of 1s:\n- Strip 1: columns 0-1\n- Strip 2: columns 2-3  \n- Strip 3: columns 4-5\n- Strip 4: columns 6-7\n- Strip 5: column 8\n\nFor each strip, if there's at least one '1', output 1 for that position, otherwise 0.\n\nLet me verify this hypothesis:\n\nExample 1 input analysis:\n- Columns 0-1: has 1s in rows 1,2,8 \u2192 output[0] = 1 \u2713\n- Columns 2-3: has 1s in rows 0,1,2,5,6 \u2192 output[1] = 1 \u2713\n- Columns 4-5: has 1s in rows 4,5,6 \u2192 output[2] = 1 \u2717 (expected 0)\n\nThis doesn't match. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet me check horizontal strips instead:\n- Rows 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8\n- Or check if there are 1s in specific row ranges\n\nActually, let me reconsider vertical strips but be more careful:\nMaybe columns (0,1), (2,3), (4,5), (6,7), (8) each map to one output position.\n\nExample 1:\n- Cols 0-1: rows 1,2,8 have 1s \u2192 output[0]=1 \u2713\n- Cols 2-3: rows 0,1,2,5,6 have 1s \u2192 output[1]=1 \u2713\n- Cols 4-5: rows 4,5,6 have 1s \u2192 output[2]=1 \u2717 (expected 0)\n\nStill not matching. Let me try checking if there are 1s in the MIDDLE of each vertical strip.\n\nOr maybe it's about the COUNT or specific patterns. Let me look for a different pattern.\n\nLet me try: divide into 5 vertical regions of different widths since 9 doesn't divide evenly by 5:\n- Region 1: col 0-1 (2 cols)\n- Region 2: col 2-3 (2 cols)  \n- Region 3: col 4 (1 col)\n- Region 4: col 5-6 (2 cols)\n- Region 5: col 7-8 (2 cols)\n\nActually, simpler: let's try (0-1), (2-3), (4-5), (6-7), (8) and check for presence of 1s:\n\nExample 1:\n- Cols 0-1: 1s at (1,1), (2,1), (8,1) \u2192 1 \u2713\n- Cols 2-3: 1s at (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (5,5), (6,5) \u2192 1 \u2713  \n- Cols 4-5: 1s at (4,4), (5,4) \u2192 1 (but expected 0)\n\nHmm, let me think differently. What if it's not just presence of 1s, but some other condition?\n\nLet me check for connected components or specific shapes.\n\nWait, let me recheck more carefully. Maybe I should check if there are 1s in the TOP part of each column region.\n\nOr maybe it's about 2s instead of 1s? No, that seems less likely given the outputs.\n\nLet me try a different approach: maybe it's about whether there are 1s in specific ROW ranges for each column group.\n\nActually, let me step back and look at this more systematically. \n\nNew hypothesis: For each of the 5 output positions, check a specific 2x2 or larger region of the input grid.\n\nLooking at the consistent pattern of [1,1,...] in positions 0,1, let me see what those regions have in common.\n\nLet me try dividing the 9 columns into 5 groups as (0,1), (2,3), (4), (5,6), (7,8) and for each group, check if ANY 1 exists:\n\nExample 1:\n- Cols 0,1: 1s exist \u2192 1 \u2713\n- Cols 2,3: 1s exist \u2192 1 \u2713\n- Col 4: 1s exist at rows 4,5? Let me check: row 4 col 4 is 0, row 5 col 4 is 0. No 1s \u2192 0 \u2713\n- Cols 5,6: 1s exist at rows 5,6 \u2192 1 (but we expected 0 for position 3)\n\nThis is still not working. Let me be more systematic.\n\nLet me divide 9 columns into 5 approximately equal regions:\n(0,1) (2,3) (4) (5,6) (7,8)\n\nActually wait, let me recheck Example 1 input:\nRow 4: \"1 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\" - so grid[4][0] = 1, grid[4][4] = 0\n\nSo column 4 in row 4 is 0, not 1.\n\nLet me try a different approach. What if the regions are:\n- Output[0]: columns 0,1  \n- Output[1]: columns 2,3\n- Output[2]: column 4\n- Output[3]: columns 5,6  \n- Output[4]: columns 7,8\n\nAnd for each region, output 1 if ANY 1 exists in that column range across ALL rows.\n\nExample 1:\n- Cols 0,1: 1s at (1,1), (2,1), (8,1) \u2192 1 \u2713\n- Cols 2,3: 1s at (0,2), (1,2), (2,2), (5,5), (6,5) \u2192 1 \u2713\n- Col 4: 1s at (4,0)? No, that's grid[4][0]=1. grid[0][4]=0, grid[1][4]=2, grid[2][4]=0, grid[3][4]=0, grid[4][4]=0, grid[5][4]=0, grid[6][4]=0, grid[7][4]=0, grid[8][4]=0. No 1s \u2192 0 \u2713\n- Cols 5,6: grid[0][5]=2, grid[1][5]=2, grid[2][5]=0, grid[3][5]=0, grid[4][5]=0, grid[5][5]=1, grid[6][5]=1, grid",

Let me recheck...\n\nActually, let me be more precise. Let me check if ANY 1 exists in each horizontal band:\n\nExample 3:\n- Rows 0-1: 2 2 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 and 2 2 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 \u2192 has 1s \u2192 1\n- Rows 2-3: 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 and 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 has 1s \u2192 1\n- Rows 4-5: 0 2 2 0 1 1 0 1 0 and 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 \u2192 has 1s \u2192 1\n- Rows 6-7: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 and 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 has 1s \u2192 1\n- Rows 8: 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 2 2 \u2192 has 1s \u2192 should be 1, but output is 0\n\nThere's an inconsistency. Let me reconsider the pattern.\n\nWait, maybe it's about whether 1s appear in the \"middle\" of each band, not just anywhere.\n\nOr maybe it's about a different division. Let me try dividing into exactly 5 equal horizontal strips, but 9 rows don't divide evenly by 5.\n\nActually, let me try a different approach: maybe the last position is special. Looking at all outputs, position 5 is 0.\n\nLet me try: rows 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, and check if 8 is treated differently, or maybe rows 7-8 together?\n\nExample 1:\n- Rows 0-1: has 1s \u2192 1\n- Rows 2-3: has 1s \u2192 1\n- Rows 4-5: has 1s \u2192 0 (but it has 1s!)\n- Rows 6-7: no 1s \u2192 0\n- Row 8: has 1s \u2192 0\n\nThis doesn't work consistently.\n\nLet me try a completely different approach. What if we look at specific fixed rows?\nOutput positions could correspond to:\n- Position 1: Row 1\n- Position 2: Row 3\n- Position 3: Row 5\n- Position 4: Row 7\n- Position 5: ?\n\nOr maybe it's about counting or some other property.\n\nLet me try: for each output position, check if the corresponding row (0-indexed) has at least one 1:\n\nExample 1:\n- Row 0: 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1 \u2192 has 1 \u2192 1\n- Row 1: 0 1 1 0 2 2 0 0 0 \u2192 has 1 \u2192 1\n- Row 2: 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 2 2 \u2192 has 1 \u2192 1, but output pos 3 should be 0\n\nThis doesn't align.\n\nLet me go back to my horizontal band approach but see if there's a different rule for the last position.\n\nActually, rechecking Example 3 more carefully:\nOutput: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\n- Rows 0-1: definitely has 1s \u2192 1 \u2713\n- Rows 2-3: definitely has 1s \u2192 1 \u2713\n- Rows 4-5: definitely has 1s \u2192 1 \u2713\n- Rows 6-7: definitely has 1s \u2192 1 \u2713\n- Row 8: definitely has 1s \u2192 but",

              "content": "Looking at the training examples, I need to analyze the patterns that map 9\u00d79 input grids to 1\u00d75 output grids.\n\nLet me examine each example carefully:\n\nExample 1:\n- Input: 9\u00d79 grid with various patterns of 0s, 1s, and 2s\n- Output: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n\nExample 2:\n- Input: 9\u00d79 grid with various patterns of 0s, 1s, and 2s\n- Output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nExample 3:\n- Input: 9\u00d79 grid with various patterns of 0s, 1s, and 2s\n- Output: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nLooking at the outputs, they all have 5 elements. Let me try to find what determines each position in the output array.\n\nLet me analyze column-wise patterns:\n- Maybe I should look at whether certain columns or regions contain specific values\n- Perhaps count occurrences of 1s and 2s in specific areas\n- Or check for connectivity/components of certain values\n\nLooking more carefully at the structure:\n- The output is always 1\u00d75\n- Most outputs start with 1s and end with 0s\n- Let me check if it's related to connected components or specific regions\n\nLet me try a hypothesis: maybe each position in the output corresponds to checking if there's a connected component of 1s or 2s in specific regions of the grid.\n\nAnother approach: let me look at the grid as divided into 5 vertical sections and check for presence of 1s or specific patterns.\n\nActually, let me look at rows and see if there's a pattern:\n- Maybe check if certain rows contain 1s in specific column ranges\n- Or check the distribution of values across the grid\n\nLet me try a different approach - perhaps the output represents whether certain conditions are met in different horizontal sections:\n\nHypothesis: Divide the 9\u00d79 grid into 5 vertical sections (columns 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8) and check for presence of 1s or other patterns.\n\nLet me check this:\n- Columns 0-1: Check if there are any 1s\n- Columns 2-3: Check if there are any 1s  \n- Columns 4-5: Check if there are any 1s\n- Columns 6-7: Check if there are any 1s\n- Column 8: Check if there are any 1s\n\nLet me verify with Example 1:\nColumns 0-1: has 1s in rows 1,2,4,8 \u2192 should be 1\nColumns 2-3: has 1s in rows 0,1,2,5,6 \u2192 should be 1  \nColumns 4-5: has 1s in rows 4,5,6 \u2192 should be 1\nColumns 6-7: has 1s in rows 2,3,5,6 \u2192 should be 1\nColumn 8: has 1s in rows 0,3,8 \u2192 should be 1\n\nBut output is [1, 1, 0, 0, 0], so this doesn't match.\n\nLet me try horizontal sections instead:\n- Rows 0-1: Check something\n- Rows 2-3: Check something\n- Rows 4-5: Check something\n- Rows 6-7: Check something  \n- Rows 8: Check something\n\nOr maybe it's about specific patterns or shapes.\n\nLet me look for another pattern - maybe it's about counting connected components or specific arrangements.\n\nActually, let me try: check each pair of columns for presence of 1s:\n- Columns 0-1: has 1s \u2192 1\n- Columns 2-3: has 1s \u2192 1\n- Columns 4-5: has 1s \u2192 1\n- Columns 6-7: has 1s \u2192 1\n- Columns 8-9: only column 8, has 1s \u2192 but output is 0\n\nWait, let me recheck Example 1 more carefully.\n\nLet me try a different approach: check for 2\u00d72 squares of 1s or 2s in specific regions.\n\nActually, let me step back and think of a simpler approach:\n\nMaybe it's about checking if there are any 1s in specific column pairs:\n- Columns 0-1: any 1s?\n- Columns 2-3: any 1s?\n- Columns 4-5: any 1s?\n- Columns 6-7: any 1s?\n- Columns 8: any 1s?\n\nExample 1:\n- Columns 0-1: rows 1,2,4,8 have 1s \u2192 1\n- Columns 2-3: rows 0,1,2,8 have 1s \u2192 1\n- Columns 4-5: row 4,5,6 have 1s \u2192 1\n- Columns 6-7: rows 2,5,6 have 1s \u2192 1\n- Column 8: rows 0,3,8 have 1s \u2192 1\n\nStill doesn't match [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nLet me try checking for 2s instead, or some other combination.\n\nActually, let me look at this differently. Let me check for 1s but with a different grouping or condition.\n\nNew hypothesis: Check if there are 1s in specific 2-row bands:\n- Rows 0-1: any 1s in columns 0-1?\n- Rows 2-3: any 1s in columns 2-3?  \n- Rows 4-5: any 1s in columns 4-5?\n- Rows 6-7: any 1s in columns 6-7?\n- Row 8: any 1s in column 8?\n\nExample 1:\n- Rows 0-1, cols 0-1: [0,0], [1,1] \u2192 has 1s \u2192 1\n- Rows 2-3, cols 2-3: [1,1], [0,0] \u2192 has 1s \u2192 1\n- Rows 4-5, cols 4-5: [0,0], [0,1] \u2192 has 1s \u2192 1\n- Rows 6-7, cols 6-7: [0,0], [0,0] \u2192 no 1s \u2192 0\n- Row 8, col 8: [1] \u2192 has 1s \u2192 1\n\nBut output is [1,1,0,0,0], so last should be 0, not 1.\n\nLet me try a different approach. What if I check for the presence of 1s in each of 5 equal-width vertical strips?\n\n9 columns divided into 5 parts: roughly columns 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8\n\nBut I already tried that.\n\nLet me try: look at the count or density of 1s in each region.\n\nActually, let me try this systematic approach:\nCheck for 1s in these column ranges:\n1. Columns 0-1\n2. Columns 2-3  \n3. Columns 4-5\n4. Columns 6-7\n5. Column 8\n\nBut make it more specific - maybe check if there's a \"significant\" presence or specific pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs again:\nExample 1: [1,1,0,0,0]\nExample 2: [1,1,1,1,0] \nExample 3: [1,1,1,1,0]\n\nThe last position is often 0. Let me check what's in column 8 in each example.\n\nExample 1 column 8: [1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1] - has 1s in positions 0,2,3,8\nExample 2 column 8: [2,0,1,1,0,2,0,0,0] - has 1s in positions 2,3\nExample 3 column 8: [0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0] - has 1s in position 2\n\nSo column 8 has 1s in all examples but output is 0 for last position.\n\nLet me try a different hypothesis: maybe it's about whether there are connected components that span across the grid or touch certain boundaries.\n\nActually, let me try one more simple approach: \nDivide into 5 vertical strips, each 1-2 columns wide, and check if there's at least one 1 in each strip.\n\nStrips: [0-1], [2-3], [4-5], [6-7], [8]\n\nExample 1:\n- Strip 0-1: has 1s \u2192 1\n- Strip 2-3: has 1s \u2192 1  \n- Strip 4-5: has 1s \u2192 1\n- Strip 6-7: has",

The output is always a 1\u00d75 grid\n2. Output values are only 0s and 1s\n3. Let me check if there's a pattern based on rows or columns\n\nLooking at the outputs:\n- Example 1: [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n- Example 2: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n- Example 3: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]\n\nLet me think about what could generate these patterns. One possibility is that we're looking at specific rows or columns, or perhaps counting occurrences of certain patterns.\n\nLet me check if the output corresponds to whether certain rows/columns contain specific values:\n\nAnother approach - let me look at this systematically by checking if certain regions or patterns in the input grid determine the output values.\n\nLooking more carefully at the relationship:\n- Position 0 in output: 1 in all examples\n- Position 1 in output: 1 in all examples\n- Position 2 in output: 0 in example 1, 1 in examples 2&3\n- Position 3 in output: 0 in example 1, 1 in examples 2&3\n- Position 4 in output: 0 in all examples\n\nLet me consider if this might be related to connected components, specific shapes, or perhaps counting occurrences of 1s or 2s in certain regions.\n\nAnother hypothesis: maybe we're looking at the grid in 5 vertical sections (since output is 5 elements) and determining if each section contains at least one '1'.\n\nLet's try dividing the 9\u00d79 grid into 5 sections:\n- Section 1: columns 0-1\n- Section 2: columns 2-3\n- Section 3: columns 4-5\n- Section 4: columns 6-7\n- Section 5: column 8\n\nLet me check this hypothesis:\n\nExample 1:\n- Section 1 (cols 0-1): has 1s? Yes (row 1,2 have 1s) \u2192 1\n- Section 2 (cols 2-3): has 1s? Yes (row 1,2 have 1s) \u2192 1\n- Section 3 (cols 4-5): has 1s? Yes (row 0,1,2,4,5 have 1s) \u2192 1 (but output is 0)\n\nThis doesn't match. Let me try another approach.\n\nLet me check if it's based on rows instead:\nMaybe check if rows 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8 contain 1s:\n\nExample 1:\n- Rows 0-1: has 1s? Yes (row 1) \u2192 1\n- Rows 2-3: has 1s? Yes (row 2) \u2192 1\n- Rows 4-5: has 1s? Yes (row 4,5) \u2192 1 (but output position 2 is 0)\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe it's about counting or specific patterns.\n\nLet me look at the positions of 1s in each example and see if there's a geometric pattern.\n\nActually, let me try this approach: divide the 9\u00d79 grid into 5 vertical strips and check for presence of 1s:\n\nStrips: columns [0-1], [2-3], [4-5], [6-7], [8]\n\nExample 1:\n- Strip 1 (cols 0-1): 1s at (1,1), (2,1) \u2192 has 1s \u2192 1\n- Strip 2 (cols 2-3): 1s at (1,2), (2,2) \u2192 has 1s \u2192 1\n- Strip 3 (cols 4-5): 1s at (0,4), (1,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5) \u2192 has 1s \u2192 1 (but output is 0)\n\nThis still doesn't work. Let me reconsider...\n\nMaybe it's not just about presence of 1s, but about specific patterns or connectivity.\n\nLet me try a different hypothesis: maybe we're looking at specific predefined regions or using a different grouping.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps we need to look at the central column or use some kind of convolution.\n\nLet me try a simpler approach - what if we count how many 1s are in each of 5 horizontal bands?\n\nBands: rows [0-1], [2-3], [4-5], [6-7], [8]\n\nExample 1:\n- Band 0-1: 1s at (1,1), (1,2) \u2192 count > 0 \u2192 1\n- Band 2-3: 1s at (2,1), (2,2) \u2192 count > 0 \u2192 1\n- Band 4-5: 1s at (4,0), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5) \u2192 count > 0 \u2192 1 (but output is 0)\n\nStill not matching. Let me think of another pattern.\n\nWhat if the output represents something about the corners or edges of shapes?\n\nLet me try one more systematic approach: check each output position against specific rules.\n\nLooking at outputs again:\nPosition 0: always 1\nPosition 1: always 1\nPosition 4: always 0\n\nPositions 2,3: 0 in example 1, 1 in examples 2,3\n\nMaybe positions 2,3 depend on whether there are 1s in the middle rows (3,4,5)?\n\nLet me check:\nExample 1: rows 3-5 have 1s at (4,0), (5,4), (5,5) \u2192 but output pos 2,3 are 0\nExample 2: rows 3-5 have 1s at (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3) \u2192 output pos 2,3 are 1\nExample 3: rows 3-5 have 1s at (4,2), (4,3), (5,2), (5,3) \u2192 output pos 2,3 are 1\n\nThis looks promising! \n\nSo my hypothesis:\n- Position 0: 1 (always)\n- Position 1: 1 (always) \n- Position 2: 1 if rows 3-5 contain 1s in columns 2-3, 0 otherwise\n- Position 3: 1 if rows 3-5 contain 1s in columns 4-5, 0 otherwise\n- Position 4: 0 (always)\n\nLet me verify:\nExample 1:\n- Position 2: rows 3-5, cols 2-3: 1s at (4,2)? No, (4,0) is the only 1. So 0 \u2713\n- Position 3: rows 3-5, cols 4-5: 1s at (4,4)? Yes, (4,4) and (5,4), (5,5). So 1 \u2717 (expected 0)\n\nThis doesn't work. Let me reconsider the column ranges.\n\nLet me try a different systematic approach by looking at what features distinguish example 1 from examples 2&3.\n\nActually let me step back and try dividing the grid into 5 vertical sections differently:\n\nMaybe: columns 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8-8 for the 5 output positions.\n\nFor each section, output 1 if that section contains at least one '1', 0 otherwise.\n\nExample 1:\n- Cols 0-1: 1s at (1,1), (2,1), (4,0) \u2192 1\n- Cols 2-3: 1s at (1,2), (2,2) \u2192 1  \n- Cols 4-5: 1s at (0,4), (1,4), (4,4), (5,4), (5,5), (6,5) \u2192 1 (but expected 0)\n\nThis still doesn't work.\n\nLet me try looking at this more carefully. What if I consider that we're looking at specific predefined patterns?\n\nActually, let me try looking at this from a",

Let me think about what could be generating these patterns.\n\nLet me check if there's a pattern based on counting occurrences or detecting specific structures:\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Output is [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n- There seem to be two distinct connected components of 1s, so maybe first position is 1\n- There are connected components of 2s, so maybe second position is 1\n- The remaining positions could be based on some other criteria\n\nLet me look at this more systematically. Perhaps the output is based on detecting certain patterns in rows or columns.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- Position 1: Might indicate presence of connected components of 1s\n- Position 2: Might indicate presence of connected components of 2s\n- Positions 3-5: Might be based on other patterns\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let's look at the structure more carefully.\n\nActually, let me check if it's based on the number of connected components:\n- Example 1: Multiple components of 1s \u2192 first position 1, multiple components of 2s \u2192 second position 1\n- Example 2: Multiple components of 1s \u2192 first position 1, multiple components of 2s \u2192 second position 1\n- Example 3: Multiple components of 1s \u2192 first position 1, multiple components of 2s \u2192 second position 1\n\nBut that doesn't fully explain it since all examples seem to have multiple components.\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe it's about detecting specific patterns or shapes.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at whether there are horizontal lines, vertical lines, or specific arrangements.\n\nActually, let me try to think of this as a feature detection problem:\n1. First position: Presence of connected 1s\n2. Second position: Presence of connected 2s\n3. Third position: Some other feature\n4. Fourth position: Some other feature\n5. Fifth position: Some other feature\n\nLooking at the outputs again:\n- All examples have [1, 1, ...] in the first two positions\n- Examples 2 and 3 end with [1, 1, 0]\n- Example 1 ends with [0, 0, 0]\n\nLet me try to find a more concrete pattern.

Let me check columns - divide the 9 columns into 5 groups and see if there are 1s in those column groups.\n\nColumns 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8\n\nLet me check Example 1:\nColumns 0-1: has 1s (column 1)\nColumns 2-3: has 1s (column 2)  \nColumns 4-5: has 1s (columns 4,5)\nColumns 6-7: has 1s (column 6)\nColumns 8: has 1s (column 8)\n\nThat would give [1,1,1,1,1] but output is [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nLet me try checking for 2s instead:\nColumns 0-1: has 2s (column 0)\nColumns 2-3: no 2s\nColumns 4-5: has 2s (columns 4,5)\nColumns 6-7: has 2s (columns 6,7)\nColumns 8: has 2s (column 8)\n\nThat gives [1,0,1,1,1] but output is [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nLet me try a different approach. What if I look at the grid as 5 vertical sections of varying widths?\n\nActually, let me reconsider horizontal sections:\nRows 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8\n\nExample 1:\nRows 0-1: has 1s\nRows 2-3: has 1s\nRows 4-5: has 1s\nRows 6-7: no 1s\nRows 8: has 1s\n\nThat gives [1,1,1,0,1] but output is [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nLet me try a different grouping or different logic.\n\nWhat if I'm looking for connected components that span certain areas?\n\nLet me try: check if there's a connected component of 1s that touches each of 5 horizontal strips.\n\nActually, let me look at this differently. What if the output represents some property of the distribution of 1s across the grid?\n\nLet me check for the presence of 1s in specific column ranges:\nMaybe columns [0,1], [2,3], [4,5], [6,7], [8] but looking for connected components or specific patterns.\n\nLet me try another approach: count how many separate groups of 1s exist in each column group.\n\nActually, let me step back and look at what makes examples 2 and 3 have the same output [1,1,1,1,0] while example 1 has [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nLet me try checking if there exists at least one connected component of 1s in each of 5 regions.\n\nWhat if I divide the 9\u00d79 grid into 5 vertical strips:\n- Columns 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8\n- And check if there's a connected component of 1s in each strip\n\nBut I need to implement connected component detection for that.\n\nLet me try a simpler approach first - just check if there's any 1 in each column group:\nColumns [0,1], [2,3], [4,5], [6,7], [8]\n\nExample 1:\nColumns 0-1: has 1s (at positions like (1,1), (2,1), (8,1))\nColumns 2-3: has 1s (at positions like (0,2), (1,2), (2,2))\nColumns 4-5: has 1s (at positions like (5,4), (6,4), (5,5), (6,5))\nColumns 6-7: has 1s (at positions like (2,7), (3,7))\nColumns 8: has 1s (at positions like (0,8), (3,8), (8,8))\n\nThis would give [1,1,1,1,1] but output is [1,1,0,0,0].\n\nHmm, let me reconsider what \"connected component\" means. Maybe I need to do actual connected component analysis.\n\nLet me try a different hypothesis. What if I look at the maximum number of connected components of 1s in each column section?\n\nOr maybe I'm supposed to check if there's a connected component that spans a certain width or height?\n\nLet me try a very different approach: what if the output represents whether there are 1s in the corners or specific positions?\n\nActually, let me re-examine the problem more systematically. Let me check if there are connected components of 1s that are at least 2x2 in size in each column section.\n\nLet me try to implement a connected components approach:\n\nFor each column section, I'll check if there's a connected component of 1s of size at least 2.\n\nBut first, let me try something simpler and see if it works.\n\nLooking at the outputs again:\n[1,1,0,0,0] \n[1,1,1,1,0]\n[1,1,1,1,0]\n\nThe last position is always 0. The first two are always 1.\n\nLet me check what's in the rightmost column (column 8):\nExample 1: 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1 - has 1s\nExample 2: 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0 - has 1s\nExample 3: 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2 - has 1s\n\nSo it's not simply about presence of 1s in the last column.\n\nLet me try one more approach: maybe the output represents whether there's a 2x2 square of 1s in certain regions.\n\nLet me divide the grid into 5 vertical regions:\nColumns 0-1, 2-3, 4-5, 6-7, 8\nAnd check if there's a 2x2 square of 1s in each region.\n\nExample 1:\nColumns 0-1: 2x2 squares of 1s at rows 1-2? Yes, positions (1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2) - but (1,2) and (2,2) are in column 2. So no 2x2 in columns 0-1.\nActually, positions (1,0),(1,1),(2,0),(2,1) - (1,0) and (2,0) are 0, (1,1) and (2,1) are 1. Not a 2x2 square.\n\nLet me check positions (1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(2,2) - but column 2 is not in range 0-1.\n\nWait, let me recheck the grid indexing. Grid[row][col].\n\nExample 1 input:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 1\nRow 1: 0 1 1 0 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 1 1 0 0",
