          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a 0 in the first row, then a row with 2s except for the ends. Then there's a row with 2s and some 0s. The output seems to have more 2s in the middle. Wait, in the output, the third row has all 2s except the ends. The fourth row has 2s on the left and right, with a 5 in the middle. Then the fifth row has a 5 in the middle. Hmm, maybe the 5s are being expanded or spread out?\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 5 in the middle of the fourth row. The output has 5s in the middle of some rows. Also, there's a 5 in the fifth row of the output. Wait, maybe the 5s are being placed in certain positions based on their original positions. Like, maybe the 5s are being mirrored or expanded in some way.\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has a 5 in the middle of some rows. The output has 5s in the middle of rows. But in the output, the 5s are spread out more. For example, in the fifth row of the output, there's a 5 in the fifth column. Wait, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are symmetric or in certain patterns.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output starts and ends with 0s in the first row. The output rows have 2s in the middle, but some rows have 5s in the middle. So perhaps the 5s are being introduced in certain positions based on the original input.\n\nWait, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are symmetrically placed. For example, in Example 1, the original input has a 5 in the fourth row, fifth column. The output has 5s in the fourth row, fifth column, but also in other positions. Wait, no, in Example 1's output, the fourth row has a 5 in the fifth column. The fifth row has a 5 in the sixth column. Hmm, maybe the 5s are being expanded in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being mirrored. For instance, in Example 1, the original input has a 5 in the fourth row, fifth column. The output has 5s in the fourth row, fifth column and also in the fourth row, sixth column? Wait, no. Let me check the output of Example 1 again.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the fourth row is 0 2 2 2 5 0 0 5 2 0 0. Wait, the fifth column is 5, and the seventh column is 5. So maybe the 5s are placed symmetrically around the center. But the original input's fifth row has a 5 in the fifth column. Wait, maybe the 5s are being mirrored horizontally or vertically.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions where 5s appear in the input and output. For example, in Example 1's input, the fourth row has a 5 in the fifth column. The output's fourth row has 5s in the fifth and seventh columns. So maybe the 5 is being expanded to both sides? But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the center of the grid. For example, in a 8x11 grid, the center is around column 5 (since 11 columns, indices 0-10, so middle is 5). So maybe the 5s are placed in positions that are mirrored around the center.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output: the fourth row has a 5 in column 4 (index 4) and 6 (index 6). Wait, that's symmetric around column 5. So maybe the 5s are being mirrored. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nIn the input of Example 1, the fourth row has a 5 in column 4 (index 4). The output has 5s in columns 4 and 6. So maybe the 5 is being mirrored across the center. But then why in the fifth row of the output, there's a 5 in column 5 (the middle)? Because in the input, the fifth row has a 5 in column 5 (original input's fifth row is 0 2 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0). So maybe the 5 is being expanded to the center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being expanded in a way that they spread out from their original positions. For example, if there's a 5 in the input, it's being replaced by 5s in certain positions.\n\nAnother idea: The 5s in the output are replacing the 0s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's input, the fourth row has a 5 in column 4. The output has 5s in columns 4 and 6. But maybe the 5 is being spread out to both sides. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the output are placed in positions that are symmetrically mirrored. For example, if there's a 5 in the input at (row, col), then in the output, there are 5s at (row, col) and (row, 10 - col). Because the grid is 11 columns wide. Let's check this.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the fourth row has a 5 at column 4 (index 4). The output's fourth row has 5s at column 4 and 6. Wait, 10 - 4 is 6. So that would fit. Then, for the fifth row of the input, which has a 5 at column 5 (index 5), the output has a 5 at column 5. But 10 - 5 is 5, so that's the same position. So that would make sense. So maybe the 5s are mirrored across the vertical axis. But why would that be the case?\n\nBut in Example 2, let's check. The input's fifth row has a 5 in column 4 (original input's fifth row is 0 2 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0). So column 4 (index 4). The output's fifth row has a 5 in column 4 and 6. Wait, in the output of Example 2, the fifth row is 0 2 2 5 0 2 2 2 2 0 0. Wait, no, the output for Example 2's fifth row is 0 2 2 5 0 2 2 2 2 0 0. So the 5 is in column 3 (index 3). Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe my initial idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being mirrored horizontally. Let me think again. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 5 in column 4 (index 4) of row 4. The output has 5s in column 4 and 6. So maybe the 5 is mirrored across the vertical center. But for a 11-column grid, the center is at column 5. So 4 and 6 are symmetric around 5. So that would make sense. But in Example 2, the fifth row's input has a 5 at column 4 (index 4), and the output's fifth row has a 5 at column 3 (index 3) and 7 (index 7)? Wait, looking at Example 2's output for the fifth row:\n\nThe output of Example 2's fifth row is 0 2 2 5 0 2 2 2 2 0 0. Wait, that's 0 2 2 5 0 2 2 2 2 0 0. So the 5 is at column 3 (index 3). But the original input's fifth row has a 5 at column 4 (index 4). So that's not symmetric. Hmm, this contradicts the previous idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being spread out in some other way. Maybe the 5s are being expanded in a diamond shape or something. Or perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions where their original position is in a certain area.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 3. The input has 5s in the middle of certain rows. The output has 5s in the middle of those rows, but also in other positions. For example, in the fifth row of the input, there's a 5 in column 4 (index 4) and 6 (index 6). The output's fifth row has a 5 in column 4 and 6. Wait, but in the output of Example 3, the fifth row is 0 2 2 2 5 0 0 0 2 2 2 0. Wait, no, the output is:\n\nIn Example 3's output, the fifth row is 0 2 2 2 5 0 0 0 2 2 2 0. Wait, that's 0 2 2 2 5 0 0 0 2 2 2 0. So the 5 is in column 4 (index 4). But in the input, the fifth row has a 5 in column 4 and 6. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being expanded in a way that they are mirrored across the vertical axis. For example, if there's a 5 in column c, then in the output, there's a 5 in column c and 10 - c. But in Example 2's fifth row, the input has a 5 at column 4 (index 4). The output's fifth row has a 5 at column 3 (index 3). That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being mirrored across the horizontal axis. But that would be for rows. For example, if a 5 is in row i, then it's mirrored in row (7 - i), since the output has 8 rows. Let's check Example 1. The input's fourth row (row index 3) has a 5. The output's fourth row (row index 3) has a 5. But the output's fifth row (row index 4) has a 5 in column 5. The input's fifth row (row index 4) has a 5 in column 5. So that's the same. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being spread out in certain positions based on their original positions. For example, if there's a 5 in the input, then in the output, it's replaced by a 5 in certain positions. But how?\n\nAnother idea: The 5s in the output are placed in positions where their original positions are in certain areas. For example, in the input, the 5s are in the middle of the grid, and the output expands them to the left and right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are symmetrically placed in the grid. For example, in the output, the 5s are placed in positions that are mirrored around the vertical center. So for each 5 in the input, we create two 5s in the output, one on each side of the vertical center. But how does that work for the fifth row?\n\nWait, let's take Example 1's input. The fourth row has a 5 in column 4. The output has 5s in columns 4 and 6. So 4 and 6 are symmetric around 5 (the center). So for a 11-column grid, the vertical center is at column 5. So 4 and 6 are symmetric. Similarly, in the fifth row of the input, there's a 5 at column 5 (the center). So in the output, it's still there. So maybe the 5s are mirrored across the vertical center. But then, in Example 2's fifth row, the input has a 5 at column 4. The output's fifth row has a 5 at column 3 (index 3) and 7 (index 7)? Wait, let me check the output for Example 2 again.\n\nIn Example 2's output, the fifth row is 0 2 2 5 0 2 2 2 2 0 0. Wait, that's columns 0-10. The 5 is at column 3. But according to the vertical center (column 5), 3 is 2 positions left of the center, and 7 is 2 positions right. So if the input has a 5 at column 4, then the output would have 5s at column 3 and 7? But the output's fifth row has a 5 at column 3. So that would be symmetric. But why is there only one 5 in the output?\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the 5s are in the middle of the grid. The input's 5s are in the middle. But in the output, they are spread out. Maybe the 5s are being replaced by 5s in a way that they are expanded in certain directions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are adjacent to the original 5s. For example, if there's a 5 in the input, then in the output, it's replaced by 5s in positions that are adjacent. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the positions of the 5s. For example, in Example 1, the input's fourth row has a 5 in column 4, and the output has 5s in columns 4 and 6. Then, in the fifth row of the input, there's a 5 in column 5, and the output has a 5 in column 5. So maybe the 5s are being mirrored across the vertical center. But for columns that are already in the center, they remain.\n\nIn Example 2, the fifth row of the input has a 5 at column 4. The output's fifth row has a 5 at column 3. But that doesn't fit the mirroring. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong rows. Let me check Example 2's input and output again.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nRow 4 (assuming rows are 0-based) is 0 2 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So column 4 (index 4) is 5. The output's fifth row (row index 4) is 0 2 2 5 0 2 2 2 2 0 0. So the 5 is at column 3 (index 3). That's one position to the left of the original column 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being expanded to the left and right in certain ways. For example, if there's a 5 in column c, then in the output, there are 5s in columns c-1 and c+1. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions where they are in the middle of a certain area. For example, in Example 1's output, the 5s are in the middle of the grid. So perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions that are symmetrically placed in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions that are part of a larger pattern. For example, the 5s are part of a diamond shape or something else.\n\nAnother observation: The output grids have 2s in the middle of the grid, except for the rows where there are 5s. So maybe the 2s are spread out in a certain way, and the 5s are placed in positions that are symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain 0s with 5s based on their position relative to the 2s. For example, if a 0 is in a position that is between two 2s, then it becomes a 5.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, in the input, if there's a 5 in the middle of a row, then in the output, it's expanded to the middle of the grid. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to expand the 5s to the left and right, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being mirrored across the vertical center, but the original 5s are in positions that are not symmetric. For example, in Example 2's fifth row, the input has a 5 in column 4 (index 4), and the output has a 5 in column 3 (index 3), which is one position left of the center. That doesn't fit the mirroring idea.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of expanding 5s in certain ways and keeping 2s as they are.\n\nAnother idea: The output has 2s in the middle of the grid, except for the rows where 5s are present. So perhaps the 5s are being introduced where the original input has 5s, and then they are expanded in certain ways.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the vertical center. So for each 5 in the input, we add 5s in symmetric positions. But how to determine that.\n\nFor example, if a 5 is at (row, col) in the input, then in the output, we add 5s at (row, col) and (row, 10 - col). Because the grid has 11 columns. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the fourth row (row 3) has a 5 at column 4 (index 4). So 10 - 4 is 6. So the output would have 5s at column 4 and 6. Which matches the output of Example 1's fourth row.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row (row 4), the input has a 5 at column 5 (index 5). So 10 - 5 is 5. So the output has a 5 at column 5, which matches.\n\nIn Example 2's fifth row (row 4), the input has a 5 at column 4 (index 4). So the output would have 5s at column 4 and 6. But in the output of Example 2's fifth row, the 5 is at column 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe this idea is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being mirrored across the vertical center, but the original 5s are in positions that are not symmetric. For example, in Example 2's fifth row, the input has a 5 at column 4 (index 4), and the output has a 5 at column 3. But according to the mirroring idea, it should be at column 6. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the mirroring is across the horizontal axis. For example, if there's a 5 in row i, then it's mirrored in row (7 - i). Let's check Example 1. The input's fourth row (row 3) has a 5. The output's fourth row (row 3) has a 5. But the input's fifth row (row 4) has a 5, and the output's fifth row (row 4) has a 5. So that doesn't fit. Unless the mirroring is vertical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being expanded in a certain way based on their position. For example, if a 5 is in the middle of a row, it's kept, but if it's not, it's mirrored.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as replacing certain 0s with 5s based on their position. For example, in the output, the 5s are placed in positions where the original input has 0s, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions that are in the middle of certain regions. For example, in the input, the 5s are in the middle of the grid, and the output expands them to the middle of the grid.\n\nAnother idea: The output has 2s in the middle of the grid, and the 5s are placed where the original input has 5s, but expanded in some way. For example, the 5s are being placed in positions that are symmetrically placed in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions and 5s in others. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, in the output, the 5s are in positions that are symmetric around the vertical center. So for each 5 in the input, we add 5s in symmetric positions.\n\nBut why in Example 2's fifth row, the output has a 5 at column 3? Maybe the input's fifth row has a 5 at column 4, and the output has a 5 at column 3 and 7. But in the output, there's only one 5. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being expanded to the left and right in certain rows. For example, in rows where the input has a 5 in the middle, the output has 5s in the middle. But for rows where the input has a 5 in the left part, the output has 5s in the middle.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in the output, the 2s are spread out in the middle of the grid, and the 5s are in certain positions.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 3. The input has 5s in the middle of the rows. The output has 5s in the middle of those rows. For example, in the fifth row of the input, the 5 is in column 4 and 6. The output has a 5 in column 4 and 6. Wait, but the output of Example 3's fifth row is 0 2 2 2 5 0 0 0 2 2 2 0. So the 5 is in column 4. Hmm, that's not matching. So maybe the 5s are not being mirrored.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are in the middle of certain regions. For example, in the input, the 5s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to translate that into code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain 0s with 5s if they are in the middle of a row. For example, if a row has a 5 in the middle, then the 0s around it are replaced with 5s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have 2s in the middle of the grid, and the 5s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed. For example, in Example 1's output, the 5s are in positions that are symmetric around the vertical center.\n\nSo, perhaps the transformation is to mirror the 5s across the vertical center. So, for each 5 in the input, we add 5s in symmetric positions. But how to handle that.\n\nSo, the code would be: for each cell in the input grid, if it's a 5, then in the output, we set the cell and its mirror across the vertical center to 5. But what about the other cells?\n\nBut in Example 1's input, the fourth row has a 5 in column 4. The output has 5s in columns 4 and 6. So that fits. In Example 1's fifth row, the input has a 5 in column 5. The output has it in column 5. So that fits.\n\nIn Example 2's fifth row, the input has a 5 in column 4. The output has a 5 in column 3. But according to the mirroring, it should be in column 6. So this is conflicting. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the mirroring is not across the vertical center, but across the horizontal center. Or maybe the mirroring is across both axes. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is across the vertical center, but the original 5 is in a position that is not symmetric. For example, if the original 5 is in column 4, then the mirrored position is 6. But in Example 2's fifth row, the output has a 5 in column 3. That doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe there's another pattern. Let's look at the test input and see what the output would be.\n\nThe test input has a 5 in the fourth row, fifth column. The output would have 5s in symmetric positions. So for the fourth row, column 5 is the center. So the mirrored position would be the same. So the output would have 5 in that position. But the test input's output is not given, so I can't check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid. So, for example, if the input has a 5 in the middle of a row, it remains, but if it's not, it's mirrored.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I need to make a hypothesis.\n\nLet me try to think of the transformation as follows:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid, if it's a 5, then in the output, the cell and its mirrored counterpart across the vertical center are set to 5. For other cells, they remain as is.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nSo, for each cell (row, col) in the input grid:\n\nif the cell is 5, then in the output grid, set (row, col) and (row, 10 - col) to 5.\n\nBut what about if the cell is already 5 and 10 - col is the same as col (like the center column)? Then it's only set once.\n\nBut in Example 1's fifth row, the input has a 5 in column 5 (10 - 5 = 5), so it's set once.\n\nIn Example 2's fifth row, the input has a 5 in column 4. So the output would have 5 in column 4 and 6. But in the output of Example 2's fifth row, it's only at column 3. So that doesn't fit. So maybe this is not the correct pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is across the horizontal center. For example, if a 5 is in row i, then it's mirrored in row (7 - i). But how?\n\nFor example, in Example 1's input, the fourth row (row 3) has a 5. The output's fourth row (row 3) has a 5. The fifth row (row 4) has a 5 in the output. So that would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being mirrored in both directions. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid, and the 2s are being expanded to fill the rest.\n\nBut how to code that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions where their original position is in the middle of a row, and then the 5s are expanded to the left and right.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions where they are in the middle of the grid, and the 2s are being expanded in a certain way.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for the most common pattern between the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1 and 3, the output has 5s in the middle of certain rows. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a 5 in the middle, and the output has 5s in the middle. In Example 3, the fifth row has a 5 in the middle, and the output has a 5 in the middle.\n\nSo perhaps the 5s are being kept in their original positions, but also expanded to the left and right if they are in the middle.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 5s in certain positions. For example, if the input has a 5 in the middle of a row, then in the output, the middle of the row is a 5, and the surrounding cells are also 5s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being expanded in a diamond shape. For example, if there's a 5 in the middle, it expands to the left and right, and up and down.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAnother observation: The output grids have 2s in the middle of the grid, and the 5s are in the middle of certain rows. So perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions that are symmetrically placed in the grid.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the 5s are being mirrored across the vertical center. So, for each 5 in the input, the output has 5s in the same column and its mirrored column. For other cells, they remain the same.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n    for each column in the row:\n        if the cell is 5:\n            set the cell and its mirrored column to 5 in the output grid.\n\nBut what about other cells? For example, in the output, the 2s are kept as is, and the 0s are replaced with 5s only if they are mirrored.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nWait, the input and output grids have 2s in the middle. So maybe the 2s are kept as is, and the 5s are mirrored.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nCreate a new grid, initialized to the input.\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n    for each column in the row:\n        if the cell is 5:\n            mirrored_col = 10 - column\n            if mirrored_col != column:\n                set the mirrored_col in the same row to 5.\n\nBut wait, this would set the mirrored column to 5, even if it's already 5. But this would work for the examples.\n\nLet's test this on Example 1.\n\nInput row 3 (fourth row) has a 5 at column 4. mirrored_col is 10 - 4 = 6. So in the output, column 4 and 6 are set to 5. Which matches the output.\n\nIn the fifth row (row 4), the input has a 5 at column 5. mirrored_col is 5, so no change. So the output has it as 5.\n\nIn Example 2's fifth row, the input has a 5 at column 4. mirrored_col is 6. So the output would have 5 at column 4 and 6. But in the output of Example 2, the fifth row has a 5 at column 3. So this doesn't match. So perhaps this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in the example.\n\nWait, in Example 2's output, the fifth row is:\n\n0 2 2 5 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n\nSo the 5 is at column 3. According to the hypothesis, if the input has a 5 at column 4, the output would have 5 at column 4 and 6. But the output has a 5 at column 3. So this contradicts.\n\nSo this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 5s are being mirrored across the horizontal center. For example, if there's a 5 in row i, then it's mirrored in row (7 - i).\n\nLet's test this on Example 1's input. The fourth row (row 3) has a 5. The mirrored row would be 7 - 3 = 4 (row 4). The output's row 4 has a 5 in column 5. So this would match. But the input's row 4 has a 5 in column 5. So the output would have it in row 4. So this would fit.\n\nBut how about the fifth row of Example 1's input, which has a 5 in column 5. The mirrored row would be 7 - 4 = 3 (row 3). The output's row 3 has a 5 in column 4 and 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being mirrored in both directions. For example, if there's a 5 in (row, col), then it's mirrored in (row, 10 - col) and (7 - row, col) and (7 - row, 10 - col). But this would create more 5s.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with the initial hypothesis that the 5s are mirrored across the vertical center, and see if it works for some examples, even if not all.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row_idx in range(8):\n        for col_idx in range(11):\n            if grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 5:\n                mirrored_col = 10 - col_idx\n                if mirrored_col != col_idx:\n                    transformed[row_idx][mirrored_col] = 5\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, this would set the mirrored column to 5, but what if the original cell is 5 and the mirrored column is already 5? It would overwrite it, but that's okay.\n\nLet's test this on Example 1.\n\nExample 1's input has a 5 in row 3, column 4. So mirrored_col is 6. So transformed[3][6] is set to 5. So the output's fourth row has 5 at column 4 and 6. Which matches the example.\n\nIn the fifth row (row 4), the input has a 5 at column 5. So mirrored_col is 5, so no change. So the output has it as 5.\n\nIn Example 2's input, the fifth row (row 4) has a 5 at column 4. So mirrored_col is 6. So transformed[4][6] is set to 5. But in the output of Example 2's fifth row, the 5 is at column 3. So this doesn't match. So this suggests the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the example. Let me recheck Example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nRow 4 (assuming rows are 0-based) is:\n\n0 2 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nSo column 4 is 5. The output's fifth row (row 4) is:\n\n0 2 2 5 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n\nSo the 5 is at column 3. According to the hypothesis, it should be at column 4 and 6. But in the output, it's at column 3. So this is a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 2's output, the fifth row has a 5 at column 3, which is one position to the left of the original column 4. So perhaps the mirroring is not across the vertical center, but across the horizontal center. Or perhaps it's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being expanded to the left and right in a certain way, like expanding to the next column.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that the 5s are being mirrored across the vertical center, even if it doesn't fit all examples. Maybe the examples are not perfectly aligned, and the hypothesis is the best I can come up with.\n\nSo the code would be as above. But I need to make sure that the output is 8x11.\n\nWait, the input is 8x11, and the output is 8x11. So the code is correct.\n\nBut the example 2's output doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 5s are being placed in positions where their original position is in the middle of a certain area. For example, if a 5 is in the middle of a row, it's kept, and if it's not, it's replaced with 2s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being replaced with 2s, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis and write the code, even if it may not fit all examples, but it's the best I can think of.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a 0 in the first row, then a row with 2s except for the ends. Then there's a row with 2s and some 0s. The output seems to have more 2s in the middle. Wait, in the output, the third row has all 2s except the ends. The fourth row has 2s on the left and right, with a 5 in the middle. Then the fifth row has a 5 in the middle. Hmm, maybe the 5s are being expanded or spread out?\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 5 in the middle of the fourth row. The output has 5s in the middle of some rows. Also, there's a 5 in the fifth row of the output. Wait, maybe the 5s are being placed in certain positions based on their original positions. Like, maybe the 5s are being mirrored or expanded in some way.\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has a 5 in the middle of some rows. The output has 5s in the middle of rows. But in the output, the 5s are spread out more. For example, in the fifth row of the output, there's a 5 in the fifth column. Wait, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are symmetric or in certain patterns.\n\nAnother observation: In all examples, the output starts and ends with 0s in the first row. The output rows have 2s in the middle, but some rows have 5s in the middle. So perhaps the 5s are being introduced in certain positions based on the original input.\n\nWait, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are symmetrically placed. For example, in Example 1, the original input has a 5 in the fourth row, fifth column. The output has 5s in the fourth row, fifth column, but also in other positions. Wait, no, in Example 1's output, the fourth row has a 5 in the fifth column. The fifth row has a 5 in the sixth column. Hmm, maybe the 5s are being expanded in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being mirrored. For instance, in Example 1, the original input has a 5 in the fourth row, fifth column. The output has 5s in the fourth row, fifth column and also in the fourth row, sixth column? Wait, no. Let me check the output of Example 1 again.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the fourth row is 0 2 2 2 5 0 0 5 2 0 0. Wait, the fifth column is 5, and the seventh column is 5. So maybe the 5s are placed symmetrically around the center. But the original input's fifth row has a 5 in the fifth column. Wait, maybe the 5s are being mirrored horizontally or vertically.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the positions where 5s appear in the input and output. For example, in Example 1's input, the fourth row has a 5 in the fifth column. The output's fourth row has 5s in the fifth and seventh columns. So maybe the 5 is being expanded to both sides? But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the center of the grid. For example, in a 8x11 grid, the center is around column 5 (since 11 columns, indices 0-10, so middle is 5). So maybe the 5s are placed in positions that are mirrored around the center.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output: the fourth row has a 5 in column 4 (index 4) and 6 (index 6). Wait, that's symmetric around column 5. So maybe the 5s are being mirrored. But how does that relate to the input?\n\nIn the input of Example 1, the fourth row has a 5 in column 4 (index 4). The output has 5s in columns 4 and 6. So maybe the 5 is being mirrored across the center. But then why in the fifth row of the output, there's a 5 in column 5 (the middle)? Because in the input, the fifth row has a 5 in column 5 (original input's fifth row is 0 2 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0). So maybe the 5 is being expanded to the center.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being expanded in a way that they spread out from their original positions. For example, if there's a 5 in the input, it's being replaced by 5s in certain positions.\n\nAnother idea: The 5s in the output are replacing the 0s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's input, the fourth row has a 5 in column 4. The output has 5s in columns 4 and 6. But maybe the 5 is being spread out to both sides. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s in the output are placed in positions that are symmetrically mirrored. For example, if there's a 5 in the input at (row, col), then in the output, there are 5s at (row, col) and (row, 10 - col). Because the grid is 11 columns wide. Let's check this.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the fourth row has a 5 at column 4 (index 4). The output's fourth row has 5s at column 4 and 6. Wait, 10 - 4 is 6. So that would fit. Then, for the fifth row of the input, which has a 5 at column 5 (index 5), the output has a 5 at column 5. But 10 - 5 is 5, so that's the same position. So that would make sense. So maybe the 5s are mirrored across the vertical axis. But why would that be the case?\n\nBut in Example 2, let's check. The input's fifth row has a 5 in column 4 (original input's fifth row is 0 2 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0). So column 4 (index 4). The output's fifth row has a 5 in column 4 and 6. Wait, in the output of Example 2, the fifth row is 0 2 2 5 0 2 2 2 2 0 0. Wait, no, the output for Example 2's fifth row is 0 2 2 5 0 2 2 2 2 0 0. So the 5 is in column 3 (index 3). Wait, that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe my initial idea is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being mirrored horizontally. Let me think again. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 5 in column 4 (index 4) of row 4. The output has 5s in column 4 and 6. So maybe the 5 is mirrored across the vertical center. But for a 11-column grid, the center is at column 5. So 4 and 6 are symmetric around 5. So that would make sense. But in Example 2, the fifth row's input has a 5 at column 4 (index 4), and the output's fifth row has a 5 at column 3 (index 3) and 7 (index 7)? Wait, looking at Example 2's output for the fifth row:\n\nThe output of Example 2's fifth row is 0 2 2 5 0 2 2 2 2 0 0. Wait, that's 0 2 2 5 0 2 2 2 2 0 0. So the 5 is at column 3 (index 3). But the original input's fifth row has a 5 at column 4 (index 4). So that's not symmetric. Hmm, this contradicts the previous idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being spread out in some other way. Maybe the 5s are being expanded in a diamond shape or something. Or perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions where their original position is in a certain area.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 3. The input has 5s in the middle of certain rows. The output has 5s in the middle of those rows, but also in other positions. For example, in the fifth row of the input, there's a 5 in column 4 (index 4) and 6 (index 6). The output's fifth row has a 5 in column 4 and 6. Wait, but in the output of Example 3, the fifth row is 0 2 2 2 5 0 0 0 2 2 2 0. Wait, no, the output is:\n\nIn Example 3's output, the fifth row is 0 2 2 2 5 0 0 0 2 2 2 0. Wait, that's 0 2 2 2 5 0 0 0 2 2 2 0. So the 5 is in column 4 (index 4). But in the input, the fifth row has a 5 in column 4 and 6. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being expanded in a way that they are mirrored across the vertical axis. For example, if there's a 5 in column c, then in the output, there's a 5 in column c and 10 - c. But in Example 2's fifth row, the input has a 5 at column 4 (index 4). The output's fifth row has a 5 at column 3 (index 3). That doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being mirrored across the horizontal axis. But that would be for rows. For example, if a 5 is in row i, then it's mirrored in row (7 - i), since the output has 8 rows. Let's check Example 1. The input's fourth row (row index 3) has a 5. The output's fourth row (row index 3) has a 5. But the output's fifth row (row index 4) has a 5 in column 5. The input's fifth row (row index 4) has a 5 in column 5. So that's the same. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being spread out in certain positions based on their original positions. For example, if there's a 5 in the input, then in the output, it's replaced by a 5 in certain positions. But how?\n\nAnother idea: The 5s in the output are placed in positions where their original positions are in certain areas. For example, in the input, the 5s are in the middle of the grid, and the output expands them to the left and right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are symmetrically placed in the grid. For example, in the output, the 5s are placed in positions that are mirrored around the vertical center. So for each 5 in the input, we create two 5s in the output, one on each side of the vertical center. But how does that work for the fifth row?\n\nWait, let's take Example 1's input. The fourth row has a 5 in column 4. The output has 5s in columns 4 and 6. So 4 and 6 are symmetric around 5 (the center). So for a 11-column grid, the vertical center is at column 5. So 4 and 6 are symmetric. Similarly, in the fifth row of the input, there's a 5 at column 5 (the center). So in the output, it's still there. So maybe the 5s are mirrored across the vertical center. But then, in Example 2's fifth row, the input has a 5 at column 4. The output's fifth row has a 5 at column 3 (index 3) and 7 (index 7)? Wait, let me check the output for Example 2 again.\n\nIn Example 2's output, the fifth row is 0 2 2 5 0 2 2 2 2 0 0. Wait, that's columns 0-10. The 5 is at column 3. But according to the vertical center (column 5), 3 is 2 positions left of the center, and 7 is 2 positions right. So if the input has a 5 at column 4, then the output would have 5s at column 3 and 7? But the output's fifth row has a 5 at column 3. So that would be symmetric. But why is there only one 5 in the output?\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the 5s are in the middle of the grid. The input's 5s are in the middle. But in the output, they are spread out. Maybe the 5s are being replaced by 5s in a way that they are expanded in certain directions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are adjacent to the original 5s. For example, if there's a 5 in the input, then in the output, it's replaced by 5s in positions that are adjacent. But how?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for patterns in the positions of the 5s. For example, in Example 1, the input's fourth row has a 5 in column 4, and the output has 5s in columns 4 and 6. Then, in the fifth row of the input, there's a 5 in column 5, and the output has a 5 in column 5. So maybe the 5s are being mirrored across the vertical center. But for columns that are already in the center, they remain.\n\nIn Example 2, the fifth row of the input has a 5 at column 4. The output's fifth row has a 5 at column 3. But that doesn't fit the mirroring. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong rows. Let me check Example 2's input and output again.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nRow 4 (assuming rows are 0-based) is 0 2 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. So column 4 (index 4) is 5. The output's fifth row (row index 4) is 0 2 2 5 0 2 2 2 2 0 0. So the 5 is at column 3 (index 3). That's one position to the left of the original column 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being expanded to the left and right in certain ways. For example, if there's a 5 in column c, then in the output, there are 5s in columns c-1 and c+1. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions where they are in the middle of a certain area. For example, in Example 1's output, the 5s are in the middle of the grid. So perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions that are symmetrically placed in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions that are part of a larger pattern. For example, the 5s are part of a diamond shape or something else.\n\nAnother observation: The output grids have 2s in the middle of the grid, except for the rows where there are 5s. So maybe the 2s are spread out in a certain way, and the 5s are placed in positions that are symmetric.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain 0s with 5s based on their position relative to the 2s. For example, if a 0 is in a position that is between two 2s, then it becomes a 5.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, in the input, if there's a 5 in the middle of a row, then in the output, it's expanded to the middle of the grid. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to expand the 5s to the left and right, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being mirrored across the vertical center, but the original 5s are in positions that are not symmetric. For example, in Example 2's fifth row, the input has a 5 in column 4 (index 4), and the output has a 5 in column 3 (index 3), which is one position left of the center. That doesn't fit the mirroring idea.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of expanding 5s in certain ways and keeping 2s as they are.\n\nAnother idea: The output has 2s in the middle of the grid, except for the rows where 5s are present. So perhaps the 5s are being introduced where the original input has 5s, and then they are expanded in certain ways.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are symmetrically placed around the vertical center. So for each 5 in the input, we add 5s in symmetric positions. But how to determine that.\n\nFor example, if a 5 is at (row, col) in the input, then in the output, we add 5s at (row, col) and (row, 10 - col). Because the grid has 11 columns. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the fourth row (row 3) has a 5 at column 4 (index 4). So 10 - 4 is 6. So the output would have 5s at column 4 and 6. Which matches the output of Example 1's fourth row.\n\nIn Example 1's fifth row (row 4), the input has a 5 at column 5 (index 5). So 10 - 5 is 5. So the output has a 5 at column 5, which matches.\n\nIn Example 2's fifth row (row 4), the input has a 5 at column 4 (index 4). So the output would have 5s at column 4 and 6. But in the output of Example 2's fifth row, the 5 is at column 3. Hmm, that doesn't fit. So maybe this idea is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being mirrored across the vertical center, but the original 5s are in positions that are not symmetric. For example, in Example 2's fifth row, the input has a 5 at column 4 (index 4), and the output has a 5 at column 3. But according to the mirroring idea, it should be at column 6. So this is conflicting.\n\nWait, maybe the mirroring is across the horizontal axis. For example, if there's a 5 in row i, then it's mirrored in row (7 - i). Let's check Example 1. The input's fourth row (row 3) has a 5. The output's fourth row (row 3) has a 5. But the input's fifth row (row 4) has a 5, and the output's fifth row (row 4) has a 5. So that doesn't fit. Unless the mirroring is vertical.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being expanded in a certain way based on their position. For example, if a 5 is in the middle of a row, it's kept, but if it's not, it's mirrored.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I need to think of the transformation as replacing certain 0s with 5s based on their position. For example, in the output, the 5s are placed in positions where the original input has 0s, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions that are in the middle of certain regions. For example, in the input, the 5s are in the middle of the grid, and the output expands them to the middle of the grid.\n\nAnother idea: The output has 2s in the middle of the grid, and the 5s are placed where the original input has 5s, but expanded in some way. For example, the 5s are being placed in positions that are symmetrically placed in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 2s in certain positions and 5s in others. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, in the output, the 5s are in positions that are symmetric around the vertical center. So for each 5 in the input, we add 5s in symmetric positions.\n\nBut why in Example 2's fifth row, the output has a 5 at column 3? Maybe the input's fifth row has a 5 at column 4, and the output has a 5 at column 3 and 7. But in the output, there's only one 5. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being expanded to the left and right in certain rows. For example, in rows where the input has a 5 in the middle, the output has 5s in the middle. But for rows where the input has a 5 in the left part, the output has 5s in the middle.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in the output, the 2s are spread out in the middle of the grid, and the 5s are in certain positions.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 3. The input has 5s in the middle of the rows. The output has 5s in the middle of those rows. For example, in the fifth row of the input, the 5 is in column 4 and 6. The output has a 5 in column 4 and 6. Wait, but the output of Example 3's fifth row is 0 2 2 2 5 0 0 0 2 2 2 0. So the 5 is in column 4. Hmm, that's not matching. So maybe the 5s are not being mirrored.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are in the middle of certain regions. For example, in the input, the 5s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has them in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to translate that into code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain 0s with 5s if they are in the middle of a row. For example, if a row has a 5 in the middle, then the 0s around it are replaced with 5s.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: The output seems to have 2s in the middle of the grid, and the 5s are placed in positions that are symmetrically placed. For example, in Example 1's output, the 5s are in positions that are symmetric around the vertical center.\n\nSo, perhaps the transformation is to mirror the 5s across the vertical center. So, for each 5 in the input, we add 5s in symmetric positions. But how to handle that.\n\nSo, the code would be: for each cell in the input grid, if it's a 5, then in the output, we set the cell and its mirror across the vertical center to 5. But what about the other cells?\n\nBut in Example 1's input, the fourth row has a 5 in column 4. The output has 5s in columns 4 and 6. So that fits. In Example 1's fifth row, the input has a 5 in column 5. The output has it in column 5. So that fits.\n\nIn Example 2's fifth row, the input has a 5 in column 4. The output has a 5 in column 3. But according to the mirroring, it should be in column 6. So this is conflicting. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the mirroring is not across the vertical center, but across the horizontal center. Or maybe the mirroring is across both axes. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is across the vertical center, but the original 5 is in a position that is not symmetric. For example, if the original 5 is in column 4, then the mirrored position is 6. But in Example 2's fifth row, the output has a 5 in column 3. That doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe there's another pattern. Let's look at the test input and see what the output would be.\n\nThe test input has a 5 in the fourth row, fifth column. The output would have 5s in symmetric positions. So for the fourth row, column 5 is the center. So the mirrored position would be the same. So the output would have 5 in that position. But the test input's output is not given, so I can't check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid. So, for example, if the input has a 5 in the middle of a row, it remains, but if it's not, it's mirrored.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I need to make a hypothesis.\n\nLet me try to think of the transformation as follows:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid, if it's a 5, then in the output, the cell and its mirrored counterpart across the vertical center are set to 5. For other cells, they remain as is.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nSo, for each cell (row, col) in the input grid:\n\nif the cell is 5, then in the output grid, set (row, col) and (row, 10 - col) to 5.\n\nBut what about if the cell is already 5 and 10 - col is the same as col (like the center column)? Then it's only set once.\n\nBut in Example 1's fifth row, the input has a 5 in column 5 (10 - 5 = 5), so it's set once.\n\nIn Example 2's fifth row, the input has a 5 in column 4. So the output would have 5 in column 4 and 6. But in the output of Example 2's fifth row, it's only at column 3. So that doesn't fit. So maybe this is not the correct pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mirroring is across the horizontal center. For example, if a 5 is in row i, then it's mirrored in row (7 - i). But how?\n\nFor example, in Example 1's input, the fourth row (row 3) has a 5. The output's fourth row (row 3) has a 5. The fifth row (row 4) has a 5 in the output. So that would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being mirrored in both directions. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 5s are being placed in positions that are in the middle of the grid, and the 2s are being expanded to fill the rest.\n\nBut how to code that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions where their original position is in the middle of a row, and then the 5s are expanded to the left and right.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions where they are in the middle of the grid, and the 2s are being expanded in a certain way.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for the most common pattern between the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1 and 3, the output has 5s in the middle of certain rows. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row has a 5 in the middle, and the output has 5s in the middle. In Example 3, the fifth row has a 5 in the middle, and the output has a 5 in the middle.\n\nSo perhaps the 5s are being kept in their original positions, but also expanded to the left and right if they are in the middle.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 5s in certain positions. For example, if the input has a 5 in the middle of a row, then in the output, the middle of the row is a 5, and the surrounding cells are also 5s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being expanded in a diamond shape. For example, if there's a 5 in the middle, it expands to the left and right, and up and down.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAnother observation: The output grids have 2s in the middle of the grid, and the 5s are in the middle of certain rows. So perhaps the 5s are being placed in positions that are symmetrically placed in the grid.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the 5s are being mirrored across the vertical center. So, for each 5 in the input, the output has 5s in the same column and its mirrored column. For other cells, they remain the same.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n    for each column in the row:\n        if the cell is 5:\n            set the cell and its mirrored column to 5 in the output grid.\n\nBut what about other cells? For example, in the output, the 2s are kept as is, and the 0s are replaced with 5s only if they are mirrored.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nWait, the input and output grids have 2s in the middle. So maybe the 2s are kept as is, and the 5s are mirrored.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nCreate a new grid, initialized to the input.\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n    for each column in the row:\n        if the cell is 5:\n            mirrored_col = 10 - column\n            if mirrored_col != column:\n                set the mirrored_col in the same row to 5.\n\nBut wait, this would set the mirrored column to 5, even if it's already 5. But this would work for the examples.\n\nLet's test this on Example 1.\n\nInput row 3 (fourth row) has a 5 at column 4. mirrored_col is 10 - 4 = 6. So in the output, column 4 and 6 are set to 5. Which matches the output.\n\nIn the fifth row (row 4), the input has a 5 at column 5. mirrored_col is 5, so no change. So the output has it as 5.\n\nIn Example 2's fifth row, the input has a 5 at column 4. mirrored_col is 6. So the output would have 5 at column 4 and 6. But in the output of Example 2, the fifth row has a 5 at column 3. So this doesn't match. So perhaps this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe I made a mistake in the example.\n\nWait, in Example 2's output, the fifth row is:\n\n0 2 2 5 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n\nSo the 5 is at column 3. According to the hypothesis, if the input has a 5 at column 4, the output would have 5 at column 4 and 6. But the output has a 5 at column 3. So this contradicts.\n\nSo this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 5s are being mirrored across the horizontal center. For example, if there's a 5 in row i, then it's mirrored in row (7 - i).\n\nLet's test this on Example 1's input. The fourth row (row 3) has a 5. The mirrored row would be 7 - 3 = 4 (row 4). The output's row 4 has a 5 in column 5. So this would match. But the input's row 4 has a 5 in column 5. So the output would have it in row 4. So this would fit.\n\nBut how about the fifth row of Example 1's input, which has a 5 in column 5. The mirrored row would be 7 - 4 = 3 (row 3). The output's row 3 has a 5 in column 4 and 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being mirrored in both directions. For example, if there's a 5 in (row, col), then it's mirrored in (row, 10 - col) and (7 - row, col) and (7 - row, 10 - col). But this would create more 5s.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with the initial hypothesis that the 5s are mirrored across the vertical center, and see if it works for some examples, even if not all.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row_idx in range(8):\n        for col_idx in range(11):\n            if grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 5:\n                mirrored_col = 10 - col_idx\n                if mirrored_col != col_idx:\n                    transformed[row_idx][mirrored_col] = 5\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, this would set the mirrored column to 5, but what if the original cell is 5 and the mirrored column is already 5? It would overwrite it, but that's okay.\n\nLet's test this on Example 1.\n\nExample 1's input has a 5 in row 3, column 4. So mirrored_col is 6. So transformed[3][6] is set to 5. So the output's fourth row has 5 at column 4 and 6. Which matches the example.\n\nIn the fifth row (row 4), the input has a 5 at column 5. So mirrored_col is 5, so no change. So the output has it as 5.\n\nIn Example 2's input, the fifth row (row 4) has a 5 at column 4. So mirrored_col is 6. So transformed[4][6] is set to 5. But in the output of Example 2's fifth row, the 5 is at column 3. So this doesn't match. So this suggests the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps I made a mistake in the example. Let me recheck Example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2's input:\n\nRow 4 (assuming rows are 0-based) is:\n\n0 2 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nSo column 4 is 5. The output's fifth row (row 4) is:\n\n0 2 2 5 0 2 2 2 2 0 0\n\nSo the 5 is at column 3. According to the hypothesis, it should be at column 4 and 6. But in the output, it's at column 3. So this is a contradiction.\n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 2's output, the fifth row has a 5 at column 3, which is one position to the left of the original column 4. So perhaps the mirroring is not across the vertical center, but across the horizontal center. Or perhaps it's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being expanded to the left and right in a certain way, like expanding to the next column.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that the 5s are being mirrored across the vertical center, even if it doesn't fit all examples. Maybe the examples are not perfectly aligned, and the hypothesis is the best I can come up with.\n\nSo the code would be as above. But I need to make sure that the output is 8x11.\n\nWait, the input is 8x11, and the output is 8x11. So the code is correct.\n\nBut the example 2's output doesn't fit. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 5s are being placed in positions where their original position is in the middle of a certain area. For example, if a 5 is in the middle of a row, it's kept, and if it's not, it's replaced with 2s. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s are being replaced with 2s, but that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis and write the code, even if it may not fit all examples, but it's the best I can think of.\n"
