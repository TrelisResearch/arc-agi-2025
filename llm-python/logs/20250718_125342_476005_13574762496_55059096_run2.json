          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from input to output. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some 3s and 0s. The output has some 3s and 2s. For instance, in the third row of the input, there are three 3s. In the output, the same row has three 3s, but then in the fourth row, there's a 3 followed by a 2. Hmm. Wait, looking at the output of Example 1, the fourth row is 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe there's some kind of propagation or replacement of 3s with 2s in certain positions?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the fifth row has a 2 in the fifth position. The sixth row has a 2 in the sixth position. The seventh row has a 2 in the seventh position and then a 3. Wait, maybe the 2s are appearing where there's a 3 in the input, but in certain positions? Or maybe there's a pattern based on the positions of the 3s.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Example 1's output, the fourth row has a 2 in the fourth column. The fifth row has a 2 in the fifth column. The sixth row has a 2 in the sixth column. The seventh row has a 2 in the seventh column. Wait, that seems like a diagonal pattern. Like, maybe the 2s are placed along a diagonal where the input had 3s. But how?\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, the fourth row has a 3 in the third column. The output's fourth row has a 3 in the third column and a 2 in the fourth. The fifth row's input has 0s except for the third column. But the output has a 2 in the fifth column. Hmm. Maybe the 2s are replacing the 3s in certain positions, but only when there's a 3 in the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being generated based on some kind of proximity. Like, if there's a 3 in a certain position, then in the next row or column, a 2 is generated. Or maybe the 2s are appearing in positions that are adjacent to 3s.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a 3 in the fourth row, fourth column. The output has a 2 in that position? Wait no, the input for Example 2's first row is 0 0 0 3 ... and the output is same. But in the third row of input, there's a 3 in the fourth column. The output for that row has a 2 in the fourth column. So maybe when there's a 3 in the input, the output has a 2 in that position? But that doesn't fit with the first example. Wait in Example 1, the third row of input is 0 3 3 3 0 ... and the output is 0 3 3 3 0 ... so no change there. But in the fourth row of input, there's a 3 in third column. The output has a 3 in third column and a 2 in fourth. So maybe the 2s are appearing in positions that are adjacent to 3s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being generated in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in the output of Example 1, the fourth row has a 2 in the fourth column. The fifth row has a 2 in fifth column. The sixth row has a 2 in sixth column. The seventh row has a 2 in seventh column. So maybe these are positions along a diagonal where the input had 3s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing the 3s in certain positions based on some pattern. For example, in the input of Example 1, the fourth row has a 3 in column 3. The output has a 3 in column 3 and a 2 in column 4. Then in the fifth row, the input has 0s, but the output has a 2 in column 5. Maybe the 2s are being generated in positions that are to the right of the 3s in the input?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the 2s are generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, but in a certain way. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 3 in row 2, column 3. The output for that row has a 3 in column 3. But in row 4, column 3, the input has a 3, and the output has a 3 in column 3 and a 2 in column 4. Then in row 5, column 5, there's a 2. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has some 3s and the output has 3s and 2s. For instance, in the fourth row of input, there's a 3 in column 6. The output has a 3 in column 6 and then a 2 in column 7. Then in the fifth row of input, there's a 3 in column 6, and the output has a 2 in column 6. Wait, that's conflicting. Or maybe not. Let me check.\n\nWait, in Example 3's input, the fourth row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, no, that's the same. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong rows. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input for Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output for Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: same as input\nRow 1: same as input\nRow 2: same as input\nRow 3: same as input\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: same as input\nRow 7: same as input\nRow 8: same as input\nRow 9: same as input\nRows 10 and 11: same as input.\n\nSo in row 4, input has 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 ... and the output has 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 ... So the sixth column (index 5?) becomes 2. Wait, maybe the 2 is replacing the 3 in the input's seventh column (index 6) but that's not the case here. Wait, the input row 4 has a 3 in column 6 (index 6?), and the output has 2 in column 5 (index 5?), then 3 in column 6. Hmm, maybe that's a pattern where the 2 is placed in the column before a 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are adjacent to 3s. For example, if there's a 3 in a certain position, then the cell to the left or right gets a 2. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where 2s appear in the outputs. Let's look at Example 1's output. The 2s are in positions:\n\nRow 3, column 3 (third row, fourth column?), no, let's think in 0-based indices. For example, in Example 1's output, row 3 (fourth row) is 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. So column 3 is 2. Then row 4, column 4 is 2. Row 5, column 5 is 2. Row 6, column 6 is 2. Then row 6, column 7 is 3. So maybe these are positions where the input has a 3 in the same column, but shifted? Or maybe in the same column but in the next row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a diagonal. For example, in Example 1's output, the 2s are in positions (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6). That's a diagonal. So maybe the 2s are placed along this diagonal where the input had 3s?\n\nBut how does that relate to the input? Let's check the input for these positions. For example, in the input for Example 1, row 3, column 3 is 3. So the output has a 2 in (3,3) and (4,4) etc. Wait, but in the input, row 3, column 3 is 3. In the output, row 3, column 3 is 3 (the third row of the input is 0 3 3 3 0 ... so the third row's third column is 3. The output's third row is 0 3 3 3 0 ... so no change. But the fourth row of the output has a 2 in column 3. So maybe the 2 is generated in the next row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated where there's a 3 in the input, but in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 3 in row 2, column 2. The output has a 3 there. But in row 3, column 3, the input has a 3, and the output has a 3 there. But in the fourth row, the output has a 2 in column 3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions where the input has a 3, but the 2 is placed in the next row and same column. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row (row 3) has a 3 in column 2 (third column). The output's fourth row (row 3) has a 3 in column 2 and a 2 in column 3. Then in row 4, column 4 is 2. Maybe the 2 is generated in the next row and same column as a 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated when there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in a certain pattern. For example, if there's a 3 in a cell, then the cell to the right is 2. But that's not consistent with all examples.\n\nAnother thought: in Example 2, the output has 2s in positions that are part of a diagonal. For instance, the third row of input has a 3 in column 3. The output has a 2 in column 3. Then in the fourth row, the input has a 3 in column 5, and the output has a 2 in column 5. Wait, maybe not. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 2's input, row 2 (third row) is 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0. So the fifth column (index 4) is 2. So maybe the 2 is placed in the fifth column of that row. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated when there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in the same column but in the next row. For example, if a 3 is in row i, column j, then in row i+1, column j, there's a 2. But in Example 1, row 2 has a 3 in column 2. Then row 3 (i+1) has a 3 in column 2, but the output has a 2 in column 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions where the input has a 3, and the 2 is placed in the same column but in the next row. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the outputs of the examples. In all three examples, the 2s are appearing in certain positions where there are 3s in the input, but not in all cases. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 3 in row 2, column 2. The output for that row has a 3 there. But in row 3, column 2, the input has a 3, and the output has a 3 there. But in row 4, column 3 (the fourth row of the output), there's a 2. So maybe the 2 is generated in the same column as a 3, but in the next row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions where the input has a 3, and the 2 is placed in a certain pattern. For example, if a 3 is in a cell, then in the same column, the next row has a 2. But that's not consistent with all examples.\n\nAnother approach: think of the 2s as being generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, but in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are in positions that form a diagonal. In Example 2, the 2s are in positions that form a diagonal. In Example 3, the 2 is in position (4,5) (row 4, column 5?), which is part of a diagonal?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are placed in a diagonal line. So perhaps the 2s are generated along a diagonal where the input has 3s.\n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the 2s are generated in positions where the input has a 3, and the 2 is placed in the same column but in the next row. For example, if there's a 3 in (i,j), then (i+1,j) is 2. But in Example 1, row 2 has a 3 in column 2. Then row 3, column 2 is 3. But the output for row 3 has a 2 in column 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are to the right of a 3. For example, if there's a 3 in (i,j), then (i,j+1) is 2. But in Example 1, row 3, column 2 is 3, and the output has a 2 in column 3. That fits. Then row 4, column 4 is 2. But why? Because in row 3, column 3 is 3. So that would fit. So the pattern is that if there's a 3 in (i,j), then (i,j+1) is 2. But then in Example 1, row 3, column 2 is 3, so (3,3) is 2. Then in row 4, column 3 is 3, so (4,4) is 2. That would fit. But in row 4 of the output, the fifth column (index 4) is 2. So that would fit.\n\nLet me check Example 1's input and output again. For row 3 (input row 3), the input is 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So column 2 is 3. The output for row 3 is 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. So column 3 is 2. That fits the pattern. Then row 4 (input row 4) is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no 3s. But the output for row 4 is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0. So column 4 is 2. How is that generated? Maybe because there's a 3 in row 3, column 3 (input row 3, column 3 is 3). Then in row 4, column 4 is 2. That would fit the pattern of (i,j) being 3, then (i+1,j+1) is 2. So maybe the 2 is generated in positions that are diagonally to the right and down.\n\nBut how to model this? It seems like the 2s are generated in positions that are one step to the right and down from a 3 in the input. So for every 3 in the input, the cell to the right and down is 2. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, for every 3 in the input, the cell to the right is 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are adjacent to 3s in a certain way. For example, if there's a 3 in (i,j), then the cell (i,j+1) is 2. But that would only generate 2s to the right of 3s. But in Example 1, row 3, column 3 is 3, and the output has a 2 in column 4. That would fit. Then in row 4, column 4 is 2. But why is that generated? Because there's a 3 in row 3, column 3. So the pattern is that for every 3 in the input, the cell to the right is 2. But that would generate a 2 in column j+1 of the same row. But in Example 1, row 3 has a 3 in column 2, so the next column (3) is 2. Then row 4 has a 3 in column 3 (input row 4?), but the input row 4 is all 0s except for column 3? Wait, no, the input for Example 1's row 4 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no 3s. Then how is the 2 in row 4, column 4 generated? That would require a 3 in row 3, column 3. Which is present. So the 2 is in row 3+1=4, column 3+1=4. So that's a diagonal pattern.\n\nSo the rule might be: for every 3 in the input grid, the cell at (i+1, j+1) is 2. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with Example 1. Let's look for all 3s in the input and see where the 2s are placed.\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nRow 1 (second row) has 0 0 3 0 0 ... so (1,2) is 3. Then according to the hypothesis, (2,3) should be 2. Looking at the output for row 2 (third row), the third row is 0 3 3 3 0 ... so (2,3) is 3. So that's not 2. Hmm, this contradicts the hypothesis. So maybe that's not the correct pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's (i, j+1) for every 3 in (i,j). So for the 3 at (1,2), the cell (1,3) is 2. But in the output, row 1 (second row) has 0 0 3 0 ... so (1,3) is 0. So that doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 2s are generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in the same column but in the next row. For example, if a 3 is at (i,j), then (i+1,j) is 2. Let's check this with Example 1.\n\nIn row 1 (input row 1), column 2 is 3. So (2,2) would be 2. Looking at the output row 2 (third row), the third row is 0 3 3 3 0 ... so (2,2) is 3. So that's not 2. So this is not correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain shape, like a diagonal. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are in positions (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6). These are along the main diagonal. So maybe the 2s are placed along this diagonal where the input has 3s. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions where the input has a 3 in the same row, but to the left. For example, if there's a 3 in (i,j), then (i,j-1) is 2. But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Maybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in Example 3's output, there's a 2 in row 4, column 5. The input for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 ... so column 6 (index 5?) is 0. So maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the 2s are generated based on the number of 3s in certain positions. For example, if there are multiple 3s in a row, then a 2 is generated in a certain position. But I don't see a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain shape, like a cross or a diagonal. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the positions of the 3s. For example, in Example 1, the 3s form a certain shape, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain transformation of that shape.\n\nLooking at the input of Example 1, the 3s are in the first few rows. The output has 2s in positions that are part of a diagonal line. Maybe the 2s are generated in the positions that are part of a diagonal line that is formed by the 3s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain shape, like a diagonal line, and the number of 2s depends on the number of 3s in the input.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. However, given that the test input has a certain pattern, maybe I should look for a pattern that can be generalized.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in the same column but one row down, but only if the cell is not already a 3. For example, if there's a 3 in (i,j), then in (i+1,j), if it's not a 3, set it to 2. But in Example 1, row 1 (input) has a 3 in column 2. Then row 2 (output) has a 3 in column 2. So that would not change. But in row 3, column 2 is 3, and the output has a 3 there. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in the same column but one row down, but only if there's a 3 in the next row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the positions of the 3s. For example, in the input, if there's a 3 in a certain position, then the output has a 2 in a position that is to the right and down.\n\nBut how to code this? Maybe for each cell in the input, if it's a 3, then set the cell to the right and down to 2. But that would require checking for each 3 in the input, and setting the cell (i+1, j+1) to 2. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 3 in row 1, column 2 (0-based). So (1,2) is 3. Then (2,3) is set to 2. Looking at the output, row 2, column 3 is 3. So that's not correct. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each 3 in the input, the cell to the right is set to 2. So for (i,j), set (i,j+1) to 2. Let's check this for Example 1.\n\nIn row 1, column 2 is 3. So (1,3) is set to 2. But in the output, row 1, column 3 is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in the same column but in the next row. For example, if (i,j) is 3, then (i+1,j) is 2. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, row 1, column 2 is 3. So row 2, column 2 is 3. But the output for row 2, column 2 is 3. So no change. Not helpful.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a kind of morphological operation. For example, replacing certain patterns with others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain shape, like a diagonal line. In Example 1, the 2s are in positions (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6). These are along the diagonal. So maybe the 2s are placed along the diagonal where the input has 3s.\n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the diagonal is determined by the positions of the 3s. For example, if there's a 3 in (i,j), then the 2 is placed at (i + k, j + k) for some k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain diagonal line, and the number of 2s depends on the number of 3s in the input.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. Given the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that for every 3 in the input, the cell to the right and down is set to 2. So for each 3 in (i,j), set (i+1,j+1) to 2. Let's see if that works for the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 3 in (1,2) (row 1, column 2). So (2,3) would be set to 2. But in the output, (2,3) is 3. So that doesn't fit. But in the output of Example 1, the fourth row (row 3) has a 2 in column 3. That would be from a 3 in row 2, column 2. So (2,2) is 3. Then (3,3) is 2. That fits. So for the 3 in row 2, column 2 (which is part of the input), the output has a 2 in (3,3). That fits. But in the input, row 2, column 2 is 3. So that would be correct.\n\nBut in row 1, column 2 is 3. So (2,3) should be 2. But in the output, row 2, column 3 is 3. So this doesn't fit. So maybe this pattern is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is generated in the same column but in the next row. For example, if there's a 3 in (i,j), then (i+1,j) is 2. But in Example 1, row 2, column 2 is 3. Then (3,2) would be 2. But in the output, row 3, column 2 is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 2s are generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in the same column but in the next row, but only if that position is not already a 3. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the positions of the 3s. For example, in Example 1, the 3s form a certain shape, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a diagonal line that is formed by the 3s.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be implemented in code. For example, the 2s are generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in the same column but in the next row, but only if the next row's column is 0. Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain shape, like a diagonal, and the number of 2s depends on the number of 3s in the input.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make a hypothesis and proceed.\n\nLet me think of the following hypothesis: for each 3 in the input, the cell to the right and down is set to 2. So for each cell (i,j) in the input that is 3, set (i+1, j+1) to 2. This would generate a diagonal pattern of 2s. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has the following 3s:\n\nRow 1 (second row): 0 0 3 0 ... \u2192 (1,2) is 3.\nRow 2 (third row): 0 3 3 3 0 ... \u2192 (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) are 3.\nRow 3 (fourth row): 0 0 3 0 ... \u2192 (3,2) is 3.\nRow 6 (seventh row): 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 \u2192 (6,7) is 3.\nRow 7 (eighth row): 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 \u2192 (7,6), (7,7), (7,8) are 3.\nRow 8 (ninth row): 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 \u2192 (8,7) is 3.\nRow 9 (tenth row): 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 no 3s.\nRow 10 (eleventh row): 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 (10,3) is 3.\nRow 11 (twelfth row): 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 (11,2), (11,3), (11,4) are 3.\nRow 12 (thirteenth row): 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 (12,3) is 3.\n\nNow, for each of these 3s, we would set (i+1, j+1) to 2.\n\nFor example, the 3 at (1,2) would set (2,3) to 2. But in the output, row 2, column 3 is 3. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nBut for the 3 at (2,2), setting (3,3) to 2. In the output, row 3, column 3 is 2. That fits. For the 3 at (2,3), setting (3,4) to 2. In the output, row 3, column 4 is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like the diagonal from (i,j) to (i+1,j+1), but only if the cell is not already a 3. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions where the input has a 3 in the same row and column as a 3 in the previous row. For example, if there's a 3 in (i,j), then in (i+1,j) is 2.\n\nBut again, this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell in the input, if it is a 3, then the cell to the right and down is set to 2. This might not fit all examples, but it's a possible pattern.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFor each i in 0 to 13 (since the output is 14x10), for each j in 0 to 9:\n\nIf grid[i][j] == 3 and i+1 < 14 and j+1 < 10:\n\nThen set transformed_grid[i+1][j+1] = 2.\n\nBut this would generate 2s along the diagonal. Let's see if this fits with the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, the output has 2s in positions (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6). Let's see if those are generated by this rule.\n\nFor example, the 3 at (2,2) in the input (row 2, column 2) would set (3,3) to 2. That fits. The 3 at (2,3) would set (3,4) to 2, but in the output, row 3, column 4 is 0. So this doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is generated in the same row, but to the right. So for each 3 at (i,j), set (i,j+1) to 2. Let's see.\n\nFor the 3 at (1,2), set (1,3) to 2. But in the output, (1,3) is 0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is generated in the next row, same column. So for each 3 at (i,j), set (i+1,j) to 2. Let's see.\n\nFor the 3 at (2,2), set (3,2) to 2. But in the output, row 3, column 2 is 3. So no.\n\nThis is very challenging. Given the time, I'll have to proceed with the assumption that the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a diagonal where the input has 3s, and the code will check for that.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the 2s are generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in the same column but in the next row. But only if that position is not already a 3.\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's try.\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input:\n\nif grid[i][j] == 3 and i+1 < 14:\n\n   if grid[i+1][j] != 3:\n\n       transformed_grid[i+1][j] = 2\n\nBut in Example 1, the 3 at (2,2) would set (3,2) to 2. But in the output, (3,2) is 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the next row and next column. So (i+1,j+1). Let's try this.\n\nFor the 3 at (2,2), set (3,3) to 2. Which fits the example. For the 3 at (2,3), set (3,4) to 2. But in the output, (3,4) is 0. So this doesn't fit. But in the output of Example 1, (3,3) is 2, which is set by this rule. So maybe this is part of the pattern.\n\nBut why is (3,4) not set to 2? Maybe because the input has a 3 in (2,3), but the output doesn't have a 2 there. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated only for certain 3s. For example, the 3s in the input that are part of a certain shape.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that for every 3 in the input, the cell to the right and down is set to 2, and see if that fits with the examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*10 for _ in range(14)]\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                if i+1 < 14 and j+1 < 10:\n                    transformed[i+1][j+1] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would set 2s in positions (i+1, j+1) for each 3 in the input. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 3 at (2,2) (row 2, column 2) would set (3,3) to 2. Which fits the output. The 3 at (2,3) would set (3,4) to 2, but in the output, (3,4) is 0. So this would not fit. But maybe the 3 at (2,3) is not part of the pattern. Or maybe there's a mistake in this approach.\n\nBut given that this is the best I can think of, I'll proceed with this code and see. It might not fit all examples, but it's a possible pattern.\n\nAnother possible adjustment: maybe the 2 is set only if the cell to the right and down is 0. But that's not mentioned in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2 is set in the same column but in the next row, and only if that cell is 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn any case, I'll proceed with the code that for each 3 in the input, the cell to the right and down is set to 2. This might not fit all examples, but it's a possible pattern.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from input to output. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some 3s and 0s. The output has some 3s and 2s. For instance, in the third row of the input, there are three 3s. In the output, the same row has three 3s, but then in the fourth row, there's a 3 followed by a 2. Hmm. Wait, looking at the output of Example 1, the fourth row is 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. So maybe there's some kind of propagation or replacement of 3s with 2s in certain positions?\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the fifth row has a 2 in the fifth position. The sixth row has a 2 in the sixth position. The seventh row has a 2 in the seventh position and then a 3. Wait, maybe the 2s are appearing where there's a 3 in the input, but in certain positions? Or maybe there's a pattern based on the positions of the 3s.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Example 1's output, the fourth row has a 2 in the fourth column. The fifth row has a 2 in the fifth column. The sixth row has a 2 in the sixth column. The seventh row has a 2 in the seventh column. Wait, that seems like a diagonal pattern. Like, maybe the 2s are placed along a diagonal where the input had 3s. But how?\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, the fourth row has a 3 in the third column. The output's fourth row has a 3 in the third column and a 2 in the fourth. The fifth row's input has 0s except for the third column. But the output has a 2 in the fifth column. Hmm. Maybe the 2s are replacing the 3s in certain positions, but only when there's a 3 in the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being generated based on some kind of proximity. Like, if there's a 3 in a certain position, then in the next row or column, a 2 is generated. Or maybe the 2s are appearing in positions that are adjacent to 3s.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input and output. The input has a 3 in the fourth row, fourth column. The output has a 2 in that position? Wait no, the input for Example 2's first row is 0 0 0 3 ... and the output is same. But in the third row of input, there's a 3 in the fourth column. The output for that row has a 2 in the fourth column. So maybe when there's a 3 in the input, the output has a 2 in that position? But that doesn't fit with the first example. Wait in Example 1, the third row of input is 0 3 3 3 0 ... and the output is 0 3 3 3 0 ... so no change there. But in the fourth row of input, there's a 3 in third column. The output has a 3 in third column and a 2 in fourth. So maybe the 2s are appearing in positions that are adjacent to 3s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being generated in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in the output of Example 1, the fourth row has a 2 in the fourth column. The fifth row has a 2 in fifth column. The sixth row has a 2 in sixth column. The seventh row has a 2 in seventh column. So maybe these are positions along a diagonal where the input had 3s?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing the 3s in certain positions based on some pattern. For example, in the input of Example 1, the fourth row has a 3 in column 3. The output has a 3 in column 3 and a 2 in column 4. Then in the fifth row, the input has 0s, but the output has a 2 in column 5. Maybe the 2s are being generated in positions that are to the right of the 3s in the input?\n\nAnother approach: maybe the 2s are generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, but in a certain way. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 3 in row 2, column 3. The output for that row has a 3 in column 3. But in row 4, column 3, the input has a 3, and the output has a 3 in column 3 and a 2 in column 4. Then in row 5, column 5, there's a 2. Hmm. Not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has some 3s and the output has 3s and 2s. For instance, in the fourth row of input, there's a 3 in column 6. The output has a 3 in column 6 and then a 2 in column 7. Then in the fifth row of input, there's a 3 in column 6, and the output has a 2 in column 6. Wait, that's conflicting. Or maybe not. Let me check.\n\nWait, in Example 3's input, the fourth row is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, no, that's the same. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong rows. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input for Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output for Example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: same as input\nRow 1: same as input\nRow 2: same as input\nRow 3: same as input\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: same as input\nRow 7: same as input\nRow 8: same as input\nRow 9: same as input\nRows 10 and 11: same as input.\n\nSo in row 4, input has 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 ... and the output has 0 0 0 0 0 2 3 ... So the sixth column (index 5?) becomes 2. Wait, maybe the 2 is replacing the 3 in the input's seventh column (index 6) but that's not the case here. Wait, the input row 4 has a 3 in column 6 (index 6?), and the output has 2 in column 5 (index 5?), then 3 in column 6. Hmm, maybe that's a pattern where the 2 is placed in the column before a 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are adjacent to 3s. For example, if there's a 3 in a certain position, then the cell to the left or right gets a 2. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where 2s appear in the outputs. Let's look at Example 1's output. The 2s are in positions:\n\nRow 3, column 3 (third row, fourth column?), no, let's think in 0-based indices. For example, in Example 1's output, row 3 (fourth row) is 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. So column 3 is 2. Then row 4, column 4 is 2. Row 5, column 5 is 2. Row 6, column 6 is 2. Then row 6, column 7 is 3. So maybe these are positions where the input has a 3 in the same column, but shifted? Or maybe in the same column but in the next row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a diagonal. For example, in Example 1's output, the 2s are in positions (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6). That's a diagonal. So maybe the 2s are placed along this diagonal where the input had 3s?\n\nBut how does that relate to the input? Let's check the input for these positions. For example, in the input for Example 1, row 3, column 3 is 3. So the output has a 2 in (3,3) and (4,4) etc. Wait, but in the input, row 3, column 3 is 3. In the output, row 3, column 3 is 3 (the third row of the input is 0 3 3 3 0 ... so the third row's third column is 3. The output's third row is 0 3 3 3 0 ... so no change. But the fourth row of the output has a 2 in column 3. So maybe the 2 is generated in the next row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated where there's a 3 in the input, but in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 3 in row 2, column 2. The output has a 3 there. But in row 3, column 3, the input has a 3, and the output has a 3 there. But in the fourth row, the output has a 2 in column 3. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions where the input has a 3, but the 2 is placed in the next row and same column. For example, in Example 1, the fourth row (row 3) has a 3 in column 2 (third column). The output's fourth row (row 3) has a 3 in column 2 and a 2 in column 3. Then in row 4, column 4 is 2. Maybe the 2 is generated in the next row and same column as a 3?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated when there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in a certain pattern. For example, if there's a 3 in a cell, then the cell to the right is 2. But that's not consistent with all examples.\n\nAnother thought: in Example 2, the output has 2s in positions that are part of a diagonal. For instance, the third row of input has a 3 in column 3. The output has a 2 in column 3. Then in the fourth row, the input has a 3 in column 5, and the output has a 2 in column 5. Wait, maybe not. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 2's input, row 2 (third row) is 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0. So the fifth column (index 4) is 2. So maybe the 2 is placed in the fifth column of that row. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated when there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in the same column but in the next row. For example, if a 3 is in row i, column j, then in row i+1, column j, there's a 2. But in Example 1, row 2 has a 3 in column 2. Then row 3 (i+1) has a 3 in column 2, but the output has a 2 in column 3. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions where the input has a 3, and the 2 is placed in the same column but in the next row. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nThis is getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the outputs of the examples. In all three examples, the 2s are appearing in certain positions where there are 3s in the input, but not in all cases. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 3 in row 2, column 2. The output for that row has a 3 there. But in row 3, column 2, the input has a 3, and the output has a 3 there. But in row 4, column 3 (the fourth row of the output), there's a 2. So maybe the 2 is generated in the same column as a 3, but in the next row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions where the input has a 3, and the 2 is placed in a certain pattern. For example, if a 3 is in a cell, then in the same column, the next row has a 2. But that's not consistent with all examples.\n\nAnother approach: think of the 2s as being generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, but in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are in positions that form a diagonal. In Example 2, the 2s are in positions that form a diagonal. In Example 3, the 2 is in position (4,5) (row 4, column 5?), which is part of a diagonal?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are placed in a diagonal line. So perhaps the 2s are generated along a diagonal where the input has 3s.\n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the 2s are generated in positions where the input has a 3, and the 2 is placed in the same column but in the next row. For example, if there's a 3 in (i,j), then (i+1,j) is 2. But in Example 1, row 2 has a 3 in column 2. Then row 3, column 2 is 3. But the output for row 3 has a 2 in column 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are to the right of a 3. For example, if there's a 3 in (i,j), then (i,j+1) is 2. But in Example 1, row 3, column 2 is 3, and the output has a 2 in column 3. That fits. Then row 4, column 4 is 2. But why? Because in row 3, column 3 is 3. So that would fit. So the pattern is that if there's a 3 in (i,j), then (i,j+1) is 2. But then in Example 1, row 3, column 2 is 3, so (3,3) is 2. Then in row 4, column 3 is 3, so (4,4) is 2. That would fit. But in row 4 of the output, the fifth column (index 4) is 2. So that would fit.\n\nLet me check Example 1's input and output again. For row 3 (input row 3), the input is 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So column 2 is 3. The output for row 3 is 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 0 0. So column 3 is 2. That fits the pattern. Then row 4 (input row 4) is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no 3s. But the output for row 4 is 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0. So column 4 is 2. How is that generated? Maybe because there's a 3 in row 3, column 3 (input row 3, column 3 is 3). Then in row 4, column 4 is 2. That would fit the pattern of (i,j) being 3, then (i+1,j+1) is 2. So maybe the 2 is generated in positions that are diagonally to the right and down.\n\nBut how to model this? It seems like the 2s are generated in positions that are one step to the right and down from a 3 in the input. So for every 3 in the input, the cell to the right and down is 2. But that might not be the case. Alternatively, for every 3 in the input, the cell to the right is 2.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are adjacent to 3s in a certain way. For example, if there's a 3 in (i,j), then the cell (i,j+1) is 2. But that would only generate 2s to the right of 3s. But in Example 1, row 3, column 3 is 3, and the output has a 2 in column 4. That would fit. Then in row 4, column 4 is 2. But why is that generated? Because there's a 3 in row 3, column 3. So the pattern is that for every 3 in the input, the cell to the right is 2. But that would generate a 2 in column j+1 of the same row. But in Example 1, row 3 has a 3 in column 2, so the next column (3) is 2. Then row 4 has a 3 in column 3 (input row 4?), but the input row 4 is all 0s except for column 3? Wait, no, the input for Example 1's row 4 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no 3s. Then how is the 2 in row 4, column 4 generated? That would require a 3 in row 3, column 3. Which is present. So the 2 is in row 3+1=4, column 3+1=4. So that's a diagonal pattern.\n\nSo the rule might be: for every 3 in the input grid, the cell at (i+1, j+1) is 2. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with Example 1. Let's look for all 3s in the input and see where the 2s are placed.\n\nIn Example 1's input:\n\nRow 1 (second row) has 0 0 3 0 0 ... so (1,2) is 3. Then according to the hypothesis, (2,3) should be 2. Looking at the output for row 2 (third row), the third row is 0 3 3 3 0 ... so (2,3) is 3. So that's not 2. Hmm, this contradicts the hypothesis. So maybe that's not the correct pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's (i, j+1) for every 3 in (i,j). So for the 3 at (1,2), the cell (1,3) is 2. But in the output, row 1 (second row) has 0 0 3 0 ... so (1,3) is 0. So that doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternative idea: Maybe the 2s are generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in the same column but in the next row. For example, if a 3 is at (i,j), then (i+1,j) is 2. Let's check this with Example 1.\n\nIn row 1 (input row 1), column 2 is 3. So (2,2) would be 2. Looking at the output row 2 (third row), the third row is 0 3 3 3 0 ... so (2,2) is 3. So that's not 2. So this is not correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain shape, like a diagonal. For example, in Example 1, the 2s are in positions (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6). These are along the main diagonal. So maybe the 2s are placed along this diagonal where the input has 3s. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions where the input has a 3 in the same row, but to the left. For example, if there's a 3 in (i,j), then (i,j-1) is 2. But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nThis is getting really tricky. Maybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in Example 3's output, there's a 2 in row 4, column 5. The input for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 ... so column 6 (index 5?) is 0. So maybe that's not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the 2s are generated based on the number of 3s in certain positions. For example, if there are multiple 3s in a row, then a 2 is generated in a certain position. But I don't see a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain shape, like a cross or a diagonal. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the positions of the 3s. For example, in Example 1, the 3s form a certain shape, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a certain transformation of that shape.\n\nLooking at the input of Example 1, the 3s are in the first few rows. The output has 2s in positions that are part of a diagonal line. Maybe the 2s are generated in the positions that are part of a diagonal line that is formed by the 3s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain shape, like a diagonal line, and the number of 2s depends on the number of 3s in the input.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. However, given that the test input has a certain pattern, maybe I should look for a pattern that can be generalized.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in the same column but one row down, but only if the cell is not already a 3. For example, if there's a 3 in (i,j), then in (i+1,j), if it's not a 3, set it to 2. But in Example 1, row 1 (input) has a 3 in column 2. Then row 2 (output) has a 3 in column 2. So that would not change. But in row 3, column 2 is 3, and the output has a 3 there. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in the same column but one row down, but only if there's a 3 in the next row. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the positions of the 3s. For example, in the input, if there's a 3 in a certain position, then the output has a 2 in a position that is to the right and down.\n\nBut how to code this? Maybe for each cell in the input, if it's a 3, then set the cell to the right and down to 2. But that would require checking for each 3 in the input, and setting the cell (i+1, j+1) to 2. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 3 in row 1, column 2 (0-based). So (1,2) is 3. Then (2,3) is set to 2. Looking at the output, row 2, column 3 is 3. So that's not correct. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each 3 in the input, the cell to the right is set to 2. So for (i,j), set (i,j+1) to 2. Let's check this for Example 1.\n\nIn row 1, column 2 is 3. So (1,3) is set to 2. But in the output, row 1, column 3 is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in the same column but in the next row. For example, if (i,j) is 3, then (i+1,j) is 2. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, row 1, column 2 is 3. So row 2, column 2 is 3. But the output for row 2, column 2 is 3. So no change. Not helpful.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a kind of morphological operation. For example, replacing certain patterns with others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain shape, like a diagonal line. In Example 1, the 2s are in positions (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6). These are along the diagonal. So maybe the 2s are placed along the diagonal where the input has 3s.\n\nBut how to determine that? Maybe the diagonal is determined by the positions of the 3s. For example, if there's a 3 in (i,j), then the 2 is placed at (i + k, j + k) for some k.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain diagonal line, and the number of 2s depends on the number of 3s in the input.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. Given the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that for every 3 in the input, the cell to the right and down is set to 2. So for each 3 in (i,j), set (i+1,j+1) to 2. Let's see if that works for the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 3 in (1,2) (row 1, column 2). So (2,3) would be set to 2. But in the output, (2,3) is 3. So that doesn't fit. But in the output of Example 1, the fourth row (row 3) has a 2 in column 3. That would be from a 3 in row 2, column 2. So (2,2) is 3. Then (3,3) is 2. That fits. So for the 3 in row 2, column 2 (which is part of the input), the output has a 2 in (3,3). That fits. But in the input, row 2, column 2 is 3. So that would be correct.\n\nBut in row 1, column 2 is 3. So (2,3) should be 2. But in the output, row 2, column 3 is 3. So this doesn't fit. So maybe this pattern is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is generated in the same column but in the next row. For example, if there's a 3 in (i,j), then (i+1,j) is 2. But in Example 1, row 2, column 2 is 3. Then (3,2) would be 2. But in the output, row 3, column 2 is 3. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 2s are generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in the same column but in the next row, but only if that position is not already a 3. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the positions of the 3s. For example, in Example 1, the 3s form a certain shape, and the 2s are placed in positions that are part of a diagonal line that is formed by the 3s.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be implemented in code. For example, the 2s are generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in the same column but in the next row, but only if the next row's column is 0. Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain shape, like a diagonal, and the number of 2s depends on the number of 3s in the input.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. Given the time constraints, I'll have to make a hypothesis and proceed.\n\nLet me think of the following hypothesis: for each 3 in the input, the cell to the right and down is set to 2. So for each cell (i,j) in the input that is 3, set (i+1, j+1) to 2. This would generate a diagonal pattern of 2s. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has the following 3s:\n\nRow 1 (second row): 0 0 3 0 ... \u2192 (1,2) is 3.\nRow 2 (third row): 0 3 3 3 0 ... \u2192 (2,1), (2,2), (2,3) are 3.\nRow 3 (fourth row): 0 0 3 0 ... \u2192 (3,2) is 3.\nRow 6 (seventh row): 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 \u2192 (6,7) is 3.\nRow 7 (eighth row): 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 0 \u2192 (7,6), (7,7), (7,8) are 3.\nRow 8 (ninth row): 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 \u2192 (8,7) is 3.\nRow 9 (tenth row): 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 no 3s.\nRow 10 (eleventh row): 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 (10,3) is 3.\nRow 11 (twelfth row): 0 0 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 (11,2), (11,3), (11,4) are 3.\nRow 12 (thirteenth row): 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 (12,3) is 3.\n\nNow, for each of these 3s, we would set (i+1, j+1) to 2.\n\nFor example, the 3 at (1,2) would set (2,3) to 2. But in the output, row 2, column 3 is 3. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nBut for the 3 at (2,2), setting (3,3) to 2. In the output, row 3, column 3 is 2. That fits. For the 3 at (2,3), setting (3,4) to 2. In the output, row 3, column 4 is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a certain pattern, like the diagonal from (i,j) to (i+1,j+1), but only if the cell is not already a 3. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated in positions where the input has a 3 in the same row and column as a 3 in the previous row. For example, if there's a 3 in (i,j), then in (i+1,j) is 2.\n\nBut again, this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell in the input, if it is a 3, then the cell to the right and down is set to 2. This might not fit all examples, but it's a possible pattern.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nFor each i in 0 to 13 (since the output is 14x10), for each j in 0 to 9:\n\nIf grid[i][j] == 3 and i+1 < 14 and j+1 < 10:\n\nThen set transformed_grid[i+1][j+1] = 2.\n\nBut this would generate 2s along the diagonal. Let's see if this fits with the examples.\n\nFor Example 1, the output has 2s in positions (3,3), (4,4), (5,5), (6,6). Let's see if those are generated by this rule.\n\nFor example, the 3 at (2,2) in the input (row 2, column 2) would set (3,3) to 2. That fits. The 3 at (2,3) would set (3,4) to 2, but in the output, row 3, column 4 is 0. So this doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is generated in the same row, but to the right. So for each 3 at (i,j), set (i,j+1) to 2. Let's see.\n\nFor the 3 at (1,2), set (1,3) to 2. But in the output, (1,3) is 0. So no.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is generated in the next row, same column. So for each 3 at (i,j), set (i+1,j) to 2. Let's see.\n\nFor the 3 at (2,2), set (3,2) to 2. But in the output, row 3, column 2 is 3. So no.\n\nThis is very challenging. Given the time, I'll have to proceed with the assumption that the 2s are generated in positions that are part of a diagonal where the input has 3s, and the code will check for that.\n\nAnother possible pattern: the 2s are generated in positions where there's a 3 in the input, and the 2 is placed in the same column but in the next row. But only if that position is not already a 3.\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's try.\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input:\n\nif grid[i][j] == 3 and i+1 < 14:\n\n   if grid[i+1][j] != 3:\n\n       transformed_grid[i+1][j] = 2\n\nBut in Example 1, the 3 at (2,2) would set (3,2) to 2. But in the output, (3,2) is 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the next row and next column. So (i+1,j+1). Let's try this.\n\nFor the 3 at (2,2), set (3,3) to 2. Which fits the example. For the 3 at (2,3), set (3,4) to 2. But in the output, (3,4) is 0. So this doesn't fit. But in the output of Example 1, (3,3) is 2, which is set by this rule. So maybe this is part of the pattern.\n\nBut why is (3,4) not set to 2? Maybe because the input has a 3 in (2,3), but the output doesn't have a 2 there. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are generated only for certain 3s. For example, the 3s in the input that are part of a certain shape.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that for every 3 in the input, the cell to the right and down is set to 2, and see if that fits with the examples.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*10 for _ in range(14)]\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3:\n                if i+1 < 14 and j+1 < 10:\n                    transformed[i+1][j+1] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would set 2s in positions (i+1, j+1) for each 3 in the input. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the 3 at (2,2) (row 2, column 2) would set (3,3) to 2. Which fits the output. The 3 at (2,3) would set (3,4) to 2, but in the output, (3,4) is 0. So this would not fit. But maybe the 3 at (2,3) is not part of the pattern. Or maybe there's a mistake in this approach.\n\nBut given that this is the best I can think of, I'll proceed with this code and see. It might not fit all examples, but it's a possible pattern.\n\nAnother possible adjustment: maybe the 2 is set only if the cell to the right and down is 0. But that's not mentioned in the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2 is set in the same column but in the next row, and only if that cell is 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn any case, I'll proceed with the code that for each 3 in the input, the cell to the right and down is set to 2. This might not fit all examples, but it's a possible pattern.\n"
