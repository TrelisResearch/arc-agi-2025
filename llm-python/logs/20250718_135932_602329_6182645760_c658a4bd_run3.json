          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 13x8 grid (since each line has 13 numbers, but the output is 8x8). Wait, the input for Example 1 is given as 13 lines, each with 13 numbers. But the output is 8x8. So the input is a 13x13 grid, and the output is 8x8. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input for Example 1 is written as 13 lines, each with 13 numbers. But the output is 8x8. So the input is a 13x13 grid, and the output is 8x8. But how does that transformation work?\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1. Let's take the first line of input: all zeros. The output's first line is 8 8s. Wait, no. The output is 8x8. The first line of output is 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. So maybe the output is a 8x8 grid, and the input is a larger grid. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the input is a 13x13 grid, and the output is an 8x8 grid. But how are they related? Let me look at the input and output for Example 1.\n\nLooking at the input lines for Example 1:\n\nThe first line of input is all zeros. The output's first line is eight 2s. Then the second line of output is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. Hmm. Maybe the output is derived from some kind of pattern in the input.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, there are some regions with 8s, 3s, 2s, etc. Maybe the output is a transformed version where certain regions are replaced by other numbers. For example, in the input, there's a vertical line of 8s in the middle. Maybe the output is a grid that's a combination of certain values from the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking some kind of pattern from the input. For example, the output seems to have a border of 2s, and then in the middle, there's a pattern of 8s and 3s. Let me think.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 8s in the middle. The output has a vertical line of 8s in the middle. Also, there are regions where 3s are present. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input and replacing them with specific values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, cells that are in certain positions (like the middle rows or columns) are replaced with 8s, and others with 2s or 3s.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input is a 16x8 grid (since each line has 16 numbers), and the output is 8x8. The output seems to have a similar structure. For example, the first line of output is 3s. Then there's a line with 8s and 4s, then 8s and 1s, etc. So maybe the output is derived from some kind of pattern based on the input's structure.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the value in the input grid. For example, if the input has a certain value in a certain position, the output has a specific value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where certain regions are replaced. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 8s in the middle. The output has a vertical line of 8s in the middle. Also, the output's first and last rows are all 2s, and the middle rows have 8s and 3s.\n\nWait, looking at the input for Example 1, there's a vertical line of 8s in the middle. The output's middle rows have 8s. Maybe the output is generated by taking the middle columns of the input and transforming them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain position. For example, if the input has a 0 in a certain position, the output has a 2. If it's an 8, then 8. If it's a 3, then 3. But that's not possible because the output has 2s in some positions and 8s in others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of averaging or pattern recognition. For example, the output is a grid that is derived from the input by taking certain positions. For instance, the output might be a 8x8 grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain position.\n\nBut how to find that pattern?\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output:\n\nThe input's first line is all zeros. The output's first line is eight 2s. So maybe the output is derived from the input's first row, but transformed. But the input's first row is all zeros. So maybe the output is a grid where certain positions are filled with 2s, and others with 8s or 3s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and transforming it. For example, the input's middle part is a 8x8 grid, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, think about the positions. The output is 8x8. The input for example 1 is 13x13. Maybe the output is derived by taking certain rows and columns from the input.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input has 13 rows. The output is 8 rows. So maybe the output is generated by taking rows 3 to 10 (assuming 0-based or 1-based indexing), but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the middle part of the input. For example, in the input, the middle rows might be selected. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's rows 4 to 10 (assuming 0-based) might be the ones that contribute to the output. But I need to check.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0\n\nRow 2: 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n\nRow 3: 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n\nRow 4: 8 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 0\n\nRow 5: 8 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 6: 8 8 8 2 8 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 9: 4 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 10: 4 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is 8 rows. Let's look at the output for example 1:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 1: 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2\n\nRow 2: 2 8 3 3 3 3 8 2\n\nRow 3: 2 8 3 4 4 3 8 2\n\nRow 4: 2 8 3 4 4 3 8 2\n\nRow 5: 2 8 3 3 3 3 8 2\n\nRow 6: 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2\n\nRow 7: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nSo the output is a grid where the middle rows (rows 1-6 of the output) are derived from certain parts of the input. For example, the output's first row is all 2s. The second row starts and ends with 2, and has 8s in the middle.\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output's first row is all 2s, which might be derived from the input's first row (all zeros), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the output's first row is filled with 2s because the input's first row is all zeros, and the output replaces zeros with 2s.\n\nBut then, why in the output's second row, the middle part is 8s. Looking at the input's row 1, which is 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. The output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So the middle part of this row is 8s. Maybe the output is derived by taking the input's middle columns and replacing them with certain values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the middle part of the input. For example, in example 1, the input has a vertical line of 8s in the middle. The output's middle rows have 8s. Maybe the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input's columns.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each cell is determined by the value in the input's cell in a certain position. For example, if the input's cell is 8, then the output's cell is 8. If the input's cell is 3, then the output's cell is 3. If the input's cell is 0, then the output's cell is 2. But that would explain some parts.\n\nLooking at example 1's output. The first row of output is all 2s. The input's first row is all zeros. So maybe zeros are replaced by 2s. The second row of output has 2s at the ends and 8s in the middle. Looking at the input's row 1, which has 8s in the first six positions. So maybe the output's second row is taking the input's row 1, but replacing the 0s with 2s and keeping the 8s. But the input's row 1 has 0s in the 7th and 8th positions, which would become 2s. But the output's second row has 8s in the middle. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in the same position, but with some transformation. For example, if the input's cell is 0, then output is 2. If it's 8, then 8. If it's 3, then 3. But then, in the output of example 1, the first row is all 2s, which would be the case if the input's first row is all zeros. But then, why in the output's second row, the middle is 8s. Because the input's row 1 has 8s in the first six positions, and the output's second row has 8s there. So that would fit.\n\nBut then, looking at the output's third row: 2 8 3 3 3 3 8 2. Looking at the input's row 2, which is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. So the input's row 2 has 8s in positions 0 and 5, and 3s in positions 8 and 11. So the output's third row would have 8s in positions 1 and 6, but the input's row 2 has 0s in positions 1, 2, 3, 4. So maybe the output is taking the input's row 2, but replacing 0s with 2s and 8s with 8s. But the output's third row is 2 8 3 3 3 3 8 2. Which would correspond to input's row 2, but with 0s replaced by 2s. Wait, the input's row 2 is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. So the first element is 8, then zeros, then 8, then zeros, then 3, then zeros, then 3, then zeros. So if we replace zeros with 2s, the row would be 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 3 2 2 3 2. But the output's third row is 2 8 3 3 3 3 8 2. That doesn't match. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input's middle part. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle 8 rows of the input. But the input for example 1 is 13 rows. Taking rows 3 to 10 (assuming 0-based), which is 8 rows. Let's see:\n\nRows 3-10 of input for example 1:\n\nRow 3: 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n\nRow 4: 8 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 0\n\nRow 5: 8 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 6: 8 8 8 2 8 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 9: 4 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 10: 4 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nBut the output is 8 rows. If we take these 8 rows and process them somehow. For example, maybe each row is transformed by replacing certain values. But the output's first row is all 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns of the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle columns of the input. The input for example 1 has 13 columns. The middle column would be column 6 (0-based). But the output is 8x8, so maybe taking columns 3-10 (assuming 8 columns). But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain position. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + something, j + something). For example, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has a border of 2s. The middle part has 8s and 3s. The output's middle rows have 8s and 3s. Maybe the output is a grid where the outermost layer is 2s, and the inner part is filled with other values.\n\nIn example 1, the output's first row is all 2s. The second row starts and ends with 2, and has 8s in between. The third row has 2 at the ends, then 8, then 3s, then 8. So maybe the output is a grid that has a border of 2s, and the inner part is filled with other values based on the input.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input is used to fill the inner part.\n\nLooking at example 1's input, there's a vertical line of 8s in the middle. The output's middle rows have 8s. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and replacing certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and replacing 0s with 2s, and 8s with 8s, and 3s with 3s. But then, in example 1's output, the middle part has 8s and 3s, which are present in the input. But the first row of output is all 2s, which would correspond to the input's first row being all zeros, which are replaced by 2s.\n\nBut how to explain the output's second row, which has 8s in the middle. That would be the case if the input's row 1 has 8s in the middle. But the input's row 1 has 8s in the first six positions. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle rows and columns, and replacing 0s with 2s, and keeping other values.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns are used.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in the same position, but with some transformation. For example, if the input's cell is 0, then output is 2. If it's 8, then 8. If it's 3, then 3. But then, for example 1's output, the first row is all 2s. Which would be the case if the input's first row is all zeros. But then, the second row of output is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. Which would correspond to the input's second row (which is 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0). So replacing the 0s with 2s, but the input's second row has 0s in positions 6 and 7, and 3s in positions 8-11. So the output's second row would be 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 3 3 3 3 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. Which doesn't match. So that approach is not correct.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's look at example 2.\n\nIn example 2, the input is a 16x8 grid (each line has 16 numbers). The output is 8x8. The output's first row is all 3s. The second row starts and ends with 3, then has 8s and 4s. The third row has 8s and 4s, then 1s, then 4s. The fourth row has 8s and 4s, then 1s, then 2s, then 1s, then 4s. The fifth row has 8s and 4s, then 1s, then 1s, then 4s. The sixth row has 8s and 4s, then 1s, then 4s. The seventh row has 8s and 4s, then 4s. The eighth row is all 3s.\n\nLooking at the input for example 2, the first line is all zeros. The output's first row is all 3s. So again, zeros are replaced by 3s. The second row of output starts and ends with 3, and has 8s and 4s in the middle. The input's second row is 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the input's second row has 4s in positions 3-6. So the output's second row is 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 3. So the 4s in the input are replaced with 8s, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input's middle part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and replacing certain values. For example, the output is a grid where the outer layer is filled with 3s, and the inner part is filled with other values based on the input's middle.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying some kind of transformation. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in the same position, but with some rules. For example, if the input's cell is 0, the output is 2 or 3, depending on the position. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells that are in certain positions, like the middle of the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's middle 8 rows and 8 columns, and then applying some transformation.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nLooking at example 1's input, the output is 8x8. The input is 13x13. Maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 4 to 11 (assuming 0-based, 8 rows) and columns 3 to 10 (8 columns). Let's see:\n\nFor example 1's input, rows 4 to 11 would be rows 4-11 (assuming 0-based, which would be 8 rows). Let's check:\n\nRow 4: 8 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 0\n\nRow 5: 8 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 6: 8 8 8 2 8 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 9: 4 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 10: 4 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n\nSo these are 8 rows. Now, if we take columns 3 to 10 (indices 3 to 10, which is 8 columns), we get:\n\nFor row 4: columns 3-10 are 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 \u2192 8 values.\n\nBut the output's first row is 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input and replacing certain values. For example, in example 1's input, the middle part of the input has 8s and 3s, which are present in the output.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by some kind of pattern where the outer layer is filled with 2s or 3s, and the inner layers are filled with other values. For example, in example 1, the output's first row is all 2s, and the second row starts and ends with 2. This suggests that the output's outer layer is 2s, and the inner part is filled with other values.\n\nBut how to determine which values to use for the inner part.\n\nLooking at example 1's input, there's a vertical line of 8s in the middle. The output's middle rows have 8s. Maybe the output is formed by taking the input's middle part and replacing 0s with 2s, and keeping other values.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input is used.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in the same position, but with 0 replaced by 2, 8 remains 8, 3 remains 3, etc. But this would not explain the output for example 1's first row. Because the input's first row is all 0s, so the output's first row is all 2s. That fits.\n\nBut then, looking at the output's second row, which is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. The input's second row is 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. So replacing 0s with 2s, the row would be 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 3 3 3 3 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So this doesn't match. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying some transformation. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + offset, j + offset). But what is the offset?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in certain positions. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but only if it's within the input's bounds. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but with certain conditions. For example, if the input's cell is 0, the output is 2, and if it's 8, the output is 8, and if it's 3, the output is 3.\n\nBut how to determine the offset.\n\nIn example 1, the output's first row is all 2s. The input's first row is all zeros. So if the output is generated by taking the input's first row and replacing zeros with 2s, that would explain it. But then, how to explain the output's second row. The input's second row has 8s in the first six positions, and the output's second row has 8s in the middle. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the input's cell in the same position, but with 0 replaced by 2, and 8 replaced by 8, and 3 replaced by 3. But this would not explain the output's second row.\n\nWait, in example 1's output, the second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. Let's look at the input's second row: 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. So if we replace the 0s with 2s, the row would be 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 3 3 3 3 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So this doesn't match.\n\nSo perhaps the output is generated by taking certain parts of the input, not the entire row.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is a grid where the outer layer is 2s, and the inner part is filled with other values. For example, in example 1's output, the first row is all 2s, and the second row starts and ends with 2, and has 8s in the middle. This suggests that the output is a grid with a border of 2s, and the inner part is filled with other values.\n\nBut how to determine the inner part. Maybe the inner part is derived from the input's middle part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying some transformation. For example, the output's inner part is a grid where each cell is the input's cell in the same position, but with 0 replaced by 2, and other values kept.\n\nBut again, this doesn't explain the output for example 1's second row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and replacing certain values. For example, the output is a grid where the outer layer is 2s, and the inner part is filled with 8s and 3s, which are present in the input.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input is used.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's cells that are in certain positions. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but only if it's within the input's bounds. Let's try this for example 1.\n\nFor example, the output is 8x8. Let's say the input is 13x13. So for each cell (i,j) in the output, it's derived from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3). Let's see:\n\nOutput's first row (i=0) would be derived from input's row 3, columns 3 to 10. Let's look at input's row 3: 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. So columns 3-10 are 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0. But the output's first row is all 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's derived from input's row 4, columns 3-10. Row 4: 8 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 0. Columns 3-10: 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3. But the output's first row is all 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let me think of another way.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where certain regions are replaced. For example, in example 1, the output's first row is all 2s, which might correspond to the input's first row being all zeros. The second row of output is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. This could be derived from the input's row 1, which has 8s in the first six positions and 0s in the seventh and eighth, and 3s in the ninth to eleventh. So maybe the output is taking the first six positions of the input's row 1 and replacing the 0s with 2s, but the output's second row has 8s in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying a transformation. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the input's cell in the same position, but with 0 replaced by 2, and 8 replaced by 8, and 3 replaced by 3. This would explain the first row of the output being all 2s. But for the second row, the input's row 1 has 8s in the first six positions, and the output's second row has 8s in the middle. So this would fit if the input's row 1's first six positions are taken as the middle part of the output's second row.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input is used for each part of the output.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying some transformation. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but with 0 replaced by 2. Let's try this.\n\nFor example, the output's first row is i=0, j=0-7. So input's cell (0+3, 0+3) = (3,3). Input's row 3, column 3 is 0. So replaced by 2. But the output's first row is all 2s. So this would fit if all the input's cells in the middle part are 0, which they are not. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells that are in the middle of the input's rows and columns. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's middle 8x8 grid. But the input for example 1 is 13x13. The middle 8x8 grid would be from row 2 to 9 and column 2 to 9. Let's check:\n\nFor example, the output's first row is all 2s. If the input's middle part has 0s, then replacing them with 2s would explain this. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nMaybe I should look for patterns in the output. In example 1's output, the first row is all 2s, and the second row starts and ends with 2, then has 8s. The third row starts and ends with 2, then has 8, 3s, then 8. The fourth row starts and ends with 2, then has 8, 3, 4, 4, 3, 8. So it seems like the output has a border of 2s, and the inner part has 8s and 3s and 4s.\n\nIn example 2, the output has a border of 3s, and the inner part has 8s, 4s, 1s, 2s.\n\nSo perhaps the output is a grid where the border is filled with a certain value, and the inner part is filled with other values based on the input.\n\nBut how to determine which value to use for the border and which values to use for the inner part.\n\nIn example 1, the border is 2, and in example 2, the border is 3. So perhaps the border value is determined by the input's outermost layer. For example, in example 1, the input's first row is all zeros, and the output's border is 2. In example 2, the input's first row is all zeros, and the output's border is 3.\n\nThis suggests that the border value is determined by the input's outermost layer. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the border is determined by the value in the input's outermost layer. For example, in example 1, the input's first row is all zeros, so the border is 2. In example 2, the input's first row is all zeros, so the border is 3. But this doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the border is determined by the input's first row. For example, if the first row has zeros, the border is 2. If the first row has zeros, the border is 3. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the border is determined by the input's first row's value. For example, in example 1, the first row is all zeros, so the border is 2. In example 2, the first row is all zeros, so the border is 3. This suggests that the border value is not determined by the input's value but by some other rule.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where 0 is replaced by 2 or 3, and other values are kept. But how to determine which value to use.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where the border is filled with 2 or 3, and the inner part is filled with other values. But how to determine this.\n\nMaybe the border is determined by the input's first row. For example, if the first row has zeros, the border is 2. If the input's first row has zeros, the border is 3. But this is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the test input.\n\nThe test input is a 17x8 grid (since each line has 17 numbers), and the output should be 8x8. Let's see what the test input looks like.\n\nThe test input's first line is all zeros. The second line has 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The third line has 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 2 2 0 0. And so on.\n\nThe output for this test input is 8x8. But since I don't have the output, I can't see what it is. But I need to write a transformation that would handle the training examples.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in the same position, but with 0 replaced by 2 or 3, and other values kept. But how to determine which value to use.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying some transformation. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's middle 8x8 grid and replacing 0s with 2s, and keeping other values.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input is the middle 8x8 grid.\n\nIn example 1, the input is 13x13. The middle 8x8 grid would be from row 2 to 9 and column 2 to 9. Let's check:\n\nFor example, the output's first row is all 2s. If the input's middle part has 0s, then replacing them with 2s would explain this. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying a transformation where 0 is replaced by 2, and other values are kept. This would explain the first row of example 1's output being all 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's middle part, which is the input's rows 3 to 10 and columns 3 to 10, and then applying the transformation.\n\nLet's try this for example 1. For example, the input's rows 3-10 (rows 3 to 10) are 8 rows, and columns 3-10 (8 columns). Let's take these 8x8 cells and replace 0s with 2s.\n\nFor example, row 3 of the input is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. Columns 3-10 are 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0. Replacing 0s with 2s gives 2 2 8 2 2 3 2 2. But the output's first row is all 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, for each cell in the output, it is the input's cell in the same position, but with 0 replaced by 2. This would explain the first row of example 1's output being all 2s. Let's check for the second row of example 1's output.\n\nInput's second row is 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. Replacing 0s with 2s gives 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 3 3 3 3 2. The output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. This doesn't match.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of example 1 and see if there's a pattern.\n\nThe output for example 1 is an 8x8 grid where the first and last rows are all 2s. The second and seventh rows start and end with 2, with 8s and 3s in between. The third and sixth rows have 2 at the ends, 8, then 3s, then 8. The fourth and fifth rows have 2 at the ends, 8, then 3s, then 4s, then 3s, then 8.\n\nThis suggests that the output is a grid with a border of 2s, and the inner part is filled with 8s, 3s, and 4s, which are present in the input.\n\nMaybe the inner part is derived from the input's middle part, and the border is filled with 2s.\n\nSo, the transformation could be:\n\n- The output is an 8x8 grid.\n- The border (first and last rows, and first and last columns) are filled with 2s.\n- The inner part is filled with the values from the input's middle part.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input is used for the inner part.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the input is 13x13. The middle part would be rows 3-10 and columns 3-10, which is 8x8. Let's take that and fill it into the output's inner part.\n\nBut then, the output's inner part would be this 8x8 grid. But the output's inner part is not just this, but also has 8s and 3s, which are present in the input.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to implement this.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Create an 8x8 output grid.\n2. Fill the border (first and last rows, and first and last columns) with 2s.\n3. Fill the inner part with the values from the input's middle part (rows 3-10, columns 3-10).\n\nBut let's test this for example 1.\n\nFor example 1's input, the middle part is rows 3-10, columns 3-10. Let's take those and fill them into the inner part of the output.\n\nThe output's inner part would be 8x8. The border is filled with 2s. So the output would look like:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 1: 2 ... 2\nRow 2: 2 ... 2\n...\nRow 7: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nBut what is the inner part? Let's take the middle part of the input.\n\nFor example, row 3 of the input (row index 3) is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. Columns 3-10 are 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0. So replacing 0s with 2s would give 2 2 8 2 2 3 2 2. But this is part of the inner part of the output. But the output's inner part is not just this, but it's filled with the values from the input's middle part.\n\nBut this would not explain the output's second row, which has 8s in the middle.\n\nThis approach might not work.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying a transformation where 0 is replaced by 2, and other values are kept. So for example, the output is the input's middle part with 0 replaced by 2, and the border is filled with 2s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn example 1, the input's middle part would be rows 3-10, columns 3-10. Let's take that and replace 0s with 2s.\n\nFor example, row 3 of the middle part is 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 \u2192 replaced by 2 2 8 2 2 3 2 2. This would be the first row of the inner part of the output. But the output's first row is all 2s, so this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is all 2s. The second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. The third row is 2 8 3 3 3 3 8 2. The fourth row is 2 8 3 4 4 3 8 2. The fifth row is the same as the fourth. The sixth row is 2 8 3 3 3 3 8 2. The seventh row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. The eighth row is all 2s.\n\nThis suggests that the output is a grid where the middle rows have 8s and 3s, and the first and last rows are all 2s. The second and seventh rows have 8s in the middle. The third and sixth rows have 8s and 3s. The fourth and fifth rows have 8s, 3s, and 4s.\n\nThis seems like the output is formed by taking the input's middle part and applying some transformation. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's middle part and replacing 0s with 2s, and keeping other values.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input is used.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's middle part (rows 4-11 and columns 3-10), and replacing 0s with 2s.\n\nLet's try this for example 1.\n\nFor example, the input's rows 4-11 (rows 4 to 11) are:\n\nRow 4: 8 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 0 \u2192 columns 3-10: 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n\nRow 5: 8 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 \u2192 columns 3-10: 2 0 8 0 0 0 0 2\n\nRow 6: 8 8 8 2 8 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 \u2192 columns 3-10: 2 8 8 0 0 0 0 2\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 \u2192 columns 3-10: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 \u2192 columns 3-10: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nRow 9: 4 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 \u2192 columns 3-10: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nRow 10: 4 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 \u2192 columns 3-10: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 \u2192 columns 3-10: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nNow, replacing 0s with 2s in these rows:\n\nRow 4: 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 \u2192 becomes 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n\nRow 5: 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 \u2192 becomes 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 6: 2 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 \u2192 becomes 2 8 8 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 7: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 \u2192 becomes 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 8: same as row 7.\n\nRow 9: same as row 7.\n\nRow 10: same as row 7.\n\nRow 11: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nNow, this would form an 8x8 grid. Let's see what this looks like:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n\nRow 1: 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 2: 2 8 8 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 3: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 4: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 5: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 6: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 7: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nBut this doesn't match the example 1's output. The example's output has 8s in the middle of the rows, and 3s and 4s in some positions. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nThe pattern seems to be that the output is a grid where the border is filled with 2s or 3s, and the inner part is filled with values from the input, but with 0 replaced by 2 or 3. However, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is the input's cell in the same position, but with 0 replaced by 2, and 8 replaced by 8, and 3 replaced by 3. This would explain the first row of example 1's output being all 2s, and the second row having 8s in the middle.\n\nBut why in the second row of example 1's output, the first element is 2, not 8. Let's look at the input's second row: 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. Replacing 0s with 2s gives 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 3 3 3 3 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So this doesn't match.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying some transformation, but it's not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and replacing 0s with 2s, and keeping other values. The border is filled with 2s.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Create an 8x8 grid.\n2. Fill the border (first and last rows, first and last columns) with 2s.\n3. Fill the inner part with the input's middle part (rows 3-10, columns 3-10), replacing 0s with 2s.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try this for example 1.\n\nFor example 1's input, the inner part is rows 3-10, columns 3-10. Let's take those and replace 0s with 2s.\n\nFor row 3 of the inner part: 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 \u2192 replaced by 2 2 8 2 2 3 2 2.\n\nRow 4: 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 \u2192 already 2s and 3s.\n\nRow 5: 2 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 \u2192 replaced by 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nRow 6: 2 8 8 0 0 0 0 2 \u2192 replaced by 2 8 8 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nRow 7: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 \u2192 replaced by 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nRow 8: same as row 7.\n\nRow 9: same as row 7.\n\nRow 10: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nSo the inner part would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 8 2 2 3 2 2\n\nRow 1: 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n\nRow 2: 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 3: 2 8 8 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 4: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 5: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 6: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 7: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nBut this doesn't match the example's output, which has 8s in the middle of the rows.\n\nBut this is the best I can do given the time. So the code would be:\n\n- Create an 8x8 grid.\n- Fill the border with 2s.\n- Fill the inner part with the input's middle part (rows 3-10, columns 3-10), replacing 0s with 2s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Assume grid is a list of lists, with each row being a list of integers.\n    # Create an 8x8 output grid.\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(8)]\n    # Fill the border with 2s\n    for i in range(8):\n        output[0][i] = 2\n        output[7][i] = 2\n        output[i][0] = 2\n        output[i][7] = 2\n    # Fill the inner part\n    for i in range(1, 7):\n        for j in range(1, 7):\n            # Get the input's row and column\n            # Input is a 13x13 grid for example 1.\n            # So for output's inner part, input's row is i + 2 (since 0-based)\n            # and column is j + 2.\n            # Wait, for example, output's inner part is rows 1-6 (since border is 0 and 7), so input's rows 3-10 (0-based) are 3-10, which is 8 rows.\n            # So for output's row i (1-6), input's row is i + 2.\n            # Similarly for columns.\n            input_row = i + 2\n            input_col = j + 2\n            if input_row < len(grid) and input_col < len(grid[0]):\n                val = grid[input_row][input_col]\n                if val == 0:\n                    output[i][j] = 2\n                else:\n                    output[i][j] = val\n    return output\n\nBut this is just a guess. It may not work for the examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nTesting this for example 1:\n\nFor output's row 1 (i=1), j=1: input_row = 3, input_col = 3. Input's value is 0 \u2192 replaced by 2. So output[1][1] = 2. But in example 1's output, row 1 is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So this would not match.\n\nBut this is the best I can do. I'll proceed with this code.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 13x8 grid (since each line has 13 numbers, but the output is 8x8). Wait, the input for Example 1 is given as 13 lines, each with 13 numbers. But the output is 8x8. So the input is a 13x13 grid, and the output is 8x8. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input for Example 1 is written as 13 lines, each with 13 numbers. But the output is 8x8. So the input is a 13x13 grid, and the output is 8x8. But how does that transformation work?\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1. Let's take the first line of input: all zeros. The output's first line is 8 8s. Wait, no. The output is 8x8. The first line of output is 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. So maybe the output is a 8x8 grid, and the input is a larger grid. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the input is a 13x13 grid, and the output is an 8x8 grid. But how are they related? Let me look at the input and output for Example 1.\n\nLooking at the input lines for Example 1:\n\nThe first line of input is all zeros. The output's first line is eight 2s. Then the second line of output is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. Hmm. Maybe the output is derived from some kind of pattern in the input.\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, there are some regions with 8s, 3s, 2s, etc. Maybe the output is a transformed version where certain regions are replaced by other numbers. For example, in the input, there's a vertical line of 8s in the middle. Maybe the output is a grid that's a combination of certain values from the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking some kind of pattern from the input. For example, the output seems to have a border of 2s, and then in the middle, there's a pattern of 8s and 3s. Let me think.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 8s in the middle. The output has a vertical line of 8s in the middle. Also, there are regions where 3s are present. Maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input and replacing them with specific values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, cells that are in certain positions (like the middle rows or columns) are replaced with 8s, and others with 2s or 3s.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input is a 16x8 grid (since each line has 16 numbers), and the output is 8x8. The output seems to have a similar structure. For example, the first line of output is 3s. Then there's a line with 8s and 4s, then 8s and 1s, etc. So maybe the output is derived from some kind of pattern based on the input's structure.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the value in the input grid. For example, if the input has a certain value in a certain position, the output has a specific value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where certain regions are replaced. For example, in Example 1, the input has a vertical line of 8s in the middle. The output has a vertical line of 8s in the middle. Also, the output's first and last rows are all 2s, and the middle rows have 8s and 3s.\n\nWait, looking at the input for Example 1, there's a vertical line of 8s in the middle. The output's middle rows have 8s. Maybe the output is generated by taking the middle columns of the input and transforming them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain position. For example, if the input has a 0 in a certain position, the output has a 2. If it's an 8, then 8. If it's a 3, then 3. But that's not possible because the output has 2s in some positions and 8s in others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of averaging or pattern recognition. For example, the output is a grid that is derived from the input by taking certain positions. For instance, the output might be a 8x8 grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain position.\n\nBut how to find that pattern?\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output:\n\nThe input's first line is all zeros. The output's first line is eight 2s. So maybe the output is derived from the input's first row, but transformed. But the input's first row is all zeros. So maybe the output is a grid where certain positions are filled with 2s, and others with 8s or 3s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and transforming it. For example, the input's middle part is a 8x8 grid, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, think about the positions. The output is 8x8. The input for example 1 is 13x13. Maybe the output is derived by taking certain rows and columns from the input.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the input has 13 rows. The output is 8 rows. So maybe the output is generated by taking rows 3 to 10 (assuming 0-based or 1-based indexing), but that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the middle part of the input. For example, in the input, the middle rows might be selected. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, the input's rows 4 to 10 (assuming 0-based) might be the ones that contribute to the output. But I need to check.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1:\n\nRow 0: all zeros.\n\nRow 1: 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0\n\nRow 2: 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n\nRow 3: 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n\nRow 4: 8 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 0\n\nRow 5: 8 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 6: 8 8 8 2 8 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 9: 4 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 10: 4 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is 8 rows. Let's look at the output for example 1:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 1: 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2\n\nRow 2: 2 8 3 3 3 3 8 2\n\nRow 3: 2 8 3 4 4 3 8 2\n\nRow 4: 2 8 3 4 4 3 8 2\n\nRow 5: 2 8 3 3 3 3 8 2\n\nRow 6: 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2\n\nRow 7: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nSo the output is a grid where the middle rows (rows 1-6 of the output) are derived from certain parts of the input. For example, the output's first row is all 2s. The second row starts and ends with 2, and has 8s in the middle.\n\nLooking at the input, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output's first row is all 2s, which might be derived from the input's first row (all zeros), but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the output's first row is filled with 2s because the input's first row is all zeros, and the output replaces zeros with 2s.\n\nBut then, why in the output's second row, the middle part is 8s. Looking at the input's row 1, which is 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. The output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So the middle part of this row is 8s. Maybe the output is derived by taking the input's middle columns and replacing them with certain values.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the middle part of the input. For example, in example 1, the input has a vertical line of 8s in the middle. The output's middle rows have 8s. Maybe the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input's columns.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each cell is determined by the value in the input's cell in a certain position. For example, if the input's cell is 8, then the output's cell is 8. If the input's cell is 3, then the output's cell is 3. If the input's cell is 0, then the output's cell is 2. But that would explain some parts.\n\nLooking at example 1's output. The first row of output is all 2s. The input's first row is all zeros. So maybe zeros are replaced by 2s. The second row of output has 2s at the ends and 8s in the middle. Looking at the input's row 1, which has 8s in the first six positions. So maybe the output's second row is taking the input's row 1, but replacing the 0s with 2s and keeping the 8s. But the input's row 1 has 0s in the 7th and 8th positions, which would become 2s. But the output's second row has 8s in the middle. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in the same position, but with some transformation. For example, if the input's cell is 0, then output is 2. If it's 8, then 8. If it's 3, then 3. But then, in the output of example 1, the first row is all 2s, which would be the case if the input's first row is all zeros. But then, why in the output's second row, the middle is 8s. Because the input's row 1 has 8s in the first six positions, and the output's second row has 8s there. So that would fit.\n\nBut then, looking at the output's third row: 2 8 3 3 3 3 8 2. Looking at the input's row 2, which is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. So the input's row 2 has 8s in positions 0 and 5, and 3s in positions 8 and 11. So the output's third row would have 8s in positions 1 and 6, but the input's row 2 has 0s in positions 1, 2, 3, 4. So maybe the output is taking the input's row 2, but replacing 0s with 2s and 8s with 8s. But the output's third row is 2 8 3 3 3 3 8 2. Which would correspond to input's row 2, but with 0s replaced by 2s. Wait, the input's row 2 is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. So the first element is 8, then zeros, then 8, then zeros, then 3, then zeros, then 3, then zeros. So if we replace zeros with 2s, the row would be 8 2 2 2 2 8 2 2 3 2 2 3 2. But the output's third row is 2 8 3 3 3 3 8 2. That doesn't match. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input's middle part. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle 8 rows of the input. But the input for example 1 is 13 rows. Taking rows 3 to 10 (assuming 0-based), which is 8 rows. Let's see:\n\nRows 3-10 of input for example 1:\n\nRow 3: 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0\n\nRow 4: 8 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 0\n\nRow 5: 8 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 6: 8 8 8 2 8 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 9: 4 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 10: 4 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nBut the output is 8 rows. If we take these 8 rows and process them somehow. For example, maybe each row is transformed by replacing certain values. But the output's first row is all 2s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns of the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the middle columns of the input. The input for example 1 has 13 columns. The middle column would be column 6 (0-based). But the output is 8x8, so maybe taking columns 3-10 (assuming 8 columns). But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in a certain position. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + something, j + something). For example, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the output. For example, in example 1, the output has a border of 2s. The middle part has 8s and 3s. The output's middle rows have 8s and 3s. Maybe the output is a grid where the outermost layer is 2s, and the inner part is filled with other values.\n\nIn example 1, the output's first row is all 2s. The second row starts and ends with 2, and has 8s in between. The third row has 2 at the ends, then 8, then 3s, then 8. So maybe the output is a grid that has a border of 2s, and the inner part is filled with other values based on the input.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input is used to fill the inner part.\n\nLooking at example 1's input, there's a vertical line of 8s in the middle. The output's middle rows have 8s. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and replacing certain values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and replacing 0s with 2s, and 8s with 8s, and 3s with 3s. But then, in example 1's output, the middle part has 8s and 3s, which are present in the input. But the first row of output is all 2s, which would correspond to the input's first row being all zeros, which are replaced by 2s.\n\nBut how to explain the output's second row, which has 8s in the middle. That would be the case if the input's row 1 has 8s in the middle. But the input's row 1 has 8s in the first six positions. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle rows and columns, and replacing 0s with 2s, and keeping other values.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns are used.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in the same position, but with some transformation. For example, if the input's cell is 0, then output is 2. If it's 8, then 8. If it's 3, then 3. But then, for example 1's output, the first row is all 2s. Which would be the case if the input's first row is all zeros. But then, the second row of output is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. Which would correspond to the input's second row (which is 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0). So replacing the 0s with 2s, but the input's second row has 0s in positions 6 and 7, and 3s in positions 8-11. So the output's second row would be 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 3 3 3 3 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. Which doesn't match. So that approach is not correct.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Let's look at example 2.\n\nIn example 2, the input is a 16x8 grid (each line has 16 numbers). The output is 8x8. The output's first row is all 3s. The second row starts and ends with 3, then has 8s and 4s. The third row has 8s and 4s, then 1s, then 4s. The fourth row has 8s and 4s, then 1s, then 2s, then 1s, then 4s. The fifth row has 8s and 4s, then 1s, then 1s, then 4s. The sixth row has 8s and 4s, then 1s, then 4s. The seventh row has 8s and 4s, then 4s. The eighth row is all 3s.\n\nLooking at the input for example 2, the first line is all zeros. The output's first row is all 3s. So again, zeros are replaced by 3s. The second row of output starts and ends with 3, and has 8s and 4s in the middle. The input's second row is 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the input's second row has 4s in positions 3-6. So the output's second row is 3 8 8 8 8 8 8 3. So the 4s in the input are replaced with 8s, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the output is derived from the input's middle part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and replacing certain values. For example, the output is a grid where the outer layer is filled with 3s, and the inner part is filled with other values based on the input's middle.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying some kind of transformation. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in the same position, but with some rules. For example, if the input's cell is 0, the output is 2 or 3, depending on the position. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells that are in certain positions, like the middle of the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's middle 8 rows and 8 columns, and then applying some transformation.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nLooking at example 1's input, the output is 8x8. The input is 13x13. Maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows 4 to 11 (assuming 0-based, 8 rows) and columns 3 to 10 (8 columns). Let's see:\n\nFor example 1's input, rows 4 to 11 would be rows 4-11 (assuming 0-based, which would be 8 rows). Let's check:\n\nRow 4: 8 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 0\n\nRow 5: 8 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 6: 8 8 8 2 8 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 9: 4 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 10: 4 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0\n\nSo these are 8 rows. Now, if we take columns 3 to 10 (indices 3 to 10, which is 8 columns), we get:\n\nFor row 4: columns 3-10 are 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 \u2192 8 values.\n\nBut the output's first row is 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the middle part of the input and replacing certain values. For example, in example 1's input, the middle part of the input has 8s and 3s, which are present in the output.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by some kind of pattern where the outer layer is filled with 2s or 3s, and the inner layers are filled with other values. For example, in example 1, the output's first row is all 2s, and the second row starts and ends with 2. This suggests that the output's outer layer is 2s, and the inner part is filled with other values.\n\nBut how to determine which values to use for the inner part.\n\nLooking at example 1's input, there's a vertical line of 8s in the middle. The output's middle rows have 8s. Maybe the output is formed by taking the input's middle part and replacing 0s with 2s, and keeping other values.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input is used.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in the same position, but with 0 replaced by 2, 8 remains 8, 3 remains 3, etc. But this would not explain the output for example 1's first row. Because the input's first row is all 0s, so the output's first row is all 2s. That fits.\n\nBut then, looking at the output's second row, which is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. The input's second row is 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. So replacing 0s with 2s, the row would be 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 3 3 3 3 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So this doesn't match. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying some transformation. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is determined by the input's cell (i + offset, j + offset). But what is the offset?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in certain positions. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but only if it's within the input's bounds. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but with certain conditions. For example, if the input's cell is 0, the output is 2, and if it's 8, the output is 8, and if it's 3, the output is 3.\n\nBut how to determine the offset.\n\nIn example 1, the output's first row is all 2s. The input's first row is all zeros. So if the output is generated by taking the input's first row and replacing zeros with 2s, that would explain it. But then, how to explain the output's second row. The input's second row has 8s in the first six positions, and the output's second row has 8s in the middle. So maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the input's cell in the same position, but with 0 replaced by 2, and 8 replaced by 8, and 3 replaced by 3. But this would not explain the output's second row.\n\nWait, in example 1's output, the second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. Let's look at the input's second row: 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. So if we replace the 0s with 2s, the row would be 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 3 3 3 3 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So this doesn't match.\n\nSo perhaps the output is generated by taking certain parts of the input, not the entire row.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is a grid where the outer layer is 2s, and the inner part is filled with other values. For example, in example 1's output, the first row is all 2s, and the second row starts and ends with 2, and has 8s in the middle. This suggests that the output is a grid with a border of 2s, and the inner part is filled with other values.\n\nBut how to determine the inner part. Maybe the inner part is derived from the input's middle part.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying some transformation. For example, the output's inner part is a grid where each cell is the input's cell in the same position, but with 0 replaced by 2, and other values kept.\n\nBut again, this doesn't explain the output for example 1's second row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and replacing certain values. For example, the output is a grid where the outer layer is 2s, and the inner part is filled with 8s and 3s, which are present in the input.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input is used.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's cells that are in certain positions. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but only if it's within the input's bounds. Let's try this for example 1.\n\nFor example, the output is 8x8. Let's say the input is 13x13. So for each cell (i,j) in the output, it's derived from the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3). Let's see:\n\nOutput's first row (i=0) would be derived from input's row 3, columns 3 to 10. Let's look at input's row 3: 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. So columns 3-10 are 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0. But the output's first row is all 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's derived from input's row 4, columns 3-10. Row 4: 8 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 0. Columns 3-10: 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3. But the output's first row is all 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let me think of another way.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where certain regions are replaced. For example, in example 1, the output's first row is all 2s, which might correspond to the input's first row being all zeros. The second row of output is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. This could be derived from the input's row 1, which has 8s in the first six positions and 0s in the seventh and eighth, and 3s in the ninth to eleventh. So maybe the output is taking the first six positions of the input's row 1 and replacing the 0s with 2s, but the output's second row has 8s in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying a transformation. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the input's cell in the same position, but with 0 replaced by 2, and 8 replaced by 8, and 3 replaced by 3. This would explain the first row of the output being all 2s. But for the second row, the input's row 1 has 8s in the first six positions, and the output's second row has 8s in the middle. So this would fit if the input's row 1's first six positions are taken as the middle part of the output's second row.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input is used for each part of the output.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying some transformation. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i + 3, j + 3), but with 0 replaced by 2. Let's try this.\n\nFor example, the output's first row is i=0, j=0-7. So input's cell (0+3, 0+3) = (3,3). Input's row 3, column 3 is 0. So replaced by 2. But the output's first row is all 2s. So this would fit if all the input's cells in the middle part are 0, which they are not. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells that are in the middle of the input's rows and columns. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's middle 8x8 grid. But the input for example 1 is 13x13. The middle 8x8 grid would be from row 2 to 9 and column 2 to 9. Let's check:\n\nFor example, the output's first row is all 2s. If the input's middle part has 0s, then replacing them with 2s would explain this. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nMaybe I should look for patterns in the output. In example 1's output, the first row is all 2s, and the second row starts and ends with 2, then has 8s. The third row starts and ends with 2, then has 8, 3s, then 8. The fourth row starts and ends with 2, then has 8, 3, 4, 4, 3, 8. So it seems like the output has a border of 2s, and the inner part has 8s and 3s and 4s.\n\nIn example 2, the output has a border of 3s, and the inner part has 8s, 4s, 1s, 2s.\n\nSo perhaps the output is a grid where the border is filled with a certain value, and the inner part is filled with other values based on the input.\n\nBut how to determine which value to use for the border and which values to use for the inner part.\n\nIn example 1, the border is 2, and in example 2, the border is 3. So perhaps the border value is determined by the input's outermost layer. For example, in example 1, the input's first row is all zeros, and the output's border is 2. In example 2, the input's first row is all zeros, and the output's border is 3.\n\nThis suggests that the border value is determined by the input's outermost layer. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the border is determined by the value in the input's outermost layer. For example, in example 1, the input's first row is all zeros, so the border is 2. In example 2, the input's first row is all zeros, so the border is 3. But this doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, the border is determined by the input's first row. For example, if the first row has zeros, the border is 2. If the first row has zeros, the border is 3. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, the border is determined by the input's first row's value. For example, in example 1, the first row is all zeros, so the border is 2. In example 2, the first row is all zeros, so the border is 3. This suggests that the border value is not determined by the input's value but by some other rule.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's cells and applying a transformation where 0 is replaced by 2 or 3, and other values are kept. But how to determine which value to use.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where the border is filled with 2 or 3, and the inner part is filled with other values. But how to determine this.\n\nMaybe the border is determined by the input's first row. For example, if the first row has zeros, the border is 2. If the input's first row has zeros, the border is 3. But this is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the test input.\n\nThe test input is a 17x8 grid (since each line has 17 numbers), and the output should be 8x8. Let's see what the test input looks like.\n\nThe test input's first line is all zeros. The second line has 0 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The third line has 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 2 2 0 0. And so on.\n\nThe output for this test input is 8x8. But since I don't have the output, I can't see what it is. But I need to write a transformation that would handle the training examples.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cell in the same position, but with 0 replaced by 2 or 3, and other values kept. But how to determine which value to use.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying some transformation. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's middle 8x8 grid and replacing 0s with 2s, and keeping other values.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input is the middle 8x8 grid.\n\nIn example 1, the input is 13x13. The middle 8x8 grid would be from row 2 to 9 and column 2 to 9. Let's check:\n\nFor example, the output's first row is all 2s. If the input's middle part has 0s, then replacing them with 2s would explain this. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying a transformation where 0 is replaced by 2, and other values are kept. This would explain the first row of example 1's output being all 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the middle part.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's middle part, which is the input's rows 3 to 10 and columns 3 to 10, and then applying the transformation.\n\nLet's try this for example 1. For example, the input's rows 3-10 (rows 3 to 10) are 8 rows, and columns 3-10 (8 columns). Let's take these 8x8 cells and replace 0s with 2s.\n\nFor example, row 3 of the input is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. Columns 3-10 are 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0. Replacing 0s with 2s gives 2 2 8 2 2 3 2 2. But the output's first row is all 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in a certain pattern. For example, for each cell in the output, it is the input's cell in the same position, but with 0 replaced by 2. This would explain the first row of example 1's output being all 2s. Let's check for the second row of example 1's output.\n\nInput's second row is 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. Replacing 0s with 2s gives 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 3 3 3 3 2. The output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. This doesn't match.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of example 1 and see if there's a pattern.\n\nThe output for example 1 is an 8x8 grid where the first and last rows are all 2s. The second and seventh rows start and end with 2, with 8s and 3s in between. The third and sixth rows have 2 at the ends, 8, then 3s, then 8. The fourth and fifth rows have 2 at the ends, 8, then 3s, then 4s, then 3s, then 8.\n\nThis suggests that the output is a grid with a border of 2s, and the inner part is filled with 8s, 3s, and 4s, which are present in the input.\n\nMaybe the inner part is derived from the input's middle part, and the border is filled with 2s.\n\nSo, the transformation could be:\n\n- The output is an 8x8 grid.\n- The border (first and last rows, and first and last columns) are filled with 2s.\n- The inner part is filled with the values from the input's middle part.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input is used for the inner part.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the input is 13x13. The middle part would be rows 3-10 and columns 3-10, which is 8x8. Let's take that and fill it into the output's inner part.\n\nBut then, the output's inner part would be this 8x8 grid. But the output's inner part is not just this, but also has 8s and 3s, which are present in the input.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to implement this.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Create an 8x8 output grid.\n2. Fill the border (first and last rows, and first and last columns) with 2s.\n3. Fill the inner part with the values from the input's middle part (rows 3-10, columns 3-10).\n\nBut let's test this for example 1.\n\nFor example 1's input, the middle part is rows 3-10, columns 3-10. Let's take those and fill them into the inner part of the output.\n\nThe output's inner part would be 8x8. The border is filled with 2s. So the output would look like:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\nRow 1: 2 ... 2\nRow 2: 2 ... 2\n...\nRow 7: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nBut what is the inner part? Let's take the middle part of the input.\n\nFor example, row 3 of the input (row index 3) is 8 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 3 0. Columns 3-10 are 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0. So replacing 0s with 2s would give 2 2 8 2 2 3 2 2. But this is part of the inner part of the output. But the output's inner part is not just this, but it's filled with the values from the input's middle part.\n\nBut this would not explain the output's second row, which has 8s in the middle.\n\nThis approach might not work.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying a transformation where 0 is replaced by 2, and other values are kept. So for example, the output is the input's middle part with 0 replaced by 2, and the border is filled with 2s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn example 1, the input's middle part would be rows 3-10, columns 3-10. Let's take that and replace 0s with 2s.\n\nFor example, row 3 of the middle part is 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 \u2192 replaced by 2 2 8 2 2 3 2 2. This would be the first row of the inner part of the output. But the output's first row is all 2s, so this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is all 2s. The second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. The third row is 2 8 3 3 3 3 8 2. The fourth row is 2 8 3 4 4 3 8 2. The fifth row is the same as the fourth. The sixth row is 2 8 3 3 3 3 8 2. The seventh row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. The eighth row is all 2s.\n\nThis suggests that the output is a grid where the middle rows have 8s and 3s, and the first and last rows are all 2s. The second and seventh rows have 8s in the middle. The third and sixth rows have 8s and 3s. The fourth and fifth rows have 8s, 3s, and 4s.\n\nThis seems like the output is formed by taking the input's middle part and applying some transformation. For example, the output is formed by taking the input's middle part and replacing 0s with 2s, and keeping other values.\n\nBut how to determine which part of the input is used.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking the input's middle part (rows 4-11 and columns 3-10), and replacing 0s with 2s.\n\nLet's try this for example 1.\n\nFor example, the input's rows 4-11 (rows 4 to 11) are:\n\nRow 4: 8 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 0 \u2192 columns 3-10: 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n\nRow 5: 8 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 \u2192 columns 3-10: 2 0 8 0 0 0 0 2\n\nRow 6: 8 8 8 2 8 8 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 \u2192 columns 3-10: 2 8 8 0 0 0 0 2\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 \u2192 columns 3-10: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 \u2192 columns 3-10: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nRow 9: 4 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 \u2192 columns 3-10: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nRow 10: 4 4 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 \u2192 columns 3-10: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nRow 11: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 \u2192 columns 3-10: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nNow, replacing 0s with 2s in these rows:\n\nRow 4: 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 \u2192 becomes 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n\nRow 5: 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2 \u2192 becomes 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 6: 2 8 8 2 2 2 2 2 \u2192 becomes 2 8 8 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 7: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 \u2192 becomes 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 8: same as row 7.\n\nRow 9: same as row 7.\n\nRow 10: same as row 7.\n\nRow 11: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nNow, this would form an 8x8 grid. Let's see what this looks like:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n\nRow 1: 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 2: 2 8 8 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 3: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 4: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 5: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 6: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 7: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nBut this doesn't match the example 1's output. The example's output has 8s in the middle of the rows, and 3s and 4s in some positions. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nThe pattern seems to be that the output is a grid where the border is filled with 2s or 3s, and the inner part is filled with values from the input, but with 0 replaced by 2 or 3. However, I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is the input's cell in the same position, but with 0 replaced by 2, and 8 replaced by 8, and 3 replaced by 3. This would explain the first row of example 1's output being all 2s, and the second row having 8s in the middle.\n\nBut why in the second row of example 1's output, the first element is 2, not 8. Let's look at the input's second row: 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 3 3 3 0. Replacing 0s with 2s gives 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 3 3 3 3 2. But the output's second row is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So this doesn't match.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and applying some transformation, but it's not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output is generated by taking the input's middle part and replacing 0s with 2s, and keeping other values. The border is filled with 2s.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Create an 8x8 grid.\n2. Fill the border (first and last rows, first and last columns) with 2s.\n3. Fill the inner part with the input's middle part (rows 3-10, columns 3-10), replacing 0s with 2s.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let's try this for example 1.\n\nFor example 1's input, the inner part is rows 3-10, columns 3-10. Let's take those and replace 0s with 2s.\n\nFor row 3 of the inner part: 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 \u2192 replaced by 2 2 8 2 2 3 2 2.\n\nRow 4: 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 \u2192 already 2s and 3s.\n\nRow 5: 2 0 8 0 0 0 0 2 \u2192 replaced by 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nRow 6: 2 8 8 0 0 0 0 2 \u2192 replaced by 2 8 8 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nRow 7: 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 \u2192 replaced by 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nRow 8: same as row 7.\n\nRow 9: same as row 7.\n\nRow 10: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nSo the inner part would be:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 8 2 2 3 2 2\n\nRow 1: 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3\n\nRow 2: 2 2 8 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 3: 2 8 8 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 4: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 5: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 6: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nRow 7: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nBut this doesn't match the example's output, which has 8s in the middle of the rows.\n\nBut this is the best I can do given the time. So the code would be:\n\n- Create an 8x8 grid.\n- Fill the border with 2s.\n- Fill the inner part with the input's middle part (rows 3-10, columns 3-10), replacing 0s with 2s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo, in code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Assume grid is a list of lists, with each row being a list of integers.\n    # Create an 8x8 output grid.\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(8)] for _ in range(8)]\n    # Fill the border with 2s\n    for i in range(8):\n        output[0][i] = 2\n        output[7][i] = 2\n        output[i][0] = 2\n        output[i][7] = 2\n    # Fill the inner part\n    for i in range(1, 7):\n        for j in range(1, 7):\n            # Get the input's row and column\n            # Input is a 13x13 grid for example 1.\n            # So for output's inner part, input's row is i + 2 (since 0-based)\n            # and column is j + 2.\n            # Wait, for example, output's inner part is rows 1-6 (since border is 0 and 7), so input's rows 3-10 (0-based) are 3-10, which is 8 rows.\n            # So for output's row i (1-6), input's row is i + 2.\n            # Similarly for columns.\n            input_row = i + 2\n            input_col = j + 2\n            if input_row < len(grid) and input_col < len(grid[0]):\n                val = grid[input_row][input_col]\n                if val == 0:\n                    output[i][j] = 2\n                else:\n                    output[i][j] = val\n    return output\n\nBut this is just a guess. It may not work for the examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nTesting this for example 1:\n\nFor output's row 1 (i=1), j=1: input_row = 3, input_col = 3. Input's value is 0 \u2192 replaced by 2. So output[1][1] = 2. But in example 1's output, row 1 is 2 8 8 8 8 8 8 2. So this would not match.\n\nBut this is the best I can do. I'll proceed with this code.\n"
