          "First, let's analyze the three ARC training examples and the transformations:\n\nThe grids are 10x10.  \nColors appear to correspond to numbers, but the exact color-number map isn't critical; we see multiple colors in the input.\n\n### Observations:\n\n- **In Input grids:** the colored cells appear scattered in the 10x10 grid.  \n- **In Output grids:**  \n\n  - The colored cells are clustered along the leftmost columns \u2014 1 to 4 columns wide at most.  \n  - The colors appear sorted vertically in columns from bottom to top or top to bottom.  \n  - The output contains vertical colored stripes stacked by color and possibly by numeric value.  \n\n### More specific deductions:\n\n- In all outputs, the column height of each color stripe corresponds roughly to the count of that color in the input.\n- Colors are arranged so that the bottom rows show smaller numbered colors and the top rows higher numbers (or vice versa).\n- The number pattern 1,2,3,4 always appears in output in the bottom rows, aligned from left to right.\n- For example 1, the output has columns with stripes of color values 1,2,3,4 in that order left to right, filled from bottom to top.\n- For example 2, it forms color stripes in columns with colors 1,2,3,4 ordered from left to right, stacked vertically from bottom.\n- For example 3, similar appearance: 1,2,3,4 stripes from left to right bottom-up.\n- The extra elements in input like color 3 in example 2 appear sometimes in the output in a 3rd column from the left, but the main focus seems on colors 1,2,3,4.\n\n### Morphing the observations into a pattern:\n\n- Collect counts of colors 1, 2, 3, 4 in the input.\n- For each color, create a vertical stripe of that color in the output, from bottom rows upwards, starting from left column for color 1, next column for color 2, etc.\n- The columns appear only for colors 1 to 4.\n- Color 0 is background black (zero).\n- Other colors besides 1-4 seem to be ignored or filtered out.\n\n### Handle extra nuances:\n\n- The count of each color determines how many cells in the output column are painted with that color.  \n- These colored stripes grow from bottom rows upwards.  \n- The 10x10 grid output only has colored cells in columns 0 to 3 for colors 1 to 4 respectively, rest is zero.  \n- If a color count is zero, that column is empty.\n- If count exceeds 10, fill the full 10 rows.\n\n### Plan:\n\n- Initialize a 10x10 zero grid.\n- For each color c in 1..4:\n  - Count how many times c occurs in input.\n  - Fill grid rows from bottom up in column c-1 with color c for that many cells.\n\nThis matches the patterns in all 3 training outputs.\n\n---\n\n### Now let's write code to implement this transformation.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize output grid 10x10 with zeros\n    output = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Count occurrences of colors 1 to 4\n    counts = [0]*5  # 0 index unused, colors 1 to 4\n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            if 1 <= val <= 4:\n                counts[val] += 1\n                \n    # For each color 1..4, fill output column (color-1) from bottom rows up\n    for color in range(1,5):\n        count = counts[color]\n        for i in range(count):\n            row = 9 - i  # start from bottom row 9 upwards\n            if row < 0:\n                break\n            output[row][color-1] = color\n            \n    return output\n```\n"

              "First, let's analyze the three ARC training examples and the transformations:\n\nThe grids are 10x10.  \nColors appear to correspond to numbers, but the exact color-number map isn't critical; we see multiple colors in the input.\n\n### Observations:\n\n- **In Input grids:** the colored cells appear scattered in the 10x10 grid.  \n- **In Output grids:**  \n\n  - The colored cells are clustered along the leftmost columns \u2014 1 to 4 columns wide at most.  \n  - The colors appear sorted vertically in columns from bottom to top or top to bottom.  \n  - The output contains vertical colored stripes stacked by color and possibly by numeric value.  \n\n### More specific deductions:\n\n- In all outputs, the column height of each color stripe corresponds roughly to the count of that color in the input.\n- Colors are arranged so that the bottom rows show smaller numbered colors and the top rows higher numbers (or vice versa).\n- The number pattern 1,2,3,4 always appears in output in the bottom rows, aligned from left to right.\n- For example 1, the output has columns with stripes of color values 1,2,3,4 in that order left to right, filled from bottom to top.\n- For example 2, it forms color stripes in columns with colors 1,2,3,4 ordered from left to right, stacked vertically from bottom.\n- For example 3, similar appearance: 1,2,3,4 stripes from left to right bottom-up.\n- The extra elements in input like color 3 in example 2 appear sometimes in the output in a 3rd column from the left, but the main focus seems on colors 1,2,3,4.\n\n### Morphing the observations into a pattern:\n\n- Collect counts of colors 1, 2, 3, 4 in the input.\n- For each color, create a vertical stripe of that color in the output, from bottom rows upwards, starting from left column for color 1, next column for color 2, etc.\n- The columns appear only for colors 1 to 4.\n- Color 0 is background black (zero).\n- Other colors besides 1-4 seem to be ignored or filtered out.\n\n### Handle extra nuances:\n\n- The count of each color determines how many cells in the output column are painted with that color.  \n- These colored stripes grow from bottom rows upwards.  \n- The 10x10 grid output only has colored cells in columns 0 to 3 for colors 1 to 4 respectively, rest is zero.  \n- If a color count is zero, that column is empty.\n- If count exceeds 10, fill the full 10 rows.\n\n### Plan:\n\n- Initialize a 10x10 zero grid.\n- For each color c in 1..4:\n  - Count how many times c occurs in input.\n  - Fill grid rows from bottom up in column c-1 with color c for that many cells.\n\nThis matches the patterns in all 3 training outputs.\n\n---\n\n### Now let's write code to implement this transformation.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize output grid 10x10 with zeros\n    output = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Count occurrences of colors 1 to 4\n    counts = [0]*5  # 0 index unused, colors 1 to 4\n    for row in grid:\n        for val in row:\n            if 1 <= val <= 4:\n                counts[val] += 1\n                \n    # For each color 1..4, fill output column (color-1) from bottom rows up\n    for color in range(1,5):\n        count = counts[color]\n        for i in range(count):\n            row = 9 - i  # start from bottom row 9 upwards\n            if row < 0:\n                break\n            output[row][color-1] = color\n            \n    return output\n```\n"
