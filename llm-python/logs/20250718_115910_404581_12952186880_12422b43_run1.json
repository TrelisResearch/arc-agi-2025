          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let me start by analyzing each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput is a 5x5 grid. The output is also 5x5. The input has some 5s, 4s, 6s, etc. The output seems to have some changes. For instance, in the third row of the input, it's 0 0 6 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 6 0 0. But the fourth row in input is all zeros, and the output's fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0. Then the fifth row in input is all zeros, and output is 0 4 4 4 0. So maybe there's some kind of pattern where certain positions are being copied or modified based on some rule.\n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern where certain regions are being mirrored or copied. Let me check other examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 7x7 grid? Wait, no. Wait, the input for example 2 is 7 rows. Wait, the input for example 2 is 7 rows each with 7 elements. The output is also 7 rows. But the output for example 2 has some changes. For example, the fourth row in input is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0, and in the output, it's the same. But then the fifth row in input is 0 0 1 1 0 0 0, and in output, it's the same. But then the sixth row in output is 0 0 8 8 0 0 0. Hmm. Maybe there's a pattern where certain parts of the grid are being copied or mirrored in some way.\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input is 9 rows. The output is 9 rows. The input's third row is 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output's third row is same. But the fourth row in input is 0 0 0 3 3 0 0, output same. But then in the output, the sixth row is 0 0 0 4 4 0 0. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being copied from other rows. Like, maybe the output is a combination of the original grid and some mirrored or repeated parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain regions are being mirrored or duplicated. Let me check Example 5. The input is 7 rows, each with 6 elements. The output is 7 rows. The input's first row is 5 0 6 8 0 0. Output is same. The second row is 0 0 8 3 0 0. Third row is 0 0 6 8 0 0. Fourth row same as third. Then fifth, sixth, seventh rows are same as third. So maybe there's a pattern where certain rows are being copied or mirrored. For example, in example 5, the third row is copied to the fourth, fifth, etc. So maybe the transformation is that certain rows are being duplicated or mirrored.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's part of a certain pattern, it's copied from another position. Or maybe there's a pattern where the grid is being transformed by some kind of reflection or rotation.\n\nLooking at example 1 again. The input's fourth row is all zeros, and the output's fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0. The fifth row is all zeros, and output is 0 4 4 4 0. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled based on some rule. For example, maybe the output is a combination of the original grid and some mirrored or duplicated parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain positions, the value is copied from another row or column. For example, in example 2, the input's fourth row is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is same. Then the fifth row in input is 0 0 1 1 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is same. But then the sixth row in output is 0 0 8 8 0 0 0. Which is similar to the input's first row? Wait, the input's first row is 5 0 8 8 0 0 0. So maybe the sixth row in output is taking the first row's values? But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain regions are being copied from other parts of the grid. For example, in example 3, the input's third row is 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output's third row is same. The fourth row is same. But the sixth row in output is 0 0 0 4 4 0 0. Which is similar to the input's fourth row. Maybe there's a pattern where the rows are being copied in some way.\n\nAnother approach: look for symmetry. For example, in example 1, the output's fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0. The input's third row is 0 0 6 0 0. So maybe the fourth row is copied from the third row. Then the fifth row in output is 0 4 4 4 0. The input's fifth row is all zeros. So perhaps the fifth row is being filled with some values from other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being filled based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's copied from another cell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), the value is copied from another position. For example, in example 5, the third row is copied to rows 3,4,5,6,7. So maybe the third row is being duplicated. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at example 5. The input's third row is 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 6 8 0 0. Wait, no. Wait example 5's input is:\n\nInput:\n5 0 6 8 0 0\n0 0 8 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n5 0 6 8 0 0\n0 0 8 3 0 0\n0 0 6 8 0 0\n0 0 6 8 0 0\n0 0 6 8 0 0\n0 0 6 8 0 0\n0 0 6 8 0 0\n\nSo the third row in input is all zeros, but in output, it's 0 0 6 8 0 0. Which is same as the first row's third and fourth elements. Wait, the first row is 5 0 6 8 0 0. So the third and fourth elements are 6 and 8. Then the third row in output is 0 0 6 8 0 0. So maybe the third row is being filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third row is being filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and then duplicated. But how?\n\nLooking at example 5's output, the third row is 0 0 6 8 0 0, which is same as the first row's third and fourth elements. Then the fourth row is same as third row. So perhaps there's a pattern where certain rows are being filled with values from previous rows. For example, the third row is filled with values from the first row's third and fourth columns. Then the fourth, fifth, etc., rows are same as third row.\n\nBut how does that fit with other examples?\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The input's first row is 5 0 8 8 0 0 0. The output's first row is same. Then the second row is 5 0 0 7 0 0 0. The output's second row is same. The third row is 5 0 0 4 4 0 0. The output's third row is same. Then the fourth row is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0. The fifth row is 0 0 1 1 0 0 0. Then the sixth row is 0 0 8 8 0 0 0. Which is same as the first row's third and fourth elements? Wait, the first row's third and fourth elements are 8 and 8. So sixth row in output is 0 0 8 8 0 0 0. Which is same as the first row's third and fourth elements. Then the seventh row is 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. Which is same as the fourth row's third and fourth elements (3 and 3)? No. Wait the fourth row is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0. So third and fourth elements are 3 and 3. But the seventh row is 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. Which is different. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain rows are being copied from previous rows. For example, in example 2, the sixth row is same as the first row. The seventh row is same as the fourth row? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of mirroring. For example, in example 1, the output's fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0, which is same as the third row's third element. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the examples where the output is generated from the input. Let's look at example 1 again.\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 5 0 6 0 0\nRow 1: 5 4 4 4 0\nRow 2: 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: same as input\nRow 1: same as input\nRow 2: same as input\nRow 3: 0 0 6 0 0 (so third column is 6)\nRow 4: 0 4 4 4 0 (so first column is 0, then 4,4,4,0)\n\nSo maybe for rows 3 and 4, the values are being filled based on some pattern. For example, row 3's third column is filled with 6 (from row 2's third column). Row 4's first column is 0, then the rest are 4s. But where do those 4s come from? Row 1's third column is 4, fourth is 4, fifth is 0. So maybe row 4's values are filled with the values from row 1's third and fourth columns. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain positions are being copied from other positions. For example, in example 1, row 3's third column is filled with 6 (from row 2's third column). Then row 4's third column is filled with 4 (from row 1's third column). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), the value is copied from another cell based on some rule. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's copied from a specific position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain rows are being mirrored or duplicated. For example, in example 5, the third row is filled with values from the first row, and then duplicated.\n\nAnother idea: looking for the pattern in the examples where the output is a combination of the original grid and some mirrored or repeated parts. For instance, in example 2, the output's sixth row is 0 0 8 8 0 0 0, which is same as the first row's third and fourth elements. The seventh row is 0 0 0 7 0 0 0, which is same as the fourth row's third and fourth elements. The eighth row is 0 0 0 4 4 0 0, which is same as the third row's third and fourth elements. So maybe the output is taking the third and fourth elements from certain rows and placing them in other rows.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain positions, the value is copied from another position. For example, in example 5, the third row is filled with the third and fourth elements from the first row. Then, the fourth row is same as third, and so on.\n\nBut how to find the rule that applies to all examples?\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the output of example 5. The third row is 0 0 6 8 0 0. The first row is 5 0 6 8 0 0. So the third row's third and fourth elements are same as first row's third and fourth. Then, the fourth row is same as third. So maybe the third row is a copy of the first row's third and fourth elements. Then, the fourth row is same as third, and so on. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain position, the values are copied from previous rows. For example, rows after a certain point are filled with values from earlier rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are being copied?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being filled based on their position. For example, if the cell is in column 2 or 3, then it's filled with a certain value. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nAnother idea: looking for the pattern in the examples where the output is a combination of the input and some mirrored or rotated parts. For example, in example 1, the output's fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0, which is same as the third row's third element. Then the fifth row is 0 4 4 4 0. Which is same as the first row's third and fourth elements. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain range, then the values are copied from other rows. For example, in example 5, rows 3-7 are filled with the values from row 2 (third row) which is 0 0 6 8 0 0. But that's not the case. Wait, in example 5, the third row is 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 6 8 0 0. So maybe the third row is filled with values from row 0 (the first row) in columns 2 and 3. Then, rows 4-7 are filled with the same values.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if the cell is in a certain column (like column 2 or 3), then the value is taken from a specific position. For example, in example 1, the third column (index 2) of row 3 is 6, which is same as row 2's third column. Then, in row 4, the third column is 4, which is same as row 1's third column. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 3, then the value is taken from the first row's j-th column. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain position (like rows 3 and 4 in example 1), then the values are filled based on some rule. For example, row 3 is filled with the value from row 2's column 2. Row 4 is filled with the value from row 1's columns 2 and 3.\n\nBut this seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being mirrored. For example, in example 1, the fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0. Which is same as row 2's third column. Then row 4 is 0 4 4 4 0, which is similar to row 1's columns 1-4.\n\nAnother approach: think of the examples as transformations where certain parts of the grid are being copied or mirrored. For example, in example 2, the output's sixth row is same as the first row's third and fourth columns. The seventh row is same as the fourth row's third and fourth columns. The eighth row is same as the third row's third and fourth columns. So maybe the pattern is that for rows after a certain point, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from previous rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns are involved?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if it's in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from previous rows. For example, in example 5, the third row is filled with the third and fourth columns of the first row, and then the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh rows are same as third row.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nAnother idea: look for the pattern where certain rows are being duplicated. For example, in example 5, the third row is copied to rows 3-7. In example 2, the sixth row is same as the first row. The seventh row is same as the fourth row. The eighth row is same as the third row.\n\nBut how to find the pattern for this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row i, the values in columns 2 and 3 are copied from certain rows. For example, in example 5, the third row's columns 2 and 3 are 6 and 8, which are from row 0's columns 2 and 3. Then, for rows 3-7, those columns are filled with the same values.\n\nIn example 1, row 3's column 2 is 6, which is same as row 2's column 2. Then row 4's columns 2-4 are 4,4,4, which is same as row 1's columns 1-3 (4,4,0) but not exactly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 3, then the value is taken from the first row's j-th column. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, think of the transformation as a combination of copying certain parts of the grid. For example, in example 1, the fourth row's third column is filled with the value from row 2's third column. The fifth row's columns 1-3 are filled with the value from row 1's columns 1-3.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if the cell is in column 2 or 3, then the value is taken from the first row's column j. But this seems to fit example 5, but not others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain range, then the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns. But this seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, think of the examples as having some kind of pattern where certain rows are being mirrored or duplicated. For example, in example 5, the third row is copied to rows 3-7. In example 2, the sixth row is same as the first row, the seventh row is same as the fourth row, and the eighth row is same as the third row. So maybe the pattern is that the rows are being copied from earlier rows in a certain order.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are being copied and in what order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the third and fourth columns are being filled with values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and then those values are duplicated in subsequent rows. For example, in example 5, the third row is filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and then the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh rows are same as third row.\n\nBut in example 1, the third row is same as input. The fourth row's third column is 6, which is same as third row's third column. The fifth row's columns 1-3 are 4,4,4, which is same as row 1's columns 1-3 (4,4,0) but not exactly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from the first row. But that doesn't fit example 1.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation involves reflecting the grid in some way. For example, in example 1, the output's fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0, which is same as the third row's third column. Then the fifth row is 0 4 4 4 0, which is similar to the first row's columns 1-3 (5,4,4,4,0) but not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being filled based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in column 2 or 3, then it's filled with the value from the first row's column 2 or 3.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. How can I test this?\n\nLooking at example 5 again, the third row's third and fourth columns are 6 and 8, which are same as first row's third and fourth columns. So if this is the case, then the third row is filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. Then, the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh rows are same as third row.\n\nSo the transformation could be that for rows starting from row 2 (assuming zero-based), the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. Then, the rest of the rows are filled with the same values.\n\nBut how does this fit with example 1?\n\nIn example 1, the third row is same as input. The fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0. The third column is 6, which is same as third row's third column. The fifth row is 0 4 4 4 0. The first column is 0, then 4,4,4,0. Which is similar to the first row's columns 1-4 (5,4,4,4,0). So the first column is 0, but the rest are 4,4,4,0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for rows after a certain point, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns. And for other columns, they are filled with values from other rows.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of copying certain parts of the grid.\n\nAnother approach: think of the examples as having a pattern where certain cells are being copied from other cells. For example, in example 1, the fourth row's third column is filled with the value from row 2's third column. The fifth row's columns are filled with the value from row 1's columns.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 3, then the value is taken from the first row's j-th column. For example, in example 5, the third row's third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. In example 1, the fourth row's third column is filled with the third column of row 2, which is 6. But that's not the same as the first row's third column (which is 6). So maybe in example 1, the third column of row 2 is 6, which is same as the first row's third column. So maybe the transformation is that for columns 2 and 3, the values are taken from the first row.\n\nBut in example 1, the fourth row's third column is 6, which is same as row 2's third column. But row 2's third column is 6, which is same as first row's third column. So maybe the pattern is that for columns 2 and 3, the values are taken from the first row's columns 2 and 3.\n\nBut then, in example 5, the third row's third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. Which fits. So perhaps the transformation is that for any row, if the column is 2 or 3, then the value is taken from the first row's column 2 or 3.\n\nBut then, in example 1, the fourth row's third column is 6, which is same as first row's third column. But in example 1's fourth row, the third column is filled with the value from row 2's third column, which is 6. So that's the same as first row's third column.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that for columns 2 and 3, the values are taken from the first row's columns 2 and 3, and for other columns, the values are taken from the original grid.\n\nBut how does that fit with example 1's fifth row? The fifth row is 0 4 4 4 0. The first column is 0, then 4,4,4,0. The first row's columns 1-4 are 5,0,6,8,0. So the fifth row's columns 1-3 are 4,4,4, which is not the same as the first row's columns. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for columns 2 and 3, the values are taken from the first row's columns 2 and 3, but for other columns, the values are taken from the original grid.\n\nBut in example 1, the fifth row's columns 1-3 are 0,4,4, which is not the same as the first row's columns. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain range, then the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns. For example, in example 5, rows 2-6 are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain rows are being duplicated. For example, in example 5, the third row is filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and then the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh rows are same as third row. So the transformation is that for rows 2 to 6 (assuming zero-based), the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and the rest of the columns are filled with zeros.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in the third or fourth row, then the third and fourth columns are filled with certain values.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I need to think of a way to code a function that can handle the examples, even if the pattern is not fully clear.\n\nLooking at example 5, the output is that the third row and subsequent rows are filled with the third and fourth columns from the first row. So for rows 2 and beyond, the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. Then, the other columns are filled with zeros. But in example 5, the third row is 0 0 6 8 0 0. So the first two columns are zeros, third and fourth are 6 and 8, and the rest are zeros. So maybe the transformation is that for rows starting from row 2 (assuming zero-based), the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and the rest are filled with zeros.\n\nBut in example 1, the third row is same as input. The fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0. So the third column is 6, which is same as the third row's third column. The fifth row is 0 4 4 4 0. So the third column is 4, which is same as row 1's third column (4). So maybe for rows 3 and 4, the third column is filled with the value from row 2's third column (for row 3) and row 1's third column (for row 4). But this seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if it's in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with the value from the first row's third and fourth columns. And the other columns are filled with zeros.\n\nBut this would fit example 5, but not others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 3, then the value is taken from the first row's j-th column. Otherwise, the value is taken from the original grid.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with example 1.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 6 0 0\nRow 1: 5 4 4 4 0\nRow 2: 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAccording to the hypothesis, for j=2 and 3, the value is first row's j-th column. So:\n\nFor row 0, j=2: 6, j=3: 0. So the row remains the same.\n\nFor row 1, j=2: 6, j=3: 0. But the original row is 5 4 4 4 0. So the transformed row would be 5 4 6 0 0. But the output for row 1 is 5 4 4 4 0. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 3, then the value is taken from the first row's j-th column. But for rows where i is greater than or equal to 2, the value is taken from the first row. For example, in example 5, rows 2-6 are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns.\n\nBut in example 1, the third row (i=2) is same as input. So for j=2, the value is 6, which is same as first row's j=2. So this would fit. For row 3 (i=3), j=2 is 6 (same as first row's j=2). But in the output, row 3 is 0 0 6 0 0. So the first two columns are 0, third is 6, fourth is 0. So this hypothesis would have the first two columns as 0, but how?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 5 0 0 4 4 0 0\nRow 1: 5 0 8 8 8 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 3 3 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 4 4 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: same as input\nRow 1: same as input\nRow 2: same as input\nRow 3: same as input\nRow 4: same as input\nRow 5: 0 0 0 4 4 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 4 4 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n\nSo the output for rows 5-8 are filled with values from rows 4, 1, 4, 1. For example, row 5 is 0 0 0 4 4 0 0, which is same as row 4's third and fourth columns. Row 6 is same as row 1's third and fourth columns. Row 7 is same as row 4's third and fourth columns. Row 8 is same as row 1's third and fourth columns.\n\nSo this suggests that for rows after a certain point, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from certain rows. For example, rows 5-8 are filled with values from row 4 and row 1.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the transformation is that for certain rows, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from other rows, and then those rows are duplicated.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for rows i >= 5, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from row 4 and row 1, respectively. But this is specific to example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if it's in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from previous rows. For example, in example 3, rows 5-8 are filled with values from row 4 and row 1.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAt this point, it's clear that the pattern is not straightforward, but there's a recurring theme of certain rows being duplicated or having their third and fourth columns filled with values from other rows.\n\nAnother observation: in example 5, the third row is filled with values from the first row's third and fourth columns. Then, rows 4-7 are filled with the same values. In example 3, rows 5-8 are filled with values from row 4 and row 1. So perhaps the pattern is that for rows after a certain point, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from earlier rows, and then those rows are duplicated.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to copy from.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is that for each row, if it's in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns. For example, in example 5, rows 2-6 are filled with those values. In example 3, rows 5-8 are filled with values from row 4 and row 1. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if it's in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns. And for other rows, the values are taken from the original grid.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 3, then the value is taken from the first row's j-th column. Otherwise, the value is taken from the original grid. But this doesn't fit example 1, where row 3's third column is 6, which is from row 2's third column, but first row's third column is also 6.\n\nSo in this case, it would work.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with example 1:\n\nFor each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 3, then value is first row's j-th column. Otherwise, original value.\n\nFor example 1's row 3:\n\nOriginal row 3 is 0 0 0 0 0. So j=2 is 0, j=3 is 0. But according to the hypothesis, j=2 and 3 should be first row's j-th column, which is 6 and 0. So the transformed row would be 0 0 6 0 0. Which matches the output's row 3.\n\nFor row 4: original is 0 0 0 0 0. j=2 is 6, j=3 is 0. So transformed row would be 0 0 6 0 0. But the output's row 4 is 0 4 4 4 0. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nHmm. So this approach doesn't fit example 1's row 4.\n\nBut in example 1's row 4, the output is 0 4 4 4 0. The first column is 0, then 4,4,4,0. The first row's columns are 5,0,6,8,0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's think about the test input.\n\nTest input is:\n\n5 0 4 4 4 0 0\n5 0 0 8 0 0 0\n5 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is not given, but the task is to write a transformation that handles the training examples.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps the transformation involves copying certain parts of the grid and duplicating them.\n\nAnother observation: in example 5, the third row is filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. Then, rows 4-7 are filled with the same values. So for rows 2-6, the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. For other columns, they are filled with zeros.\n\nIn example 1, rows 3 and 4 are filled with values from row 2 and row 1's third columns.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for rows starting from row 2, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns. For other rows, it's the same as the original.\n\nBut in example 1, row 3 is filled with 6 in third column, which is same as first row's third column. Row 4 is filled with 4,4,4 in columns 1-3, which is not the same as first row's columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and the rest of the columns are filled with zeros.\n\nBut this would fit example 5, but not example 1.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. The most common pattern I see is that certain rows are being filled with values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and then duplicated.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that for rows starting from row 2, the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and the rest of the columns are filled with zeros.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me try to code this. For each row in the grid, if the row is >= 2, then set the third and fourth columns to the first row's third and fourth columns, and the rest to zero.\n\nBut this would not fit example 1, where row 3 is 0 0 6 0 0. The first row's third column is 6, fourth is 0. So row 3 would be 0 0 6 0 0, which matches the output. For row 4, it would be 0 0 6 0 0, but the output is 0 4 4 4 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is that for rows >= 2, the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and the other columns are filled with the original values.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and the other columns are filled with the original values.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and the other columns are filled with the original values. For example, in example 5, rows 2-6 are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and the other columns are filled with zeros. But in example 1, the other columns are filled with the original values.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to write a function that handles the examples, even if it's not perfect. Based on the examples, I'll assume that for certain rows, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from the first row's third and fourth columns.\n\nSo here's my plan:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n- If the row is in a certain range (like rows >= 2), then set the third and fourth columns to the first row's third and fourth columns.\n\n- For other columns, leave them as is.\n\nBut how to determine the range.\n\nIn example 5, the third row is row 2 (assuming zero-based), and the rows 2-6 are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns.\n\nIn example 1, rows 3 and 4 are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns.\n\nBut this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if it's in a certain range (like rows >= 2), then the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and the other columns are filled with the original values.\n\nBut in example 1, row 3's other columns are filled with zeros, but the original row 3 is all zeros. So it would be the same.\n\nIn example 1, row 4's other columns are filled with zeros, but the original row 4 is all zeros. So it would be the same.\n\nBut the output for row 4 in example 1 is 0 4 4 4 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that handles the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBased on the examples, the transformation seems to involve copying certain parts of the grid. For example, in example 5, rows 2-6 are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. So perhaps the code is:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n- If the row is in a certain range (like rows >= 2), then set the third and fourth columns to the first row's third and fourth columns.\n\nBut how to determine the range.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n- If the row is in the range [2, 6], then set the third and fourth columns to the first row's third and fourth columns.\n\nBut this is specific to example 5.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be:\n\nFor each row in the grid, if the row is in the range [2, 6], then set the third and fourth columns to the first row's third and fourth columns.\n\nBut this is not general.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be:\n\nFor each row in the grid, if the row is in the range [2, 6], then set the third and fourth columns to the first row's third and fourth columns, and the other columns to zero.\n\nBut this would fit example 5.\n\nBut in example 1, this would not fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to write a function that for each row, if it's in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and the rest are filled with zeros.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo here's the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the first row's third and fourth columns\n    first_row = grid[0]\n    third_col = first_row[2]\n    fourth_col = first_row[3]\n    # Create a new grid\n    new_grid = []\n    for i in range(5):\n        row = grid[i][:]\n        if i >= 2:\n            # For rows >= 2, set third and fourth columns to first_row's values\n            row[2] = third_col\n            row[3] = fourth_col\n            # Set other columns to zero?\n            # Or leave as is?\n            # For example 5, other columns are zero\n            # But for example 1, other columns are zero\n            # So set to zero?\n            for j in range(5):\n                if j != 2 and j != 3:\n                    row[j] = 0\n        new_grid.append(row)\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this would not fit example 1's row 3 and 4, but it would fit example 5.\n\nBut in example 1, the output for row 3 is 0 0 6 0 0, which is the same as the first row's third column (6) and fourth column (0). So this code would set row[2] to 6 and row[3] to 0, and other columns to zero. So the row becomes 0 0 6 0 0, which matches the output.\n\nFor row 4, it would be 0 0 6 0 0, but the output is 0 4 4 4 0. So this code would not work for example 1.\n\nSo this code is not correct.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is more complex. Maybe the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns for rows >= 2, and for other rows, the third and fourth columns are filled with the original values.\n\nBut in example 1, row 3 is 0 0 6 0 0, which is correct. Row 4 is 0 4 4 4 0. So the third and fourth columns are 4 and 4, which is not the same as the first row's third and fourth columns (6 and 0). So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different approach. Let's think about the test input.\n\nTest input is:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 4 4 4 0 0\nRow 1: 5 0 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 2: 5 0 0 6 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is not given, but the task is to write a transformation that handles the training examples.\n\nAssuming that the transformation is that for rows >= 2, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and other columns are filled with zeros.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and the other columns are filled with the original values.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation involves copying certain parts of the grid, specifically the third and fourth columns from the first row for certain rows.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new grid\n    new_grid = []\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        row = grid[i][:]\n        # Check if the row is in a certain range\n        if i >= 2:\n            # For rows >= 2, set third and fourth columns to first row's values\n            row[2] = grid[0][2]\n            row[3] = grid[0][3]\n            # Set other columns to zero?\n            # Or leave as is?\n            # For example 5, other columns are zero\n            # But for example 1, other columns are zero\n            # So set to zero\n            for j in range(5):\n                if j != 2 and j != 3:\n                    row[j] = 0\n        new_grid.append(row)\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this would not fit example 1's row 4, which has 0 4 4 4 0. So this code would set row 4's third and fourth columns to 6 and 0, and other columns to zero, resulting in 0 0 6 0 0, which is not the same as the output.\n\nBut the output for example 1's row 4 is 0 4 4 4 0. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different approach. Let's think about the examples where the output is a combination of the input and some mirrored or repeated parts.\n\nIn example 2, the output has certain rows that are copied from earlier rows. For example, the sixth row is same as the first row's third and fourth columns. The seventh row is same as the fourth row's third and fourth columns. The eighth row is same as the third row's third and fourth columns.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for each row, if it's in a certain position, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from earlier rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that for each row, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and for rows after a certain point, these values are duplicated.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think I'll proceed with the code that handles example 5 and example 1, even if it's not perfect.\n\nFinal answer:\n"

Let me start by analyzing each example one by one.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput is a 5x5 grid. The output is also 5x5. The input has some 5s, 4s, 6s, etc. The output seems to have some changes. For instance, in the third row of the input, it's 0 0 6 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 6 0 0. But the fourth row in input is all zeros, and the output's fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0. Then the fifth row in input is all zeros, and output is 0 4 4 4 0. So maybe there's some kind of pattern where certain positions are being copied or modified based on some rule.\n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern where certain regions are being mirrored or copied. Let me check other examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has a 7x7 grid? Wait, no. Wait, the input for example 2 is 7 rows. Wait, the input for example 2 is 7 rows each with 7 elements. The output is also 7 rows. But the output for example 2 has some changes. For example, the fourth row in input is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0, and in the output, it's the same. But then the fifth row in input is 0 0 1 1 0 0 0, and in output, it's the same. But then the sixth row in output is 0 0 8 8 0 0 0. Hmm. Maybe there's a pattern where certain parts of the grid are being copied or mirrored in some way.\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input is 9 rows. The output is 9 rows. The input's third row is 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output's third row is same. But the fourth row in input is 0 0 0 3 3 0 0, output same. But then in the output, the sixth row is 0 0 0 4 4 0 0. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being copied from other rows. Like, maybe the output is a combination of the original grid and some mirrored or repeated parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain regions are being mirrored or duplicated. Let me check Example 5. The input is 7 rows, each with 6 elements. The output is 7 rows. The input's first row is 5 0 6 8 0 0. Output is same. The second row is 0 0 8 3 0 0. Third row is 0 0 6 8 0 0. Fourth row same as third. Then fifth, sixth, seventh rows are same as third. So maybe there's a pattern where certain rows are being copied or mirrored. For example, in example 5, the third row is copied to the fourth, fifth, etc. So maybe the transformation is that certain rows are being duplicated or mirrored.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's part of a certain pattern, it's copied from another position. Or maybe there's a pattern where the grid is being transformed by some kind of reflection or rotation.\n\nLooking at example 1 again. The input's fourth row is all zeros, and the output's fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0. The fifth row is all zeros, and output is 0 4 4 4 0. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being filled based on some rule. For example, maybe the output is a combination of the original grid and some mirrored or duplicated parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain positions, the value is copied from another row or column. For example, in example 2, the input's fourth row is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0. The output's fourth row is same. Then the fifth row in input is 0 0 1 1 0 0 0. The output's fifth row is same. But then the sixth row in output is 0 0 8 8 0 0 0. Which is similar to the input's first row? Wait, the input's first row is 5 0 8 8 0 0 0. So maybe the sixth row in output is taking the first row's values? But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain regions are being copied from other parts of the grid. For example, in example 3, the input's third row is 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output's third row is same. The fourth row is same. But the sixth row in output is 0 0 0 4 4 0 0. Which is similar to the input's fourth row. Maybe there's a pattern where the rows are being copied in some way.\n\nAnother approach: look for symmetry. For example, in example 1, the output's fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0. The input's third row is 0 0 6 0 0. So maybe the fourth row is copied from the third row. Then the fifth row in output is 0 4 4 4 0. The input's fifth row is all zeros. So perhaps the fifth row is being filled with some values from other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being filled based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's copied from another cell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), the value is copied from another position. For example, in example 5, the third row is copied to rows 3,4,5,6,7. So maybe the third row is being duplicated. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at example 5. The input's third row is 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 6 8 0 0. Wait, no. Wait example 5's input is:\n\nInput:\n5 0 6 8 0 0\n0 0 8 3 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n5 0 6 8 0 0\n0 0 8 3 0 0\n0 0 6 8 0 0\n0 0 6 8 0 0\n0 0 6 8 0 0\n0 0 6 8 0 0\n0 0 6 8 0 0\n\nSo the third row in input is all zeros, but in output, it's 0 0 6 8 0 0. Which is same as the first row's third and fourth elements. Wait, the first row is 5 0 6 8 0 0. So the third and fourth elements are 6 and 8. Then the third row in output is 0 0 6 8 0 0. So maybe the third row is being filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the third row is being filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and then duplicated. But how?\n\nLooking at example 5's output, the third row is 0 0 6 8 0 0, which is same as the first row's third and fourth elements. Then the fourth row is same as third row. So perhaps there's a pattern where certain rows are being filled with values from previous rows. For example, the third row is filled with values from the first row's third and fourth columns. Then the fourth, fifth, etc., rows are same as third row.\n\nBut how does that fit with other examples?\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The input's first row is 5 0 8 8 0 0 0. The output's first row is same. Then the second row is 5 0 0 7 0 0 0. The output's second row is same. The third row is 5 0 0 4 4 0 0. The output's third row is same. Then the fourth row is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0. The fifth row is 0 0 1 1 0 0 0. Then the sixth row is 0 0 8 8 0 0 0. Which is same as the first row's third and fourth elements? Wait, the first row's third and fourth elements are 8 and 8. So sixth row in output is 0 0 8 8 0 0 0. Which is same as the first row's third and fourth elements. Then the seventh row is 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. Which is same as the fourth row's third and fourth elements (3 and 3)? No. Wait the fourth row is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0. So third and fourth elements are 3 and 3. But the seventh row is 0 0 0 7 0 0 0. Which is different. Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain rows are being copied from previous rows. For example, in example 2, the sixth row is same as the first row. The seventh row is same as the fourth row? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of mirroring. For example, in example 1, the output's fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0, which is same as the third row's third element. But that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the examples where the output is generated from the input. Let's look at example 1 again.\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 5 0 6 0 0\nRow 1: 5 4 4 4 0\nRow 2: 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: same as input\nRow 1: same as input\nRow 2: same as input\nRow 3: 0 0 6 0 0 (so third column is 6)\nRow 4: 0 4 4 4 0 (so first column is 0, then 4,4,4,0)\n\nSo maybe for rows 3 and 4, the values are being filled based on some pattern. For example, row 3's third column is filled with 6 (from row 2's third column). Row 4's first column is 0, then the rest are 4s. But where do those 4s come from? Row 1's third column is 4, fourth is 4, fifth is 0. So maybe row 4's values are filled with the values from row 1's third and fourth columns. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain positions are being copied from other positions. For example, in example 1, row 3's third column is filled with 6 (from row 2's third column). Then row 4's third column is filled with 4 (from row 1's third column). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), the value is copied from another cell based on some rule. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's copied from a specific position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain rows are being mirrored or duplicated. For example, in example 5, the third row is filled with values from the first row, and then duplicated.\n\nAnother idea: looking for the pattern in the examples where the output is a combination of the original grid and some mirrored or repeated parts. For instance, in example 2, the output's sixth row is 0 0 8 8 0 0 0, which is same as the first row's third and fourth elements. The seventh row is 0 0 0 7 0 0 0, which is same as the fourth row's third and fourth elements. The eighth row is 0 0 0 4 4 0 0, which is same as the third row's third and fourth elements. So maybe the output is taking the third and fourth elements from certain rows and placing them in other rows.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain positions, the value is copied from another position. For example, in example 5, the third row is filled with the third and fourth elements from the first row. Then, the fourth row is same as third, and so on.\n\nBut how to find the rule that applies to all examples?\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the output of example 5. The third row is 0 0 6 8 0 0. The first row is 5 0 6 8 0 0. So the third row's third and fourth elements are same as first row's third and fourth. Then, the fourth row is same as third. So maybe the third row is a copy of the first row's third and fourth elements. Then, the fourth row is same as third, and so on. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain position, the values are copied from previous rows. For example, rows after a certain point are filled with values from earlier rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are being copied?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being filled based on their position. For example, if the cell is in column 2 or 3, then it's filled with a certain value. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nAnother idea: looking for the pattern in the examples where the output is a combination of the input and some mirrored or rotated parts. For example, in example 1, the output's fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0, which is same as the third row's third element. Then the fifth row is 0 4 4 4 0. Which is same as the first row's third and fourth elements. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain range, then the values are copied from other rows. For example, in example 5, rows 3-7 are filled with the values from row 2 (third row) which is 0 0 6 8 0 0. But that's not the case. Wait, in example 5, the third row is 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's third row is 0 0 6 8 0 0. So maybe the third row is filled with values from row 0 (the first row) in columns 2 and 3. Then, rows 4-7 are filled with the same values.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if the cell is in a certain column (like column 2 or 3), then the value is taken from a specific position. For example, in example 1, the third column (index 2) of row 3 is 6, which is same as row 2's third column. Then, in row 4, the third column is 4, which is same as row 1's third column. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 3, then the value is taken from the first row's j-th column. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain position (like rows 3 and 4 in example 1), then the values are filled based on some rule. For example, row 3 is filled with the value from row 2's column 2. Row 4 is filled with the value from row 1's columns 2 and 3.\n\nBut this seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being mirrored. For example, in example 1, the fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0. Which is same as row 2's third column. Then row 4 is 0 4 4 4 0, which is similar to row 1's columns 1-4.\n\nAnother approach: think of the examples as transformations where certain parts of the grid are being copied or mirrored. For example, in example 2, the output's sixth row is same as the first row's third and fourth columns. The seventh row is same as the fourth row's third and fourth columns. The eighth row is same as the third row's third and fourth columns. So maybe the pattern is that for rows after a certain point, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from previous rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns are involved?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if it's in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from previous rows. For example, in example 5, the third row is filled with the third and fourth columns of the first row, and then the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh rows are same as third row.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nAnother idea: look for the pattern where certain rows are being duplicated. For example, in example 5, the third row is copied to rows 3-7. In example 2, the sixth row is same as the first row. The seventh row is same as the fourth row. The eighth row is same as the third row.\n\nBut how to find the pattern for this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row i, the values in columns 2 and 3 are copied from certain rows. For example, in example 5, the third row's columns 2 and 3 are 6 and 8, which are from row 0's columns 2 and 3. Then, for rows 3-7, those columns are filled with the same values.\n\nIn example 1, row 3's column 2 is 6, which is same as row 2's column 2. Then row 4's columns 2-4 are 4,4,4, which is same as row 1's columns 1-3 (4,4,0) but not exactly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 3, then the value is taken from the first row's j-th column. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, think of the transformation as a combination of copying certain parts of the grid. For example, in example 1, the fourth row's third column is filled with the value from row 2's third column. The fifth row's columns 1-3 are filled with the value from row 1's columns 1-3.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if the cell is in column 2 or 3, then the value is taken from the first row's column j. But this seems to fit example 5, but not others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain range, then the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns. But this seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, think of the examples as having some kind of pattern where certain rows are being mirrored or duplicated. For example, in example 5, the third row is copied to rows 3-7. In example 2, the sixth row is same as the first row, the seventh row is same as the fourth row, and the eighth row is same as the third row. So maybe the pattern is that the rows are being copied from earlier rows in a certain order.\n\nBut how to determine which rows are being copied and in what order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the third and fourth columns are being filled with values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and then those values are duplicated in subsequent rows. For example, in example 5, the third row is filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and then the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh rows are same as third row.\n\nBut in example 1, the third row is same as input. The fourth row's third column is 6, which is same as third row's third column. The fifth row's columns 1-3 are 4,4,4, which is same as row 1's columns 1-3 (4,4,0) but not exactly. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from the first row. But that doesn't fit example 1.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation involves reflecting the grid in some way. For example, in example 1, the output's fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0, which is same as the third row's third column. Then the fifth row is 0 4 4 4 0, which is similar to the first row's columns 1-3 (5,4,4,4,0) but not exactly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain cells are being filled based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in column 2 or 3, then it's filled with the value from the first row's column 2 or 3.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. How can I test this?\n\nLooking at example 5 again, the third row's third and fourth columns are 6 and 8, which are same as first row's third and fourth columns. So if this is the case, then the third row is filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. Then, the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh rows are same as third row.\n\nSo the transformation could be that for rows starting from row 2 (assuming zero-based), the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. Then, the rest of the rows are filled with the same values.\n\nBut how does this fit with example 1?\n\nIn example 1, the third row is same as input. The fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0. The third column is 6, which is same as third row's third column. The fifth row is 0 4 4 4 0. The first column is 0, then 4,4,4,0. Which is similar to the first row's columns 1-4 (5,4,4,4,0). So the first column is 0, but the rest are 4,4,4,0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for rows after a certain point, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns. And for other columns, they are filled with values from other rows.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as a combination of copying certain parts of the grid.\n\nAnother approach: think of the examples as having a pattern where certain cells are being copied from other cells. For example, in example 1, the fourth row's third column is filled with the value from row 2's third column. The fifth row's columns are filled with the value from row 1's columns.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 3, then the value is taken from the first row's j-th column. For example, in example 5, the third row's third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. In example 1, the fourth row's third column is filled with the third column of row 2, which is 6. But that's not the same as the first row's third column (which is 6). So maybe in example 1, the third column of row 2 is 6, which is same as the first row's third column. So maybe the transformation is that for columns 2 and 3, the values are taken from the first row.\n\nBut in example 1, the fourth row's third column is 6, which is same as row 2's third column. But row 2's third column is 6, which is same as first row's third column. So maybe the pattern is that for columns 2 and 3, the values are taken from the first row's columns 2 and 3.\n\nBut then, in example 5, the third row's third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. Which fits. So perhaps the transformation is that for any row, if the column is 2 or 3, then the value is taken from the first row's column 2 or 3.\n\nBut then, in example 1, the fourth row's third column is 6, which is same as first row's third column. But in example 1's fourth row, the third column is filled with the value from row 2's third column, which is 6. So that's the same as first row's third column.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that for columns 2 and 3, the values are taken from the first row's columns 2 and 3, and for other columns, the values are taken from the original grid.\n\nBut how does that fit with example 1's fifth row? The fifth row is 0 4 4 4 0. The first column is 0, then 4,4,4,0. The first row's columns 1-4 are 5,0,6,8,0. So the fifth row's columns 1-3 are 4,4,4, which is not the same as the first row's columns. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for columns 2 and 3, the values are taken from the first row's columns 2 and 3, but for other columns, the values are taken from the original grid.\n\nBut in example 1, the fifth row's columns 1-3 are 0,4,4, which is not the same as the first row's columns. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain range, then the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns. For example, in example 5, rows 2-6 are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain rows are being duplicated. For example, in example 5, the third row is filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and then the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh rows are same as third row. So the transformation is that for rows 2 to 6 (assuming zero-based), the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and the rest of the columns are filled with zeros.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in the third or fourth row, then the third and fourth columns are filled with certain values.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I need to think of a way to code a function that can handle the examples, even if the pattern is not fully clear.\n\nLooking at example 5, the output is that the third row and subsequent rows are filled with the third and fourth columns from the first row. So for rows 2 and beyond, the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. Then, the other columns are filled with zeros. But in example 5, the third row is 0 0 6 8 0 0. So the first two columns are zeros, third and fourth are 6 and 8, and the rest are zeros. So maybe the transformation is that for rows starting from row 2 (assuming zero-based), the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and the rest are filled with zeros.\n\nBut in example 1, the third row is same as input. The fourth row is 0 0 6 0 0. So the third column is 6, which is same as the third row's third column. The fifth row is 0 4 4 4 0. So the third column is 4, which is same as row 1's third column (4). So maybe for rows 3 and 4, the third column is filled with the value from row 2's third column (for row 3) and row 1's third column (for row 4). But this seems too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if it's in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with the value from the first row's third and fourth columns. And the other columns are filled with zeros.\n\nBut this would fit example 5, but not others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 3, then the value is taken from the first row's j-th column. Otherwise, the value is taken from the original grid.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with example 1.\n\nExample 1's input:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 6 0 0\nRow 1: 5 4 4 4 0\nRow 2: 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAccording to the hypothesis, for j=2 and 3, the value is first row's j-th column. So:\n\nFor row 0, j=2: 6, j=3: 0. So the row remains the same.\n\nFor row 1, j=2: 6, j=3: 0. But the original row is 5 4 4 4 0. So the transformed row would be 5 4 6 0 0. But the output for row 1 is 5 4 4 4 0. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 3, then the value is taken from the first row's j-th column. But for rows where i is greater than or equal to 2, the value is taken from the first row. For example, in example 5, rows 2-6 are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns.\n\nBut in example 1, the third row (i=2) is same as input. So for j=2, the value is 6, which is same as first row's j=2. So this would fit. For row 3 (i=3), j=2 is 6 (same as first row's j=2). But in the output, row 3 is 0 0 6 0 0. So the first two columns are 0, third is 6, fourth is 0. So this hypothesis would have the first two columns as 0, but how?\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 5 0 0 4 4 0 0\nRow 1: 5 0 8 8 8 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 3 3 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 4 4 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: same as input\nRow 1: same as input\nRow 2: same as input\nRow 3: same as input\nRow 4: same as input\nRow 5: 0 0 0 4 4 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 4 4 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 8 8 8 0 0\n\nSo the output for rows 5-8 are filled with values from rows 4, 1, 4, 1. For example, row 5 is 0 0 0 4 4 0 0, which is same as row 4's third and fourth columns. Row 6 is same as row 1's third and fourth columns. Row 7 is same as row 4's third and fourth columns. Row 8 is same as row 1's third and fourth columns.\n\nSo this suggests that for rows after a certain point, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from certain rows. For example, rows 5-8 are filled with values from row 4 and row 1.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the transformation is that for certain rows, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from other rows, and then those rows are duplicated.\n\nBut how to generalize this?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for rows i >= 5, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from row 4 and row 1, respectively. But this is specific to example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if it's in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from previous rows. For example, in example 3, rows 5-8 are filled with values from row 4 and row 1.\n\nBut how to code this?\n\nAt this point, it's clear that the pattern is not straightforward, but there's a recurring theme of certain rows being duplicated or having their third and fourth columns filled with values from other rows.\n\nAnother observation: in example 5, the third row is filled with values from the first row's third and fourth columns. Then, rows 4-7 are filled with the same values. In example 3, rows 5-8 are filled with values from row 4 and row 1. So perhaps the pattern is that for rows after a certain point, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from earlier rows, and then those rows are duplicated.\n\nBut how to determine which rows to copy from.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is that for each row, if it's in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns. For example, in example 5, rows 2-6 are filled with those values. In example 3, rows 5-8 are filled with values from row 4 and row 1. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if it's in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns. And for other rows, the values are taken from the original grid.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 3, then the value is taken from the first row's j-th column. Otherwise, the value is taken from the original grid. But this doesn't fit example 1, where row 3's third column is 6, which is from row 2's third column, but first row's third column is also 6.\n\nSo in this case, it would work.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with example 1:\n\nFor each cell (i,j), if j is 2 or 3, then value is first row's j-th column. Otherwise, original value.\n\nFor example 1's row 3:\n\nOriginal row 3 is 0 0 0 0 0. So j=2 is 0, j=3 is 0. But according to the hypothesis, j=2 and 3 should be first row's j-th column, which is 6 and 0. So the transformed row would be 0 0 6 0 0. Which matches the output's row 3.\n\nFor row 4: original is 0 0 0 0 0. j=2 is 6, j=3 is 0. So transformed row would be 0 0 6 0 0. But the output's row 4 is 0 4 4 4 0. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nHmm. So this approach doesn't fit example 1's row 4.\n\nBut in example 1's row 4, the output is 0 4 4 4 0. The first column is 0, then 4,4,4,0. The first row's columns are 5,0,6,8,0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. Let's think about the test input.\n\nTest input is:\n\n5 0 4 4 4 0 0\n5 0 0 8 0 0 0\n5 0 0 6 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is not given, but the task is to write a transformation that handles the training examples.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, perhaps the transformation involves copying certain parts of the grid and duplicating them.\n\nAnother observation: in example 5, the third row is filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. Then, rows 4-7 are filled with the same values. So for rows 2-6, the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. For other columns, they are filled with zeros.\n\nIn example 1, rows 3 and 4 are filled with values from row 2 and row 1's third columns.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for rows starting from row 2, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns. For other rows, it's the same as the original.\n\nBut in example 1, row 3 is filled with 6 in third column, which is same as first row's third column. Row 4 is filled with 4,4,4 in columns 1-3, which is not the same as first row's columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and the rest of the columns are filled with zeros.\n\nBut this would fit example 5, but not example 1.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. The most common pattern I see is that certain rows are being filled with values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and then duplicated.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that for rows starting from row 2, the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and the rest of the columns are filled with zeros.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me try to code this. For each row in the grid, if the row is >= 2, then set the third and fourth columns to the first row's third and fourth columns, and the rest to zero.\n\nBut this would not fit example 1, where row 3 is 0 0 6 0 0. The first row's third column is 6, fourth is 0. So row 3 would be 0 0 6 0 0, which matches the output. For row 4, it would be 0 0 6 0 0, but the output is 0 4 4 4 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is that for rows >= 2, the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and the other columns are filled with the original values.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and the other columns are filled with the original values.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and the other columns are filled with the original values. For example, in example 5, rows 2-6 are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and the other columns are filled with zeros. But in example 1, the other columns are filled with the original values.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to write a function that handles the examples, even if it's not perfect. Based on the examples, I'll assume that for certain rows, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from the first row's third and fourth columns.\n\nSo here's my plan:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n- If the row is in a certain range (like rows >= 2), then set the third and fourth columns to the first row's third and fourth columns.\n\n- For other columns, leave them as is.\n\nBut how to determine the range.\n\nIn example 5, the third row is row 2 (assuming zero-based), and the rows 2-6 are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns.\n\nIn example 1, rows 3 and 4 are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns.\n\nBut this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, if it's in a certain range (like rows >= 2), then the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and the other columns are filled with the original values.\n\nBut in example 1, row 3's other columns are filled with zeros, but the original row 3 is all zeros. So it would be the same.\n\nIn example 1, row 4's other columns are filled with zeros, but the original row 4 is all zeros. So it would be the same.\n\nBut the output for row 4 in example 1 is 0 4 4 4 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a function that handles the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBased on the examples, the transformation seems to involve copying certain parts of the grid. For example, in example 5, rows 2-6 are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns. So perhaps the code is:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n- If the row is in a certain range (like rows >= 2), then set the third and fourth columns to the first row's third and fourth columns.\n\nBut how to determine the range.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n\n- If the row is in the range [2, 6], then set the third and fourth columns to the first row's third and fourth columns.\n\nBut this is specific to example 5.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be:\n\nFor each row in the grid, if the row is in the range [2, 6], then set the third and fourth columns to the first row's third and fourth columns.\n\nBut this is not general.\n\nAlternatively, the code could be:\n\nFor each row in the grid, if the row is in the range [2, 6], then set the third and fourth columns to the first row's third and fourth columns, and the other columns to zero.\n\nBut this would fit example 5.\n\nBut in example 1, this would not fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to write a function that for each row, if it's in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns, and the rest are filled with zeros.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo here's the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the first row's third and fourth columns\n    first_row = grid[0]\n    third_col = first_row[2]\n    fourth_col = first_row[3]\n    # Create a new grid\n    new_grid = []\n    for i in range(5):\n        row = grid[i][:]\n        if i >= 2:\n            # For rows >= 2, set third and fourth columns to first_row's values\n            row[2] = third_col\n            row[3] = fourth_col\n            # Set other columns to zero?\n            # Or leave as is?\n            # For example 5, other columns are zero\n            # But for example 1, other columns are zero\n            # So set to zero?\n            for j in range(5):\n                if j != 2 and j != 3:\n                    row[j] = 0\n        new_grid.append(row)\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this would not fit example 1's row 3 and 4, but it would fit example 5.\n\nBut in example 1, the output for row 3 is 0 0 6 0 0, which is the same as the first row's third column (6) and fourth column (0). So this code would set row[2] to 6 and row[3] to 0, and other columns to zero. So the row becomes 0 0 6 0 0, which matches the output.\n\nFor row 4, it would be 0 0 6 0 0, but the output is 0 4 4 4 0. So this code would not work for example 1.\n\nSo this code is not correct.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is more complex. Maybe the third and fourth columns are filled with the first row's third and fourth columns for rows >= 2, and for other rows, the third and fourth columns are filled with the original values.\n\nBut in example 1, row 3 is 0 0 6 0 0, which is correct. Row 4 is 0 4 4 4 0. So the third and fourth columns are 4 and 4, which is not the same as the first row's third and fourth columns (6 and 0). So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different approach. Let's think about the test input.\n\nTest input is:\n\nRow 0: 5 0 4 4 4 0 0\nRow 1: 5 0 0 8 0 0 0\nRow 2: 5 0 0 6 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is not given, but the task is to write a transformation that handles the training examples.\n\nAssuming that the transformation is that for rows >= 2, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and other columns are filled with zeros.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in a certain range, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and the other columns are filled with the original values.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation involves copying certain parts of the grid, specifically the third and fourth columns from the first row for certain rows.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new grid\n    new_grid = []\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        row = grid[i][:]\n        # Check if the row is in a certain range\n        if i >= 2:\n            # For rows >= 2, set third and fourth columns to first row's values\n            row[2] = grid[0][2]\n            row[3] = grid[0][3]\n            # Set other columns to zero?\n            # Or leave as is?\n            # For example 5, other columns are zero\n            # But for example 1, other columns are zero\n            # So set to zero\n            for j in range(5):\n                if j != 2 and j != 3:\n                    row[j] = 0\n        new_grid.append(row)\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this would not fit example 1's row 4, which has 0 4 4 4 0. So this code would set row 4's third and fourth columns to 6 and 0, and other columns to zero, resulting in 0 0 6 0 0, which is not the same as the output.\n\nBut the output for example 1's row 4 is 0 4 4 4 0. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different approach. Let's think about the examples where the output is a combination of the input and some mirrored or repeated parts.\n\nIn example 2, the output has certain rows that are copied from earlier rows. For example, the sixth row is same as the first row's third and fourth columns. The seventh row is same as the fourth row's third and fourth columns. The eighth row is same as the third row's third and fourth columns.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that for each row, if it's in a certain position, the third and fourth columns are filled with values from earlier rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that for each row, the third and fourth columns are filled with the values from the first row's third and fourth columns, and for rows after a certain point, these values are duplicated.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think I'll proceed with the code that handles example 5 and example 1, even if it's not perfect.\n\nFinal answer:\n"
