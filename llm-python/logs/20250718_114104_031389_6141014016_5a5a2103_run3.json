The output grid seems to have a \"spread\" pattern where certain values are repeated in a way that creates a wave-like pattern.\n2. Values like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 seem to be spread out in a pattern that creates horizontal and vertical lines.\n3. The value 0 seems to be used as a \"background\" or \"spacer\" value.\n4. There's a pattern where certain values are repeated in a way that creates a wave-like pattern across the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads certain values in a wave-like pattern across the grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 14x14 output grid initialized with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(14)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(14):\n        for col in range(14):\n            # If the input cell is not 0, spread it in a wave-like pattern\n            if grid[row][col] != 0:\n                # Spread the value in a wave-like pattern\n                for i in range(14):\n                    for j in range(14):\n                        # Calculate the position based on the wave pattern\n                        if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[row][col]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid seems to have a \"spread\" pattern where certain values are repeated in a way that creates a wave-like pattern.\n2. Values like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 seem to be spread out in a pattern that creates horizontal and vertical lines.\n3. The value 0 seems to be used as a \"background\" or \"spacer\" value.\n4. There's a pattern where certain values are repeated in a way that creates a wave-like pattern across the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads certain values in a wave-like pattern across the grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 14x14 output grid initialized with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(14)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(14):\n        for col in range(14):\n            # If the input cell is not 0, spread it in a wave-like pattern\n            if grid[row][col] != 0:\n                # Spread the value in a wave-like pattern\n                for i in range(14):\n                    for j in range(14):\n                        # Calculate the position based on the wave pattern\n                        if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[row][col]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
