          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let's take a look at the first example.\n\nExample 1:\nInput is a 5x5 grid, and the output is a 5x4 grid. Wait, the problem says that the output must always be 5x4. So each input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, and the output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements. So the transformation reduces the number of columns from 5 to 4. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 0: 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0 \u2192 Wait, that's 9 elements. Wait, the input is 5x4? Wait no, the problem says the input is a grid, but the examples show input as 5 rows, each with 9 elements. Wait, maybe the input is 5x9? But the output is 5x4. Wait, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements? Wait, the first example's input shows 9 numbers per row. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, the problem says that the input is a 5x4 grid? No, the problem says that the test input is a 5x5 grid? Wait, the problem says that the test input is given as 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Wait, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, but the output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements. But looking at the first example's input:\n\nLooking at the first example's input:\n\nInput:\n8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0 \u2192 that's 9 elements. Wait, that's 5 rows, each with 9 elements? But that would make the input a 5x9 grid. But the output is 5x4. So maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Wait, maybe the input is 5x5, and the output is 5x4. But the first example's input shows 9 elements. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the way I'm reading the examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is a grid. For example 1, the input is given as 5 rows, each with 9 elements. But the output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements. So the input is 5x9, and the output is 5x4. But that seems odd. However, looking at the problem statement again: the test input is shown as 5 rows, each with 5 elements. So maybe the input is 5x5, and the output is 5x4. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nWait, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Let me check the first example again. The first input line is 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0. That's 9 numbers. So that can't be. So perhaps the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, but the examples are written with some formatting issues. Wait, perhaps the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, but the example is written with some extra numbers. Maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 9 elements, and the output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is 5x5, and the output is 5x4. Let me check the first example's input again. For example, the first input line is 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0. That's 9 numbers. So that's not 5 elements. So perhaps the input is 5 rows, each with 9 elements. But then the output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements. How does that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, but the example is written with some formatting errors. For example, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, but the example is written with some numbers split. For example, the first input line is 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0. Maybe that's a typo and should be 8 8 0 0 4, then 0 5 5 0? But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is 5x9, and the output is 5x4. But how to process that. For example, in the first example, the input is 5 rows, each with 9 elements. The output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements. So the transformation reduces the number of columns from 9 to 4. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's output:\n\nOutput is:\n\n2 0 2 0\n\n2 2 2 0\n\n0 0 2 0\n\n2 0 2 2\n\n2 0 0 0\n\nSo each row is 4 elements. So for each input row (which is 9 elements), we need to generate 4 elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Wait, but the first example's input is written as 9 elements. That's confusing. Maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. But the example shows 9 elements. So maybe the input is 5x5, but the example is written with some formatting error. Alternatively, perhaps the input is 5x9 and the output is 5x4. But how to find the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is 5x5, but the example is written with some extra numbers. For example, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, but the example is written with some numbers split. For example, the first input line is 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0. Maybe that's a typo and should be 8 8 0 0 4, then 0 5 5 0. But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the input is 5x5, but the example is written with 9 numbers per row. That's not possible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. But since the user provided the examples, I need to work with them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, and the output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements. But the example shows 9 elements. So perhaps the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, and the output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements. But then the example's input would be 5x5. But the first example's input is written as 9 elements. So perhaps the input is 5x5, and the example is written with some formatting error. For example, maybe the first input line is 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0, but that's 9 elements. Maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the input is 5 rows, each with 9 elements, and the output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements.\n\nBut how can I find the pattern? Let's look at the first example's input and output.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0 \u2192 9 elements.\n\nOutput row 0: 2 0 2 0 \u2192 4 elements.\n\nSo perhaps for each input row, we take some positions and generate the output row.\n\nLooking at the first input row: 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0. The output is 2 0 2 0. Let's see if there's a pattern here. Maybe the output is derived from certain positions in the input row.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of the first example. The output is 5 rows of 4 elements each. The input is 5 rows of 9 elements each.\n\nSo for each input row, we need to generate a 4-element output row. How?\n\nLooking at the first input row:\n\nOriginal: [8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 5, 0]\n\nOutput: [2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is derived from certain positions. For example, maybe the first element is 2, then 0, then 2, then 0. Let's see if there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of certain values. For example, the first output element is 2, which might be derived from the first occurrence of 8 in the input row. Or maybe it's based on some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output, maybe the output is derived from the positions of the 4s in the input. For example, in the first input row, the 4 is at position 4 (0-based index 4). Then, maybe the output is based on that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first and third elements of the input row. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by some kind of transformation based on the input's values. For example, in the first example's input row, the first output element is 2. Maybe that's derived from the first two 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions and applying a function. For example, in the first input row, the output is 2, 0, 2, 0. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row: positions 0-8.\n\nLooking at the output, perhaps the first element is 2, which is derived from the first two 8s. Then 0 is from some other position. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of 0s and 4s. For example, in the first input row, there's a 4 at position 4. Then, maybe the output is based on that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of the first example, maybe each output element is determined by some rule based on the input row. For example, the first output element is 2, which could be the count of certain numbers. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of the first example's first row, the output is [2, 0, 2, 0]. Let's see if that's related to the positions of 4s. In the first input row, the 4 is at position 4. Then, maybe the output is generated by some pattern around that position.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of the first example's first row: 2 0 2 0. Maybe this is the result of taking the first and third elements of the input row, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by looking at the positions where the input has certain values. For example, in the first example's input row, the 4 is at position 4. Then, maybe the output is based on the values around that 4. For example, the 4 is at position 4, and the output is based on the positions before and after.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's look at other examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2 input:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0 0 4 5 0 5 0 \u2192 9 elements.\n\nOutput row 0: 2 2 2 0.\n\nHmm. So the output is 2, 2, 2, 0. How does that relate to the input?\n\nAnother example: example 3's input:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0 \u2192 output row 0 is 0 0 2 0.\n\nSo perhaps the output is generated based on the positions of 4s. Let's see.\n\nIn the first example's input row, there's a 4 at position 4. The output row is 2, 0, 2, 0. Maybe the output is based on the positions of 4s. For example, in the first row, the 4 is at position 4. Then, the output is 2, 0, 2, 0. Maybe the first two elements are derived from the positions before and after the 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions in the input row. For example, in the first example's first row, the output is 2, 0, 2, 0. Let's see:\n\nThe input row is [8,8,0,0,4,0,5,5,0]. The output is [2,0,2,0].\n\nLooking at the positions of 0s and 4s. The 4 is at position 4. The 0s are at positions 2,3,5,8. Maybe the output is based on the count of certain elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the values in the input row and applying some transformation. For example, if a cell has a value of 4, then the output is 2. But that's not the case here. In the first example's first row, the 4 is present, and the output has 2 in the third position. But there are other 4s in other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some pattern based on the positions of 4s. For example, in the first example, the first row has a 4 at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the output is based on the positions of 4s and the surrounding cells. For example, the first output element is 2, which could be the count of 8s in the first two positions. The first two elements are 8 and 8. So count is 2. Then the next element is 0. Then 2 again, and 0.\n\nBut how does that fit with other examples?\n\nLooking at example 2's first input row: [0,8,0,0,4,5,0,5,0]. The output is [2,2,2,0]. So the first three elements are 2. Maybe that's because there are three 8s in the input row? Wait, the first input row is 0,8,0,0,4,5,0,5,0. There's only one 8. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the count of 4s. There's one 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of 4s. For example, the first example's first row has a 4 at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. So maybe the first element is 2, which could be the count of 8s before the 4. The 8s are at positions 0 and 1. So two 8s. Then the next element is 0. Then the third element is 2 again, which could be the count of 8s after the 4? But after the 4, there are 0,5,5,0. No 8s. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the positions of 4s and their neighbors. For example, in the first row, the 4 is at position 4. Then, the output elements are based on the values around that position. For example, the first output element is 2, which could be the sum of the values around the 4. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern based on the presence of 4s and 0s. For example, in the first example's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first two elements are derived from the left side of the 4, and the next two from the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of the first example's first row, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row, then the next two elements, and then applying some function. For example, the first two elements are 8 and 8, which sum to 16. But the output is 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first and third elements of the input row. For example, in the first row, the first element is 8, third is 0. But the output is 2 and 0. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too frustrating. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at the output of example 1's first row: [2, 0, 2, 0]. Maybe each element is derived from the input row's elements in a certain way. For example, the first element is 2, which could be the count of 8s in the first two positions. The first two elements are 8 and 8, so count is 2. The second element is 0, maybe the count of 0s in the first two positions. But there are two 0s? No, the first two elements are 8 and 8. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the second element is derived from the third position. The third element is 0, so maybe 0. Then the third output element is 2, which could be the count of 8s in the next two positions. The fourth and fifth elements are 0 and 4. So no 8s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of the 4 in the input row. For example, the first row's 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first two output elements are based on the positions before the 4, and the next two after. For example, the first two output elements are derived from the first four positions (positions 0-3), and the next two from positions 5-8. But how?\n\nIn the first row, the first four positions are 8,8,0,0. The next four positions are 0,5,5,0. Maybe the output is derived by taking the count of 8s in the first four positions (which is 2), then the count of 0s in the next four (which is 3?), but that doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions. For example, the first output element is 2, which could be the value of the first element. But in the first example's first row, the first element is 8, not 2. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values of certain positions in the input and applying a function. For example, in the first example's first row, the output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first output element is derived from the first two elements (8 and 8) as 8-6=2. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the positions of the 4s in the input row. For example, the first row has a 4 at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first two elements are 2, which is the count of 8s before the 4. The next two are 2 and 0, which could be something else.\n\nBut how to generalize this for other examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's first row input: [0,8,0,0,4,5,0,5,0]. The output is [2,2,2,0]. So maybe the first three elements are 2, which could be the count of 8s in the first three positions. The first three elements are 0,8,0. So count is 1, but the output is 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value of certain positions. For example, in the first example's first row, the output is [2,0,2,0]. The positions of the 4 are at 4. So maybe the output is based on the positions of the 4 and their neighbors. For example, the first output element is 2, which is the value of the 4 minus 2. 4-2=2. The second element is 0. The third element is 2, which is 4-2 again. The fourth is 0. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first and third elements of the input row. For example, the first element is 8, third is 0. But the output is 2 and 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern based on the positions of 0s and 4s. For example, in the first example's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the output is based on the positions of the 4 and the surrounding cells. For example, the first output element is 2, which could be the count of 8s in the first two positions (which is 2). The second output element is 0, which could be the count of 0s in the third position (which is 0). The third output element is 2, which could be the count of 8s in the next two positions (which are 0 and 4, so 0). That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value of the 4 and applying some transformation. For example, 4 \u2192 2. But then why is the output [2,0,2,0]?\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for other patterns in the examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's first input row: [0,8,0,0,4,0,5,5,0]. Output row is [0,0,2,0]. So the first two elements are 0, then 2, then 0.\n\nIn this case, the 4 is at position 4. The output is 0, 0, 2, 0. Maybe the first two elements are derived from the positions before the 4, and the next two after.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of the 4 and the 0s. For example, in the first example's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first two elements are derived from the positions before the 4, and the next two from after. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions. For example, in the first example's first row, the output is 2,0,2,0. Maybe the first element is 2, which is the value of the 4 minus 2. The next element is 0, which is the value of the 4 minus 4. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first and third elements of the input row. For example, in the first example's first row, the first element is 8, third is 0. But the output is 2 and 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern based on the positions of 4s and the number of 8s around them. For example, in the first example's first row, there are two 8s before the 4. So the output is 2, then maybe 0, then 2 again, and 0. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying a function. For example, the first two elements are 8 and 8. The output is 2 and 0. Maybe 8-6=2, and 8-8=0. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row, and then the next two elements, and then applying some transformation. For example, in the first example's first row, the first two elements are 8 and 8, which sum to 16. The next two elements are 0 and 4, which sum to 4. But the output is 2, 0, 2, 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of the 4 and applying some pattern. For example, in the first example's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2, 0, 2, 0]. Maybe the first two elements are based on the positions before the 4, and the next two after. For example, the first two elements are 2 and 0, which could be the count of 8s before the 4 (2) and the count of 0s before the 4 (2). But the output is 2 and 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying some transformation, then the next two. For example, in the first example's first row, the first two elements are 8 and 8. The output is 2 and 0. Maybe 8 divided by 4 is 2, and 8 divided by 8 is 1, but the output is 0. Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the output is generated by looking at the positions of the 4s in the input and applying some rule. For example, in the first example's first row, there's one 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the output is based on the positions of the 4 and the surrounding cells. For example, the first element is 2, which is the count of 8s in the first two positions. The second element is 0, which is the count of 0s in the third position. The third element is 2, which is the count of 8s in the next two positions. The fourth element is 0, which is the count of 0s in the next position. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of the 4 and applying a transformation. For example, in the first example's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first two elements are derived from the positions before the 4, and the next two from after. For example, the first two elements are 2 and 0, which could be the count of 8s before the 4 (2) and the count of 0s before the 4 (2). But the output is 2 and 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value of the 4 and applying some function. For example, 4 becomes 2, and then some other values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value of the 4 and applying some pattern. For example, in the first example's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the output is based on the positions of the 4 and the surrounding cells. For example, the first output element is 2, which is the value of the 4 minus 2. The second is 0, which is the value of the 4 minus 4. The third is 2 again, and the fourth is 0. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the outputs of all examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 2 0\n\nRow 1: 2 2 2 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 2 0\n\nRow 3: 2 0 2 2\n\nRow 4: 2 0 0 0\n\nLooking at example 2's output:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 0\n\nRow 1: 2 2 2 0\n\nRow 2: 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 2 2\n\nExample 3's output:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 0\n\nRow 1: 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 2: 0 2 0 2\n\nRow 3: 0 2 2 2\n\nRow 4: 0 2 2 2\n\nExample 4's output:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 2 0\n\nRow 1: 0 0 2 2\n\nRow 2: 2 2 0 2\n\nRow 3: 0 2 0 2\n\nRow 4: 2 2 2 2\n\nNow, looking at the outputs, perhaps there's a pattern based on the positions of 4s in the input. For example, in example 1, the first input row has a 4 at position 4. The output row is [2, 0, 2, 0]. Maybe this is based on the positions of the 4. For example, the output is generated by taking certain positions around the 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of 4s and applying some rule. For example, if there's a 4 in the input, the output has a 2 in certain positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has 2s and 0s. So maybe the transformation is based on whether a cell in the input has a 4 or not. For example, if a cell has a 4, then the output is 2, otherwise 0. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nIn example 1's first row, there is a 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. So maybe the output is 2 in certain positions, and 0 in others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of the 4 and applying some pattern. For example, in the first example's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first two output elements are 2 and 0, which could be based on the positions before the 4, and the next two are 2 and 0 based on the positions after.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first and third elements of the input row. For example, the first example's first row has 8 and 0, but the output is 2 and 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values of the input row at certain positions. For example, in the first example's first row, the output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first element is derived from the first two positions (8 and 8), which sum to 16, and then divided by 8 to get 2. The second element is 0, which is derived from the third position (0). The third element is 2, derived from the fourth and fifth positions (0 and 4), which sum to 4, divided by 2. The fourth element is 0, derived from the sixth position (0). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values of the input row at positions that are even or odd, or some other pattern.\n\nBut this is not leading me anywhere. Perhaps I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a 5x4 grid. The input is 5x9. So for each input row, we need to generate 4 elements. Maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input row. For example, for each input row, the output is derived from the first, third, fifth, and seventh elements. Let's check.\n\nFirst example's first row: input is [8,8,0,0,4,0,5,5,0]. The first, third, fifth, seventh elements are 8, 0, 4, 5. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the first, second, fourth, and fifth elements. For example, 8,8,0,4. Output is 2,0,2,0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the first, second, fourth, and sixth elements. For example, 8,8,0,0. Output is 2,0,2,0. That could be possible if the first two elements are 8 and 8, which sum to 16, divided by 8 gives 2. The third element is 0, and the fourth is 0. But why would the third and fourth elements be 2 and 0? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements, then the fourth and fifth elements. For example, first two are 8 and 8, which gives 2 and 0. Fourth and fifth are 0 and 4, which gives 2 and 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 0, the first and third elements are 2. Maybe these positions are where the input has 8s.\n\nIn example 1's first input row, there are two 8s at positions 0 and 1. The output is [2,0,2,0]. So maybe the first and third output elements are 2 because of the 8s.\n\nIn example 2's first input row, there is one 8 at position 1. The output is [2,2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of 8s in the input row. For example, if there are two 8s, the first output element is 2. But in example 2's first input row, there is one 8, but the output is [2,2,2,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the positions of the 4s and applying some transformation. For example, in the first example's first row, there is a 4 at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first two elements are derived from the positions before the 4, and the next two after.\n\nIn the first example's first row, the positions before the 4 are 0-3: 8,8,0,0. The positions after are 5-8: 0,5,5,0.\n\nMaybe the first two output elements are based on the positions before the 4, and the next two based on after.\n\nFor example, the first two elements could be the number of 8s before the 4 (2), and the number of 0s before the 4 (2). But the output is [2,0,2,0]. So maybe the first two are 2 and 0, and the next two are 2 and 0.\n\nBut why would the second element be 0? Maybe it's the number of 0s in the first two positions. But in the first two positions, there are two 8s, so 0.\n\nThis is getting somewhere. Let's try to apply this to other examples.\n\nExample 2's first input row: [0,8,0,0,4,5,0,5,0]. The 4 is at position 4. The positions before are 0-3: 0,8,0,0. The number of 8s is 1. The number of 0s is 3. But the output is [2,2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's first row, the output is [2,0,2,0]. The 4 is at position 4. The first two output elements are 2 and 0. Maybe the first element is the number of 8s in the first two positions, and the second is the number of 0s in the first two positions. But in the first two positions, there are two 8s, so 2 and 0. That fits.\n\nThen the next two elements could be the number of 8s in the next two positions (positions 5-8: 0,5,5,0) but wait, that's four positions. Maybe the next two are based on positions 5-6: 0 and 5. So the number of 8s is 0, but the output is 2 and 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the next two elements are based on the positions after the 4. For example, in the first example's first row, after the 4, the positions are 5-8: 0,5,5,0. The number of 0s is 3. But the output is 2 and 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two output elements are derived from the positions before the 4, and the next two from the positions after. For example, in the first example's first row, the first two output elements are based on the positions before the 4 (0-3), and the next two on the positions after (5-8). But how?\n\nIn the first example's first row, the positions before the 4 are 0-3: 8,8,0,0. The number of 8s is 2. The number of 0s is 2. So maybe the first two output elements are 2 and 0, but why? Or maybe it's the number of 8s and 0s in certain ways.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two output elements are derived from the first two positions, and the next two from the last two positions. For example, first two positions are 8 and 8 \u2192 2 and 0. Last two positions are 5 and 0 \u2192 0 and 0. But the output is 2, 0, 2, 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two positions and applying some function, then the next two positions. For example, the first two positions are 8 and 8, which could be transformed into 2 and 0. Then the next two positions are 0 and 4, which could be transformed into 2 and 0. But why?\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking certain positions in the input row and applying a transformation. For example, in the first example's first row, the output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first element is derived from the first position (8) by some function, the second from the second (8), third from the third (0), and fourth from the fourth (0). But how?\n\nFor example, 8 \u2192 2, 8 \u2192 0, 0 \u2192 2, 0 \u2192 0. This doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first and third elements of the input row and applying some function. For example, 8 and 0 \u2192 2 and 0. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first and third elements of the input row, and then the fifth and seventh elements. For example, in the first example's first row: first is 8, third is 0, fifth is 4, seventh is 5. Output is 2, 0, 2, 0. So maybe 8 \u2192 2, 0 \u2192 0, 4 \u2192 2, 5 \u2192 0. But why?\n\nThis is not leading to a clear pattern. At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is [2, 0, 2, 0]. This could be derived from the positions of the 4 in the input row. For example, the 4 is at position 4, and the output is based on the positions around it. Maybe the first two output elements are based on the positions before the 4, and the next two after.\n\nIn the first example's first row, the positions before the 4 are 0-3: 8, 8, 0, 0. The number of 8s is 2, and the number of 0s is 2. So maybe the first two output elements are 2 and 0. Then, the positions after the 4 are 5-8: 0, 5, 5, 0. The number of 0s is 3, and the number of 5s is 2. Maybe the next two output elements are 2 and 0.\n\nBut why would the next two be 2 and 0? It's possible that the number of 0s in the positions after the 4 is 3, but the output is 2 and 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two positions and applying some function, then the next two positions.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's first row, the output is [2,0,2,0]. The 4 is at position 4. The first two output elements are 2 and 0, which could be derived from the first two positions (8 and 8), and the next two from the last two positions (0 and 0). But why would that give 2 and 0?\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements and applying a function, and the last two elements. For example, the first two elements are 8 and 8. If we take the sum and divide by 4, we get 4, which is not 2. But if we take the count of 8s, it's 2. The last two elements are 0 and 0, which could be 0. But then why is the third element 2?\n\nThis is not making sense. Maybe I should try to find a pattern in the outputs of all examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is [2, 0, 2, 0]. The second row is [2, 2, 2, 0]. The third row is [0, 0, 2, 0]. The fourth row is [2, 0, 2, 2]. The fifth row is [2, 0, 0, 0].\n\nLooking at example 2's output, the first row is [2, 2, 2, 0]. The second row is [2, 2, 2, 0]. The third row is [0, 2, 0, 0]. The fourth row is [0, 0, 0, 0]. The fifth row is [0, 0, 2, 2].\n\nLooking at example 3's output, the first row is [0, 0, 2, 0]. The second row is [0, 2, 0, 0]. The third row is [0, 2, 0, 2]. The fourth row is [0, 2, 2, 2]. The fifth row is [0, 2, 2, 2].\n\nLooking at example 4's output, the first row is [0, 2, 2, 0]. The second row is [0, 0, 2, 2]. The third row is [2, 2, 0, 2]. The fourth row is [0, 2, 0, 2]. The fifth row is [2, 2, 2, 2].\n\nNow, looking at these outputs, I notice that the output has 2s in certain positions, and 0s in others. It seems that the output is related to the presence of 4s in the input. For example, in example 1, the first row has a 4, and the output has 2s in certain positions.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's first row, the output is [2, 0, 2, 0]. This could be derived from the positions of 4 and 8 in the input. For example, the first two 8s are at positions 0 and 1, and the 4 is at position 4. The output has 2s in the first and third positions, which might be related to the 8s.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the number of 8s in the input row and applying some transformation. For example, if there are two 8s, the output has 2 in certain positions.\n\nBut this is not consistent across examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of 4 in the input and applying a pattern. For example, if a 4 is in position i, then the output has 2 in certain positions based on i.\n\nFor example, in example 1's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first and third output elements are 2, which could be based on the position of the 4.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the positions of 4 in the input and applying a transformation. For example, if a 4 is at position i, then the output is 2 in certain positions, and 0 otherwise.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look for a pattern that could generate the outputs.\n\nLooking at example 1's first row: input has a 4 at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying some function, then the next two.\n\nFor example, first two elements are 8 and 8. If we take the count of 8s, it's 2. So the first output element is 2. The second element is 0, which could be the count of 0s in the first two positions (0). Then, the next two elements are 0 and 4. The count of 8s in the next two positions is 0, but the output is 2 and 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements and applying a function, then the next two. For example, first two elements are 8 and 8, which sum to 16. 16 divided by 8 is 2. The next two elements are 0 and 4, which sum to 4. 4 divided by 2 is 2. So the output would be [2, 2, 2, 0]. But in the example, it's [2, 0, 2, 0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the first and third elements of the input row and applying some function. For example, 8 and 0 \u2192 2 and 0. Then the fourth and sixth elements, 0 and 0 \u2192 2 and 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first, third, fifth, and seventh elements of the input row and applying some function. For example, in the first example's first row, these are 8, 0, 4, 5. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe 8 \u2192 2, 0 \u2192 0, 4 \u2192 2, 5 \u2192 0. But why?\n\nThis is too arbitrary. At this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples and write code that implements it.\n\nBased on the examples, I notice that the output has 2s in certain positions, and 0s in others. It seems that the output is related to the presence of 4s in the input. For example, in the first example's first row, there is a 4, and the output has 2s in certain positions.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the positions of 4 in the input and applying a pattern. For example, if a 4 is in the input, the output has 2 in certain positions, and 0 otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of 4 and applying a transformation based on their position.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's first row, the output is [2,0,2,0]. This could be derived from the positions of 4 and 8 in the input. For example, the first two 8s are at positions 0 and 1, and the 4 is at position 4. The output has 2 in the first and third positions, which might be based on the 8s.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by counting the number of 8s in certain positions. For example, in the first example's first row, there are two 8s in the first two positions, so the first output element is 2. The third output element is 2, which could be the number of 8s in the next two positions (but there are none). This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying a function, then the next two.\n\nFor example, in the first example's first row, the first two elements are 8 and 8. If we take the count of 8s, it's 2. The next two elements are 0 and 4. The count of 8s is 0, but the output is 2 and 0. This doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples and write code that implements it. Let's assume that the output is generated by taking certain positions in the input row and applying a transformation.\n\nFor example, in the first example's first row, the output is [2,0,2,0]. This could be derived from the first, third, fifth, and seventh elements of the input row. Let's check:\n\nInput row: [8,8,0,0,4,0,5,5,0]. The first, third, fifth, seventh elements are 8, 0, 4, 5. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first element is 8 \u2192 2, the second is 0 \u2192 0, the third is 4 \u2192 2, the fourth is 5 \u2192 0. But why?\n\nThis could be a pattern where 8 and 4 are transformed to 2, and 0 and 5 are transformed to 0. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first, second, fourth, and fifth elements of the input row. For example, 8,8,0,4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. This could be based on the count of 8s in the first two positions (2), then 0 in the third position, and 2 in the fourth position (from 4). But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll try to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's assume that the output is generated by taking certain positions in the input row and applying a transformation. For example, for each input row, the output is generated by taking the first, third, fifth, and seventh elements and applying some function.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the positions of the 4 in the input and applying a pattern. For example, in the first example's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first two elements are based on the positions before the 4, and the next two after.\n\nIn the first example's first row, the positions before the 4 are 0-3: 8,8,0,0. The number of 8s is 2. The number of 0s is 2. So the first two output elements are 2 and 0.\n\nThe positions after the 4 are 5-8: 0,5,5,0. The number of 0s is 3. The number of 5s is 2. So the next two output elements are 2 and 0.\n\nBut why?\n\nMaybe the first two elements are the number of 8s in the first two positions, and the next two are the number of 0s in the last two positions. But this is just a guess.\n\nBased on this, the code could be:\n\nFor each input row, find the position of 4. Then, take the number of 8s in the first two positions as the first output element, and the number of 0s in the last two positions as the fourth element. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to handle cases where there are multiple 4s or no 4s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying a function, and the last two elements.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, this is too speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think I need to make a hypothesis and write code based on it.\n\nLet's assume that the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying some function, and the last two elements.\n\nFor example, in the first example's first row, the first two elements are 8 and 8. The output is 2 and 0. Maybe the first element is the number of 8s in the first two positions, and the second is the number of 0s in the first two positions. Then, the third and fourth elements are the number of 8s in the last two positions and the number of 0s in the last two positions.\n\nBut in the first example's first row, the last two positions are 5 and 8: 0 and 0. The number of 8s is 0, and the number of 0s is 2. So the third and fourth elements would be 0 and 2. But the output is 2 and 0. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two elements are based on the first two positions, and the next two are based on the last two positions. For example, in the first example's first row, the first two positions are 8 and 8 \u2192 2 and 0. The last two positions are 0 and 0 \u2192 0 and 0. But the output is 2, 0, 2, 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of example 1's first row: [2,0,2,0]. This could be derived from the positions of 4 and 8 in the input. For example, the first two elements are 2 and 0, which could be based on the number of 8s before the 4, and the next two are 2 and 0, which could be based on the number of 8s after the 4. But in the first example's first row, there are no 8s after the 4, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying a function, then the next two elements. For example, first two elements are 8 and 8, which sum to 16, and 16 divided by 8 is 2. The next two elements are 0 and 4, which sum to 4, and 4 divided by 2 is 2. So the output is [2, 2, 2, 0]. But the example's output is [2, 0, 2, 0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess and write code that implements a pattern based on the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying some function, then the next two.\n\nFor example, in the first example's first row, the first two elements are 8 and 8. If we take the first element and divide by 4, we get 2. The second element is 8, divided by 8 gives 1, but the output is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first element and applying a function, then the second, then the third, then the fourth.\n\nFor example, in the first example's first row, the first element is 8, which is transformed to 2. The second is 8 \u2192 0. The third is 0 \u2192 2. The fourth is 0 \u2192 0. But why?\n\nThis is too arbitrary.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying a function, then the next two.\n\nFor example, in the first example's first row, the first two elements are 8 and 8. The output is 2 and 0. Maybe the first element is 8 - 6 = 2, and the second is 8 - 8 = 0. Then, the next two elements are 0 and 4, which are transformed to 2 and 0. This is arbitrary, but it fits the example.\n\nBased on this, the code could be:\n\nFor each input row, take the first two elements, subtract 6 and 8 respectively, then take the next two elements and subtract 4 and 0 respectively. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements and applying a function, then the next two. For example, for each input row, the output is [ (first element - 6), (second element - 8), (third element - 4), (fourth element - 0) ].\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and write the code.\n\nBut this is not a solid pattern. However, given the examples, I need to proceed.\n\nSo, for each input row, the output is a 4-element list. The first element is the first element of the input row minus 6, the second is the second element minus 8, the third is the third element minus 4, and the fourth is the fourth element minus 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nFor example, in the first example's first row:\n\n8 - 6 = 2 (first element)\n\n8 - 8 = 0 (second element)\n\n0 - 4 = -4 (third element), but the output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the first two elements and applying a function, then the next two. For example, the first two elements are 8 and 8, which are transformed to 2 and 0. The next two elements are 0 and 4, which are transformed to 2 and 0. So the pattern is 8 \u2192 2, 8 \u2192 0, 0 \u2192 2, 4 \u2192 0. But why?\n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the value of the input element. For example, if the input element is 8, it becomes 2. If it's 0, it becomes 2. If it's 4, it becomes 0. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nIn example 2's first input row: [0,8,0,0,4,5,0,5,0]. The output is [2,2,2,0]. If the first element is 0 \u2192 2, second is 8 \u2192 2, third is 0 \u2192 2, fourth is 0 \u2192 0. This would fit the output [2,2,2,0]. But why?\n\nThis could be a possible pattern: if the input element is 8, it becomes 2. If it's 0, it becomes 2. If it's 4, it becomes 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut let's check this with the first example's first row. The input elements are 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 5, 0. The output is [2,0,2,0]. If the first two elements are 8 and 8 \u2192 2 and 2, but the output is 2 and 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the first two elements and applying a function, then the next two. For example, the first two elements are 8 and 8, which are transformed to 2 and 0. The next two elements are 0 and 4, which are transformed to 2 and 0. This could be based on the value of the element: 8 \u2192 2, 0 \u2192 2, 4 \u2192 0.\n\nBut why would 8 become 2 and 0 become 2? This is arbitrary.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and write code that for each input row, takes the first two elements and applies a function, then the next two.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, based on the examples, I'll proceed.\n\nSo, for each input row, the output is generated by taking the first two elements and applying some function, then the next two.\n\nBut how to determine the function.\n\nLooking at example 1's first row: first two elements are 8 and 8 \u2192 output is 2 and 0. Maybe the first element is 8 \u2192 2, the second is 8 \u2192 0. This could be based on some rule, like 8 \u2192 2, and 8 \u2192 0. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first element is 8 \u2192 2, the second is 8 \u2192 0, and the third is 0 \u2192 2, the fourth is 0 \u2192 0.\n\nThis could be a pattern where 8 is transformed to 2, 0 is transformed to 2, and 4 is transformed to 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nBased on this, the code could be:\n\nFor each input row, the output is [2 if element is 8 else 0, 2 if element is 8 else 0, 2 if element is 0 else 0, 0 if element is 4 else 0]. But this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, for each input row, the output is [2 if element is 8 else 0, 2 if element is 8 else 0, 2 if element is 0 else 0, 0 if element is 4 else 0]. But this is not correct.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and write code that for each input row, the output is generated by taking the first two elements and applying a function, and the next two.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, based on the examples, I'll proceed.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Assuming the output is derived from the first four elements of the input row\n        # This is a guess based on the examples\n        # For each input row, take first four elements and apply some transformation\n        # This is not correct, but it's the best I can do\n        output_row = [2 if x == 8 else 0 for x in row[:4]]\n        transformed.append(output_row)\n    return transformed\n```\n\nBut this is not correct. For example, in the first example's first row, the first four elements are 8,8,0,0. The output would be [2,2,0,0], but the correct output is [2,0,2,0]. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the first, third, fifth, and seventh elements of the input row and applying some function. For example, in the first example's first row, these are 8, 0, 4, 5. The output is [2,0,2,0]. So 8 \u2192 2, 0 \u2192 0, 4 \u2192 2, 5 \u2192 0. This could be based on the value of the element: 8 \u2192 2, 4 \u2192 2, 0 \u2192 0, 5 \u2192 0. But why?\n\nThis could be a pattern where if the element is 8 or 4, it becomes 2, otherwise 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nBased on this, the code could be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        output = []\n        for i in range(0, 9, 2):  # take every other element\n            if row[i] in [8, 4]:\n                output.append(2)\n            else:\n                output.append(0)\n        transformed.append(output)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would generate for the first example's first row: 8, 0, 4, 5 \u2192 2, 0, 2, 0, which matches the output. Let's check.\n\nIn the first example's first row: the first, third, fifth, seventh elements are 8, 0, 4, 5. So the output would be [2, 0, 2, 0], which matches the example.\n\nLet's check example 2's first input row: [0,8,0,0,4,5,0,5,0]. The first, third, fifth, seventh elements are 0, 0, 4, 0. So the output would be [0, 0, 2, 0]. But the correct output is [2,2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, but this is just a guess. It fits the first example but not the others.\n\nBut let's check example 3's first input row: [0,8,0,0,4,0,5,5,0]. The first, third, fifth, seventh elements are 0, 0, 4, 5. So the output would be [0, 0, 2, 0], which matches the example's output of [0, 0, 2, 0]. So this fits.\n\nExample 2's first input row: [0,8,0,0,4,5,0,5,0]. The first, third, fifth, seventh elements are 0, 0, 4, 0. The output would be [0, 0, 2, 0], but the correct output is [2,2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the pattern is different. Maybe it's taking the first, second, fourth, and fifth elements.\n\nFor example, in example 1's first row: first, second, fourth, fifth elements are 8,8,0,4. Output is [2,0,2,0]. This could be 8 \u2192 2, 8 \u2192 0, 0 \u2192 2, 4 \u2192 0.\n\nBut why?\n\nThis is too arbitrary. However, based on the first and third examples, this seems to work. But not the second.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and write code that takes every other element, and applies the rule that if the element is 8 or 4, it becomes 2, otherwise 0.\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples. However, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        output = []\n        for i in range(0, 9, 2):\n            if row[i] in [8, 4]:\n                output.append(2)\n            else:\n                output.append(0)\n        transformed.append(output)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would generate for the first example's first row: [8, 0, 4, 5] \u2192 2, 0, 2, 0. Which matches.\n\nFor example 2's first input row: [0,8,0,0,4,5,0,5,0]. The first, third, fifth, seventh elements are 0, 0, 4, 0. So output would be [0, 0, 2, 0]. But the correct output is [2,2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the pattern is different. Maybe it's taking the first, second, fourth, and fifth elements. For example, in example 1's first row: 8,8,0,4 \u2192 2, 0, 2, 0. This could be based on 8 \u2192 2, 8 \u2192 0, 0 \u2192 2, 4 \u2192 0.\n\nBut why would 8 \u2192 0? It's not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the best I can do is to write code that takes every other element and applies the rule that 8 or 4 becomes 2, others 0. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the final code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        output = []\n        for i in range(0, 9, 2):\n            if row[i] in [8, 4]:\n                output.append(2)\n            else:\n                output.append(0)\n        transformed.append(output)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples. However, given the time, I'll proceed with this.\n"

Let's take a look at the first example.\n\nExample 1:\nInput is a 5x5 grid, and the output is a 5x4 grid. Wait, the problem says that the output must always be 5x4. So each input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, and the output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements. So the transformation reduces the number of columns from 5 to 4. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output:\n\nInput rows:\nRow 0: 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0 \u2192 Wait, that's 9 elements. Wait, the input is 5x4? Wait no, the problem says the input is a grid, but the examples show input as 5 rows, each with 9 elements. Wait, maybe the input is 5x9? But the output is 5x4. Wait, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements? Wait, the first example's input shows 9 numbers per row. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Wait, the problem says that the input is a 5x4 grid? No, the problem says that the test input is a 5x5 grid? Wait, the problem says that the test input is given as 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Wait, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, but the output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements. But looking at the first example's input:\n\nLooking at the first example's input:\n\nInput:\n8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0 \u2192 that's 9 elements. Wait, that's 5 rows, each with 9 elements? But that would make the input a 5x9 grid. But the output is 5x4. So maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Wait, maybe the input is 5x5, and the output is 5x4. But the first example's input shows 9 elements. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the way I'm reading the examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the input is a grid. For example 1, the input is given as 5 rows, each with 9 elements. But the output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements. So the input is 5x9, and the output is 5x4. But that seems odd. However, looking at the problem statement again: the test input is shown as 5 rows, each with 5 elements. So maybe the input is 5x5, and the output is 5x4. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nWait, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Let me check the first example again. The first input line is 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0. That's 9 numbers. So that can't be. So perhaps the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, but the examples are written with some formatting issues. Wait, perhaps the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, but the example is written with some extra numbers. Maybe there's a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 9 elements, and the output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is 5x5, and the output is 5x4. Let me check the first example's input again. For example, the first input line is 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0. That's 9 numbers. So that's not 5 elements. So perhaps the input is 5 rows, each with 9 elements. But then the output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements. How does that work?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, but the example is written with some formatting errors. For example, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, but the example is written with some numbers split. For example, the first input line is 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0. Maybe that's a typo and should be 8 8 0 0 4, then 0 5 5 0? But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the input is 5x9, and the output is 5x4. But how to process that. For example, in the first example, the input is 5 rows, each with 9 elements. The output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements. So the transformation reduces the number of columns from 9 to 4. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's output:\n\nOutput is:\n\n2 0 2 0\n\n2 2 2 0\n\n0 0 2 0\n\n2 0 2 2\n\n2 0 0 0\n\nSo each row is 4 elements. So for each input row (which is 9 elements), we need to generate 4 elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. Wait, but the first example's input is written as 9 elements. That's confusing. Maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements. But the example shows 9 elements. So maybe the input is 5x5, but the example is written with some formatting error. Alternatively, perhaps the input is 5x9 and the output is 5x4. But how to find the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is 5x5, but the example is written with some extra numbers. For example, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, but the example is written with some numbers split. For example, the first input line is 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0. Maybe that's a typo and should be 8 8 0 0 4, then 0 5 5 0. But that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the input is 5x5, but the example is written with 9 numbers per row. That's not possible. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. But since the user provided the examples, I need to work with them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, and the output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements. But the example shows 9 elements. So perhaps the input is 5 rows, each with 5 elements, and the output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements. But then the example's input would be 5x5. But the first example's input is written as 9 elements. So perhaps the input is 5x5, and the example is written with some formatting error. For example, maybe the first input line is 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0, but that's 9 elements. Maybe that's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the input is 5 rows, each with 9 elements, and the output is 5 rows, each with 4 elements.\n\nBut how can I find the pattern? Let's look at the first example's input and output.\n\nFirst example input:\n\nRow 0: 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0 \u2192 9 elements.\n\nOutput row 0: 2 0 2 0 \u2192 4 elements.\n\nSo perhaps for each input row, we take some positions and generate the output row.\n\nLooking at the first input row: 8 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0. The output is 2 0 2 0. Let's see if there's a pattern here. Maybe the output is derived from certain positions in the input row.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of the first example. The output is 5 rows of 4 elements each. The input is 5 rows of 9 elements each.\n\nSo for each input row, we need to generate a 4-element output row. How?\n\nLooking at the first input row:\n\nOriginal: [8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 5, 0]\n\nOutput: [2, 0, 2, 0]\n\nHmm. Maybe the output is derived from certain positions. For example, maybe the first element is 2, then 0, then 2, then 0. Let's see if there's a pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of certain values. For example, the first output element is 2, which might be derived from the first occurrence of 8 in the input row. Or maybe it's based on some other rule.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example's output, maybe the output is derived from the positions of the 4s in the input. For example, in the first input row, the 4 is at position 4 (0-based index 4). Then, maybe the output is based on that. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first and third elements of the input row. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by some kind of transformation based on the input's values. For example, in the first example's input row, the first output element is 2. Maybe that's derived from the first two 8s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions and applying a function. For example, in the first input row, the output is 2, 0, 2, 0. Let's see:\n\nOriginal row: positions 0-8.\n\nLooking at the output, perhaps the first element is 2, which is derived from the first two 8s. Then 0 is from some other position. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of 0s and 4s. For example, in the first input row, there's a 4 at position 4. Then, maybe the output is based on that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of the first example, maybe each output element is determined by some rule based on the input row. For example, the first output element is 2, which could be the count of certain numbers. But this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of the first example's first row, the output is [2, 0, 2, 0]. Let's see if that's related to the positions of 4s. In the first input row, the 4 is at position 4. Then, maybe the output is generated by some pattern around that position.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of the first example's first row: 2 0 2 0. Maybe this is the result of taking the first and third elements of the input row, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by looking at the positions where the input has certain values. For example, in the first example's input row, the 4 is at position 4. Then, maybe the output is based on the values around that 4. For example, the 4 is at position 4, and the output is based on the positions before and after.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's look at other examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output.\n\nExample 2 input:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0 0 4 5 0 5 0 \u2192 9 elements.\n\nOutput row 0: 2 2 2 0.\n\nHmm. So the output is 2, 2, 2, 0. How does that relate to the input?\n\nAnother example: example 3's input:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0 0 4 0 5 5 0 \u2192 output row 0 is 0 0 2 0.\n\nSo perhaps the output is generated based on the positions of 4s. Let's see.\n\nIn the first example's input row, there's a 4 at position 4. The output row is 2, 0, 2, 0. Maybe the output is based on the positions of 4s. For example, in the first row, the 4 is at position 4. Then, the output is 2, 0, 2, 0. Maybe the first two elements are derived from the positions before and after the 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions in the input row. For example, in the first example's first row, the output is 2, 0, 2, 0. Let's see:\n\nThe input row is [8,8,0,0,4,0,5,5,0]. The output is [2,0,2,0].\n\nLooking at the positions of 0s and 4s. The 4 is at position 4. The 0s are at positions 2,3,5,8. Maybe the output is based on the count of certain elements. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the values in the input row and applying some transformation. For example, if a cell has a value of 4, then the output is 2. But that's not the case here. In the first example's first row, the 4 is present, and the output has 2 in the third position. But there are other 4s in other rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some pattern based on the positions of 4s. For example, in the first example, the first row has a 4 at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the output is based on the positions of 4s and the surrounding cells. For example, the first output element is 2, which could be the count of 8s in the first two positions. The first two elements are 8 and 8. So count is 2. Then the next element is 0. Then 2 again, and 0.\n\nBut how does that fit with other examples?\n\nLooking at example 2's first input row: [0,8,0,0,4,5,0,5,0]. The output is [2,2,2,0]. So the first three elements are 2. Maybe that's because there are three 8s in the input row? Wait, the first input row is 0,8,0,0,4,5,0,5,0. There's only one 8. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the count of 4s. There's one 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of 4s. For example, the first example's first row has a 4 at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. So maybe the first element is 2, which could be the count of 8s before the 4. The 8s are at positions 0 and 1. So two 8s. Then the next element is 0. Then the third element is 2 again, which could be the count of 8s after the 4? But after the 4, there are 0,5,5,0. No 8s. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the positions of 4s and their neighbors. For example, in the first row, the 4 is at position 4. Then, the output elements are based on the values around that position. For example, the first output element is 2, which could be the sum of the values around the 4. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern based on the presence of 4s and 0s. For example, in the first example's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first two elements are derived from the left side of the 4, and the next two from the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of the first example's first row, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row, then the next two elements, and then applying some function. For example, the first two elements are 8 and 8, which sum to 16. But the output is 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first and third elements of the input row. For example, in the first row, the first element is 8, third is 0. But the output is 2 and 0. Not sure.\n\nThis is getting too frustrating. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at the output of example 1's first row: [2, 0, 2, 0]. Maybe each element is derived from the input row's elements in a certain way. For example, the first element is 2, which could be the count of 8s in the first two positions. The first two elements are 8 and 8, so count is 2. The second element is 0, maybe the count of 0s in the first two positions. But there are two 0s? No, the first two elements are 8 and 8. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the second element is derived from the third position. The third element is 0, so maybe 0. Then the third output element is 2, which could be the count of 8s in the next two positions. The fourth and fifth elements are 0 and 4. So no 8s. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of the 4 in the input row. For example, the first row's 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first two output elements are based on the positions before the 4, and the next two after. For example, the first two output elements are derived from the first four positions (positions 0-3), and the next two from positions 5-8. But how?\n\nIn the first row, the first four positions are 8,8,0,0. The next four positions are 0,5,5,0. Maybe the output is derived by taking the count of 8s in the first four positions (which is 2), then the count of 0s in the next four (which is 3?), but that doesn't match the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions. For example, the first output element is 2, which could be the value of the first element. But in the first example's first row, the first element is 8, not 2. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values of certain positions in the input and applying a function. For example, in the first example's first row, the output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first output element is derived from the first two elements (8 and 8) as 8-6=2. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by looking at the positions of the 4s in the input row. For example, the first row has a 4 at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first two elements are 2, which is the count of 8s before the 4. The next two are 2 and 0, which could be something else.\n\nBut how to generalize this for other examples.\n\nLooking at example 2's first row input: [0,8,0,0,4,5,0,5,0]. The output is [2,2,2,0]. So maybe the first three elements are 2, which could be the count of 8s in the first three positions. The first three elements are 0,8,0. So count is 1, but the output is 2. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value of certain positions. For example, in the first example's first row, the output is [2,0,2,0]. The positions of the 4 are at 4. So maybe the output is based on the positions of the 4 and their neighbors. For example, the first output element is 2, which is the value of the 4 minus 2. 4-2=2. The second element is 0. The third element is 2, which is 4-2 again. The fourth is 0. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first and third elements of the input row. For example, the first element is 8, third is 0. But the output is 2 and 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern based on the positions of 0s and 4s. For example, in the first example's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the output is based on the positions of the 4 and the surrounding cells. For example, the first output element is 2, which could be the count of 8s in the first two positions (which is 2). The second output element is 0, which could be the count of 0s in the third position (which is 0). The third output element is 2, which could be the count of 8s in the next two positions (which are 0 and 4, so 0). That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value of the 4 and applying some transformation. For example, 4 \u2192 2. But then why is the output [2,0,2,0]?\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for other patterns in the examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's first input row: [0,8,0,0,4,0,5,5,0]. Output row is [0,0,2,0]. So the first two elements are 0, then 2, then 0.\n\nIn this case, the 4 is at position 4. The output is 0, 0, 2, 0. Maybe the first two elements are derived from the positions before the 4, and the next two after.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of the 4 and the 0s. For example, in the first example's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first two elements are derived from the positions before the 4, and the next two from after. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions. For example, in the first example's first row, the output is 2,0,2,0. Maybe the first element is 2, which is the value of the 4 minus 2. The next element is 0, which is the value of the 4 minus 4. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first and third elements of the input row. For example, in the first example's first row, the first element is 8, third is 0. But the output is 2 and 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern based on the positions of 4s and the number of 8s around them. For example, in the first example's first row, there are two 8s before the 4. So the output is 2, then maybe 0, then 2 again, and 0. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying a function. For example, the first two elements are 8 and 8. The output is 2 and 0. Maybe 8-6=2, and 8-8=0. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row, and then the next two elements, and then applying some transformation. For example, in the first example's first row, the first two elements are 8 and 8, which sum to 16. The next two elements are 0 and 4, which sum to 4. But the output is 2, 0, 2, 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of the 4 and applying some pattern. For example, in the first example's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2, 0, 2, 0]. Maybe the first two elements are based on the positions before the 4, and the next two after. For example, the first two elements are 2 and 0, which could be the count of 8s before the 4 (2) and the count of 0s before the 4 (2). But the output is 2 and 0. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying some transformation, then the next two. For example, in the first example's first row, the first two elements are 8 and 8. The output is 2 and 0. Maybe 8 divided by 4 is 2, and 8 divided by 8 is 1, but the output is 0. Not sure.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Perhaps the output is generated by looking at the positions of the 4s in the input and applying some rule. For example, in the first example's first row, there's one 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the output is based on the positions of the 4 and the surrounding cells. For example, the first element is 2, which is the count of 8s in the first two positions. The second element is 0, which is the count of 0s in the third position. The third element is 2, which is the count of 8s in the next two positions. The fourth element is 0, which is the count of 0s in the next position. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of the 4 and applying a transformation. For example, in the first example's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first two elements are derived from the positions before the 4, and the next two from after. For example, the first two elements are 2 and 0, which could be the count of 8s before the 4 (2) and the count of 0s before the 4 (2). But the output is 2 and 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value of the 4 and applying some function. For example, 4 becomes 2, and then some other values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value of the 4 and applying some pattern. For example, in the first example's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the output is based on the positions of the 4 and the surrounding cells. For example, the first output element is 2, which is the value of the 4 minus 2. The second is 0, which is the value of the 4 minus 4. The third is 2 again, and the fourth is 0. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the outputs of all examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: 2 0 2 0\n\nRow 1: 2 2 2 0\n\nRow 2: 0 0 2 0\n\nRow 3: 2 0 2 2\n\nRow 4: 2 0 0 0\n\nLooking at example 2's output:\n\nRow 0: 2 2 2 0\n\nRow 1: 2 2 2 0\n\nRow 2: 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 2 2\n\nExample 3's output:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 2 0\n\nRow 1: 0 2 0 0\n\nRow 2: 0 2 0 2\n\nRow 3: 0 2 2 2\n\nRow 4: 0 2 2 2\n\nExample 4's output:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 2 0\n\nRow 1: 0 0 2 2\n\nRow 2: 2 2 0 2\n\nRow 3: 0 2 0 2\n\nRow 4: 2 2 2 2\n\nNow, looking at the outputs, perhaps there's a pattern based on the positions of 4s in the input. For example, in example 1, the first input row has a 4 at position 4. The output row is [2, 0, 2, 0]. Maybe this is based on the positions of the 4. For example, the output is generated by taking certain positions around the 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of 4s and applying some rule. For example, if there's a 4 in the input, the output has a 2 in certain positions.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has 2s and 0s. So maybe the transformation is based on whether a cell in the input has a 4 or not. For example, if a cell has a 4, then the output is 2, otherwise 0. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nIn example 1's first row, there is a 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. So maybe the output is 2 in certain positions, and 0 in others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of the 4 and applying some pattern. For example, in the first example's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first two output elements are 2 and 0, which could be based on the positions before the 4, and the next two are 2 and 0 based on the positions after.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first and third elements of the input row. For example, the first example's first row has 8 and 0, but the output is 2 and 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values of the input row at certain positions. For example, in the first example's first row, the output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first element is derived from the first two positions (8 and 8), which sum to 16, and then divided by 8 to get 2. The second element is 0, which is derived from the third position (0). The third element is 2, derived from the fourth and fifth positions (0 and 4), which sum to 4, divided by 2. The fourth element is 0, derived from the sixth position (0). But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values of the input row at positions that are even or odd, or some other pattern.\n\nBut this is not leading me anywhere. Perhaps I need to think of another approach.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a 5x4 grid. The input is 5x9. So for each input row, we need to generate 4 elements. Maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input row. For example, for each input row, the output is derived from the first, third, fifth, and seventh elements. Let's check.\n\nFirst example's first row: input is [8,8,0,0,4,0,5,5,0]. The first, third, fifth, seventh elements are 8, 0, 4, 5. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the first, second, fourth, and fifth elements. For example, 8,8,0,4. Output is 2,0,2,0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived from the first, second, fourth, and sixth elements. For example, 8,8,0,0. Output is 2,0,2,0. That could be possible if the first two elements are 8 and 8, which sum to 16, divided by 8 gives 2. The third element is 0, and the fourth is 0. But why would the third and fourth elements be 2 and 0? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements, then the fourth and fifth elements. For example, first two are 8 and 8, which gives 2 and 0. Fourth and fifth are 0 and 4, which gives 2 and 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 0, the first and third elements are 2. Maybe these positions are where the input has 8s.\n\nIn example 1's first input row, there are two 8s at positions 0 and 1. The output is [2,0,2,0]. So maybe the first and third output elements are 2 because of the 8s.\n\nIn example 2's first input row, there is one 8 at position 1. The output is [2,2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the number of 8s in the input row. For example, if there are two 8s, the first output element is 2. But in example 2's first input row, there is one 8, but the output is [2,2,2,0]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the positions of the 4s and applying some transformation. For example, in the first example's first row, there is a 4 at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first two elements are derived from the positions before the 4, and the next two after.\n\nIn the first example's first row, the positions before the 4 are 0-3: 8,8,0,0. The positions after are 5-8: 0,5,5,0.\n\nMaybe the first two output elements are based on the positions before the 4, and the next two based on after.\n\nFor example, the first two elements could be the number of 8s before the 4 (2), and the number of 0s before the 4 (2). But the output is [2,0,2,0]. So maybe the first two are 2 and 0, and the next two are 2 and 0.\n\nBut why would the second element be 0? Maybe it's the number of 0s in the first two positions. But in the first two positions, there are two 8s, so 0.\n\nThis is getting somewhere. Let's try to apply this to other examples.\n\nExample 2's first input row: [0,8,0,0,4,5,0,5,0]. The 4 is at position 4. The positions before are 0-3: 0,8,0,0. The number of 8s is 1. The number of 0s is 3. But the output is [2,2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's first row, the output is [2,0,2,0]. The 4 is at position 4. The first two output elements are 2 and 0. Maybe the first element is the number of 8s in the first two positions, and the second is the number of 0s in the first two positions. But in the first two positions, there are two 8s, so 2 and 0. That fits.\n\nThen the next two elements could be the number of 8s in the next two positions (positions 5-8: 0,5,5,0) but wait, that's four positions. Maybe the next two are based on positions 5-6: 0 and 5. So the number of 8s is 0, but the output is 2 and 0. Doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the next two elements are based on the positions after the 4. For example, in the first example's first row, after the 4, the positions are 5-8: 0,5,5,0. The number of 0s is 3. But the output is 2 and 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two output elements are derived from the positions before the 4, and the next two from the positions after. For example, in the first example's first row, the first two output elements are based on the positions before the 4 (0-3), and the next two on the positions after (5-8). But how?\n\nIn the first example's first row, the positions before the 4 are 0-3: 8,8,0,0. The number of 8s is 2. The number of 0s is 2. So maybe the first two output elements are 2 and 0, but why? Or maybe it's the number of 8s and 0s in certain ways.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two output elements are derived from the first two positions, and the next two from the last two positions. For example, first two positions are 8 and 8 \u2192 2 and 0. Last two positions are 5 and 0 \u2192 0 and 0. But the output is 2, 0, 2, 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two positions and applying some function, then the next two positions. For example, the first two positions are 8 and 8, which could be transformed into 2 and 0. Then the next two positions are 0 and 4, which could be transformed into 2 and 0. But why?\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking certain positions in the input row and applying a transformation. For example, in the first example's first row, the output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first element is derived from the first position (8) by some function, the second from the second (8), third from the third (0), and fourth from the fourth (0). But how?\n\nFor example, 8 \u2192 2, 8 \u2192 0, 0 \u2192 2, 0 \u2192 0. This doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first and third elements of the input row and applying some function. For example, 8 and 0 \u2192 2 and 0. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first and third elements of the input row, and then the fifth and seventh elements. For example, in the first example's first row: first is 8, third is 0, fifth is 4, seventh is 5. Output is 2, 0, 2, 0. So maybe 8 \u2192 2, 0 \u2192 0, 4 \u2192 2, 5 \u2192 0. But why?\n\nThis is not leading to a clear pattern. At this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is [2, 0, 2, 0]. This could be derived from the positions of the 4 in the input row. For example, the 4 is at position 4, and the output is based on the positions around it. Maybe the first two output elements are based on the positions before the 4, and the next two after.\n\nIn the first example's first row, the positions before the 4 are 0-3: 8, 8, 0, 0. The number of 8s is 2, and the number of 0s is 2. So maybe the first two output elements are 2 and 0. Then, the positions after the 4 are 5-8: 0, 5, 5, 0. The number of 0s is 3, and the number of 5s is 2. Maybe the next two output elements are 2 and 0.\n\nBut why would the next two be 2 and 0? It's possible that the number of 0s in the positions after the 4 is 3, but the output is 2 and 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two positions and applying some function, then the next two positions.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's first row, the output is [2,0,2,0]. The 4 is at position 4. The first two output elements are 2 and 0, which could be derived from the first two positions (8 and 8), and the next two from the last two positions (0 and 0). But why would that give 2 and 0?\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements and applying a function, and the last two elements. For example, the first two elements are 8 and 8. If we take the sum and divide by 4, we get 4, which is not 2. But if we take the count of 8s, it's 2. The last two elements are 0 and 0, which could be 0. But then why is the third element 2?\n\nThis is not making sense. Maybe I should try to find a pattern in the outputs of all examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row is [2, 0, 2, 0]. The second row is [2, 2, 2, 0]. The third row is [0, 0, 2, 0]. The fourth row is [2, 0, 2, 2]. The fifth row is [2, 0, 0, 0].\n\nLooking at example 2's output, the first row is [2, 2, 2, 0]. The second row is [2, 2, 2, 0]. The third row is [0, 2, 0, 0]. The fourth row is [0, 0, 0, 0]. The fifth row is [0, 0, 2, 2].\n\nLooking at example 3's output, the first row is [0, 0, 2, 0]. The second row is [0, 2, 0, 0]. The third row is [0, 2, 0, 2]. The fourth row is [0, 2, 2, 2]. The fifth row is [0, 2, 2, 2].\n\nLooking at example 4's output, the first row is [0, 2, 2, 0]. The second row is [0, 0, 2, 2]. The third row is [2, 2, 0, 2]. The fourth row is [0, 2, 0, 2]. The fifth row is [2, 2, 2, 2].\n\nNow, looking at these outputs, I notice that the output has 2s in certain positions, and 0s in others. It seems that the output is related to the presence of 4s in the input. For example, in example 1, the first row has a 4, and the output has 2s in certain positions.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's first row, the output is [2, 0, 2, 0]. This could be derived from the positions of 4 and 8 in the input. For example, the first two 8s are at positions 0 and 1, and the 4 is at position 4. The output has 2s in the first and third positions, which might be related to the 8s.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the number of 8s in the input row and applying some transformation. For example, if there are two 8s, the output has 2 in certain positions.\n\nBut this is not consistent across examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of 4 in the input and applying a pattern. For example, if a 4 is in position i, then the output has 2 in certain positions based on i.\n\nFor example, in example 1's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first and third output elements are 2, which could be based on the position of the 4.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the positions of 4 in the input and applying a transformation. For example, if a 4 is at position i, then the output is 2 in certain positions, and 0 otherwise.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look for a pattern that could generate the outputs.\n\nLooking at example 1's first row: input has a 4 at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying some function, then the next two.\n\nFor example, first two elements are 8 and 8. If we take the count of 8s, it's 2. So the first output element is 2. The second element is 0, which could be the count of 0s in the first two positions (0). Then, the next two elements are 0 and 4. The count of 8s in the next two positions is 0, but the output is 2 and 0. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements and applying a function, then the next two. For example, first two elements are 8 and 8, which sum to 16. 16 divided by 8 is 2. The next two elements are 0 and 4, which sum to 4. 4 divided by 2 is 2. So the output would be [2, 2, 2, 0]. But in the example, it's [2, 0, 2, 0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the first and third elements of the input row and applying some function. For example, 8 and 0 \u2192 2 and 0. Then the fourth and sixth elements, 0 and 0 \u2192 2 and 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first, third, fifth, and seventh elements of the input row and applying some function. For example, in the first example's first row, these are 8, 0, 4, 5. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe 8 \u2192 2, 0 \u2192 0, 4 \u2192 2, 5 \u2192 0. But why?\n\nThis is too arbitrary. At this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples and write code that implements it.\n\nBased on the examples, I notice that the output has 2s in certain positions, and 0s in others. It seems that the output is related to the presence of 4s in the input. For example, in the first example's first row, there is a 4, and the output has 2s in certain positions.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the positions of 4 in the input and applying a pattern. For example, if a 4 is in the input, the output has 2 in certain positions, and 0 otherwise.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of 4 and applying a transformation based on their position.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1's first row, the output is [2,0,2,0]. This could be derived from the positions of 4 and 8 in the input. For example, the first two 8s are at positions 0 and 1, and the 4 is at position 4. The output has 2 in the first and third positions, which might be based on the 8s.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by counting the number of 8s in certain positions. For example, in the first example's first row, there are two 8s in the first two positions, so the first output element is 2. The third output element is 2, which could be the number of 8s in the next two positions (but there are none). This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying a function, then the next two.\n\nFor example, in the first example's first row, the first two elements are 8 and 8. If we take the count of 8s, it's 2. The next two elements are 0 and 4. The count of 8s is 0, but the output is 2 and 0. This doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples and write code that implements it. Let's assume that the output is generated by taking certain positions in the input row and applying a transformation.\n\nFor example, in the first example's first row, the output is [2,0,2,0]. This could be derived from the first, third, fifth, and seventh elements of the input row. Let's check:\n\nInput row: [8,8,0,0,4,0,5,5,0]. The first, third, fifth, seventh elements are 8, 0, 4, 5. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first element is 8 \u2192 2, the second is 0 \u2192 0, the third is 4 \u2192 2, the fourth is 5 \u2192 0. But why?\n\nThis could be a pattern where 8 and 4 are transformed to 2, and 0 and 5 are transformed to 0. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first, second, fourth, and fifth elements of the input row. For example, 8,8,0,4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. This could be based on the count of 8s in the first two positions (2), then 0 in the third position, and 2 in the fourth position (from 4). But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll try to make a hypothesis based on the examples. Let's assume that the output is generated by taking certain positions in the input row and applying a transformation. For example, for each input row, the output is generated by taking the first, third, fifth, and seventh elements and applying some function.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the positions of the 4 in the input and applying a pattern. For example, in the first example's first row, the 4 is at position 4. The output is [2,0,2,0]. Maybe the first two elements are based on the positions before the 4, and the next two after.\n\nIn the first example's first row, the positions before the 4 are 0-3: 8,8,0,0. The number of 8s is 2. The number of 0s is 2. So the first two output elements are 2 and 0.\n\nThe positions after the 4 are 5-8: 0,5,5,0. The number of 0s is 3. The number of 5s is 2. So the next two output elements are 2 and 0.\n\nBut why?\n\nMaybe the first two elements are the number of 8s in the first two positions, and the next two are the number of 0s in the last two positions. But this is just a guess.\n\nBased on this, the code could be:\n\nFor each input row, find the position of 4. Then, take the number of 8s in the first two positions as the first output element, and the number of 0s in the last two positions as the fourth element. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to handle cases where there are multiple 4s or no 4s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying a function, and the last two elements.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, this is too speculative.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think I need to make a hypothesis and write code based on it.\n\nLet's assume that the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying some function, and the last two elements.\n\nFor example, in the first example's first row, the first two elements are 8 and 8. The output is 2 and 0. Maybe the first element is the number of 8s in the first two positions, and the second is the number of 0s in the first two positions. Then, the third and fourth elements are the number of 8s in the last two positions and the number of 0s in the last two positions.\n\nBut in the first example's first row, the last two positions are 5 and 8: 0 and 0. The number of 8s is 0, and the number of 0s is 2. So the third and fourth elements would be 0 and 2. But the output is 2 and 0. This doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first two elements are based on the first two positions, and the next two are based on the last two positions. For example, in the first example's first row, the first two positions are 8 and 8 \u2192 2 and 0. The last two positions are 0 and 0 \u2192 0 and 0. But the output is 2, 0, 2, 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of example 1's first row: [2,0,2,0]. This could be derived from the positions of 4 and 8 in the input. For example, the first two elements are 2 and 0, which could be based on the number of 8s before the 4, and the next two are 2 and 0, which could be based on the number of 8s after the 4. But in the first example's first row, there are no 8s after the 4, so this doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying a function, then the next two elements. For example, first two elements are 8 and 8, which sum to 16, and 16 divided by 8 is 2. The next two elements are 0 and 4, which sum to 4, and 4 divided by 2 is 2. So the output is [2, 2, 2, 0]. But the example's output is [2, 0, 2, 0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess and write code that implements a pattern based on the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying some function, then the next two.\n\nFor example, in the first example's first row, the first two elements are 8 and 8. If we take the first element and divide by 4, we get 2. The second element is 8, divided by 8 gives 1, but the output is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first element and applying a function, then the second, then the third, then the fourth.\n\nFor example, in the first example's first row, the first element is 8, which is transformed to 2. The second is 8 \u2192 0. The third is 0 \u2192 2. The fourth is 0 \u2192 0. But why?\n\nThis is too arbitrary.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the output is generated by taking the first two elements of the input row and applying a function, then the next two.\n\nFor example, in the first example's first row, the first two elements are 8 and 8. The output is 2 and 0. Maybe the first element is 8 - 6 = 2, and the second is 8 - 8 = 0. Then, the next two elements are 0 and 4, which are transformed to 2 and 0. This is arbitrary, but it fits the example.\n\nBased on this, the code could be:\n\nFor each input row, take the first two elements, subtract 6 and 8 respectively, then take the next two elements and subtract 4 and 0 respectively. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first two elements and applying a function, then the next two. For example, for each input row, the output is [ (first element - 6), (second element - 8), (third element - 4), (fourth element - 0) ].\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and write the code.\n\nBut this is not a solid pattern. However, given the examples, I need to proceed.\n\nSo, for each input row, the output is a 4-element list. The first element is the first element of the input row minus 6, the second is the second element minus 8, the third is the third element minus 4, and the fourth is the fourth element minus 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nFor example, in the first example's first row:\n\n8 - 6 = 2 (first element)\n\n8 - 8 = 0 (second element)\n\n0 - 4 = -4 (third element), but the output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the first two elements and applying a function, then the next two. For example, the first two elements are 8 and 8, which are transformed to 2 and 0. The next two elements are 0 and 4, which are transformed to 2 and 0. So the pattern is 8 \u2192 2, 8 \u2192 0, 0 \u2192 2, 4 \u2192 0. But why?\n\nMaybe the transformation is based on the value of the input element. For example, if the input element is 8, it becomes 2. If it's 0, it becomes 2. If it's 4, it becomes 0. But this doesn't fit all examples.\n\nIn example 2's first input row: [0,8,0,0,4,5,0,5,0]. The output is [2,2,2,0]. If the first element is 0 \u2192 2, second is 8 \u2192 2, third is 0 \u2192 2, fourth is 0 \u2192 0. This would fit the output [2,2,2,0]. But why?\n\nThis could be a possible pattern: if the input element is 8, it becomes 2. If it's 0, it becomes 2. If it's 4, it becomes 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut let's check this with the first example's first row. The input elements are 8, 8, 0, 0, 4, 0, 5, 5, 0. The output is [2,0,2,0]. If the first two elements are 8 and 8 \u2192 2 and 2, but the output is 2 and 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the first two elements and applying a function, then the next two. For example, the first two elements are 8 and 8, which are transformed to 2 and 0. The next two elements are 0 and 4, which are transformed to 2 and 0. This could be based on the value of the element: 8 \u2192 2, 0 \u2192 2, 4 \u2192 0.\n\nBut why would 8 become 2 and 0 become 2? This is arbitrary.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and write code that for each input row, takes the first two elements and applies a function, then the next two.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, based on the examples, I'll proceed.\n\nSo, for each input row, the output is generated by taking the first two elements and applying some function, then the next two.\n\nBut how to determine the function.\n\nLooking at example 1's first row: first two elements are 8 and 8 \u2192 output is 2 and 0. Maybe the first element is 8 \u2192 2, the second is 8 \u2192 0. This could be based on some rule, like 8 \u2192 2, and 8 \u2192 0. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the first element is 8 \u2192 2, the second is 8 \u2192 0, and the third is 0 \u2192 2, the fourth is 0 \u2192 0.\n\nThis could be a pattern where 8 is transformed to 2, 0 is transformed to 2, and 4 is transformed to 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nBased on this, the code could be:\n\nFor each input row, the output is [2 if element is 8 else 0, 2 if element is 8 else 0, 2 if element is 0 else 0, 0 if element is 4 else 0]. But this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, for each input row, the output is [2 if element is 8 else 0, 2 if element is 8 else 0, 2 if element is 0 else 0, 0 if element is 4 else 0]. But this is not correct.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and write code that for each input row, the output is generated by taking the first two elements and applying a function, and the next two.\n\nBut I'm not sure. However, based on the examples, I'll proceed.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Assuming the output is derived from the first four elements of the input row\n        # This is a guess based on the examples\n        # For each input row, take first four elements and apply some transformation\n        # This is not correct, but it's the best I can do\n        output_row = [2 if x == 8 else 0 for x in row[:4]]\n        transformed.append(output_row)\n    return transformed\n```\n\nBut this is not correct. For example, in the first example's first row, the first four elements are 8,8,0,0. The output would be [2,2,0,0], but the correct output is [2,0,2,0]. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the first, third, fifth, and seventh elements of the input row and applying some function. For example, in the first example's first row, these are 8, 0, 4, 5. The output is [2,0,2,0]. So 8 \u2192 2, 0 \u2192 0, 4 \u2192 2, 5 \u2192 0. This could be based on the value of the element: 8 \u2192 2, 4 \u2192 2, 0 \u2192 0, 5 \u2192 0. But why?\n\nThis could be a pattern where if the element is 8 or 4, it becomes 2, otherwise 0. But this is just a guess.\n\nBased on this, the code could be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        output = []\n        for i in range(0, 9, 2):  # take every other element\n            if row[i] in [8, 4]:\n                output.append(2)\n            else:\n                output.append(0)\n        transformed.append(output)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would generate for the first example's first row: 8, 0, 4, 5 \u2192 2, 0, 2, 0, which matches the output. Let's check.\n\nIn the first example's first row: the first, third, fifth, seventh elements are 8, 0, 4, 5. So the output would be [2, 0, 2, 0], which matches the example.\n\nLet's check example 2's first input row: [0,8,0,0,4,5,0,5,0]. The first, third, fifth, seventh elements are 0, 0, 4, 0. So the output would be [0, 0, 2, 0]. But the correct output is [2,2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, but this is just a guess. It fits the first example but not the others.\n\nBut let's check example 3's first input row: [0,8,0,0,4,0,5,5,0]. The first, third, fifth, seventh elements are 0, 0, 4, 5. So the output would be [0, 0, 2, 0], which matches the example's output of [0, 0, 2, 0]. So this fits.\n\nExample 2's first input row: [0,8,0,0,4,5,0,5,0]. The first, third, fifth, seventh elements are 0, 0, 4, 0. The output would be [0, 0, 2, 0], but the correct output is [2,2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the pattern is different. Maybe it's taking the first, second, fourth, and fifth elements.\n\nFor example, in example 1's first row: first, second, fourth, fifth elements are 8,8,0,4. Output is [2,0,2,0]. This could be 8 \u2192 2, 8 \u2192 0, 0 \u2192 2, 4 \u2192 0.\n\nBut why?\n\nThis is too arbitrary. However, based on the first and third examples, this seems to work. But not the second.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and write code that takes every other element, and applies the rule that if the element is 8 or 4, it becomes 2, otherwise 0.\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples. However, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        output = []\n        for i in range(0, 9, 2):\n            if row[i] in [8, 4]:\n                output.append(2)\n            else:\n                output.append(0)\n        transformed.append(output)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would generate for the first example's first row: [8, 0, 4, 5] \u2192 2, 0, 2, 0. Which matches.\n\nFor example 2's first input row: [0,8,0,0,4,5,0,5,0]. The first, third, fifth, seventh elements are 0, 0, 4, 0. So output would be [0, 0, 2, 0]. But the correct output is [2,2,2,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the pattern is different. Maybe it's taking the first, second, fourth, and fifth elements. For example, in example 1's first row: 8,8,0,4 \u2192 2, 0, 2, 0. This could be based on 8 \u2192 2, 8 \u2192 0, 0 \u2192 2, 4 \u2192 0.\n\nBut why would 8 \u2192 0? It's not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the best I can do is to write code that takes every other element and applies the rule that 8 or 4 becomes 2, others 0. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the final code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        output = []\n        for i in range(0, 9, 2):\n            if row[i] in [8, 4]:\n                output.append(2)\n            else:\n                output.append(0)\n        transformed.append(output)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is not correct for all examples. However, given the time, I'll proceed with this.\n"
