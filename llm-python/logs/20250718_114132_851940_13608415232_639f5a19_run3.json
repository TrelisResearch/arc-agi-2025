There are patterns of 8s in the input that transform into patterns of 6s, 4s, 2s, etc. in the output\n2. The transformation seems to involve some kind of spatial transformation or pattern replacement\n3. The output seems to have a more complex structure with different numbers in different regions\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Replaces certain patterns of 8s with different numbers\n- Applies some kind of spatial transformation or pattern replacement\n- Maintains the 23x23 grid size\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

There are patterns of 8s in the input that transform into patterns of 6s, 4s, 2s, etc. in the output\n2. The transformation seems to involve some kind of spatial transformation or pattern replacement\n3. The output seems to have a more complex structure with different numbers in different regions\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Replaces certain patterns of 8s with different numbers\n- Applies some kind of spatial transformation or pattern replacement\n- Maintains the 23x23 grid size\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
