          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from these examples. The problem is to transform an input grid into an output grid based on some rules. Let me look at the examples and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some numbers, and the output has some changes. For instance, in the first row of input, it's all zeros except for the 8 in the fifth position. The output has the same 8, but then a 2 in the sixth position. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions get filled with 2s? Let me check other rows.\n\nIn the third row of input, the first element is 2, and the output's third row has 2s in the first three positions. Then in the fifth row of input, there's a 7 in the fifth position and a 6 in the tenth. The output has a 7 in the fifth position and a 6 in the tenth, but also a 2 in the sixth position. Hmm, maybe the 2s are appearing in certain positions based on some rule.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has a 3 in the fifth column of the first row. The output has a 3 there but also a 2 in the fifth column of the second row. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions get 2s based on their position or some other factor.\n\nAnother example: Example 3's input is a 6x6 grid. The output has some 2s in certain positions. For instance, the first row of input is 0 0 3 0 0 7, and the output is 0 0 3 2 0 7. So the fourth column in the first row of output is 2. Similarly, in the third row of input, the first element is 2, and the output's third row starts with 2s. Maybe the 2s are being placed in certain positions based on their row or column?\n\nLooking at Example 4: The input has a 2 in the first row, fourth column. The output has a 2 in that position. But also, in the second row of input, the output has 2s in some positions. Maybe the 2s are being added in certain positions based on the original grid's structure.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain cells with 2s based on their position. Let's think about the positions where 2s appear in the outputs.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 2s in positions like (row 2, column 5), (row 3, columns 1-3), etc. Wait, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions that are in certain rows or columns. For example, in the third row of Example 1's output, all the first three columns are 2s. But the original input's third row was 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are in certain rows or columns, perhaps based on some pattern like even or odd rows or columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions that are part of a certain shape. For instance, in Example 3, the output's first row has a 2 in the fourth column. The input's first row was 0 0 3 0 0 7. So maybe the 2 is inserted in the fourth column. But why?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for positions where 2s are added in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the third row has 2s in the first three columns. The original input's third row was 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is 2, or maybe in positions that are part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row is all 2s in the first three columns. But in the input, the first element is 2, and the rest are zeros. Maybe the 2s are being placed in positions that are in certain rows or columns, perhaps based on the original grid's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are in certain rows or columns, such as even rows or columns. Let me check Example 4. The input is a 8x8 grid. The output for the second row is 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3. The original input's second row was 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3. So the output's second row has 2s in the first six positions. Maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is zero, but in certain rows or columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on their position. For example, in the output, certain positions are filled with 2s. Let me look for a pattern in the positions where 2s are added.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 0 \u2192 the sixth column (index 5) is 2.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 3 0 0 2 0 0 7 0 \u2192 sixth column (index 5) is 2.\n\nRow 2: 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 0 0 0 \u2192 first three columns are 2s, sixth column is 2.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 \u2192 sixth column (index 5) is 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 7 2 8 0 0 6 \u2192 sixth column (index 5) is 2.\n\nRow 5: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 \u2192 all columns are 2s.\n\nRow 6: 0 7 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 8 \u2192 sixth column (index 5) is 6, not 2.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 6 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 sixth column is 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 sixth column is 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 \u2192 sixth column is 0.\n\nSo in rows 0,1,2,3,4,5, the sixth column (index 5) is 2. But in rows 6,7,8,9, it's not. Wait, but row 5 is all 2s. Maybe the sixth column (index 5) is being filled with 2s in certain rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added based on the row number. For example, rows where the row index is even or odd. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, rows 0,1,2,3,4,5 (rows 0-5) have 2s in column 5. But rows 6-9 don't. But row 5 is all 2s. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 5 is all 2s. That's the sixth row. Maybe that's a special case.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the second row is 0 0 8 2 2 2 2 2 7 0 0 3. The fourth column (index 3) is 2. But the original input's second row was 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 3. So the fourth column (index 3) is 0 in the input, but becomes 2 in the output. Similarly, in the third row of the output, the first three columns are 2s, and the rest are 2s. Maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the original grid's structure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where 2s are added in the output. For example, in the output of Example 1, the 2s are in positions (row, col) where col is 5, and in some other positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added based on the original grid's value. For example, if the original grid has a 0 in a certain position, then the output has a 2. But that's not the case in all examples. For instance, in Example 1's third row, the original input has 2 in the first column, and the output has 2 in that position. So maybe the 2s are being added where the original value is 0, but only in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even, then certain columns get 2s. Or maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row and column indices are even or odd.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input is a 6x6 grid. The output has 2s in certain positions. For example, the first row of input is 0 0 3 0 0 7, and the output is 0 0 3 2 0 7. So the fourth column (index 3) is 2. The third row of input is 2 0 0 0 3 0, and the output is 2 2 2 2 3 0. So the first three columns are 2s. Maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is 0, but in certain rows or columns.\n\nAnother example: Example 4's input has a 2 in the first row, fourth column. The output has a 2 in that position. But also, in the second row of the output, all columns except the last are 2s. Maybe the 2s are being added based on the row index. For example, if the row is even, then certain columns get 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the row or column index is even. Let's check Example 1. For row 0 (even), the sixth column (index 5) is 2. For row 1 (odd), sixth column is 2. For row 2 (even), columns 0-2 are 2s, and column 5 is 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row and column indices are both even. But in Example 1's row 0, column 5 is 2. That's not even. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row is even, and the column is even, or something like that. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions that are in certain regions of the grid. For example, in Example 1's output, row 5 is all 2s. Maybe that's a special case where the entire row is filled with 2s. But why?\n\nLooking at Example 5's input and output. The input is a 5x6 grid. The output is a 5x6 grid. The input's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's first row is 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the fourth column (index 3) is 2. The second row of input is 2 0 0 0 8 0 \u2192 output is 2 2 2 2 8 0. So the first three columns are 2s. The third row of input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 0 0 0 2 0 0. Fourth column is 2. The fourth row of input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 0 0 0 2 0 0. So in rows 0, 2, 3, 4, the fourth column is 2. But row 1's first three columns are 2s.\n\nHmm, this seems to suggest that for certain rows, certain columns are being filled with 2s. For example, row 1 in Example 5's output has first three columns as 2s. Row 0, 2, 3, 4 have fourth column as 2. Maybe the 2s are being added based on the row's index. Like, for even rows, certain columns are filled with 2s, and for odd rows, others. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row is even and the column is even, or something like that. But in Example 5, row 0 is even, and column 3 is 2 (which is odd). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the output of Example 1. The output for row 5 is all 2s. That's the sixth row. Maybe that's a special case. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the original grid's value is 0, but in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's third row, the original input's first element is 2, and the output's third row has 2s in the first three columns. So maybe the 2s are being added where the original value is 2, but that's not the case in all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1's output, the third row has 2s in the first three columns. The original input's third row is 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So the first element is 2, and the rest are 0. So maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is 2, but that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the row and column indices are such that (row + column) is even. Let's check Example 1's row 0, column 5 (0+5=5, odd). But in the output, it's 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are in certain regions. For example, in Example 1's output, the sixth column (index 5) is filled with 2s in rows 0-4, but not in rows 5-9. But row 5 is all 2s. Maybe that's a special case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added based on the original grid's value. For example, if the original grid has a 0, then the output has a 2. But in Example 1's third row, the first element is 2, and the output has 2 in that position. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the original grid's value is zero, and the row is even. Let's check Example 1's row 0: the sixth column is 0 in the input. So output is 2. Row 1: sixth column is 0 in input, output is 2. Row 2: sixth column is 0 in input, output is 2. Row 3: sixth column is 0 in input, output is 2. Row 4: sixth column is 0 in input, output is 2. Row 5: sixth column is 0 in input, output is 2. But row 5 is all 2s. So maybe that's a pattern.\n\nBut in Example 1's row 2, the original input's sixth column is 0 (the input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 for row 3?), no, wait the input for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 sixth column (index 5) is 0.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 \u2192 sixth column (index 5) is 0.\n\nRow 2: 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 \u2192 sixth column (index 5) is 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 sixth column is 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 7 0 8 0 0 6 \u2192 sixth column is 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 7 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 8 \u2192 sixth column is 6.\n\nWait, in row 5 of input, the sixth column is 6. But in the output, row 5 is all 2s. So that doesn't fit the pattern. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the original value is 0, but in certain rows. For example, in Example 1's row 5, the sixth column is 6, but the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the outputs for each example.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the third row has 2s in the first three columns. The original input's third row is 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So the first element is 2, and the rest are 0. So maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is 2, but that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is 0, and the row is even. For example, in Example 1's row 0 (even), sixth column is 0 \u2192 output is 2. Row 1 (odd), sixth column is 0 \u2192 output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where 2s are added in the output. For example, in Example 1, the sixth column (index 5) is filled with 2s in rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s. Maybe that's a pattern where in certain columns, the 2s are added based on the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the row is even or odd, and the column is even or odd. For example, in row 0 (even), column 5 (odd) is 2. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the row index is less than 5. For example, in Example 1's output, rows 0-4 have 2s in the sixth column, and row 5 is all 2s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1's output, the sixth column (index 5) has 2s in rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s. Maybe that's because in the input, the sixth column has 0s in those rows. But in row 5, the sixth column is 6, but the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added based on the original grid's value. For example, if the original value is 0, then the output is 2. But in Example 1's row 5, the sixth column is 6, but the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in Example 3, the output has 2s in certain positions. Let's look at the input and output for Example 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 3 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8\n0 0 3 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 3 2 0 7\n0 0 0 2 0 0\n2 2 2 2 3 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 8\n0 0 3 2 0 0\n\nLooking at the output, the fourth column (index 3) in the first row is 2. In the second row, the fourth column is 2. In the third row, the fourth column is 2. In the fourth row, the fourth column is 2. In the fifth row, the fourth column is 2. In the sixth row, the fourth column is 2. So all rows have 2 in column 3. But the original input's first row's column 3 is 0, second row's column 3 is 0, third row's column 3 is 0, etc. So perhaps the fourth column (index 3) is being filled with 2s in all rows. But why?\n\nIn Example 3's output, the third row's first three columns are 2s. The original input's third row is 2 0 0 0 3 0. So maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is 2, but that's not the case for the first row's third column (which is 3 in the input, but the output is 3 in that position).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the row is even or odd. For example, in the third row of Example 3, which is row index 2 (even), the first three columns are 2s. But in the first row, which is index 0 (even), the fourth column is 2. So maybe there's a pattern where for even rows, the first three columns are 2s, and for odd rows, the fourth column is 2s. But that's not consistent with all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in Example 3, the fourth column (index 3) is filled with 2s in all rows. So maybe that's a general rule. But why?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to multiple examples. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 2s in the sixth column (index 5) for rows 0-4. In Example 3, the fourth column (index 3) is filled with 2s for all rows. In Example 4, the second row of output is all 2s except the last column. In Example 5, the fourth column (index 3) is 2 for rows 0, 2, 3, 4. In Example 6, the second row of output is 6 2 2 2 2 2, which suggests that certain columns are filled with 2s.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for certain columns, all rows have 2s in those columns. For example, in Example 1, column 5 (sixth column) has 2s in rows 0-4. In Example 3, column 3 (fourth column) has 2s in all rows. In Example 4, column 3 (fourth column) has 2s in rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7? Wait, no. In Example 4's output, the second row is 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3. So columns 0-6 are 2s. But the original input for Example 4's second row was 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3. So the fourth column (index 3) is 0, but in the output it's 2. So maybe the pattern is that certain columns are filled with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the column index is even. But in Example 1, column 5 is odd, and it has 2s. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the column index is 5 for some rows, and 3 for others. This seems too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the sixth column (index 5) is filled with 2s in rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s. But why?\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are part of a certain shape, like a diagonal or a line. For example, in Example 1's output, the sixth column (index 5) is filled with 2s in rows 0-4. That's a vertical line. In Example 3, the fourth column (index 3) is filled with 2s in all rows. Also a vertical line. In Example 4, the second row is all 2s except the last column. That's a horizontal line. So maybe the transformation involves adding 2s in certain lines or shapes based on the input.\n\nBut how to determine which lines to add?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the row and column indices are such that row + column is even. For example, in Example 1's row 0, column 5: 0+5=5, which is odd. But the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the row is even. For example, in Example 1, rows 0, 2, 4, 5 (even rows) have 2s in certain columns. But that's not consistent.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing certain cells with 2s based on their position. For example, in the output, certain cells are 2s. So the pattern is to replace certain cells with 2s, and leave others as they are.\n\nLooking at the outputs, it seems that in some cases, the 2s are added in specific columns for certain rows. For example:\n\n- In Example 1, column 5 (sixth column) has 2s in rows 0-4.\n- In Example 3, column 3 (fourth column) has 2s in all rows.\n- In Example 4, the second row has 2s in columns 0-6.\n- In Example 5, column 3 (fourth column) has 2s in rows 0, 2, 3, 4.\n- In Example 6, the second row has 2s in columns 1-5.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the 2s are being added in certain columns for certain rows. But how to determine which columns and rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the row is less than a certain value. For example, in Example 1, rows 0-4 have 2s in column 5. But why?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the outputs for each example and see if there's a common pattern.\n\nExample 1's output has 2s in column 5 for rows 0-4. Example 3's output has 2s in column 3 for all rows. Example 4's output has 2s in column 3 for all rows. Example 5's output has 2s in column 3 for certain rows. Example 6's output has 2s in columns 1-5 for row 1.\n\nThis suggests that the 2s are being added in certain columns, possibly based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the input's fifth column (index 4) has a 8, and the output's fifth column (index 5) has a 2. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original grid has a certain value. For example, if the original grid has a 0 in a certain position, then the output has a 2.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input's third row has a 2 in the first column, and the output has 2 in that position. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original grid's value is 0, and the row and column indices are such that (row + column) is even or something like that.\n\nThis is really difficult. Given the time constraints, maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for multiple examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output for row 5 is all 2s. Maybe that's a special case. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves adding 2s in certain positions based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 5 is all 2s. Maybe that's because the input's row 5 has a 7 in column 1, 6 in column 5, and 8 in column 9. But that doesn't seem to relate.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are part of a certain shape, like a diagonal. For example, in Example 1, the sixth column (index 5) has 2s in rows 0-4. That's a vertical line. In Example 3, column 3 (fourth column) has 2s in all rows. Also a vertical line. In Example 4, the second row has all 2s except the last column. That's a horizontal line.\n\nSo maybe the transformation involves adding 2s in certain vertical or horizontal lines. But how to determine which lines?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row is even or odd, and the column is even or odd. For example, in Example 1, the sixth column (index 5) is odd, and it's filled with 2s in rows 0-4. But that's not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row is even, and the column is even. But in Example 1, row 0 (even), column 5 (odd) has 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that applies to multiple examples. Let's look for the following:\n\nIn all examples, there are 2s in certain columns for certain rows. For example:\n\n- In Example 1, column 5 has 2s in rows 0-4.\n- In Example 3, column 3 has 2s in all rows.\n- In Example 4, column 3 has 2s in all rows.\n- In Example 5, column 3 has 2s in rows 0, 2, 3, 4.\n- In Example 6, column 1-5 have 2s in row 1.\n\nThis suggests that the 2s are being added in certain columns for certain rows. But how to determine which columns and rows?\n\nMaybe the columns where 2s are added are determined by the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the sixth column (index 5) is filled with 2s. In the input, this column has 0s in rows 0-4 and 6 in row 5. So perhaps the 2s are added in columns where the original grid has 0s in certain rows.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in columns where the original grid has a 0 in that column for all rows. For example, in Example 3, the fourth column (index 3) has 0s in all rows, so 2s are added. But in Example 1, the sixth column (index 5) has 0s in rows 0-4 and 6 in row 5. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in columns where the original grid has a 0 in that column for certain rows. For example, in Example 1, column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4, so 2s are added.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should think of the transformation as adding 2s in certain positions based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even, then certain columns are filled with 2s. Or if the column is even, then certain rows are filled with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row is even and the column is even, or something like that.\n\nBut I need to find a pattern that works for multiple examples.\n\nLet me look at the outputs for all examples:\n\nExample 1: 2s in column 5 for rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s.\n\nExample 2: 2s in column 3 for rows 1-4, and other positions.\n\nExample 3: 2s in column 3 for all rows.\n\nExample 4: 2s in column 3 for all rows, and row 1 has all 2s except last column.\n\nExample 5: 2s in column 3 for rows 0, 2, 3, 4.\n\nExample 6: 2s in columns 1-5 for row 1.\n\nThis suggests that the 2s are added in certain columns based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 3 and 4, column 3 is filled with 2s.\n\nMaybe the 2s are added in column 3 for all rows, and in other columns for other rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in columns that are in the middle of the grid. For example, column 3 (fourth column) is in the middle for a 10x10 grid. But in Example 1, column 5 is sixth column, which is also in the middle.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Given that, I need to find a way to code this. Perhaps the pattern is to add 2s in certain positions based on the row and column indices.\n\nLet's think of the following: For each cell in the output grid, if the cell is in a certain position, set it to 2. Otherwise, keep the original value.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output for row 5 is all 2s. So maybe that's a special case. But how to generalize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row is less than 5, and the column is 5. But that's just for Example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row and column indices are such that (row + column) is even. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the outputs for all examples and see if there's a pattern in the positions where 2s are added.\n\nExample 1: 2s in column 5 for rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s.\n\nExample 2: 2s in column 3 for rows 1-4, and other positions.\n\nExample 3: 2s in column 3 for all rows.\n\nExample 4: 2s in column 3 for all rows, and row 1 has all 2s except last column.\n\nExample 5: 2s in column 3 for rows 0, 2, 3, 4.\n\nExample 6: 2s in columns 1-5 for row 1.\n\nThis suggests that for certain rows, certain columns are filled with 2s. For example, in Example 3, column 3 is filled with 2s for all rows. In Example 4, column 3 is filled with 2s for all rows. In Example 5, column 3 is filled with 2s for certain rows. In Example 6, row 1 has 2s in columns 1-5.\n\nThis is very inconsistent. But perhaps the pattern is that for certain columns, all rows have 2s. For example, in Example 3 and 4, column 3 is filled with 2s for all rows. Maybe the columns where 2s are added are determined by the original grid's structure.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are added in columns where the original grid has 0 in that column for all rows. For example, in Example 3, column 3 has 0 in all rows, so 2s are added. In Example 1, column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4, so 2s are added. But in Example 1, row 5 has 6 in column 5, but the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in columns where the original grid has 0 in that column for certain rows. For example, in Example 1, column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4, so 2s are added.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I'll try to find a pattern that fits some examples and see if I can code it.\n\nLet me think about the following hypothesis: For each cell in the output grid, if the row is less than 5, then the sixth column (index 5) is 2. Also, for row 5, all columns are 2. But this is just for Example 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are added in certain columns based on the row number. For example, for rows 0-4, column 5 is 2. For row 5, all columns are 2. For other rows, maybe other columns.\n\nBut this is too specific to Example 1.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row is even, and the column is even. For example, in Example 1, row 0 is even, column 5 is odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row is even, and the column is 5. For example, in Example 1, rows 0-4 are even (0, 2, 4) and column 5 is 2. But row 1 and 3 are odd, and column 5 is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working. Given that, maybe the pattern is to replace certain positions with 2s based on their row and column indices. For example, in the output, certain cells are 2s based on the row and column indices.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that in the output, the cell (i, j) is 2 if i is even or j is even. But let's check.\n\nIn Example 1, row 0 (even) has 2 in column 5 (odd). So this would fit. Row 1 (odd), column 5 (odd) is 2. So this would fit. Row 2 (even), column 5 (odd) is 2. So this fits. Row 3 (odd), column 5 (odd) is 2. Row 4 (even), column 5 (odd) is 2. Row 5 (odd), column 5 (odd) is 2. So this would fit. But in Example 3, row 0 (even) has 2 in column 3 (odd). So this would fit. Row 1 (odd) has 2 in column 3 (odd). So this would fit. But in Example 3, row 2 (even) has 2 in column 3 (odd). So this fits. But in Example 3, row 2 has 2 in columns 0-2, which would be even columns. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where (i + j) is even. For example, in Example 1, row 0, column 5: 0+5=5 (odd) \u2192 not 2. But in the output, it is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. Given the time, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLet me look at the outputs for all examples and see if there's a common pattern. For example, in all examples, there are 2s in certain columns for certain rows. For example, in Example 1, column 5 for rows 0-4. In Example 3, column 3 for all rows. In Example 4, column 3 for all rows. In Example 5, column 3 for certain rows. In Example 6, row 1 has 2s in columns 1-5.\n\nMaybe the pattern is to add 2s in certain columns for certain rows, and the columns are determined by the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, column 5 is filled with 2s for rows 0-4. In Example 3, column 3 is filled with 2s for all rows. In Example 4, column 3 is filled with 2s for all rows.\n\nSo perhaps the columns where 2s are added are determined by the original grid's structure. For example, in the input, if a column has 0s in all rows, then the output adds 2s in that column.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns where 2s are added are those where the original input has 0 in that column for all rows. For example, in Example 3, column 3 has 0 in all rows. In Example 1, column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4 and 6 in row 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input's column 3 has 0 in all rows, so the output adds 2s there.\n\nIn Example 4, the input's column 3 has 0 in all rows, so the output adds 2s there.\n\nIn Example 1, column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4, so the output adds 2s there.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is: for each column in the input, if all rows have 0 in that column, then in the output, that column is filled with 2s. Otherwise, if some rows have non-zero values, then only certain rows have 2s.\n\nBut this is a hypothesis. Let's test it.\n\nIn Example 1, column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4 and 6 in row 5. So not all rows have 0. So the output has 2s in column 5 for rows 0-4, but not in row 5.\n\nIn Example 3, column 3 has 0 in all rows, so output has 2s in column 3 for all rows.\n\nIn Example 4, column 3 has 0 in all rows, so output has 2s in column 3 for all rows.\n\nIn Example 5, column 3 has 0 in all rows (input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 for rows 0, 2, 3, 4). So output has 2s in column 3 for those rows.\n\nBut in Example 5, row 1 has 2 in column 0-2, and 8 in column 4. So this hypothesis doesn't explain that.\n\nBut maybe the 2s are added in columns where all rows have 0, and also in certain rows where the original value is 0.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Given that, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each column in the input, if all rows have 0 in that column, then in the output, that column is filled with 2s. Otherwise, for rows where the original value is 0, add 2.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's try to code this. For each column in the input, check if all rows have 0. If so, set all cells in that column to 2. Otherwise, for each row, if the original value is 0, set to 2.\n\nBut this would explain some examples.\n\nIn Example 1, column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4 and 6 in row 5. So not all rows have 0. So for rows 0-4, set to 2. For row 5, original value is 6, so not set to 2. But in the output, row 5 is all 2s. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nBut in the output, row 5 is all 2s. So this suggests that there's another rule.\n\nMaybe the 2s are added in all rows for certain columns, regardless of the original value.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each column, if all rows have 0, then set to 2. Otherwise, for each row, if the original value is 0, set to 2. This would explain some examples.\n\nBut this might not work for all, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- For each column in the input grid:\n   - Check if all rows in that column are 0.\n   - If yes, set all cells in that column to 2.\n   - Else, for each row, if the cell is 0, set to 2.\n\nBut this would not explain the example where row 5 is all 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another rule: for each row, if the row is even, set certain columns to 2.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the original value is 0, and the column is in a certain range.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nFor each cell in the output grid, if the original value is 0, set to 2. Otherwise, keep the original value.\n\nBut this would not explain the examples where the original value is 2, but the output has 2. For example, in Example 1, the third row's first cell is 2, and the output is 2. So this would work. But in Example 3, the third row's first cell is 2, and the output is 2. So this would work. But in Example 1's row 5, the sixth column is 6, but the output is 2. So this would not work.\n\nSo this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: The 2s are added in positions where the original value is 0, and the row is less than 5. But this is just for Example 1.\n\nThis is not a general solution.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples I can see.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the sixth column (index 5) has 2s in rows 0-4. So maybe for rows 0-4, column 5 is set to 2. For row 5, all columns are set to 2.\n\nIn Example 3, column 3 is set to 2 for all rows.\n\nIn Example 4, column 3 is set to 2 for all rows.\n\nIn Example 5, column 3 is set to 2 for rows 0, 2, 3, 4.\n\nIn Example 6, row 1 has 2s in columns 1-5.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for certain columns, all rows are set to 2. For example, column 3 in Examples 3, 4, and 5.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nMaybe the columns are determined by the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 3, the input has 0 in column 3 for all rows, so the output sets it to 2.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 0 in column 5 for rows 0-4, so the output sets it to 2.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has 0 in column 3 for all rows, so the output sets it to 2.\n\nSo the hypothesis is: for each column in the input, if all rows in that column have 0, then in the output, that column is filled with 2s. Otherwise, for rows where the original value is 0, set to 2.\n\nBut this would explain some examples.\n\nLet's code this:\n\nFor each column in the input grid:\n   if all cells in that column are 0:\n       set all cells in that column to 2\n   else:\n       for each row in the grid:\n           if the cell is 0:\n               set to 2\n\nBut this would not explain the case where a column has some 0s and some non-zero, but the output has 2s in certain rows.\n\nBut let's test this hypothesis on the examples.\n\nExample 1: column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4 and 6 in row 5. So not all 0. So for rows 0-4, set to 2. For row 5, original value is 6, so not set. But in the output, row 5 is all 2s. So this would not explain that.\n\nBut in the output, row 5 is all 2s. So this suggests that there's another rule.\n\nMaybe the row 5 is a special case where all cells are set to 2.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in all cells where the original value is 0, and also in certain rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that sets 2s in columns where all rows are 0, and also sets 2s in cells where the original value is 0. This would handle some examples, but not all.\n\nBut let's write the code.\n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Check for columns where all values are 0\n    for col in range(10):\n        all_zero = True\n        for row in range(10):\n            if transformed[row][col] != 0:\n                all_zero = False\n                break\n        if all_zero:\n            for row in range(10):\n                transformed[row][col] = 2\n    # Now, for cells that are 0, set to 2\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            if transformed[row][col] == 0:\n                transformed[row][col] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, this would set 2s in columns where all are 0, and then set 2s in all 0 cells. But this would overwrite the columns where all are 0, because after setting the columns to 2, the cells are already 2, so the second loop would not change them. So this code would set 2s in columns where all are 0, and also set 2s in any 0 cells that are not in those columns.\n\nBut this would not explain the example where row 5 is all 2s. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4 and 6 in row 5. So the first loop would not set it to 2. Then, the second loop would set 0 cells to 2. In rows 0-4, column 5 is 0, so it would be set to 2. Row 5's column 5 is 6, so it remains 6. But in the output, row 5 is all 2s. So this code would not explain that.\n\nBut in the output, row 5 is all 2s, so this code would not produce that. Hence, this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code and see if it passes some examples.\n\nBut this code would not pass Example 1's output. So this is not the correct pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 2s are added in all cells where the original value is 0, and also in certain rows. For example, for rows 0-4, column 5 is 2.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a guess. Maybe the 2s are added in all cells where the original value is 0, and also in certain columns for certain rows.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that sets all 0 cells to 2, and see if that passes some examples.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 2s in column 5 for rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s. So this code would set row 5's cells to 2 if they are 0. But in the input, row 5 has 0 7 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 8. So the cells are 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8. So the 0 cells are in columns 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8. So the code would set these to 2. But in the output, row 5 is all 2s. So this would not be the case, because the original input's row 5 has 7, 6, 8 in certain columns. So the code would set the 0 cells to 2, but not the non-zero cells. So the output row 5 would have 2, 7, 2, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 8. But the output for row 5 is all 2s. So this code would not produce that.\n\nSo this suggests that the pattern is more complex.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples I can see. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s in column 5 for rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s. So perhaps the code should set column 5 to 2 for rows 0-4, and set all cells in row 5 to 2.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nMaybe the code should set certain columns to 2 for certain rows, and also set certain rows to 2.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell, if the row is less than 5, set column 5 to 2. For row 5, set all cells to 2. This would handle Example 1. But this is not general.\n\nBut this is not a general solution, but it's the best I can do given the time.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            if row < 5 and col == 5:\n                transformed[row][col] = 2\n            elif row == 5:\n                transformed[row][col] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not handle other examples. For example, in Example 3, the output has 2s in column 3 for all rows. So this code would not handle that.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code, even though it's not correct for all examples. But the user said to write a function that implements the best understanding, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBut this is not the correct approach. I need to find a better way.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output for row 5 is all 2s. In Example 3, the output for row 2 is 2 2 2 2 3 0. So the first three columns are 2s. This suggests that for certain rows, the first few columns are 2s.\n\nMaybe the pattern is to add 2s in the first few columns for certain rows, and in certain columns for other rows.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a guess that the 2s are added in certain columns for certain rows, and the code is to set 2s in certain positions based on the row and column indices.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following code, which sets 2s in column 5 for rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s, and for other examples, it sets 2s in column 3 for all rows.\n\nBut this is not general.\n\nAlternatively, the code could set 2s in column 3 for all rows, and column 5 for rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s. But this is not general.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code, which sets 2s in column 3 for all rows, and column 5 for rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s. This would handle some examples, but not all.\n\nBut this is not a general solution.\n\nAlternatively, the code could set 2s in all cells where the row is even or the column is even.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that sets 2s in all cells where the original value is 0, and also sets 2s in certain columns for certain rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nFinally, given the examples, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell, if the original value is 0, set to 2. This would handle some examples, but not all. But it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code is:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            if transformed[row][col] == 0:\n                transformed[row][col] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not handle Example 1's output where row 5 is all 2s. Because in the input, row 5 has some non-zero values, so the code would not set them to 2. But in the output, they are 2s. So this code is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is to set all cells to 2, but this is not the case in the examples.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this code, even though it's not correct, but it's the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from these examples. The problem is to transform an input grid into an output grid based on some rules. Let me look at the examples and see what's going on.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some numbers, and the output has some changes. For instance, in the first row of input, it's all zeros except for the 8 in the fifth position. The output has the same 8, but then a 2 in the sixth position. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions get filled with 2s? Let me check other rows.\n\nIn the third row of input, the first element is 2, and the output's third row has 2s in the first three positions. Then in the fifth row of input, there's a 7 in the fifth position and a 6 in the tenth. The output has a 7 in the fifth position and a 6 in the tenth, but also a 2 in the sixth position. Hmm, maybe the 2s are appearing in certain positions based on some rule.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has a 3 in the fifth column of the first row. The output has a 3 there but also a 2 in the fifth column of the second row. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions get 2s based on their position or some other factor.\n\nAnother example: Example 3's input is a 6x6 grid. The output has some 2s in certain positions. For instance, the first row of input is 0 0 3 0 0 7, and the output is 0 0 3 2 0 7. So the fourth column in the first row of output is 2. Similarly, in the third row of input, the first element is 2, and the output's third row starts with 2s. Maybe the 2s are being placed in certain positions based on their row or column?\n\nLooking at Example 4: The input has a 2 in the first row, fourth column. The output has a 2 in that position. But also, in the second row of input, the output has 2s in some positions. Maybe the 2s are being added in certain positions based on the original grid's structure.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain cells with 2s based on their position. Let's think about the positions where 2s appear in the outputs.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 2s in positions like (row 2, column 5), (row 3, columns 1-3), etc. Wait, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions that are in certain rows or columns. For example, in the third row of Example 1's output, all the first three columns are 2s. But the original input's third row was 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are in certain rows or columns, perhaps based on some pattern like even or odd rows or columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being placed in positions that are part of a certain shape. For instance, in Example 3, the output's first row has a 2 in the fourth column. The input's first row was 0 0 3 0 0 7. So maybe the 2 is inserted in the fourth column. But why?\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for positions where 2s are added in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the third row has 2s in the first three columns. The original input's third row was 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is 2, or maybe in positions that are part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the output's third row is all 2s in the first three columns. But in the input, the first element is 2, and the rest are zeros. Maybe the 2s are being placed in positions that are in certain rows or columns, perhaps based on the original grid's structure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are in certain rows or columns, such as even rows or columns. Let me check Example 4. The input is a 8x8 grid. The output for the second row is 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3. The original input's second row was 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3. So the output's second row has 2s in the first six positions. Maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is zero, but in certain rows or columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on their position. For example, in the output, certain positions are filled with 2s. Let me look for a pattern in the positions where 2s are added.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 0 \u2192 the sixth column (index 5) is 2.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 3 0 0 2 0 0 7 0 \u2192 sixth column (index 5) is 2.\n\nRow 2: 2 2 2 2 2 2 3 0 0 0 \u2192 first three columns are 2s, sixth column is 2.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 \u2192 sixth column (index 5) is 2.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 7 2 8 0 0 6 \u2192 sixth column (index 5) is 2.\n\nRow 5: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 \u2192 all columns are 2s.\n\nRow 6: 0 7 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 8 \u2192 sixth column (index 5) is 6, not 2.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 6 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 sixth column is 0.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 sixth column is 0.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 \u2192 sixth column is 0.\n\nSo in rows 0,1,2,3,4,5, the sixth column (index 5) is 2. But in rows 6,7,8,9, it's not. Wait, but row 5 is all 2s. Maybe the sixth column (index 5) is being filled with 2s in certain rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added based on the row number. For example, rows where the row index is even or odd. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, rows 0,1,2,3,4,5 (rows 0-5) have 2s in column 5. But rows 6-9 don't. But row 5 is all 2s. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 5 is all 2s. That's the sixth row. Maybe that's a special case.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the second row is 0 0 8 2 2 2 2 2 7 0 0 3. The fourth column (index 3) is 2. But the original input's second row was 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 3. So the fourth column (index 3) is 0 in the input, but becomes 2 in the output. Similarly, in the third row of the output, the first three columns are 2s, and the rest are 2s. Maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are part of a certain pattern based on the original grid's structure.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where 2s are added in the output. For example, in the output of Example 1, the 2s are in positions (row, col) where col is 5, and in some other positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added based on the original grid's value. For example, if the original grid has a 0 in a certain position, then the output has a 2. But that's not the case in all examples. For instance, in Example 1's third row, the original input has 2 in the first column, and the output has 2 in that position. So maybe the 2s are being added where the original value is 0, but only in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even, then certain columns get 2s. Or maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row and column indices are even or odd.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input is a 6x6 grid. The output has 2s in certain positions. For example, the first row of input is 0 0 3 0 0 7, and the output is 0 0 3 2 0 7. So the fourth column (index 3) is 2. The third row of input is 2 0 0 0 3 0, and the output is 2 2 2 2 3 0. So the first three columns are 2s. Maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is 0, but in certain rows or columns.\n\nAnother example: Example 4's input has a 2 in the first row, fourth column. The output has a 2 in that position. But also, in the second row of the output, all columns except the last are 2s. Maybe the 2s are being added based on the row index. For example, if the row is even, then certain columns get 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the row or column index is even. Let's check Example 1. For row 0 (even), the sixth column (index 5) is 2. For row 1 (odd), sixth column is 2. For row 2 (even), columns 0-2 are 2s, and column 5 is 2. Hmm, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row and column indices are both even. But in Example 1's row 0, column 5 is 2. That's not even. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row is even, and the column is even, or something like that. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions that are in certain regions of the grid. For example, in Example 1's output, row 5 is all 2s. Maybe that's a special case where the entire row is filled with 2s. But why?\n\nLooking at Example 5's input and output. The input is a 5x6 grid. The output is a 5x6 grid. The input's first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's first row is 0 0 0 2 0 0. So the fourth column (index 3) is 2. The second row of input is 2 0 0 0 8 0 \u2192 output is 2 2 2 2 8 0. So the first three columns are 2s. The third row of input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 0 0 0 2 0 0. Fourth column is 2. The fourth row of input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 0 0 0 2 0 0. So in rows 0, 2, 3, 4, the fourth column is 2. But row 1's first three columns are 2s.\n\nHmm, this seems to suggest that for certain rows, certain columns are being filled with 2s. For example, row 1 in Example 5's output has first three columns as 2s. Row 0, 2, 3, 4 have fourth column as 2. Maybe the 2s are being added based on the row's index. Like, for even rows, certain columns are filled with 2s, and for odd rows, others. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row is even and the column is even, or something like that. But in Example 5, row 0 is even, and column 3 is 2 (which is odd). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the output of Example 1. The output for row 5 is all 2s. That's the sixth row. Maybe that's a special case. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the original grid's value is 0, but in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's third row, the original input's first element is 2, and the output's third row has 2s in the first three columns. So maybe the 2s are being added where the original value is 2, but that's not the case in all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1's output, the third row has 2s in the first three columns. The original input's third row is 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So the first element is 2, and the rest are 0. So maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is 2, but that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the row and column indices are such that (row + column) is even. Let's check Example 1's row 0, column 5 (0+5=5, odd). But in the output, it's 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are in certain regions. For example, in Example 1's output, the sixth column (index 5) is filled with 2s in rows 0-4, but not in rows 5-9. But row 5 is all 2s. Maybe that's a special case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added based on the original grid's value. For example, if the original grid has a 0, then the output has a 2. But in Example 1's third row, the first element is 2, and the output has 2 in that position. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the original grid's value is zero, and the row is even. Let's check Example 1's row 0: the sixth column is 0 in the input. So output is 2. Row 1: sixth column is 0 in input, output is 2. Row 2: sixth column is 0 in input, output is 2. Row 3: sixth column is 0 in input, output is 2. Row 4: sixth column is 0 in input, output is 2. Row 5: sixth column is 0 in input, output is 2. But row 5 is all 2s. So maybe that's a pattern.\n\nBut in Example 1's row 2, the original input's sixth column is 0 (the input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 for row 3?), no, wait the input for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 sixth column (index 5) is 0.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 \u2192 sixth column (index 5) is 0.\n\nRow 2: 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 \u2192 sixth column (index 5) is 0.\n\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 sixth column is 0.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 7 0 8 0 0 6 \u2192 sixth column is 0.\n\nRow 5: 0 7 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 8 \u2192 sixth column is 6.\n\nWait, in row 5 of input, the sixth column is 6. But in the output, row 5 is all 2s. So that doesn't fit the pattern. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the original value is 0, but in certain rows. For example, in Example 1's row 5, the sixth column is 6, but the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the outputs for each example.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the third row has 2s in the first three columns. The original input's third row is 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. So the first element is 2, and the rest are 0. So maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is 2, but that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is 0, and the row is even. For example, in Example 1's row 0 (even), sixth column is 0 \u2192 output is 2. Row 1 (odd), sixth column is 0 \u2192 output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look for the positions where 2s are added in the output. For example, in Example 1, the sixth column (index 5) is filled with 2s in rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s. Maybe that's a pattern where in certain columns, the 2s are added based on the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the row is even or odd, and the column is even or odd. For example, in row 0 (even), column 5 (odd) is 2. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the row index is less than 5. For example, in Example 1's output, rows 0-4 have 2s in the sixth column, and row 5 is all 2s. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with 2s based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1's output, the sixth column (index 5) has 2s in rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s. Maybe that's because in the input, the sixth column has 0s in those rows. But in row 5, the sixth column is 6, but the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added based on the original grid's value. For example, if the original value is 0, then the output is 2. But in Example 1's row 5, the sixth column is 6, but the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in Example 3, the output has 2s in certain positions. Let's look at the input and output for Example 3:\n\nInput:\n0 0 3 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 3 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 8\n0 0 3 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 3 2 0 7\n0 0 0 2 0 0\n2 2 2 2 3 0\n0 0 0 2 0 0\n0 0 0 2 0 8\n0 0 3 2 0 0\n\nLooking at the output, the fourth column (index 3) in the first row is 2. In the second row, the fourth column is 2. In the third row, the fourth column is 2. In the fourth row, the fourth column is 2. In the fifth row, the fourth column is 2. In the sixth row, the fourth column is 2. So all rows have 2 in column 3. But the original input's first row's column 3 is 0, second row's column 3 is 0, third row's column 3 is 0, etc. So perhaps the fourth column (index 3) is being filled with 2s in all rows. But why?\n\nIn Example 3's output, the third row's first three columns are 2s. The original input's third row is 2 0 0 0 3 0. So maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original value is 2, but that's not the case for the first row's third column (which is 3 in the input, but the output is 3 in that position).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the row is even or odd. For example, in the third row of Example 3, which is row index 2 (even), the first three columns are 2s. But in the first row, which is index 0 (even), the fourth column is 2. So maybe there's a pattern where for even rows, the first three columns are 2s, and for odd rows, the fourth column is 2s. But that's not consistent with all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in Example 3, the fourth column (index 3) is filled with 2s in all rows. So maybe that's a general rule. But why?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to multiple examples. Let's see:\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 2s in the sixth column (index 5) for rows 0-4. In Example 3, the fourth column (index 3) is filled with 2s for all rows. In Example 4, the second row of output is all 2s except the last column. In Example 5, the fourth column (index 3) is 2 for rows 0, 2, 3, 4. In Example 6, the second row of output is 6 2 2 2 2 2, which suggests that certain columns are filled with 2s.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for certain columns, all rows have 2s in those columns. For example, in Example 1, column 5 (sixth column) has 2s in rows 0-4. In Example 3, column 3 (fourth column) has 2s in all rows. In Example 4, column 3 (fourth column) has 2s in rows 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7? Wait, no. In Example 4's output, the second row is 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 3. So columns 0-6 are 2s. But the original input for Example 4's second row was 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3. So the fourth column (index 3) is 0, but in the output it's 2. So maybe the pattern is that certain columns are filled with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the column index is even. But in Example 1, column 5 is odd, and it has 2s. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the column index is 5 for some rows, and 3 for others. This seems too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the sixth column (index 5) is filled with 2s in rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s. But why?\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are part of a certain shape, like a diagonal or a line. For example, in Example 1's output, the sixth column (index 5) is filled with 2s in rows 0-4. That's a vertical line. In Example 3, the fourth column (index 3) is filled with 2s in all rows. Also a vertical line. In Example 4, the second row is all 2s except the last column. That's a horizontal line. So maybe the transformation involves adding 2s in certain lines or shapes based on the input.\n\nBut how to determine which lines to add?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the row and column indices are such that row + column is even. For example, in Example 1's row 0, column 5: 0+5=5, which is odd. But the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the row is even. For example, in Example 1, rows 0, 2, 4, 5 (even rows) have 2s in certain columns. But that's not consistent.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing certain cells with 2s based on their position. For example, in the output, certain cells are 2s. So the pattern is to replace certain cells with 2s, and leave others as they are.\n\nLooking at the outputs, it seems that in some cases, the 2s are added in specific columns for certain rows. For example:\n\n- In Example 1, column 5 (sixth column) has 2s in rows 0-4.\n- In Example 3, column 3 (fourth column) has 2s in all rows.\n- In Example 4, the second row has 2s in columns 0-6.\n- In Example 5, column 3 (fourth column) has 2s in rows 0, 2, 3, 4.\n- In Example 6, the second row has 2s in columns 1-5.\n\nThis seems to suggest that the 2s are being added in certain columns for certain rows. But how to determine which columns and rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the row is less than a certain value. For example, in Example 1, rows 0-4 have 2s in column 5. But why?\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the outputs for each example and see if there's a common pattern.\n\nExample 1's output has 2s in column 5 for rows 0-4. Example 3's output has 2s in column 3 for all rows. Example 4's output has 2s in column 3 for all rows. Example 5's output has 2s in column 3 for certain rows. Example 6's output has 2s in columns 1-5 for row 1.\n\nThis suggests that the 2s are being added in certain columns, possibly based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the input's fifth column (index 4) has a 8, and the output's fifth column (index 5) has a 2. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original grid has a certain value. For example, if the original grid has a 0 in a certain position, then the output has a 2.\n\nBut in Example 1, the input's third row has a 2 in the first column, and the output has 2 in that position. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are being added in positions where the original grid's value is 0, and the row and column indices are such that (row + column) is even or something like that.\n\nThis is really difficult. Given the time constraints, maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for multiple examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output for row 5 is all 2s. Maybe that's a special case. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves adding 2s in certain positions based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the output for row 5 is all 2s. Maybe that's because the input's row 5 has a 7 in column 1, 6 in column 5, and 8 in column 9. But that doesn't seem to relate.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 2s are being added in positions that are part of a certain shape, like a diagonal. For example, in Example 1, the sixth column (index 5) has 2s in rows 0-4. That's a vertical line. In Example 3, column 3 (fourth column) has 2s in all rows. Also a vertical line. In Example 4, the second row has all 2s except the last column. That's a horizontal line.\n\nSo maybe the transformation involves adding 2s in certain vertical or horizontal lines. But how to determine which lines?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row is even or odd, and the column is even or odd. For example, in Example 1, the sixth column (index 5) is odd, and it's filled with 2s in rows 0-4. But that's not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row is even, and the column is even. But in Example 1, row 0 (even), column 5 (odd) has 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that applies to multiple examples. Let's look for the following:\n\nIn all examples, there are 2s in certain columns for certain rows. For example:\n\n- In Example 1, column 5 has 2s in rows 0-4.\n- In Example 3, column 3 has 2s in all rows.\n- In Example 4, column 3 has 2s in all rows.\n- In Example 5, column 3 has 2s in rows 0, 2, 3, 4.\n- In Example 6, column 1-5 have 2s in row 1.\n\nThis suggests that the 2s are being added in certain columns for certain rows. But how to determine which columns and rows?\n\nMaybe the columns where 2s are added are determined by the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, the sixth column (index 5) is filled with 2s. In the input, this column has 0s in rows 0-4 and 6 in row 5. So perhaps the 2s are added in columns where the original grid has 0s in certain rows.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in columns where the original grid has a 0 in that column for all rows. For example, in Example 3, the fourth column (index 3) has 0s in all rows, so 2s are added. But in Example 1, the sixth column (index 5) has 0s in rows 0-4 and 6 in row 5. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in columns where the original grid has a 0 in that column for certain rows. For example, in Example 1, column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4, so 2s are added.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nThis is getting me nowhere. Maybe I should think of the transformation as adding 2s in certain positions based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even, then certain columns are filled with 2s. Or if the column is even, then certain rows are filled with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row is even and the column is even, or something like that.\n\nBut I need to find a pattern that works for multiple examples.\n\nLet me look at the outputs for all examples:\n\nExample 1: 2s in column 5 for rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s.\n\nExample 2: 2s in column 3 for rows 1-4, and other positions.\n\nExample 3: 2s in column 3 for all rows.\n\nExample 4: 2s in column 3 for all rows, and row 1 has all 2s except last column.\n\nExample 5: 2s in column 3 for rows 0, 2, 3, 4.\n\nExample 6: 2s in columns 1-5 for row 1.\n\nThis suggests that the 2s are added in certain columns based on the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 3 and 4, column 3 is filled with 2s.\n\nMaybe the 2s are added in column 3 for all rows, and in other columns for other rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in columns that are in the middle of the grid. For example, column 3 (fourth column) is in the middle for a 10x10 grid. But in Example 1, column 5 is sixth column, which is also in the middle.\n\nThis is getting too speculative. Given that, I need to find a way to code this. Perhaps the pattern is to add 2s in certain positions based on the row and column indices.\n\nLet's think of the following: For each cell in the output grid, if the cell is in a certain position, set it to 2. Otherwise, keep the original value.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output for row 5 is all 2s. So maybe that's a special case. But how to generalize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row is less than 5, and the column is 5. But that's just for Example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row and column indices are such that (row + column) is even. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the outputs for all examples and see if there's a pattern in the positions where 2s are added.\n\nExample 1: 2s in column 5 for rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s.\n\nExample 2: 2s in column 3 for rows 1-4, and other positions.\n\nExample 3: 2s in column 3 for all rows.\n\nExample 4: 2s in column 3 for all rows, and row 1 has all 2s except last column.\n\nExample 5: 2s in column 3 for rows 0, 2, 3, 4.\n\nExample 6: 2s in columns 1-5 for row 1.\n\nThis suggests that for certain rows, certain columns are filled with 2s. For example, in Example 3, column 3 is filled with 2s for all rows. In Example 4, column 3 is filled with 2s for all rows. In Example 5, column 3 is filled with 2s for certain rows. In Example 6, row 1 has 2s in columns 1-5.\n\nThis is very inconsistent. But perhaps the pattern is that for certain columns, all rows have 2s. For example, in Example 3 and 4, column 3 is filled with 2s for all rows. Maybe the columns where 2s are added are determined by the original grid's structure.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are added in columns where the original grid has 0 in that column for all rows. For example, in Example 3, column 3 has 0 in all rows, so 2s are added. In Example 1, column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4, so 2s are added. But in Example 1, row 5 has 6 in column 5, but the output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in columns where the original grid has 0 in that column for certain rows. For example, in Example 1, column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4, so 2s are added.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time constraints, I'll try to find a pattern that fits some examples and see if I can code it.\n\nLet me think about the following hypothesis: For each cell in the output grid, if the row is less than 5, then the sixth column (index 5) is 2. Also, for row 5, all columns are 2. But this is just for Example 1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are added in certain columns based on the row number. For example, for rows 0-4, column 5 is 2. For row 5, all columns are 2. For other rows, maybe other columns.\n\nBut this is too specific to Example 1.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row is even, and the column is even. For example, in Example 1, row 0 is even, column 5 is odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the row is even, and the column is 5. For example, in Example 1, rows 0-4 are even (0, 2, 4) and column 5 is 2. But row 1 and 3 are odd, and column 5 is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is not working. Given that, maybe the pattern is to replace certain positions with 2s based on their row and column indices. For example, in the output, certain cells are 2s based on the row and column indices.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the pattern is that in the output, the cell (i, j) is 2 if i is even or j is even. But let's check.\n\nIn Example 1, row 0 (even) has 2 in column 5 (odd). So this would fit. Row 1 (odd), column 5 (odd) is 2. So this would fit. Row 2 (even), column 5 (odd) is 2. So this fits. Row 3 (odd), column 5 (odd) is 2. Row 4 (even), column 5 (odd) is 2. Row 5 (odd), column 5 (odd) is 2. So this would fit. But in Example 3, row 0 (even) has 2 in column 3 (odd). So this would fit. Row 1 (odd) has 2 in column 3 (odd). So this would fit. But in Example 3, row 2 (even) has 2 in column 3 (odd). So this fits. But in Example 3, row 2 has 2 in columns 0-2, which would be even columns. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where (i + j) is even. For example, in Example 1, row 0, column 5: 0+5=5 (odd) \u2192 not 2. But in the output, it is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really tough. Given the time, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLet me look at the outputs for all examples and see if there's a common pattern. For example, in all examples, there are 2s in certain columns for certain rows. For example, in Example 1, column 5 for rows 0-4. In Example 3, column 3 for all rows. In Example 4, column 3 for all rows. In Example 5, column 3 for certain rows. In Example 6, row 1 has 2s in columns 1-5.\n\nMaybe the pattern is to add 2s in certain columns for certain rows, and the columns are determined by the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 1, column 5 is filled with 2s for rows 0-4. In Example 3, column 3 is filled with 2s for all rows. In Example 4, column 3 is filled with 2s for all rows.\n\nSo perhaps the columns where 2s are added are determined by the original grid's structure. For example, in the input, if a column has 0s in all rows, then the output adds 2s in that column.\n\nBut how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the columns where 2s are added are those where the original input has 0 in that column for all rows. For example, in Example 3, column 3 has 0 in all rows. In Example 1, column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4 and 6 in row 5. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in Example 3, the input's column 3 has 0 in all rows, so the output adds 2s there.\n\nIn Example 4, the input's column 3 has 0 in all rows, so the output adds 2s there.\n\nIn Example 1, column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4, so the output adds 2s there.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is: for each column in the input, if all rows have 0 in that column, then in the output, that column is filled with 2s. Otherwise, if some rows have non-zero values, then only certain rows have 2s.\n\nBut this is a hypothesis. Let's test it.\n\nIn Example 1, column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4 and 6 in row 5. So not all rows have 0. So the output has 2s in column 5 for rows 0-4, but not in row 5.\n\nIn Example 3, column 3 has 0 in all rows, so output has 2s in column 3 for all rows.\n\nIn Example 4, column 3 has 0 in all rows, so output has 2s in column 3 for all rows.\n\nIn Example 5, column 3 has 0 in all rows (input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 for rows 0, 2, 3, 4). So output has 2s in column 3 for those rows.\n\nBut in Example 5, row 1 has 2 in column 0-2, and 8 in column 4. So this hypothesis doesn't explain that.\n\nBut maybe the 2s are added in columns where all rows have 0, and also in certain rows where the original value is 0.\n\nThis is getting too complex. Given that, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each column in the input, if all rows have 0 in that column, then in the output, that column is filled with 2s. Otherwise, for rows where the original value is 0, add 2.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet's try to code this. For each column in the input, check if all rows have 0. If so, set all cells in that column to 2. Otherwise, for each row, if the original value is 0, set to 2.\n\nBut this would explain some examples.\n\nIn Example 1, column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4 and 6 in row 5. So not all rows have 0. So for rows 0-4, set to 2. For row 5, original value is 6, so not set to 2. But in the output, row 5 is all 2s. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nBut in the output, row 5 is all 2s. So this suggests that there's another rule.\n\nMaybe the 2s are added in all rows for certain columns, regardless of the original value.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each column, if all rows have 0, then set to 2. Otherwise, for each row, if the original value is 0, set to 2. This would explain some examples.\n\nBut this might not work for all, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- For each column in the input grid:\n   - Check if all rows in that column are 0.\n   - If yes, set all cells in that column to 2.\n   - Else, for each row, if the cell is 0, set to 2.\n\nBut this would not explain the example where row 5 is all 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's another rule: for each row, if the row is even, set certain columns to 2.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in positions where the original value is 0, and the column is in a certain range.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\nFor each cell in the output grid, if the original value is 0, set to 2. Otherwise, keep the original value.\n\nBut this would not explain the examples where the original value is 2, but the output has 2. For example, in Example 1, the third row's first cell is 2, and the output is 2. So this would work. But in Example 3, the third row's first cell is 2, and the output is 2. So this would work. But in Example 1's row 5, the sixth column is 6, but the output is 2. So this would not work.\n\nSo this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: The 2s are added in positions where the original value is 0, and the row is less than 5. But this is just for Example 1.\n\nThis is not a general solution.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples I can see.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the sixth column (index 5) has 2s in rows 0-4. So maybe for rows 0-4, column 5 is set to 2. For row 5, all columns are set to 2.\n\nIn Example 3, column 3 is set to 2 for all rows.\n\nIn Example 4, column 3 is set to 2 for all rows.\n\nIn Example 5, column 3 is set to 2 for rows 0, 2, 3, 4.\n\nIn Example 6, row 1 has 2s in columns 1-5.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that for certain columns, all rows are set to 2. For example, column 3 in Examples 3, 4, and 5.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nMaybe the columns are determined by the original grid's structure. For example, in Example 3, the input has 0 in column 3 for all rows, so the output sets it to 2.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 0 in column 5 for rows 0-4, so the output sets it to 2.\n\nIn Example 4, the input has 0 in column 3 for all rows, so the output sets it to 2.\n\nSo the hypothesis is: for each column in the input, if all rows in that column have 0, then in the output, that column is filled with 2s. Otherwise, for rows where the original value is 0, set to 2.\n\nBut this would explain some examples.\n\nLet's code this:\n\nFor each column in the input grid:\n   if all cells in that column are 0:\n       set all cells in that column to 2\n   else:\n       for each row in the grid:\n           if the cell is 0:\n               set to 2\n\nBut this would not explain the case where a column has some 0s and some non-zero, but the output has 2s in certain rows.\n\nBut let's test this hypothesis on the examples.\n\nExample 1: column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4 and 6 in row 5. So not all 0. So for rows 0-4, set to 2. For row 5, original value is 6, so not set. But in the output, row 5 is all 2s. So this would not explain that.\n\nBut in the output, row 5 is all 2s. So this suggests that there's another rule.\n\nMaybe the row 5 is a special case where all cells are set to 2.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are added in all cells where the original value is 0, and also in certain rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that sets 2s in columns where all rows are 0, and also sets 2s in cells where the original value is 0. This would handle some examples, but not all.\n\nBut let's write the code.\n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    # Check for columns where all values are 0\n    for col in range(10):\n        all_zero = True\n        for row in range(10):\n            if transformed[row][col] != 0:\n                all_zero = False\n                break\n        if all_zero:\n            for row in range(10):\n                transformed[row][col] = 2\n    # Now, for cells that are 0, set to 2\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            if transformed[row][col] == 0:\n                transformed[row][col] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, this would set 2s in columns where all are 0, and then set 2s in all 0 cells. But this would overwrite the columns where all are 0, because after setting the columns to 2, the cells are already 2, so the second loop would not change them. So this code would set 2s in columns where all are 0, and also set 2s in any 0 cells that are not in those columns.\n\nBut this would not explain the example where row 5 is all 2s. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1, column 5 has 0 in rows 0-4 and 6 in row 5. So the first loop would not set it to 2. Then, the second loop would set 0 cells to 2. In rows 0-4, column 5 is 0, so it would be set to 2. Row 5's column 5 is 6, so it remains 6. But in the output, row 5 is all 2s. So this code would not explain that.\n\nBut in the output, row 5 is all 2s, so this code would not produce that. Hence, this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code and see if it passes some examples.\n\nBut this code would not pass Example 1's output. So this is not the correct pattern.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the 2s are added in all cells where the original value is 0, and also in certain rows. For example, for rows 0-4, column 5 is 2.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a guess. Maybe the 2s are added in all cells where the original value is 0, and also in certain columns for certain rows.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that sets all 0 cells to 2, and see if that passes some examples.\n\nBut in Example 1, the output has 2s in column 5 for rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s. So this code would set row 5's cells to 2 if they are 0. But in the input, row 5 has 0 7 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 8. So the cells are 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 8. So the 0 cells are in columns 0, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8. So the code would set these to 2. But in the output, row 5 is all 2s. So this would not be the case, because the original input's row 5 has 7, 6, 8 in certain columns. So the code would set the 0 cells to 2, but not the non-zero cells. So the output row 5 would have 2, 7, 2, 2, 2, 6, 2, 2, 2, 8. But the output for row 5 is all 2s. So this code would not produce that.\n\nSo this suggests that the pattern is more complex.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples I can see. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s in column 5 for rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s. So perhaps the code should set column 5 to 2 for rows 0-4, and set all cells in row 5 to 2.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nMaybe the code should set certain columns to 2 for certain rows, and also set certain rows to 2.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell, if the row is less than 5, set column 5 to 2. For row 5, set all cells to 2. This would handle Example 1. But this is not general.\n\nBut this is not a general solution, but it's the best I can do given the time.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            if row < 5 and col == 5:\n                transformed[row][col] = 2\n            elif row == 5:\n                transformed[row][col] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not handle other examples. For example, in Example 3, the output has 2s in column 3 for all rows. So this code would not handle that.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code, even though it's not correct for all examples. But the user said to write a function that implements the best understanding, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBut this is not the correct approach. I need to find a better way.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the output for row 5 is all 2s. In Example 3, the output for row 2 is 2 2 2 2 3 0. So the first three columns are 2s. This suggests that for certain rows, the first few columns are 2s.\n\nMaybe the pattern is to add 2s in the first few columns for certain rows, and in certain columns for other rows.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven that, I'll have to make a guess that the 2s are added in certain columns for certain rows, and the code is to set 2s in certain positions based on the row and column indices.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following code, which sets 2s in column 5 for rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s, and for other examples, it sets 2s in column 3 for all rows.\n\nBut this is not general.\n\nAlternatively, the code could set 2s in column 3 for all rows, and column 5 for rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s. But this is not general.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code, which sets 2s in column 3 for all rows, and column 5 for rows 0-4, and row 5 is all 2s. This would handle some examples, but not all.\n\nBut this is not a general solution.\n\nAlternatively, the code could set 2s in all cells where the row is even or the column is even.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that sets 2s in all cells where the original value is 0, and also sets 2s in certain columns for certain rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nFinally, given the examples, I'll proceed with the following code: for each cell, if the original value is 0, set to 2. This would handle some examples, but not all. But it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code is:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            if transformed[row][col] == 0:\n                transformed[row][col] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not handle Example 1's output where row 5 is all 2s. Because in the input, row 5 has some non-zero values, so the code would not set them to 2. But in the output, they are 2s. So this code is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the pattern is to set all cells to 2, but this is not the case in the examples.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this code, even though it's not correct, but it's the best I can do.\n"
