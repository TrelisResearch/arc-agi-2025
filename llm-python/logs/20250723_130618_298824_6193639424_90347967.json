Let's map the observed replacements:\n- `3 -> 4`\n- `2 -> 3`\n- `5 -> 2`\n- `4 -> 3`\n- `1 -> 4`\n- `6 -> 0`\n- `0 -> 0`\n\nWe can implement this transformation in a Python function:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a dictionary to map input values to output values\n    replacement_map = {\n        3: 4,\n        2: 3,\n        5: 2,\n        4: 3,\n        1: 4,\n        6: 0,\n        0: 0\n    }\n    \n    # Create a new grid to store the transformed values\n    transformed_grid = [[replacement_map.get(value, value) for value in row] for row in grid]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis function uses a dictionary to map each input value to its corresponding output value and then constructs the transformed grid by applying these mappings to each element in the input grid. If an input value is not found in the dictionary, it remains unchanged.",

If an input value is not found in the dictionary, it remains unchanged.",
