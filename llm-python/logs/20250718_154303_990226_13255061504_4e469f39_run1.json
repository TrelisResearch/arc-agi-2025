          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that:\n1. The output grid has 2s in certain positions where the input has 5s\n2. The 2s seem to be replacing or adding to the 5s in specific patterns\n3. The 2s appear in certain rows and columns, especially in the middle of the grid\n4. The 2s seem to be spreading out from certain positions\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing 5s with 2s in certain positions\n- Adding 2s in specific patterns\n- The 2s seem to be spreading out from certain positions\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Check if the cell is a 5 and not in the first 3 rows or last 3 rows\n            if grid[i][j] == 5 and i > 2 and i < 7:\n                # Check if the cell is in the middle columns (columns 3-7)\n                if j > 2 and j < 7:\n                    # Replace 5 with 2\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Check if the cell is a 5 and not in the first 3 rows or last 3 rows\n            if grid[i][j] == 5 and i > 2 and i < 7:\n                # Check if the cell is in the middle columns (columns 3-7)\n                if j > 2 and j < 7:\n                    # Replace 5 with 2\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
