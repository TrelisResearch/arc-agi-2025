          "Let's carefully analyze the training examples:\n\n- All examples have an input 10x10 grid, mostly with scattered colored blocks.\n- The output grids also 10x10, but very sparse in a very specific form.\n- Most importantly, in training outputs, there's a clear pattern: **the output forms vertical columns along the left edge (lowest columns, starting at the left edge) with colors arranged in increasing order from 1 to 4**, stacked vertically.\n- The leftmost column is always colored '1's, second column colored '2's, third '3's, and fourth '4's in a column stacked manner (some rows or less). The rest of the grid is zeros.\n- The number of rows filled vertically corresponds to how many of that color appeared as **ascending numbers starting at 1**. It seems to \"accumulate\" from the bottom upwards.\n- Some outputs also have other placements of those colors at the left columns, or start one or two rows higher depending on presence.\n\nLooking at the inputs:\n\n- They have colors 1,2,3,4 scattered.\n- The output can be seen as a **left-aligned sorted stack of colors 1-4 in order, with their counts or presence preserved but compacted into columns arranged left to right: column 0 is color 1, column 1 is color 2, etc.**\n- Partial rows for each color in vertical stacking, filling from bottom upwards.\n\n**Hypothesis about transformation:**\n\n1. Identify all positions of colors 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the input grid.\n2. Count how many times each color appears.\n3. Create an empty 10x10 output grid with zeros.\n4. For each color c in [1,2,3,4], fill a vertical column from bottom up along the left side with c, where:\n   - column index = c-1 (0 for color 1, 1 for color 2, and so forth)\n   - fill as many rows from the bottom as the count of that color in input\n   - This places bars of colors 1 to 4 in columns 0 to 3 respectively.\n5. The output ends with 10x10 grid where only the first 4 columns might have colored blocks stacked from bottom.\n\nThis aligns with the examples given visually and textually.\n\n---\n\n### Implementing this in Python\n\nWe will:\n\n- Loop through grid.\n- Count cells for colors 1,2,3,4.\n- Construct output grid all zeros.\n- For each color c in 1-4, fill bottom rows of column c-1 with c for count times.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    # Count occurrences of colors 1 to 4\n    counts = []\n    for c in [1,2,3,4]:\n        counts.append(np.count_nonzero(grid_np == c))\n\n    # Create empty 10x10 output grid\n    out = np.zeros((10,10), dtype=int)\n\n    # Fill columns 0 to 3 from bottom up with corresponding color and count\n    for idx, c in enumerate([1,2,3,4]):\n        count = counts[idx]\n        if count > 0:\n            # Fill from bottom upwards\n            out[-count:, idx] = c\n\n    # Return as list of lists\n    return out.tolist()\n```\n"

              "Let's carefully analyze the training examples:\n\n- All examples have an input 10x10 grid, mostly with scattered colored blocks.\n- The output grids also 10x10, but very sparse in a very specific form.\n- Most importantly, in training outputs, there's a clear pattern: **the output forms vertical columns along the left edge (lowest columns, starting at the left edge) with colors arranged in increasing order from 1 to 4**, stacked vertically.\n- The leftmost column is always colored '1's, second column colored '2's, third '3's, and fourth '4's in a column stacked manner (some rows or less). The rest of the grid is zeros.\n- The number of rows filled vertically corresponds to how many of that color appeared as **ascending numbers starting at 1**. It seems to \"accumulate\" from the bottom upwards.\n- Some outputs also have other placements of those colors at the left columns, or start one or two rows higher depending on presence.\n\nLooking at the inputs:\n\n- They have colors 1,2,3,4 scattered.\n- The output can be seen as a **left-aligned sorted stack of colors 1-4 in order, with their counts or presence preserved but compacted into columns arranged left to right: column 0 is color 1, column 1 is color 2, etc.**\n- Partial rows for each color in vertical stacking, filling from bottom upwards.\n\n**Hypothesis about transformation:**\n\n1. Identify all positions of colors 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the input grid.\n2. Count how many times each color appears.\n3. Create an empty 10x10 output grid with zeros.\n4. For each color c in [1,2,3,4], fill a vertical column from bottom up along the left side with c, where:\n   - column index = c-1 (0 for color 1, 1 for color 2, and so forth)\n   - fill as many rows from the bottom as the count of that color in input\n   - This places bars of colors 1 to 4 in columns 0 to 3 respectively.\n5. The output ends with 10x10 grid where only the first 4 columns might have colored blocks stacked from bottom.\n\nThis aligns with the examples given visually and textually.\n\n---\n\n### Implementing this in Python\n\nWe will:\n\n- Loop through grid.\n- Count cells for colors 1,2,3,4.\n- Construct output grid all zeros.\n- For each color c in 1-4, fill bottom rows of column c-1 with c for count times.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    # Count occurrences of colors 1 to 4\n    counts = []\n    for c in [1,2,3,4]:\n        counts.append(np.count_nonzero(grid_np == c))\n\n    # Create empty 10x10 output grid\n    out = np.zeros((10,10), dtype=int)\n\n    # Fill columns 0 to 3 from bottom up with corresponding color and count\n    for idx, c in enumerate([1,2,3,4]):\n        count = counts[idx]\n        if count > 0:\n            # Fill from bottom upwards\n            out[-count:, idx] = c\n\n    # Return as list of lists\n    return out.tolist()\n```\n"
