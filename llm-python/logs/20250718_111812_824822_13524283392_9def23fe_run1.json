          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve expanding or filling in certain regions with 2s and 8s based on the original values.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where 0s are replaced with 2s in certain regions, and 8s are placed in specific positions.\n3. The transformation also involves creating larger regions of 2s where there were previously 0s or other numbers.\n4. The output grid is always 21x25, so the transformation must ensure this size.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing 0s with 2s in certain regions\n- Placing 8s in specific positions\n- Expanding regions of 2s based on the original grid\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 21x25 output grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(25)] for _ in range(21)]\n    \n    # Fill in 2s in regions based on the input grid\n    for row in range(21):\n        for col in range(25):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                # Fill with 2s in certain regions\n                if row < 5 and col < 5:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n                elif row < 5 and col > 20:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n                elif row > 15 and col < 5:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n                elif row > 15 and col > 20:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n            elif grid[row][col] == 2:\n                # Expand regions of 2s\n                for r in range(row-1, row+2):\n                    for c in range(col-1, col+2):\n                        if 0 <= r < 21 and 0 <= c < 25:\n                            transformed_grid[r][c] = 2\n            elif grid[row][col] == 8:\n                # Place 8s in specific positions\n                if row == 1 and col == 22:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n                elif row == 7 and col == 22:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n                elif row == 13 and col == 22:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n                elif row == 19 and col == 22:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 21x25 output grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(25)] for _ in range(21)]\n    \n    # Fill in 2s in regions based on the input grid\n    for row in range(21):\n        for col in range(25):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                # Fill with 2s in certain regions\n                if row < 5 and col < 5:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n                elif row < 5 and col > 20:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n                elif row > 15 and col < 5:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n                elif row > 15 and col > 20:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n            elif grid[row][col] == 2:\n                # Expand regions of 2s\n                for r in range(row-1, row+2):\n                    for c in range(col-1, col+2):\n                        if 0 <= r < 21 and 0 <= c < 25:\n                            transformed_grid[r][c] = 2\n            elif grid[row][col] == 8:\n                # Place 8s in specific positions\n                if row == 1 and col == 22:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n                elif row == 7 and col == 22:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n                elif row == 13 and col == 22:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n                elif row == 19 and col == 22:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The transformation seems to involve expanding or filling in certain regions with 2s and 8s based on the original values.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where 0s are replaced with 2s in certain regions, and 8s are placed in specific positions.\n3. The transformation also involves creating larger regions of 2s where there were previously 0s or other numbers.\n4. The output grid is always 21x25, so the transformation must ensure this size.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing 0s with 2s in certain regions\n- Placing 8s in specific positions\n- Expanding regions of 2s based on the original grid\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 21x25 output grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(25)] for _ in range(21)]\n    \n    # Fill in 2s in regions based on the input grid\n    for row in range(21):\n        for col in range(25):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                # Fill with 2s in certain regions\n                if row < 5 and col < 5:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n                elif row < 5 and col > 20:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n                elif row > 15 and col < 5:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n                elif row > 15 and col > 20:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n            elif grid[row][col] == 2:\n                # Expand regions of 2s\n                for r in range(row-1, row+2):\n                    for c in range(col-1, col+2):\n                        if 0 <= r < 21 and 0 <= c < 25:\n                            transformed_grid[r][c] = 2\n            elif grid[row][col] == 8:\n                # Place 8s in specific positions\n                if row == 1 and col == 22:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n                elif row == 7 and col == 22:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n                elif row == 13 and col == 22:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n                elif row == 19 and col == 22:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 21x25 output grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(25)] for _ in range(21)]\n    \n    # Fill in 2s in regions based on the input grid\n    for row in range(21):\n        for col in range(25):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                # Fill with 2s in certain regions\n                if row < 5 and col < 5:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n                elif row < 5 and col > 20:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n                elif row > 15 and col < 5:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n                elif row > 15 and col > 20:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n            elif grid[row][col] == 2:\n                # Expand regions of 2s\n                for r in range(row-1, row+2):\n                    for c in range(col-1, col+2):\n                        if 0 <= r < 21 and 0 <= c < 25:\n                            transformed_grid[r][c] = 2\n            elif grid[row][col] == 8:\n                # Place 8s in specific positions\n                if row == 1 and col == 22:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n                elif row == 7 and col == 22:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n                elif row == 13 and col == 22:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n                elif row == 19 and col == 22:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
