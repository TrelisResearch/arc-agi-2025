          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from these training examples. The input is a 3x3 grid (each example's input seems to be 3 rows with 9 elements each?), but wait, looking at the first example's input: the first line is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2014 that's 9 elements. So the input is 3 rows, each with 9 elements. The output is 3 rows, each with 7 elements. So the transformation reduces the grid from 3x9 to 3x7.\n\nLooking at example 1:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 0 2 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 0 1 2 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHmm. Let's see how each row is transformed. For example, the first input row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output row is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. So the first row of input has 9 elements, output has 7. How does it get transformed? Maybe some elements are kept, others are removed or modified.\n\nLooking at the first row of input: the 2 is in position 1. The output row has 0, 2, then 1, 1, then 0s. Wait, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input. Let's see the positions:\n\nOriginal input row 0: positions 0-8 (indices 0 to 8). Output row 0 has 7 elements. Maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input. For example, maybe the first row of output is taking columns 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7? Wait, no. Let me check the first output row: 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0. Let's see the original input row 0: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So the output row 0 is [0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Wait, where do those 1s come from? The original row 0 has no 1s. So maybe the 1s are coming from other rows?\n\nWait, maybe the output is combining elements from multiple rows. For example, in the first output row, the third element is 1. Looking at the input rows, maybe the third element is taken from the second row. Let me check the second input row: [2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2]. So in the second row, positions 3 and 4 are 1s. So maybe the first output row is taking some elements from the first row and some from the second row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of certain columns from the input. Let me look at the first output row. The output row 0 is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. Let's see the original input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 1: [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo for the first output row, maybe the elements are taken from columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7? Wait, but the output row 0 has 7 elements. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input columns for row 0: columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7? Let's see:\n\nOriginal row 0: columns 0 is 0, column 1 is 2, column 3 is 0, column 4 is 0, column 5 is 0, column 6 is 0, column 7 is 0. That would give 0,2,0,0,0,0,0. But the output row is 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is combining elements from different rows. For example, the first output row's third element is 1. That's from row 1, column 3. The fourth element is 1, from row 1, column 4. So maybe the output rows are combining elements from the input rows in a certain way.\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 0 1 2 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLooking at row 1 of output: 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. The original row 1 of input is [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]. So the output row 1 is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. So the fifth element is 2, which is from the original row 1's column 6 (original row 1 has 2 in column 6, 7, 8). Wait, maybe the output is taking some columns from the input rows and combining them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input. For example, in the first output row, the third element is 1, which is from row 1's column 3. The fourth element is 1 from row 1's column 4. The fifth element is 0, which is from row 0's column 5 (original row 0's column 5 is 0). But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of certain columns from the input. Let's think about the output grid's columns. The output is 3 rows by 7 columns. For example, in example 1, the output row 0 is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. Let me check the original input's columns:\n\nOriginal input has 9 columns. The output has 7. So maybe the output is taking columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7? But that's 7 columns. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7:\n\nRow 0: 0,2,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 but output row 0 is 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. So that's not matching. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain columns from different rows. For example, the first output row's third element is 1, which is from row 1's column 3. The fourth element is 1 from row 1's column 4. The fifth element is 0 from row 0's column 5. But how to determine which rows and columns to take?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking elements from the input in a way that depends on the value. For example, if a cell is 0, it's kept, but if it's non-zero, it's replaced with something else. But looking at example 1's output, there are 1s in the output. Where do those come from? The original input has 1s in row 1, columns 3 and 4.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is derived by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in example 1, the output for row 0 is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input row 0: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOriginal input row 1: [2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n\nOriginal input row 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLooking at the output row 0, the third element is 1. That comes from row 1, column 3. The fourth element is 1 from row 1, column 4. The fifth element is 0, which could be from row 0's column 5. But how to combine these?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain columns from each row. For example, for row 0 of output, columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7. But that would be 7 columns. But in that case, row 0 of input would have 0,2,0,0,0,0,0. But the output row 0 is 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. So where do the 1s come from?\n\nWait, maybe the output is combining elements from multiple rows. For example, the third and fourth elements in the output row 0 are 1 and 1. These are from row 1's columns 3 and 4. So maybe the output is taking elements from row 1's columns 3 and 4, and others from other rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of the original input's columns, but with some transformation. For example, in the first output row, the third and fourth elements are 1s. These are from row 1's columns 3 and 4. So maybe the output is taking certain columns from row 1, and others from row 0 or 2?\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's look at other examples to find a pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 0 2 2\nWait, wait, the input is 3 rows with 11 elements each? Because the first input line is 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 0 2 2 \u2014 that's 11 elements. But the output is 3 rows with 8 elements each. For example, the output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 1 2 2\n0 2 3 3 1 1 0 2\n\nSo the input is 3x11, output is 3x8. So the transformation is reducing the number of columns. How?\n\nLooking at example 2's output row 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The input row 0 is [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,1,0,2,2]. So maybe the first output row is taking some elements from the input's row 0 and others from other rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output row is 8 elements. Let's see, the original input has 11 columns. How to select 8 columns? Maybe the first output row is taking columns 0,1,2, then skipping some, then taking columns 4,5,6,7, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in example 2's output row 0, all elements are 0. The input row 0 has 0s in some positions. But where are the 0s coming from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input's columns, but with some rules. For example, if a column has a certain value, it's included in the output. But this is unclear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1's output, the first row is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The second row is 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. The third row is all 0s.\n\nLooking at the original input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 1: [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe output row 0 is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. So the first two elements are from row 0, then 1 and 1 from row 1. Then 0s.\n\nMaybe the output is combining elements from different rows. For example, the first two elements are from row 0, then the next two from row 1, then the rest from row 0 or 2. But how to determine which rows and columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input. For example, for each output row, the first two elements are from the input row 0, then some elements from row 1, then some from row 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output row 1 in example 1: 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. The original row 1 is [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]. So the output row 1 is 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. The fifth element is 2, which is from row 1's column 6. The sixth and seventh elements are 2 and 2 from row 1's columns 7 and 8. So maybe the output is taking columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8. But that's 7 elements. Let's check:\n\nOriginal row 1: columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 \u2192 values 2,2,0,1,2,2,2. Which matches the output row 1. So that's possible. So for row 1 of output, it's taking columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 of the input row 1. But why?\n\nBut then for output row 0, how does that fit? The output row 0 is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. If we take columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 of the input row 0, then the values would be 0,2,0,0,0,0,0. But the output row 0 has 1s in positions 2 and 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking elements from different rows. For example, for output row 0, the first two elements are from row 0, then the next two from row 1, and the rest from row 0. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input rows and combining them. For example, in example 1, the output row 0 has 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. The 1s are from row 1. So perhaps the output is combining elements from row 0 and row 1. For example, the third and fourth elements are from row 1's columns 3 and 4. The fifth element is from row 0's column 5. But how to determine which columns to take?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input, but the positions depend on the value. For example, if a cell is 0, it's kept, but if it's non-zero, it's replaced with something else. But in example 1's output, there are 1s which are not present in the input. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is a combination of the input's columns, but with some transformation. For example, the output is taking columns from the input, but only certain ones. For example, in example 1's output row 0, the first two elements are from the input row 0's columns 0 and 1. The third and fourth elements are from row 1's columns 3 and 4. The fifth element is from row 0's column 5. The rest are zeros. But how to determine which columns to take?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first two columns from the input row 0, then the next two columns from row 1, and then the rest from row 0. But this is not consistent with the other examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 2 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6\nRow 2: 0 0 2 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nHmm. The output for row 0 is all zeros. The input row 0 has 8 in column 6. But the output row 0 is all zeros. So maybe the output is not directly taking elements from the input rows.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is derived by taking certain columns from the input, but in a way that depends on the row. For example, for each row in the output, the columns are selected based on the input's row.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output row 1: 2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6. The input row 1 is [2,2,2,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]. The output row 1 is 2,2,2,0,0,8,6,6,6. Wait, the output row 1 is 9 elements? No, the output is 3x7. Wait, the output for example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 wait, that's 9 elements. But the output should be 3x7. Oh, wait no, the output for example 3 is:\n\nThe output is given as:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 that's 9 elements? No, the output for example 3 is:\n\nOriginal example 3's output is:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6\n0 0 2 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nWait, but each output row should be 7 elements. But here, the first output row has 9 elements. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the output is a 3x7 grid. So for example 3's output, each row must have 7 elements. But the given example's output is written as:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6\n0 0 2 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nBut that's 9 elements per row. That can't be right. Wait, maybe the examples are written with some formatting issues. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nExample 3's input is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6\n0 0 2 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nWait, the input is 3 rows of 11 elements each. The output is 3 rows. But the output's first row is 9 elements, second is 8, third is 8. That doesn't make sense. But the problem says that the output must be 3x7. So there's a mistake here. Maybe the examples are written incorrectly, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the input and output formats.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are written with a different structure. For example, perhaps the input and output are 3 rows of 9 elements each, but in the examples, the output is written with 7 elements per row. Let me check the first example again.\n\nExample 1's input is 3 rows of 9 elements each. The output is 3 rows of 7 elements each. So for example 1's output:\n\n0 2 1 1 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements\n2 2 0 1 2 2 2 \u2192 7 elements\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements.\n\nSo the output rows have 7 elements. But in the example 3's output, the first row is written as 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2014 that's 9 elements. That's a contradiction. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm misreading the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for example 3 is written with 7 elements per row. Let me count again. The output for example 3 is:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 that's 9 elements. But that's impossible. So perhaps the example is written incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the output for example 3 is:\n\nFirst row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements.\nSecond row: 2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6 \u2192 9 elements? No. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are not written correctly, but the problem says that the output must be 3x7. So perhaps the examples have a typo. For example, in example 3, the output rows should have 7 elements each. So for example, the first output row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (7 elements), the second row is 2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6 \u2014 but that's 9 elements. This is conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement. However, given that the test input is provided, and the problem says that the output must be 3x7, I need to focus on that.\n\nAssuming that the examples are correct, perhaps the output for example 3 is:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0 8 6\n0 0 2 8 8 8 0\n\nBut that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the output for example 3 is written with 7 elements per row, but the formatting is not clear.\n\nThis is a problem because without knowing the correct structure of the output, it's hard to find the pattern. But given that the problem says that the output must be 3x7, I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern that fits all the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 0 1 2 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output rows seem to have certain elements from the input. For example, row 1 of output is taking elements from the input row 1. Let's see:\n\nInput row 1 is [2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2]. The output row 1 is [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2]. So the first three elements are same as input row 1. Then the fourth element is 1 (same as input), then fifth is 2 (input's column 6), sixth and seventh are 2 and 2 (input's columns 7 and 8). So this suggests that the output row 1 is taking columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 of the input row 1. That's 7 columns.\n\nFor example 1's output row 0: 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. Where do these come from? Let's see:\n\nOriginal input row 0: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOriginal input row 1: [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]\nOriginal input row 2: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe output row 0 has elements from row 0 and row 1. For example, the third and fourth elements are 1 and 1, which are from row 1's columns 3 and 4. The first two elements are from row 0's columns 0 and 1. The fifth element is 0, which is from row 0's column 5. The rest are 0s. So maybe the output row 0 is taking columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 of the input row 0 and row 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is combining elements from different rows. For example, the first two elements are from row 0, the next two from row 1, and the rest from row 0 or 2.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the transformation as a combination of certain columns from the input.\n\nFor example, in example 1's output row 1, it's taking columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 of the input row 1. That's 7 columns. For example 1's output row 0, maybe it's taking columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 of the input row 0, but then adding some values from row 1. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain columns from each row. For example, for each output row, it takes certain columns from the input rows, but the selection depends on the row.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the test input and trying to predict the output. The test input is:\n\n0 2 0 1 1 0 0 3 0 5 5\n2 2 0 0 1 0 3 3 0 0 5\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis is 3 rows with 11 elements each. The output must be 3 rows with 7 elements each.\n\nIf I can find a pattern for the test input, that might help.\n\nBut without knowing the correct pattern, it's hard. Let's think about the examples again.\n\nLooking at example 4:\n\nInput:\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2\n1 1 0 0 2 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the output is 3 rows of 8 elements. Wait, but the output should be 3x7. Oh, no, the problem says that the output must be 3x7. So perhaps the example is written with a typo, but the actual output is 3x7. For example, the output for example 4 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2 \u2192 8 elements, but should be 7. So this is conflicting. Again, this suggests that the examples might have formatting issues. However, given that the problem says the output must be 3x7, I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Perhaps the output is derived by taking certain columns from the input, and for each output row, the columns are selected based on some rule. For example, in example 1's output row 1, the columns are 0,1,2,3,6,7,8. For example 4's output row 0: 0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2 \u2192 but that's 8 elements. Assuming it's 7, maybe it's 0 1 1 2 2 0 2.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to select.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is derived by taking certain columns from the input, and for each row, the columns are selected based on the presence of certain values. For example, if a column has a non-zero value, it's included in the output. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output row 0: the 1s are from row 1's columns 3 and 4. So maybe the output is taking certain columns from row 1 and others from row 0.\n\nBut this is too vague. Maybe the pattern is that for each output row, the columns are selected from the input's columns, but the selection is based on the input's values. For example, the output is the input's columns that are not zero, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input's columns, but with certain transformations. For example, the output is the input's columns, but with some columns removed. For example, in example 1's output, the input's columns 2,5,6,7,8 are removed. But this is not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for example 1's row 0, the third and fourth elements are 1 and 1. These are from row 1's columns 3 and 4. So maybe the output is taking certain columns from row 1, and others from row 0.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to take.\n\nMaybe the output is a combination of the input's columns, but the selection of columns depends on the row. For example, for each output row, the columns are selected from the input's columns in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by taking the input's columns and applying some transformation, like averaging or something else. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to think of a possible transformation that can fit some of the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output row 1, it's taking columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 from the input row 1. That's 7 columns. So for row 1 of output, the columns are 0-3, then 6-8. So the columns are 0,1,2,3,6,7,8.\n\nFor example 4's output row 0: the input row 0 is [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]. The output row 0 is [0,1,1,2,2,0,2]. So the columns are 0,1,2,8,9,10, and 8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first three columns, then the last three columns, and some in between. For example, for row 1 of output in example 1, it's taking the first four columns (0-3), then the last three (6-8). But this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then the output is taking certain columns from the input, but how to determine which ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first three columns, then the last three columns, and then some middle columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is derived by taking the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, then the last three columns. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output row 0, which has 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. The first two elements are from row 0, then two from row 1, then three from row 0. But this is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern where the output is taking certain columns from the input, and for each row, the columns are selected in a way that depends on the row.\n\nFor example, in example 1's output row 0, the first two columns are from row 0, then the next two columns are from row 1, and the last three are from row 0. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking columns from the input, but the columns are selected based on the value. For example, if a column has a non-zero value, it's included in the output. But in example 1's output row 0, there are 1s which are not in the input row 0.\n\nThis is not helping. Let's think about the test input and try to derive a possible transformation.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 1 1 0 0 3 0 5 5\nRow 1: 2 2 0 0 1 0 3 3 0 0 5\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput should be 3x7.\n\nLet's try to imagine what the output might look like. For example, the first row of output could be 0 2 1 1 3 5 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking certain columns from the input rows. For example, for each output row, the columns are selected from the input rows in a way that depends on the row.\n\nMaybe the output is derived by taking certain columns from the input, but the columns are selected based on the input's values. For example, if a column has a value that is not zero, it's included in the output.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is derived by taking the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, then the last three columns. But this is just a guess.\n\nFor example, in example 1's input row 0, the first two columns are 0 and 2. The next two columns are 0 and 0. The last three columns are 0,0,0. So the output row 0 would be 0,2,0,0,0,0,0. But the actual output is 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input rows, but the selection is based on the row's position. For example, for each output row, it takes columns from the input rows in a certain pattern.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can fit multiple examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output row 1, which is 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. This is the same as the input row 1's columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8. So for row 1 of output, it's taking columns 0-3 and 6-8.\n\nFor example 4's input row 0: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]. The output row 0 is [0,1,1,2,2,0,2]. So this could be taking columns 0,1,2,8,9,10, and 8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for row 0 of output, it's taking columns 0,1,2,8,9,10, and 8? Not sure.\n\nThis suggests that for each output row, the columns are selected from the input row in a certain way. For example, for row 1 of output, it's taking the first four columns and the last three columns. For row 0 of output, it's taking the first two columns, then columns 3 and 4 from row 1, and then columns 5-7 from row 0.\n\nBut this is not consistent across examples.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is derived by taking certain columns from the input, but the columns are determined by the presence of certain values. For example, if a column in the input has a non-zero value, it's included in the output. But in example 1's output row 0, the 1s are from row 1.\n\nThis is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to write a function that for each output row, takes certain columns from the input rows, but the selection of columns is based on the input's rows.\n\nFor example, for each output row, the columns are selected from the input rows in a way that depends on the row. For example, for output row 0, it takes columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 from the input row 0 and row 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by taking the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, then the last three columns. But this is not consistent.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: for each output row, the columns are selected from the input's columns in a way that depends on the row. For example, for output row 0, it takes the first two columns from the input row 0, then the next two columns from the input row 1, and then the next three columns from the input row 0. This is just a guess, but it might fit some examples.\n\nBut this is not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the output is derived by taking the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, and then the last three columns from the input row. For example, for each output row, the columns are 0,1,2,3,6,7,8. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn example 1's output row 1, this would be columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 of the input row 1, which matches the output. So perhaps this is the pattern.\n\nFor example, for each output row, the columns are 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 of the input row. But why? For example, in example 1's output row 0, this would be columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 of the input row 0. Let's see:\n\nInput row 0: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 are 0,2,0,0,0,0,0. But the output row 0 is 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut if the output row 0 is taking columns 0,1,3,4,6,7,8 from the input row 1, then it would be 2,2,1,1,2,2,2. But this is not matching.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I think I need to proceed with a possible transformation that fits some of the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nMaybe the output is derived by taking certain columns from the input, but the columns are determined by the input's values. For example, for each output row, the columns are selected based on the presence of non-zero values in the input rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is derived by taking the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, and then the last three columns from the input row. This would give 7 columns per row. For example, in example 1's input row 0, columns 0-1, then 2-3, then 6-8. But this is not matching the output.\n\nAlternatively, for each output row, the columns are selected from the input row's columns 0-3, then 6-8. This gives 7 columns. For example, in example 1's input row 1, columns 0-3 are 2,2,0,1, and columns 6-8 are 2,2,2. So the output row 1 would be 2,2,0,1,2,2,2. Which matches the example. So this seems to fit.\n\nFor example 1's output row 0, if we take columns 0-3 and 6-8 of the input row 0, it would be 0,2,0,0,0,0,0. But the output is 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. So this doesn't fit. So this suggests that this pattern is not correct for all rows.\n\nBut for row 1, it works. Maybe the pattern is different for each row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each output row, the columns are selected from the input row's columns 0-3 and 6-8, but for row 0, the columns are taken from row 0 and row 1. This is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to write a function that for each output row, takes certain columns from the input row, based on the row's position. For example, for output row 0, it takes columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 of the input row 0, and for output row 1, it takes columns 0-3 and 6-8 of the input row 1. This is a guess, but it might fit some examples.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by taking the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, then the last three columns. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: for each output row, the columns are selected from the input row's columns 0-3 and 6-8. This would give 7 columns. For example 1's output row 1, this fits. For example 1's output row 0, this would give 0,2,0,0,0,0,0, which doesn't match, but perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by taking the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, and then the last three columns from the input row. For example, for each output row, the columns are 0,1,2,3,6,7,8. This would give 7 columns.\n\nFor example 1's output row 1, this fits. For example 1's output row 0, it would give 0,2,0,0,0,0,0, which doesn't match the actual output. But perhaps there's another pattern for row 0.\n\nMaybe the output is derived by taking the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, and then the last three columns from the input row, but for row 0, it's taking columns from row 0 and row 1.\n\nThis is too vague. I think I need to proceed with the best possible guess based on the examples.\n\nLet's assume that for each output row, the columns are selected from the input row's columns 0-3 and 6-8. This would give 7 columns.\n\nSo for each output row, the transformed row is the input row's columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8.\n\nBut for example 1's output row 0, this would be [0,2,0,0,0,0,0], but the actual output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit. However, for example 1's output row 1, it fits. So maybe this is part of the pattern.\n\nBut how to explain the 1s in the output row 0.\n\nMaybe the 1s are from row 1's columns 3 and 4. So perhaps the output is taking some columns from row 1.\n\nThis suggests that the output is a combination of columns from different rows.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each output row, the columns are selected from the input rows in a certain way. For example, for output row 0, it takes columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 from the input row 0 and some from row 1.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given that I'm stuck, I'll proceed to write a function that takes the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, and then the last three columns. This would give 7 columns. For example, for each row in the output, it's taking columns 0-3 and 6-8 of the input row.\n\nThis would work for example 1's output row 1, but not for row 0. But perhaps this is the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input, create a new row by taking columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8.\n\nBut this would give 7 columns per row.\n\nLet's test this for example 1's input row 0: columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 are [0,2,0,0,0,0,0], but the output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut for example 1's input row 1, it would give [2,2,0,1,2,2,2], which matches the output row 1.\n\nFor example 2's input row 0: [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,1,0,2,2]. Taking columns 0-3 and 6-8: columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 are 0,0,0,3,0,1,0,2,2? Wait, the input row 0 has 11 elements. Columns 0-3 are 0,0,0,3. Columns 6-8 are 0,1,0. So the new row would be [0,0,0,3,0,1,0]. But the output row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm forced to make an educated guess based on the examples that fit. For example, the output row 1 in example 1 is taking columns 0-3 and 6-8 of the input row 1. So perhaps for each output row, the columns are selected from the input row in this way.\n\nBut for other rows, it's not clear. Maybe the output is derived by taking columns 0-3 and 6-8 for row 1, and for other rows, it's different.\n\nBut this is not helpful. Given the time, I'll proceed with this approach and write the code, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Take columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8\n        new_row = [row[0], row[1], row[2], row[3], row[6], row[7], row[8]]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not work for example 1's output row 0, but it works for row 1.\n\nHowever, the test input has 11 columns, so for the test input, this would take columns 0-3 and 6-8, which would be 7 elements.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given that, I'll proceed with this code, even if it's not correct for all examples.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from these training examples. The input is a 3x3 grid (each example's input seems to be 3 rows with 9 elements each?), but wait, looking at the first example's input: the first line is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2014 that's 9 elements. So the input is 3 rows, each with 9 elements. The output is 3 rows, each with 7 elements. So the transformation reduces the grid from 3x9 to 3x7.\n\nLooking at example 1:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 0 1 1 0 2 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 0 2 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 0 1 2 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHmm. Let's see how each row is transformed. For example, the first input row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output row is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. So the first row of input has 9 elements, output has 7. How does it get transformed? Maybe some elements are kept, others are removed or modified.\n\nLooking at the first row of input: the 2 is in position 1. The output row has 0, 2, then 1, 1, then 0s. Wait, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input. Let's see the positions:\n\nOriginal input row 0: positions 0-8 (indices 0 to 8). Output row 0 has 7 elements. Maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input. For example, maybe the first row of output is taking columns 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7? Wait, no. Let me check the first output row: 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0. Let's see the original input row 0: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. So the output row 0 is [0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]. Wait, where do those 1s come from? The original row 0 has no 1s. So maybe the 1s are coming from other rows?\n\nWait, maybe the output is combining elements from multiple rows. For example, in the first output row, the third element is 1. Looking at the input rows, maybe the third element is taken from the second row. Let me check the second input row: [2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2]. So in the second row, positions 3 and 4 are 1s. So maybe the first output row is taking some elements from the first row and some from the second row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of certain columns from the input. Let me look at the first output row. The output row 0 is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. Let's see the original input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 1: [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nSo for the first output row, maybe the elements are taken from columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7? Wait, but the output row 0 has 7 elements. Let me check:\n\nOriginal input columns for row 0: columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7? Let's see:\n\nOriginal row 0: columns 0 is 0, column 1 is 2, column 3 is 0, column 4 is 0, column 5 is 0, column 6 is 0, column 7 is 0. That would give 0,2,0,0,0,0,0. But the output row is 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is combining elements from different rows. For example, the first output row's third element is 1. That's from row 1, column 3. The fourth element is 1, from row 1, column 4. So maybe the output rows are combining elements from the input rows in a certain way.\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 0 1 2 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nLooking at row 1 of output: 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. The original row 1 of input is [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]. So the output row 1 is [2,2,0,1,2,2,2]. So the fifth element is 2, which is from the original row 1's column 6 (original row 1 has 2 in column 6, 7, 8). Wait, maybe the output is taking some columns from the input rows and combining them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input. For example, in the first output row, the third element is 1, which is from row 1's column 3. The fourth element is 1 from row 1's column 4. The fifth element is 0, which is from row 0's column 5 (original row 0's column 5 is 0). But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of certain columns from the input. Let's think about the output grid's columns. The output is 3 rows by 7 columns. For example, in example 1, the output row 0 is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. Let me check the original input's columns:\n\nOriginal input has 9 columns. The output has 7. So maybe the output is taking columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7? But that's 7 columns. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7:\n\nRow 0: 0,2,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 but output row 0 is 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. So that's not matching. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain columns from different rows. For example, the first output row's third element is 1, which is from row 1's column 3. The fourth element is 1 from row 1's column 4. The fifth element is 0 from row 0's column 5. But how to determine which rows and columns to take?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking elements from the input in a way that depends on the value. For example, if a cell is 0, it's kept, but if it's non-zero, it's replaced with something else. But looking at example 1's output, there are 1s in the output. Where do those come from? The original input has 1s in row 1, columns 3 and 4.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is derived by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in example 1, the output for row 0 is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input row 0: [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOriginal input row 1: [2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2]\n\nOriginal input row 2: [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nLooking at the output row 0, the third element is 1. That comes from row 1, column 3. The fourth element is 1 from row 1, column 4. The fifth element is 0, which could be from row 0's column 5. But how to combine these?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain columns from each row. For example, for row 0 of output, columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7. But that would be 7 columns. But in that case, row 0 of input would have 0,2,0,0,0,0,0. But the output row 0 is 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. So where do the 1s come from?\n\nWait, maybe the output is combining elements from multiple rows. For example, the third and fourth elements in the output row 0 are 1 and 1. These are from row 1's columns 3 and 4. So maybe the output is taking elements from row 1's columns 3 and 4, and others from other rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a combination of the original input's columns, but with some transformation. For example, in the first output row, the third and fourth elements are 1s. These are from row 1's columns 3 and 4. So maybe the output is taking certain columns from row 1, and others from row 0 or 2?\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let's look at other examples to find a pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 0 2 2\nWait, wait, the input is 3 rows with 11 elements each? Because the first input line is 0 0 0 3 3 0 0 1 0 2 2 \u2014 that's 11 elements. But the output is 3 rows with 8 elements each. For example, the output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 0 0 0 1 2 2\n0 2 3 3 1 1 0 2\n\nSo the input is 3x11, output is 3x8. So the transformation is reducing the number of columns. How?\n\nLooking at example 2's output row 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The input row 0 is [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,1,0,2,2]. So maybe the first output row is taking some elements from the input's row 0 and others from other rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output row is 8 elements. Let's see, the original input has 11 columns. How to select 8 columns? Maybe the first output row is taking columns 0,1,2, then skipping some, then taking columns 4,5,6,7, etc. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in example 2's output row 0, all elements are 0. The input row 0 has 0s in some positions. But where are the 0s coming from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input's columns, but with some rules. For example, if a column has a certain value, it's included in the output. But this is unclear.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1's output, the first row is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. The second row is 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. The third row is all 0s.\n\nLooking at the original input rows:\n\nRow 0: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nRow 1: [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]\nRow 2: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe output row 0 is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. So the first two elements are from row 0, then 1 and 1 from row 1. Then 0s.\n\nMaybe the output is combining elements from different rows. For example, the first two elements are from row 0, then the next two from row 1, then the rest from row 0 or 2. But how to determine which rows and columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input. For example, for each output row, the first two elements are from the input row 0, then some elements from row 1, then some from row 2. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output row 1 in example 1: 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. The original row 1 is [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]. So the output row 1 is 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. The fifth element is 2, which is from row 1's column 6. The sixth and seventh elements are 2 and 2 from row 1's columns 7 and 8. So maybe the output is taking columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8. But that's 7 elements. Let's check:\n\nOriginal row 1: columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 \u2192 values 2,2,0,1,2,2,2. Which matches the output row 1. So that's possible. So for row 1 of output, it's taking columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 of the input row 1. But why?\n\nBut then for output row 0, how does that fit? The output row 0 is 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. If we take columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 of the input row 0, then the values would be 0,2,0,0,0,0,0. But the output row 0 has 1s in positions 2 and 3. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking elements from different rows. For example, for output row 0, the first two elements are from row 0, then the next two from row 1, and the rest from row 0. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input rows and combining them. For example, in example 1, the output row 0 has 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. The 1s are from row 1. So perhaps the output is combining elements from row 0 and row 1. For example, the third and fourth elements are from row 1's columns 3 and 4. The fifth element is from row 0's column 5. But how to determine which columns to take?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input, but the positions depend on the value. For example, if a cell is 0, it's kept, but if it's non-zero, it's replaced with something else. But in example 1's output, there are 1s which are not present in the input. So that's not it.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is a combination of the input's columns, but with some transformation. For example, the output is taking columns from the input, but only certain ones. For example, in example 1's output row 0, the first two elements are from the input row 0's columns 0 and 1. The third and fourth elements are from row 1's columns 3 and 4. The fifth element is from row 0's column 5. The rest are zeros. But how to determine which columns to take?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first two columns from the input row 0, then the next two columns from row 1, and then the rest from row 0. But this is not consistent with the other examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 2 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6\nRow 2: 0 0 2 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nHmm. The output for row 0 is all zeros. The input row 0 has 8 in column 6. But the output row 0 is all zeros. So maybe the output is not directly taking elements from the input rows.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is derived by taking certain columns from the input, but in a way that depends on the row. For example, for each row in the output, the columns are selected based on the input's row.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output row 1: 2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6. The input row 1 is [2,2,2,0,8,8,8,0,0,0,0]. The output row 1 is 2,2,2,0,0,8,6,6,6. Wait, the output row 1 is 9 elements? No, the output is 3x7. Wait, the output for example 3 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 wait, that's 9 elements. But the output should be 3x7. Oh, wait no, the output for example 3 is:\n\nThe output is given as:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 that's 9 elements? No, the output for example 3 is:\n\nOriginal example 3's output is:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6\n0 0 2 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nWait, but each output row should be 7 elements. But here, the first output row has 9 elements. That's a problem. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says that the output is a 3x7 grid. So for example 3's output, each row must have 7 elements. But the given example's output is written as:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6\n0 0 2 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nBut that's 9 elements per row. That can't be right. Wait, maybe the examples are written with some formatting issues. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement:\n\nExample 3's input is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 8 8 8 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 6 6 6\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6\n0 0 2 8 8 8 0 0 0\n\nWait, the input is 3 rows of 11 elements each. The output is 3 rows. But the output's first row is 9 elements, second is 8, third is 8. That doesn't make sense. But the problem says that the output must be 3x7. So there's a mistake here. Maybe the examples are written incorrectly, but perhaps I'm misunderstanding the input and output formats.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are written with a different structure. For example, perhaps the input and output are 3 rows of 9 elements each, but in the examples, the output is written with 7 elements per row. Let me check the first example again.\n\nExample 1's input is 3 rows of 9 elements each. The output is 3 rows of 7 elements each. So for example 1's output:\n\n0 2 1 1 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements\n2 2 0 1 2 2 2 \u2192 7 elements\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements.\n\nSo the output rows have 7 elements. But in the example 3's output, the first row is written as 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2014 that's 9 elements. That's a contradiction. So perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I'm misreading the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for example 3 is written with 7 elements per row. Let me count again. The output for example 3 is:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 that's 9 elements. But that's impossible. So perhaps the example is written incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe the output for example 3 is:\n\nFirst row: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements.\nSecond row: 2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6 \u2192 9 elements? No. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are not written correctly, but the problem says that the output must be 3x7. So perhaps the examples have a typo. For example, in example 3, the output rows should have 7 elements each. So for example, the first output row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 (7 elements), the second row is 2 2 2 0 0 8 6 6 6 \u2014 but that's 9 elements. This is conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that there's a mistake in the problem statement. However, given that the test input is provided, and the problem says that the output must be 3x7, I need to focus on that.\n\nAssuming that the examples are correct, perhaps the output for example 3 is:\n\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 2 2 0 0 8 6\n0 0 2 8 8 8 0\n\nBut that's just a guess. Alternatively, perhaps the output for example 3 is written with 7 elements per row, but the formatting is not clear.\n\nThis is a problem because without knowing the correct structure of the output, it's hard to find the pattern. But given that the problem says that the output must be 3x7, I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nLet me try to find a pattern that fits all the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 1 1 0 0 0\nRow 1: 2 2 0 1 2 2 2\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output rows seem to have certain elements from the input. For example, row 1 of output is taking elements from the input row 1. Let's see:\n\nInput row 1 is [2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 2]. The output row 1 is [2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2]. So the first three elements are same as input row 1. Then the fourth element is 1 (same as input), then fifth is 2 (input's column 6), sixth and seventh are 2 and 2 (input's columns 7 and 8). So this suggests that the output row 1 is taking columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 of the input row 1. That's 7 columns.\n\nFor example 1's output row 0: 0 2 1 1 0 0 0. Where do these come from? Let's see:\n\nOriginal input row 0: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]\nOriginal input row 1: [2,2,0,1,1,0,2,2,2]\nOriginal input row 2: [0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0]\n\nThe output row 0 has elements from row 0 and row 1. For example, the third and fourth elements are 1 and 1, which are from row 1's columns 3 and 4. The first two elements are from row 0's columns 0 and 1. The fifth element is 0, which is from row 0's column 5. The rest are 0s. So maybe the output row 0 is taking columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 of the input row 0 and row 1. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is combining elements from different rows. For example, the first two elements are from row 0, the next two from row 1, and the rest from row 0 or 2.\n\nThis is getting too vague. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the transformation as a combination of certain columns from the input.\n\nFor example, in example 1's output row 1, it's taking columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 of the input row 1. That's 7 columns. For example 1's output row 0, maybe it's taking columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 of the input row 0, but then adding some values from row 1. But this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain columns from each row. For example, for each output row, it takes certain columns from the input rows, but the selection depends on the row.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the test input and trying to predict the output. The test input is:\n\n0 2 0 1 1 0 0 3 0 5 5\n2 2 0 0 1 0 3 3 0 0 5\n0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThis is 3 rows with 11 elements each. The output must be 3 rows with 7 elements each.\n\nIf I can find a pattern for the test input, that might help.\n\nBut without knowing the correct pattern, it's hard. Let's think about the examples again.\n\nLooking at example 4:\n\nInput:\n0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n1 1 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2\n1 1 0 0 2 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the output is 3 rows of 8 elements. Wait, but the output should be 3x7. Oh, no, the problem says that the output must be 3x7. So perhaps the example is written with a typo, but the actual output is 3x7. For example, the output for example 4 is:\n\nRow 0: 0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2 \u2192 8 elements, but should be 7. So this is conflicting. Again, this suggests that the examples might have formatting issues. However, given that the problem says the output must be 3x7, I'll proceed under that assumption.\n\nLet me think of another approach. Perhaps the output is derived by taking certain columns from the input, and for each output row, the columns are selected based on some rule. For example, in example 1's output row 1, the columns are 0,1,2,3,6,7,8. For example 4's output row 0: 0 1 1 2 2 0 2 2 \u2192 but that's 8 elements. Assuming it's 7, maybe it's 0 1 1 2 2 0 2.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to select.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is derived by taking certain columns from the input, and for each row, the columns are selected based on the presence of certain values. For example, if a column has a non-zero value, it's included in the output. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output row 0: the 1s are from row 1's columns 3 and 4. So maybe the output is taking certain columns from row 1 and others from row 0.\n\nBut this is too vague. Maybe the pattern is that for each output row, the columns are selected from the input's columns, but the selection is based on the input's values. For example, the output is the input's columns that are not zero, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input's columns, but with certain transformations. For example, the output is the input's columns, but with some columns removed. For example, in example 1's output, the input's columns 2,5,6,7,8 are removed. But this is not helpful.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for example 1's row 0, the third and fourth elements are 1 and 1. These are from row 1's columns 3 and 4. So maybe the output is taking certain columns from row 1, and others from row 0.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to take.\n\nMaybe the output is a combination of the input's columns, but the selection of columns depends on the row. For example, for each output row, the columns are selected from the input's columns in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by taking the input's columns and applying some transformation, like averaging or something else. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to think of a possible transformation that can fit some of the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output row 1, it's taking columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 from the input row 1. That's 7 columns. So for row 1 of output, the columns are 0-3, then 6-8. So the columns are 0,1,2,3,6,7,8.\n\nFor example 4's output row 0: the input row 0 is [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]. The output row 0 is [0,1,1,2,2,0,2]. So the columns are 0,1,2,8,9,10, and 8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first three columns, then the last three columns, and some in between. For example, for row 1 of output in example 1, it's taking the first four columns (0-3), then the last three (6-8). But this is just a guess.\n\nIf this is the case, then the output is taking certain columns from the input, but how to determine which ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first three columns, then the last three columns, and then some middle columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is derived by taking the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, then the last three columns. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's output row 0, which has 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. The first two elements are from row 0, then two from row 1, then three from row 0. But this is not consistent.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern where the output is taking certain columns from the input, and for each row, the columns are selected in a way that depends on the row.\n\nFor example, in example 1's output row 0, the first two columns are from row 0, then the next two columns are from row 1, and the last three are from row 0. But this is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking columns from the input, but the columns are selected based on the value. For example, if a column has a non-zero value, it's included in the output. But in example 1's output row 0, there are 1s which are not in the input row 0.\n\nThis is not helping. Let's think about the test input and try to derive a possible transformation.\n\nTest input:\n\nRow 0: 0 2 0 1 1 0 0 3 0 5 5\nRow 1: 2 2 0 0 1 0 3 3 0 0 5\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput should be 3x7.\n\nLet's try to imagine what the output might look like. For example, the first row of output could be 0 2 1 1 3 5 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking certain columns from the input rows. For example, for each output row, the columns are selected from the input rows in a way that depends on the row.\n\nMaybe the output is derived by taking certain columns from the input, but the columns are selected based on the input's values. For example, if a column has a value that is not zero, it's included in the output.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is derived by taking the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, then the last three columns. But this is just a guess.\n\nFor example, in example 1's input row 0, the first two columns are 0 and 2. The next two columns are 0 and 0. The last three columns are 0,0,0. So the output row 0 would be 0,2,0,0,0,0,0. But the actual output is 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input rows, but the selection is based on the row's position. For example, for each output row, it takes columns from the input rows in a certain pattern.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can fit multiple examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output row 1, which is 2 2 0 1 2 2 2. This is the same as the input row 1's columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8. So for row 1 of output, it's taking columns 0-3 and 6-8.\n\nFor example 4's input row 0: [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,2,2,0]. The output row 0 is [0,1,1,2,2,0,2]. So this could be taking columns 0,1,2,8,9,10, and 8? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, for row 0 of output, it's taking columns 0,1,2,8,9,10, and 8? Not sure.\n\nThis suggests that for each output row, the columns are selected from the input row in a certain way. For example, for row 1 of output, it's taking the first four columns and the last three columns. For row 0 of output, it's taking the first two columns, then columns 3 and 4 from row 1, and then columns 5-7 from row 0.\n\nBut this is not consistent across examples.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is derived by taking certain columns from the input, but the columns are determined by the presence of certain values. For example, if a column in the input has a non-zero value, it's included in the output. But in example 1's output row 0, the 1s are from row 1.\n\nThis is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to write a function that for each output row, takes certain columns from the input rows, but the selection of columns is based on the input's rows.\n\nFor example, for each output row, the columns are selected from the input rows in a way that depends on the row. For example, for output row 0, it takes columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 from the input row 0 and row 1. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by taking the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, then the last three columns. But this is not consistent.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: for each output row, the columns are selected from the input's columns in a way that depends on the row. For example, for output row 0, it takes the first two columns from the input row 0, then the next two columns from the input row 1, and then the next three columns from the input row 0. This is just a guess, but it might fit some examples.\n\nBut this is not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the output is derived by taking the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, and then the last three columns from the input row. For example, for each output row, the columns are 0,1,2,3,6,7,8. But this is just a guess.\n\nIn example 1's output row 1, this would be columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 of the input row 1, which matches the output. So perhaps this is the pattern.\n\nFor example, for each output row, the columns are 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 of the input row. But why? For example, in example 1's output row 0, this would be columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 of the input row 0. Let's see:\n\nInput row 0: [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 are 0,2,0,0,0,0,0. But the output row 0 is 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut if the output row 0 is taking columns 0,1,3,4,6,7,8 from the input row 1, then it would be 2,2,1,1,2,2,2. But this is not matching.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time, I think I need to proceed with a possible transformation that fits some of the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nMaybe the output is derived by taking certain columns from the input, but the columns are determined by the input's values. For example, for each output row, the columns are selected based on the presence of non-zero values in the input rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is derived by taking the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, and then the last three columns from the input row. This would give 7 columns per row. For example, in example 1's input row 0, columns 0-1, then 2-3, then 6-8. But this is not matching the output.\n\nAlternatively, for each output row, the columns are selected from the input row's columns 0-3, then 6-8. This gives 7 columns. For example, in example 1's input row 1, columns 0-3 are 2,2,0,1, and columns 6-8 are 2,2,2. So the output row 1 would be 2,2,0,1,2,2,2. Which matches the example. So this seems to fit.\n\nFor example 1's output row 0, if we take columns 0-3 and 6-8 of the input row 0, it would be 0,2,0,0,0,0,0. But the output is 0,2,1,1,0,0,0. So this doesn't fit. So this suggests that this pattern is not correct for all rows.\n\nBut for row 1, it works. Maybe the pattern is different for each row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each output row, the columns are selected from the input row's columns 0-3 and 6-8, but for row 0, the columns are taken from row 0 and row 1. This is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to write a function that for each output row, takes certain columns from the input row, based on the row's position. For example, for output row 0, it takes columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 of the input row 0, and for output row 1, it takes columns 0-3 and 6-8 of the input row 1. This is a guess, but it might fit some examples.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by taking the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, then the last three columns. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: for each output row, the columns are selected from the input row's columns 0-3 and 6-8. This would give 7 columns. For example 1's output row 1, this fits. For example 1's output row 0, this would give 0,2,0,0,0,0,0, which doesn't match, but perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is derived by taking the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, and then the last three columns from the input row. For example, for each output row, the columns are 0,1,2,3,6,7,8. This would give 7 columns.\n\nFor example 1's output row 1, this fits. For example 1's output row 0, it would give 0,2,0,0,0,0,0, which doesn't match the actual output. But perhaps there's another pattern for row 0.\n\nMaybe the output is derived by taking the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, and then the last three columns from the input row, but for row 0, it's taking columns from row 0 and row 1.\n\nThis is too vague. I think I need to proceed with the best possible guess based on the examples.\n\nLet's assume that for each output row, the columns are selected from the input row's columns 0-3 and 6-8. This would give 7 columns.\n\nSo for each output row, the transformed row is the input row's columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8.\n\nBut for example 1's output row 0, this would be [0,2,0,0,0,0,0], but the actual output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit. However, for example 1's output row 1, it fits. So maybe this is part of the pattern.\n\nBut how to explain the 1s in the output row 0.\n\nMaybe the 1s are from row 1's columns 3 and 4. So perhaps the output is taking some columns from row 1.\n\nThis suggests that the output is a combination of columns from different rows.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each output row, the columns are selected from the input rows in a certain way. For example, for output row 0, it takes columns 0,1,3,4,5,6,7 from the input row 0 and some from row 1.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given that I'm stuck, I'll proceed to write a function that takes the first two columns from the input row, then the next two columns from the input row, and then the last three columns. This would give 7 columns. For example, for each row in the output, it's taking columns 0-3 and 6-8 of the input row.\n\nThis would work for example 1's output row 1, but not for row 0. But perhaps this is the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input, create a new row by taking columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8.\n\nBut this would give 7 columns per row.\n\nLet's test this for example 1's input row 0: columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 are [0,2,0,0,0,0,0], but the output is [0,2,1,1,0,0,0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut for example 1's input row 1, it would give [2,2,0,1,2,2,2], which matches the output row 1.\n\nFor example 2's input row 0: [0,0,0,3,3,0,0,1,0,2,2]. Taking columns 0-3 and 6-8: columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8 are 0,0,0,3,0,1,0,2,2? Wait, the input row 0 has 11 elements. Columns 0-3 are 0,0,0,3. Columns 6-8 are 0,1,0. So the new row would be [0,0,0,3,0,1,0]. But the output row 0 is [0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I'm forced to make an educated guess based on the examples that fit. For example, the output row 1 in example 1 is taking columns 0-3 and 6-8 of the input row 1. So perhaps for each output row, the columns are selected from the input row in this way.\n\nBut for other rows, it's not clear. Maybe the output is derived by taking columns 0-3 and 6-8 for row 1, and for other rows, it's different.\n\nBut this is not helpful. Given the time, I'll proceed with this approach and write the code, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Take columns 0,1,2,3,6,7,8\n        new_row = [row[0], row[1], row[2], row[3], row[6], row[7], row[8]]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not work for example 1's output row 0, but it works for row 1.\n\nHowever, the test input has 11 columns, so for the test input, this would take columns 0-3 and 6-8, which would be 7 elements.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given that, I'll proceed with this code, even if it's not correct for all examples.\n"
