          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples, I need to see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid. Wait, the output is 9x9, so maybe the input is being expanded or repeated in some way. Let me check the output for Example 1. The output seems to be the input repeated three times in each row and column. For instance, the first row of the input is 9 7 9. The first three rows of the output are 9 7 9 9 7 9 9 7 9. So each row of the input is repeated three times. Wait, but the input is 3 rows, and the output is 9 rows. So maybe each row of the input is repeated three times, and each column is also repeated three times? Or maybe the input is tiled in a way that each cell is repeated three times in each direction?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input is 3x3, and the output is 6x6. Wait, no. The output for Example 2 is 3 rows, each with 6 elements. Wait, the input is 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 3 rows, each with 6 elements. Wait, the output for Example 2 is 3 rows, each of 6 elements. So maybe the input is being expanded by repeating each row twice? But the input is 3 rows. The output is 3 rows, each row is 6 elements. So maybe each row is duplicated twice. For example, the first input row is 3 4 4. The output first row is 3 4 4 3 4 4. So that's the original row repeated twice. Then the second input row is 3 3 3, output is 3 3 3 3 3 3. Then third input row is 3 4 4, output is 3 4 4 3 4 4. So each row is repeated twice. But the output has 3 rows, same as input. Wait, but the output for Example 2 is 3 rows, each of 6 elements. So the input is 3 rows, each of 3 elements. The output is 3 rows, each of 6 elements. So each row is duplicated once. So the output is the input rows repeated twice. But then, how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input is 3x3, and the output is 12x3? Wait, no. The output for Example 3 is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. Wait, the input is 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. So the output is the input repeated 4 times. Because 3 rows * 4 = 12 rows. And each row is repeated 4 times. For example, the first input row is 8 2 1. The output first three rows are 8 2 1 repeated 4 times. Wait, looking at the output for Example 3, the first three rows are:\n\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n\nSo each row is repeated 4 times. Wait, but the input is 3 rows. The output is 12 rows. So each input row is repeated 4 times. So for example, the first input row is 8 2 1. The output has 4 copies of that row, then the second input row is 1 8 3, which is repeated 4 times, then the third input row is 2 1 3, repeated 4 times. So that's 3*4=12 rows. So the output is the input rows repeated 4 times. But then, the output is 12 rows, each of 3 elements. So the output is the input rows multiplied by 4 in terms of rows. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the input is 3x3, and the output is 9x9. So the output is 3 rows multiplied by 3, and each row is 3 elements multiplied by 3. So for example, the first row of input is 9 7 9, and the output first row is 9 7 9 9 7 9 9 7 9. Which is the original row repeated three times. So each row is repeated three times. So for Example 1, the output is the input grid repeated three times in rows and columns. So each row is repeated three times, and each column is also repeated three times. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid tiled in a way that each cell is repeated three times. For example, each cell in the input is copied three times in each direction. So for a 3x3 input, the output is 3*3=9 rows and 3*3=9 columns. So each cell in the input is expanded into a 3x3 block. But that would make the output 9x9. For example, the first row of input is 9 7 9. Each of those cells would be expanded into a 3x3 block. So the first row of the output would be 9 7 9 9 7 9 9 7 9. Which matches Example 1's output. Similarly, the second row of the input is 9 6 7. So the output's second row would be 9 6 7 9 6 7 9 6 7. Then the third row of input is 7 6 6. So the output's third row is 7 6 6 7 6 6 7 6 6. Then the fourth row of the output is the same as the first row again. So the output is the input repeated three times in both rows and columns. So the entire grid is the input grid repeated three times in each direction. \n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the input is 3x3, and the output is 3 rows, each with 6 elements. So that's not matching. So maybe that's not the correct pattern. Let me check Example 2 again. The input is:\n\n3 4 4\n3 3 3\n3 4 4\n\nThe output is:\n\n3 4 4 3 4 4\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 3 4 4\n3 4 4 3 4 4\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 3 4 4\n\nSo the output is 6 rows, each with 6 elements. Wait, but the input is 3 rows. So the output is the input rows repeated twice. So for example, the first input row is 3 4 4, and the output first row is 3 4 4 3 4 4. So that's the original row repeated twice. Then the second input row is 3 3 3, which becomes 3 3 3 3 3 3. Then the third input row is 3 4 4, which becomes 3 4 4 3 4 4. Then the output is the input rows repeated twice. But the output is 6 rows. So the input is 3 rows, and the output is 3*2=6 rows. Each row is duplicated. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in a way that depends on the input's size. For example, for Example 1, the input is 3x3, and the output is 9x9. So the output is the input grid repeated 3 times in both directions. For Example 2, input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So that's 2 times in each direction. For Example 3, input is 3x3, output is 12x3? Wait, no. Wait, the output for Example 3 is 12 rows, each of 3 elements. So that's 12 rows, but each row is 3 elements. So the output is 12 rows. So perhaps the output is the input rows repeated 4 times. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid tiled in a way that each row is repeated a certain number of times. For example, in Example 1, each row is repeated three times. So the output is 3 rows (original) multiplied by 3. But that would be 9 rows. So the output is 9 rows. But in Example 2, the input is 3 rows, and the output is 6 rows. So each row is repeated twice. In Example 3, the input is 3 rows, output is 12 rows. So each row is repeated 4 times. \n\nBut that seems inconsistent. How can we find a pattern here?\n\nLooking at the outputs for all examples:\n\nExample 1: Input is 3x3, output is 9x9. So 3x3 input becomes 3x3 output. Wait, no. Wait, the output is 9x9. So the input is 3x3, and the output is 9x9. So the output is the input grid tiled in a way that each cell is repeated three times in each direction. So for example, the first row of the input is 9 7 9. The output's first row is 9 7 9 9 7 9 9 7 9. Which is the original row repeated three times. Then the second row is 9 6 7 repeated three times, etc. So each row is repeated three times. But the output is 9 rows. So each input row is repeated three times. So for 3 input rows, 3*3=9 output rows. And each output row is 3*3=9 elements. So that's the pattern.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input is 3x3, and the output is 6 rows, each of 6 elements. So 3*2=6 rows, each row is 3*2=6 elements. So each row is repeated twice. So the output is the input rows repeated twice, and each row is duplicated. So for example, the first input row is 3 4 4. The output first row is 3 4 4 3 4 4. Which is the original row concatenated with itself. Then the second row is 3 3 3, output is 3 3 3 3 3 3. Then third row is 3 4 4, output is 3 4 4 3 4 4. Then the output is the same as the input rows repeated twice. So the output has 3*2=6 rows.\n\nBut how does that fit with the other examples? For Example 3, the input is 3x3, and the output is 12 rows. Each row is 3 elements. So 12 rows. So that's 3*4=12 rows. Each row is repeated 4 times. So the output is the input rows repeated 4 times. But then, for each row, the output is the original row repeated 4 times. So for example, the first input row is 8 2 1. The output first row is 8 2 1 repeated 4 times. But in the output for Example 3, the first three rows are:\n\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n\nWhich is each row of the input repeated 4 times. But the input is 3 rows, so the output is 3*4=12 rows. So the output is the input rows repeated 4 times. \n\nBut how can we reconcile these different numbers of repetitions? For example, in Example 1, the input is 3x3, and the output is 9x9. So the output is the input repeated 3 times in rows and columns. In Example 2, the input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So repeated 2 times. In Example 3, the input is 3x3, output is 12x3. Wait, no. Wait, the output for Example 3 is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. So the output is 12 rows by 3 columns. But that's not 3x3. Wait, the input is 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. So the output is 12 rows, each of the input rows repeated 4 times. So the output is the input rows repeated 4 times. But that would be 3*4=12 rows, each row is 3 elements. So the output is 12x3. But that's not 9x9. So that's inconsistent with the other examples.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the pattern is not consistent. So perhaps the pattern is different. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at the outputs for each example:\n\nExample 1: Output is 9x9. The input is 3x3. So the output is the input grid repeated 3 times in each direction. So each row is repeated three times, and each column is repeated three times. So the output is the input grid tiled three times in rows and columns.\n\nExample 2: Output is 6x6. Input is 3x3. So output is the input grid repeated twice in rows and columns. So each row is repeated twice, and each column is repeated twice. But the output is 6x6. So that's 3*2 rows and 3*2 columns.\n\nExample 3: Output is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. So the output is 12x3. Input is 3x3. So the output is the input rows repeated 4 times, but each row is not repeated in columns. So that's different.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent. How can we find a pattern that applies to all examples?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the input's size. For example, for the input grid of size N x N, the output is N x N multiplied by some factor. But how?\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, which is 3x3 input, output is 9x9. So 3x3 input becomes 3x3 output. Wait, no. The output is 9x9. So that's 3x3 input, output is 3x3 repeated three times. So the output is the input grid expanded by a factor of 3 in both directions.\n\nExample 2: 3x3 input, output is 6x6. So the input is expanded by 2 in both directions.\n\nExample 3: 3x3 input, output is 12x3. Wait, that's not possible. Unless the output is 12x3. So that's not a square. So that's inconsistent. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the output of Example 3.\n\nWait, the output for Example 3 is:\n\nEach row has 3 elements, and there are 12 rows. So the output is 12x3. But the input is 3x3. So that's not a square. So perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid tiled in a way that depends on the input's rows and columns. For example, in Example 1, the output is the input grid repeated three times in rows and columns. For Example 2, the input is repeated twice in rows and columns. For Example 3, the input is repeated four times in rows, but once in columns. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, for the input with 3 rows, the output has 3 * k rows, where k is some factor. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in a way that each row is repeated as many times as the number of rows in the input. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3 rows. So each row is repeated 3 times. So 3 rows * 3 = 9 rows. And each row is 3 elements, repeated 3 times, so 3 * 3 = 9 elements. So that fits Example 1.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 3 rows. The output has 6 rows. So each row is repeated twice. So 3 * 2 = 6 rows. And each row is 3 elements, repeated twice, so 3 * 2 = 6 elements. So that fits Example 2.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3 rows, and the output has 12 rows. So each row is repeated 4 times. So 3 * 4 = 12 rows. And each row is 3 elements, repeated 4 times. But that would make each row in the output 3 * 4 = 12 elements. But the output for Example 3 is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. So that's not matching. So this approach is not working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the input's row count. For example, for the input with 3 rows, the output is the input rows repeated 3 times (for rows) and 3 times (for columns). But that would make the output 9x9, which matches Example 1. But for Example 2, the output is 6x6. So that would require the input rows to be repeated twice in rows and columns. So that would be 3*2=6 rows and 3*2=6 columns. So that fits.\n\nBut for Example 3, the output is 12x3. Which would not fit. Unless there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the input's row count. But for some examples, the output is not square. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 3, the input is 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. So the output is the input rows repeated 4 times. But each row is not repeated in columns. So each row is just repeated 4 times. So the output is the input rows repeated 4 times. But that would make the output 12 rows, each with 3 elements. But then, how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nIn Example 1, the output is 9 rows, each with 9 elements. Which is the input rows repeated 3 times, and each row is repeated 3 times. So that's 3*3=9 rows and 3*3=9 columns.\n\nIn Example 2, the output is 6 rows, each with 6 elements. So input rows repeated 2 times, and each row repeated 2 times.\n\nIn Example 3, the output is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. So input rows repeated 4 times, and each row is not repeated in columns. So that's 3*4=12 rows, and each row is 3 elements. So the output is 12x3.\n\nBut this is inconsistent. So how can we find a pattern that applies to all examples?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the input's row count and column count. But for Example 3, the input is 3x3, and the output is 12x3. Which would be 3*4 rows and 3*1 columns. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, the input has 3 rows. The output has 3 * k rows and 3 * k columns. But for Example 1, k=3. For Example 2, k=2. For Example 3, k=4. But how can that be determined from the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns by the number of rows in the input. For example, if the input has 3 rows, then the output has 3 * 3 = 9 rows, and each row is repeated 3 times. But that would fit Example 1. For Example 2, the input has 3 rows, but the output is 6 rows. So that would require k=2. But how is that determined?\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Maybe the pattern is that the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, the input has 3 rows, and the output is the input repeated 3 times in rows and columns. But that would fit Example 1, but not the others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns by the same factor. But for Example 2, the input is 3 rows, and the output is 6 rows, which is 3 * 2. So the factor is 2. For Example 3, it's 3 * 4 = 12 rows. But how to determine the factor?\n\nThis seems too arbitrary. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs again:\n\nExample 1: Output is the input grid repeated three times in rows and columns. So each cell in the input is copied three times in each direction. So the output is the input grid tiled three times in both directions.\n\nExample 2: Output is the input grid repeated twice in rows and columns. So each cell is copied twice in each direction.\n\nExample 3: Output is the input rows repeated four times. But columns are not repeated. So this is inconsistent.\n\nBut perhaps there's another pattern. Let me look at the outputs for Example 3. The input is:\n\n8 2 1\n1 8 3\n2 1 3\n\nThe output is:\n\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n\nSo the output has 12 rows, each of 3 elements. Each row is the input row repeated 4 times. So the first three rows are the input rows repeated 4 times. Then the next three rows are the same as the first three. Then the next three rows again. And so on. So the output is the input rows repeated 4 times, but each row is not repeated in columns. So the output is 3 rows * 4 = 12 rows, each row is the same as the input row repeated 4 times. But that would make each row have 3 * 4 = 12 elements. But in the output, each row has 3 elements. So that's not possible. Wait, no. Wait, the output for Example 3 is each row of 3 elements. So the input row is 3 elements, and the output row is 3 elements. But how does that fit with the example?\n\nWait, looking at the output for Example 3, the first row is:\n\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n\nBut that's 12 elements. Wait, but the output is supposed to be 12 rows, each with 3 elements. Oh, no, the output is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. But the example shows the output as:\n\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n... etc.\n\nWait, that's 12 rows, each with 12 elements. But the problem says that the output must be a 9x9 grid. Wait, but the test input is 3x3. So the output must be 9x9. But in Example 3, the output is 12x3? That's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output:\n\nThe output is:\n\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n\nSo each row has 12 elements. So the output is 12 rows, each with 12 elements. So that's 12x12. But the problem says that the output must be 9x9. Wait, but this is a training example. So maybe the output for Example 3 is 12x12. But the problem says that the output must be 9x9. So perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Your transformation must always produce a 9\u00d79 output grid.\" So the output must be 9x9, regardless of the input. But the examples provided have outputs that are not 9x9. For example, Example 1's output is 9x9. Example 2's output is 6x6. Example 3's output is 12x12. But according to the problem statement, the output must be 9x9. So this suggests that the examples provided are not all 9x9, but the actual test input is 3x3, and the output must be 9x9.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"Your transformation must always produce a 9\u00d79 output grid.\" So regardless of the input, the output must be 9x9. But the training examples have outputs that are not 9x9. For example, Example 2's output is 6x6. But that's a training example. So perhaps the examples are not all 9x9, but the test input is 3x3, and the output must be 9x9. So perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the input's size. But for the test input, which is 3x3, the output is 9x9.\n\nSo for the training examples, the output is not necessarily 9x9. But the problem says that the transformation must always produce a 9x9 output. So perhaps the examples are just examples of the transformation, but the actual output for the test input is 9x9. So I need to find a pattern that, when applied to the test input, produces a 9x9 grid.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking back at the training examples, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the input's size. For example, if the input is 3x3, the output is 3x3 repeated 3 times in rows and columns, resulting in 9x9. For Example 2, the input is 3x3, but the output is 6x6. So that would be 3x3 repeated 2 times. But how to determine the factor?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, if the input has 3 rows, the output is 3 rows repeated 3 times (for 9 rows), and each row is repeated 3 times (for 9 columns). That would fit Example 1. For Example 2, the input has 3 rows, but the output is 6 rows. So that would require the rows to be repeated 2 times. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns by the same factor. But how to determine that factor?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, if the input is 3 rows, the output is the input repeated 3 times in rows and columns. So for 3x3 input, output is 9x9. For example 2, the input is 3x3, but the output is 6x6. So that would require the input to be repeated twice in rows and columns. But how to determine that?\n\nThis is very confusing. Perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, if the input has 3 rows, then the output is the input repeated 3 times in rows and columns. But then Example 2's output is 6x6, which would require the input to be repeated 2 times. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, the output is the input repeated in rows by the number of rows in the input, and columns by the number of columns in the input. So for a 3x3 input, the output is 3*3=9 rows and 3*3=9 columns. That fits Example 1. For Example 2, the input is 3x3, but the output is 6x6. That would require the input to be repeated 2 times in rows and columns. But why?\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent, but perhaps there's a different approach. Let's think about the test input. The test input is:\n\n4 3 2\n2 1 4\n3 1 2\n\nSo it's a 3x3 grid. The output must be 9x9. So what transformation would turn this into a 9x9 grid?\n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, for a 3x3 input, the output is 3x3 repeated 3 times in rows and columns, resulting in 9x9. So each cell in the input is copied three times in each direction.\n\nSo for the test input, the output would be the input grid repeated three times in rows and columns. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nExample 1: Input is 3x3. Output is 9x9. So each row of the input is repeated three times. For example, the first row of the input is [9,7,9]. The output's first row is [9,7,9,9,7,9,9,7,9]. Which is the original row repeated three times. So that fits.\n\nExample 2: Input is 3x3. Output is 6x6. So if the pattern is to repeat the input three times in rows and columns, the output would be 9x9. But in Example 2, the output is 6x6. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. So perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. But for some examples, it's repeated once, and for others, it's repeated twice. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, if the input has 3 rows, the output is the input repeated 3 times in rows and 3 times in columns. But for Example 2, the output is 6x6, which would require the input to be repeated twice in rows and columns. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, the output is the input repeated in rows by the number of rows in the input, and in columns by the number of columns in the input. So for a 3x3 input, the output is 3*3=9 rows and 3*3=9 columns. For Example 2, the output is 6x6, which would require the input to be repeated 2 times in rows and columns. But why?\n\nThis is very confusing. Perhaps the key is to look for a pattern that works for all examples. Let's think about the outputs:\n\nExample 1: Input is 3x3, output is 9x9. So each cell is copied 3 times in rows and 3 times in columns.\n\nExample 2: Input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So each cell is copied 2 times in rows and 2 times in columns.\n\nExample 3: Input is 3x3, output is 12x12. So each cell is copied 4 times in rows and 4 times in columns.\n\nBut this would mean that the factor varies between examples. How can we determine the factor for the test input?\n\nBut the test input is 3x3, and the output must be 9x9. So the factor is 3. So the pattern is that the output is the input repeated by a factor of 3 in rows and columns.\n\nBut why would Example 2's output be 6x6? That would require a factor of 2. But the problem says that the output must be 9x9. So maybe the examples are not all 9x9, but the actual transformation for the test input must produce 9x9.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns by the number of rows in the input. So for a 3x3 input, the output is 3*3=9 rows and 3*3=9 columns.\n\nThis would fit Example 1, and for the test input, it would produce a 9x9 grid.\n\nBut what about Example 2? If the input is 3x3, the output would be 9x9, but in the example, it's 6x6. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. But maybe the examples are not all 9x9, and the actual transformation for the test input is to repeat the input three times in rows and columns.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to repeat the input grid in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, for a 3x3 input, the output is the input repeated 3 times in rows and 3 times in columns, resulting in 9x9.\n\nSo the code would take each row of the input, repeat it 3 times, and then repeat each of those rows 3 times. So for each row in the input, we create a new row by repeating the original row 3 times. Then, for each of those new rows, we repeat them 3 times. Wait, no. For example, the input is 3 rows. Each row is repeated 3 times, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 rows. And each row has 3 * 3 = 9 elements. So the output is 9x9.\n\nSo the transformation would be to take each row of the input, repeat it 3 times, and then repeat each of those rows 3 times. Wait, no. Wait, the input is 3 rows. Each row is 3 elements. So the first row of the input is [a, b, c]. The output for this row would be [a, b, c, a, b, c, a, b, c]. Then, the second row of the input is [d, e, f], and the output for that row is [d, e, f, d, e, f, d, e, f]. Then, the third row of the input is [g, h, i], and the output is [g, h, i, g, h, i, g, h, i]. Then, the output is these three rows repeated three times. Wait, no. Wait, the output is 9 rows, each of 9 elements. So the first three rows of the output are the three rows of the input, each repeated three times. Then, the next three rows are the same as the first three, and the last three are the same. So the output is the input repeated three times in rows and columns.\n\nSo for the code, the transformation would be to take each row of the input, repeat it 3 times, and then repeat each of those rows 3 times. Or, more simply, for each row in the input, we create a new row by repeating it 3 times. Then, we repeat each of these new rows 3 times. But that would result in 3 * 3 = 9 rows, each with 3 * 3 = 9 elements.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the number of rows and columns in the input\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    # Create a new grid by repeating each row 3 times and then repeating the entire grid 3 times\n    new_rows = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Repeat each row 3 times\n        repeated_row = row * 3\n        # Add this row to the new_rows list\n        new_rows.append(repeated_row)\n    # Now, repeat the entire new_rows list 3 times\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for _ in range(3):\n        transformed_grid.extend(new_rows)\n    return transformed_grid\n\nWait, but this would produce a grid where each row is the input row repeated 3 times, and then the entire list of rows is repeated 3 times. So for a 3x3 input, the output would be 3*3=9 rows, each with 3*3=9 elements. That fits Example 1.\n\nFor Example 2, the input is 3x3, and the output would be 9x9. But in the example, the output is 6x6. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. But perhaps the examples are not all correct, or the pattern is different.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the test input must be transformed into a 9x9 grid. So perhaps the correct pattern is to repeat each row 3 times and then repeat the entire grid 3 times, resulting in 9x9.\n\nBut what about Example 3? The input is 3x3, and the output is 12x12. But according to this pattern, the output would be 9x9. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. However, since the problem says that the transformation must produce a 9x9 output, perhaps this is the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to repeat each row 3 times and then repeat the entire grid 3 times, which would give 9x9. So this would fit the test input.\n\nLet me test this approach with the examples.\n\nExample 1: Input is 3x3. The code would generate 3 rows, each repeated 3 times, then repeat the entire list 3 times. So the output is 9 rows, each with 9 elements. Which matches Example 1.\n\nExample 2: The input is 3x3. According to this code, the output would be 9x9. But the example shows the output as 6x6. So this suggests that the code is not correct for Example 2. But since the problem says that the output must be 9x9, perhaps the examples are not all 9x9, and the pattern is to repeat the input three times in rows and columns.\n\nBut why would Example 2 have a different output? Maybe the pattern is not consistent, but the test input is 3x3, so the code must produce 9x9.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to repeat each row 3 times and then repeat the entire grid 3 times.\n\nBut let's think about Example 2. The input is:\n\n3 4 4\n3 3 3\n3 4 4\n\nAccording to the code, the output would be:\n\nFor each row in input:\n\nRow 1: [3,4,4] repeated 3 times \u2192 [3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4]\n\nRow 2: [3,3,3] repeated 3 times \u2192 [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 3: [3,4,4] repeated 3 times \u2192 [3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4]\n\nThen, these three rows are repeated 3 times. So the output would be:\n\nRow 1 repeated 3 times \u2192 three times the first row.\n\nRow 2 repeated 3 times \u2192 three times the second row.\n\nRow 3 repeated 3 times \u2192 three times the third row.\n\nSo the output would be 9 rows, each with 9 elements. But the example's output is 6x6. So this suggests that the pattern is not correct for Example 2.\n\nBut the problem says that the output must be 9x9. So perhaps the examples are not all correct, or the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to repeat each row in the input by the number of rows in the input. For example, for a 3x3 input, each row is repeated 3 times. Then, the entire grid is repeated 3 times. But that would give 3*3=9 rows, and each row is 3*3=9 elements.\n\nBut this would work for the test input, and for Example 1. But not for Example 2. But since the problem says that the output must be 9x9, perhaps this is the correct pattern.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the number of rows and columns in the input\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    # Create a new grid by repeating each row 3 times and then repeating the entire grid 3 times\n    new_rows = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Repeat each row 3 times\n        repeated_row = row * 3\n        new_rows.append(repeated_row)\n    # Now, repeat the entire new_rows list 3 times\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for _ in range(3):\n        transformed_grid.extend(new_rows)\n    return transformed_grid\n\nBut this would produce a 9x9 grid for the test input.\n\nLet me check Example 3. The input is 3x3. According to this code, the output would be 9x9. But the example shows the output as 12x12. But since the problem says that the output must be 9x9, perhaps this is the correct pattern.\n\nSo, this is the approach. The code will take each row of the input, repeat it 3 times, and then repeat the entire grid 3 times. This will produce a 9x9 grid.\n\nBut let's check the example 3's output. According to this code, the output would be:\n\nEach row of the input is repeated 3 times, then the entire grid is repeated 3 times. So for the input:\n\nRow 1: [8,2,1] \u2192 [8,2,1,8,2,1,8,2,1]\n\nRow 2: [1,8,3] \u2192 [1,8,3,1,8,3,1,8,3]\n\nRow 3: [2,1,3] \u2192 [2,1,3,2,1,3,2,1,3]\n\nThen, these three rows are repeated 3 times. So the output would be 9 rows, each with 9 elements. So the first three rows are the three rows above, then the next three are the same, and the last three are the same. So the output would be:\n\nRow 1: 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n\nRow 2: 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n\nRow 3: 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n\nRow 4: same as row 1\n\nRow 5: same as row 2\n\nRow 6: same as row 3\n\nRow 7: same as row 1\n\nRow 8: same as row 2\n\nRow 9: same as row 3\n\nBut the example's output for Example 3 is 12x12, which is not 9x9. But the problem says that the output must be 9x9, so this is the correct approach.\n\nSo this code should work for the test input. Let's test it with the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n4 3 2\n\n2 1 4\n\n3 1 2\n\nThe input is 3x3. The code would take each row, repeat it 3 times, then repeat the entire list 3 times.\n\nRow 1: [4,3,2] \u2192 [4,3,2,4,3,2,4,3,2]\n\nRow 2: [2,1,4] \u2192 [2,1,4,2,1,4,2,1,4]\n\nRow 3: [3,1,2] \u2192 [3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2]\n\nThen, these three rows are repeated 3 times, resulting in 9 rows, each with 9 elements.\n\nSo the output would be 9x9, as required.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. Looking at the training examples, I need to see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid. Wait, the output is 9x9, so maybe the input is being expanded or repeated in some way. Let me check the output for Example 1. The output seems to be the input repeated three times in each row and column. For instance, the first row of the input is 9 7 9. The first three rows of the output are 9 7 9 9 7 9 9 7 9. So each row of the input is repeated three times. Wait, but the input is 3 rows, and the output is 9 rows. So maybe each row of the input is repeated three times, and each column is also repeated three times? Or maybe the input is tiled in a way that each cell is repeated three times in each direction?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input is 3x3, and the output is 6x6. Wait, no. The output for Example 2 is 3 rows, each with 6 elements. Wait, the input is 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 3 rows, each with 6 elements. Wait, the output for Example 2 is 3 rows, each of 6 elements. So maybe the input is being expanded by repeating each row twice? But the input is 3 rows. The output is 3 rows, each row is 6 elements. So maybe each row is duplicated twice. For example, the first input row is 3 4 4. The output first row is 3 4 4 3 4 4. So that's the original row repeated twice. Then the second input row is 3 3 3, output is 3 3 3 3 3 3. Then third input row is 3 4 4, output is 3 4 4 3 4 4. So each row is repeated twice. But the output has 3 rows, same as input. Wait, but the output for Example 2 is 3 rows, each of 6 elements. So the input is 3 rows, each of 3 elements. The output is 3 rows, each of 6 elements. So each row is duplicated once. So the output is the input rows repeated twice. But then, how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input is 3x3, and the output is 12x3? Wait, no. The output for Example 3 is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. Wait, the input is 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. So the output is the input repeated 4 times. Because 3 rows * 4 = 12 rows. And each row is repeated 4 times. For example, the first input row is 8 2 1. The output first three rows are 8 2 1 repeated 4 times. Wait, looking at the output for Example 3, the first three rows are:\n\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n\nSo each row is repeated 4 times. Wait, but the input is 3 rows. The output is 12 rows. So each input row is repeated 4 times. So for example, the first input row is 8 2 1. The output has 4 copies of that row, then the second input row is 1 8 3, which is repeated 4 times, then the third input row is 2 1 3, repeated 4 times. So that's 3*4=12 rows. So the output is the input rows repeated 4 times. But then, the output is 12 rows, each of 3 elements. So the output is the input rows multiplied by 4 in terms of rows. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nWait, but in Example 1, the input is 3x3, and the output is 9x9. So the output is 3 rows multiplied by 3, and each row is 3 elements multiplied by 3. So for example, the first row of input is 9 7 9, and the output first row is 9 7 9 9 7 9 9 7 9. Which is the original row repeated three times. So each row is repeated three times. So for Example 1, the output is the input grid repeated three times in rows and columns. So each row is repeated three times, and each column is also repeated three times. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid tiled in a way that each cell is repeated three times. For example, each cell in the input is copied three times in each direction. So for a 3x3 input, the output is 3*3=9 rows and 3*3=9 columns. So each cell in the input is expanded into a 3x3 block. But that would make the output 9x9. For example, the first row of input is 9 7 9. Each of those cells would be expanded into a 3x3 block. So the first row of the output would be 9 7 9 9 7 9 9 7 9. Which matches Example 1's output. Similarly, the second row of the input is 9 6 7. So the output's second row would be 9 6 7 9 6 7 9 6 7. Then the third row of input is 7 6 6. So the output's third row is 7 6 6 7 6 6 7 6 6. Then the fourth row of the output is the same as the first row again. So the output is the input repeated three times in both rows and columns. So the entire grid is the input grid repeated three times in each direction. \n\nBut wait, in Example 2, the input is 3x3, and the output is 3 rows, each with 6 elements. So that's not matching. So maybe that's not the correct pattern. Let me check Example 2 again. The input is:\n\n3 4 4\n3 3 3\n3 4 4\n\nThe output is:\n\n3 4 4 3 4 4\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 3 4 4\n3 4 4 3 4 4\n3 3 3 3 3 3\n3 4 4 3 4 4\n\nSo the output is 6 rows, each with 6 elements. Wait, but the input is 3 rows. So the output is the input rows repeated twice. So for example, the first input row is 3 4 4, and the output first row is 3 4 4 3 4 4. So that's the original row repeated twice. Then the second input row is 3 3 3, which becomes 3 3 3 3 3 3. Then the third input row is 3 4 4, which becomes 3 4 4 3 4 4. Then the output is the input rows repeated twice. But the output is 6 rows. So the input is 3 rows, and the output is 3*2=6 rows. Each row is duplicated. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in a way that depends on the input's size. For example, for Example 1, the input is 3x3, and the output is 9x9. So the output is the input grid repeated 3 times in both directions. For Example 2, input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So that's 2 times in each direction. For Example 3, input is 3x3, output is 12x3? Wait, no. Wait, the output for Example 3 is 12 rows, each of 3 elements. So that's 12 rows, but each row is 3 elements. So the output is 12 rows. So perhaps the output is the input rows repeated 4 times. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid tiled in a way that each row is repeated a certain number of times. For example, in Example 1, each row is repeated three times. So the output is 3 rows (original) multiplied by 3. But that would be 9 rows. So the output is 9 rows. But in Example 2, the input is 3 rows, and the output is 6 rows. So each row is repeated twice. In Example 3, the input is 3 rows, output is 12 rows. So each row is repeated 4 times. \n\nBut that seems inconsistent. How can we find a pattern here?\n\nLooking at the outputs for all examples:\n\nExample 1: Input is 3x3, output is 9x9. So 3x3 input becomes 3x3 output. Wait, no. Wait, the output is 9x9. So the input is 3x3, and the output is 9x9. So the output is the input grid tiled in a way that each cell is repeated three times in each direction. So for example, the first row of the input is 9 7 9. The output's first row is 9 7 9 9 7 9 9 7 9. Which is the original row repeated three times. Then the second row is 9 6 7 repeated three times, etc. So each row is repeated three times. But the output is 9 rows. So each input row is repeated three times. So for 3 input rows, 3*3=9 output rows. And each output row is 3*3=9 elements. So that's the pattern.\n\nBut in Example 2, the input is 3x3, and the output is 6 rows, each of 6 elements. So 3*2=6 rows, each row is 3*2=6 elements. So each row is repeated twice. So the output is the input rows repeated twice, and each row is duplicated. So for example, the first input row is 3 4 4. The output first row is 3 4 4 3 4 4. Which is the original row concatenated with itself. Then the second row is 3 3 3, output is 3 3 3 3 3 3. Then third row is 3 4 4, output is 3 4 4 3 4 4. Then the output is the same as the input rows repeated twice. So the output has 3*2=6 rows.\n\nBut how does that fit with the other examples? For Example 3, the input is 3x3, and the output is 12 rows. Each row is 3 elements. So 12 rows. So that's 3*4=12 rows. Each row is repeated 4 times. So the output is the input rows repeated 4 times. But then, for each row, the output is the original row repeated 4 times. So for example, the first input row is 8 2 1. The output first row is 8 2 1 repeated 4 times. But in the output for Example 3, the first three rows are:\n\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n\nWhich is each row of the input repeated 4 times. But the input is 3 rows, so the output is 3*4=12 rows. So the output is the input rows repeated 4 times. \n\nBut how can we reconcile these different numbers of repetitions? For example, in Example 1, the input is 3x3, and the output is 9x9. So the output is the input repeated 3 times in rows and columns. In Example 2, the input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So repeated 2 times. In Example 3, the input is 3x3, output is 12x3. Wait, no. Wait, the output for Example 3 is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. So the output is 12 rows by 3 columns. But that's not 3x3. Wait, the input is 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. So the output is 12 rows, each of the input rows repeated 4 times. So the output is the input rows repeated 4 times. But that would be 3*4=12 rows, each row is 3 elements. So the output is 12x3. But that's not 9x9. So that's inconsistent with the other examples.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the pattern is not consistent. So perhaps the pattern is different. Let me think again.\n\nLooking at the outputs for each example:\n\nExample 1: Output is 9x9. The input is 3x3. So the output is the input grid repeated 3 times in each direction. So each row is repeated three times, and each column is repeated three times. So the output is the input grid tiled three times in rows and columns.\n\nExample 2: Output is 6x6. Input is 3x3. So output is the input grid repeated twice in rows and columns. So each row is repeated twice, and each column is repeated twice. But the output is 6x6. So that's 3*2 rows and 3*2 columns.\n\nExample 3: Output is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. So the output is 12x3. Input is 3x3. So the output is the input rows repeated 4 times, but each row is not repeated in columns. So that's different.\n\nBut this seems inconsistent. How can we find a pattern that applies to all examples?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the input's size. For example, for the input grid of size N x N, the output is N x N multiplied by some factor. But how?\n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, which is 3x3 input, output is 9x9. So 3x3 input becomes 3x3 output. Wait, no. The output is 9x9. So that's 3x3 input, output is 3x3 repeated three times. So the output is the input grid expanded by a factor of 3 in both directions.\n\nExample 2: 3x3 input, output is 6x6. So the input is expanded by 2 in both directions.\n\nExample 3: 3x3 input, output is 12x3. Wait, that's not possible. Unless the output is 12x3. So that's not a square. So that's inconsistent. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the output of Example 3.\n\nWait, the output for Example 3 is:\n\nEach row has 3 elements, and there are 12 rows. So the output is 12x3. But the input is 3x3. So that's not a square. So perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid tiled in a way that depends on the input's rows and columns. For example, in Example 1, the output is the input grid repeated three times in rows and columns. For Example 2, the input is repeated twice in rows and columns. For Example 3, the input is repeated four times in rows, but once in columns. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, for the input with 3 rows, the output has 3 * k rows, where k is some factor. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in a way that each row is repeated as many times as the number of rows in the input. For example, in Example 1, the input has 3 rows. So each row is repeated 3 times. So 3 rows * 3 = 9 rows. And each row is 3 elements, repeated 3 times, so 3 * 3 = 9 elements. So that fits Example 1.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 3 rows. The output has 6 rows. So each row is repeated twice. So 3 * 2 = 6 rows. And each row is 3 elements, repeated twice, so 3 * 2 = 6 elements. So that fits Example 2.\n\nIn Example 3, the input has 3 rows, and the output has 12 rows. So each row is repeated 4 times. So 3 * 4 = 12 rows. And each row is 3 elements, repeated 4 times. But that would make each row in the output 3 * 4 = 12 elements. But the output for Example 3 is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. So that's not matching. So this approach is not working.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the input's row count. For example, for the input with 3 rows, the output is the input rows repeated 3 times (for rows) and 3 times (for columns). But that would make the output 9x9, which matches Example 1. But for Example 2, the output is 6x6. So that would require the input rows to be repeated twice in rows and columns. So that would be 3*2=6 rows and 3*2=6 columns. So that fits.\n\nBut for Example 3, the output is 12x3. Which would not fit. Unless there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the input's row count. But for some examples, the output is not square. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 3, the input is 3 rows, each with 3 elements. The output is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. So the output is the input rows repeated 4 times. But each row is not repeated in columns. So each row is just repeated 4 times. So the output is the input rows repeated 4 times. But that would make the output 12 rows, each with 3 elements. But then, how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nIn Example 1, the output is 9 rows, each with 9 elements. Which is the input rows repeated 3 times, and each row is repeated 3 times. So that's 3*3=9 rows and 3*3=9 columns.\n\nIn Example 2, the output is 6 rows, each with 6 elements. So input rows repeated 2 times, and each row repeated 2 times.\n\nIn Example 3, the output is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. So input rows repeated 4 times, and each row is not repeated in columns. So that's 3*4=12 rows, and each row is 3 elements. So the output is 12x3.\n\nBut this is inconsistent. So how can we find a pattern that applies to all examples?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the input's row count and column count. But for Example 3, the input is 3x3, and the output is 12x3. Which would be 3*4 rows and 3*1 columns. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, the input has 3 rows. The output has 3 * k rows and 3 * k columns. But for Example 1, k=3. For Example 2, k=2. For Example 3, k=4. But how can that be determined from the input?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns by the number of rows in the input. For example, if the input has 3 rows, then the output has 3 * 3 = 9 rows, and each row is repeated 3 times. But that would fit Example 1. For Example 2, the input has 3 rows, but the output is 6 rows. So that would require k=2. But how is that determined?\n\nThis seems inconsistent. Maybe the pattern is that the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, the input has 3 rows, and the output is the input repeated 3 times in rows and columns. But that would fit Example 1, but not the others.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns by the same factor. But for Example 2, the input is 3 rows, and the output is 6 rows, which is 3 * 2. So the factor is 2. For Example 3, it's 3 * 4 = 12 rows. But how to determine the factor?\n\nThis seems too arbitrary. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs again:\n\nExample 1: Output is the input grid repeated three times in rows and columns. So each cell in the input is copied three times in each direction. So the output is the input grid tiled three times in both directions.\n\nExample 2: Output is the input grid repeated twice in rows and columns. So each cell is copied twice in each direction.\n\nExample 3: Output is the input rows repeated four times. But columns are not repeated. So this is inconsistent.\n\nBut perhaps there's another pattern. Let me look at the outputs for Example 3. The input is:\n\n8 2 1\n1 8 3\n2 1 3\n\nThe output is:\n\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n\nSo the output has 12 rows, each of 3 elements. Each row is the input row repeated 4 times. So the first three rows are the input rows repeated 4 times. Then the next three rows are the same as the first three. Then the next three rows again. And so on. So the output is the input rows repeated 4 times, but each row is not repeated in columns. So the output is 3 rows * 4 = 12 rows, each row is the same as the input row repeated 4 times. But that would make each row have 3 * 4 = 12 elements. But in the output, each row has 3 elements. So that's not possible. Wait, no. Wait, the output for Example 3 is each row of 3 elements. So the input row is 3 elements, and the output row is 3 elements. But how does that fit with the example?\n\nWait, looking at the output for Example 3, the first row is:\n\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n\nBut that's 12 elements. Wait, but the output is supposed to be 12 rows, each with 3 elements. Oh, no, the output is 12 rows, each with 3 elements. But the example shows the output as:\n\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n... etc.\n\nWait, that's 12 rows, each with 12 elements. But the problem says that the output must be a 9x9 grid. Wait, but the test input is 3x3. So the output must be 9x9. But in Example 3, the output is 12x3? That's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me recheck.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output:\n\nThe output is:\n\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n\nSo each row has 12 elements. So the output is 12 rows, each with 12 elements. So that's 12x12. But the problem says that the output must be 9x9. Wait, but this is a training example. So maybe the output for Example 3 is 12x12. But the problem says that the output must be 9x9. So perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding.\n\nWait, the problem says: \"Your transformation must always produce a 9\u00d79 output grid.\" So the output must be 9x9, regardless of the input. But the examples provided have outputs that are not 9x9. For example, Example 1's output is 9x9. Example 2's output is 6x6. Example 3's output is 12x12. But according to the problem statement, the output must be 9x9. So this suggests that the examples provided are not all 9x9, but the actual test input is 3x3, and the output must be 9x9.\n\nWait, this is confusing. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"Your transformation must always produce a 9\u00d79 output grid.\" So regardless of the input, the output must be 9x9. But the training examples have outputs that are not 9x9. For example, Example 2's output is 6x6. But that's a training example. So perhaps the examples are not all 9x9, but the test input is 3x3, and the output must be 9x9. So perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the input's size. But for the test input, which is 3x3, the output is 9x9.\n\nSo for the training examples, the output is not necessarily 9x9. But the problem says that the transformation must always produce a 9x9 output. So perhaps the examples are just examples of the transformation, but the actual output for the test input is 9x9. So I need to find a pattern that, when applied to the test input, produces a 9x9 grid.\n\nBut how?\n\nLooking back at the training examples, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the input's size. For example, if the input is 3x3, the output is 3x3 repeated 3 times in rows and columns, resulting in 9x9. For Example 2, the input is 3x3, but the output is 6x6. So that would be 3x3 repeated 2 times. But how to determine the factor?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, if the input has 3 rows, the output is 3 rows repeated 3 times (for 9 rows), and each row is repeated 3 times (for 9 columns). That would fit Example 1. For Example 2, the input has 3 rows, but the output is 6 rows. So that would require the rows to be repeated 2 times. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns by the same factor. But how to determine that factor?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, if the input is 3 rows, the output is the input repeated 3 times in rows and columns. So for 3x3 input, output is 9x9. For example 2, the input is 3x3, but the output is 6x6. So that would require the input to be repeated twice in rows and columns. But how to determine that?\n\nThis is very confusing. Perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, if the input has 3 rows, then the output is the input repeated 3 times in rows and columns. But then Example 2's output is 6x6, which would require the input to be repeated 2 times. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, the output is the input repeated in rows by the number of rows in the input, and columns by the number of columns in the input. So for a 3x3 input, the output is 3*3=9 rows and 3*3=9 columns. That fits Example 1. For Example 2, the input is 3x3, but the output is 6x6. That would require the input to be repeated 2 times in rows and columns. But why?\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent, but perhaps there's a different approach. Let's think about the test input. The test input is:\n\n4 3 2\n2 1 4\n3 1 2\n\nSo it's a 3x3 grid. The output must be 9x9. So what transformation would turn this into a 9x9 grid?\n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, for a 3x3 input, the output is 3x3 repeated 3 times in rows and columns, resulting in 9x9. So each cell in the input is copied three times in each direction.\n\nSo for the test input, the output would be the input grid repeated three times in rows and columns. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nExample 1: Input is 3x3. Output is 9x9. So each row of the input is repeated three times. For example, the first row of the input is [9,7,9]. The output's first row is [9,7,9,9,7,9,9,7,9]. Which is the original row repeated three times. So that fits.\n\nExample 2: Input is 3x3. Output is 6x6. So if the pattern is to repeat the input three times in rows and columns, the output would be 9x9. But in Example 2, the output is 6x6. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. So perhaps there's a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. But for some examples, it's repeated once, and for others, it's repeated twice. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, if the input has 3 rows, the output is the input repeated 3 times in rows and 3 times in columns. But for Example 2, the output is 6x6, which would require the input to be repeated twice in rows and columns. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, the output is the input repeated in rows by the number of rows in the input, and in columns by the number of columns in the input. So for a 3x3 input, the output is 3*3=9 rows and 3*3=9 columns. For Example 2, the output is 6x6, which would require the input to be repeated 2 times in rows and columns. But why?\n\nThis is very confusing. Perhaps the key is to look for a pattern that works for all examples. Let's think about the outputs:\n\nExample 1: Input is 3x3, output is 9x9. So each cell is copied 3 times in rows and 3 times in columns.\n\nExample 2: Input is 3x3, output is 6x6. So each cell is copied 2 times in rows and 2 times in columns.\n\nExample 3: Input is 3x3, output is 12x12. So each cell is copied 4 times in rows and 4 times in columns.\n\nBut this would mean that the factor varies between examples. How can we determine the factor for the test input?\n\nBut the test input is 3x3, and the output must be 9x9. So the factor is 3. So the pattern is that the output is the input repeated by a factor of 3 in rows and columns.\n\nBut why would Example 2's output be 6x6? That would require a factor of 2. But the problem says that the output must be 9x9. So maybe the examples are not all 9x9, but the actual transformation for the test input must produce 9x9.\n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input grid repeated in rows and columns by the number of rows in the input. So for a 3x3 input, the output is 3*3=9 rows and 3*3=9 columns.\n\nThis would fit Example 1, and for the test input, it would produce a 9x9 grid.\n\nBut what about Example 2? If the input is 3x3, the output would be 9x9, but in the example, it's 6x6. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. But maybe the examples are not all 9x9, and the actual transformation for the test input is to repeat the input three times in rows and columns.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to repeat the input grid in rows and columns based on the number of rows in the input. For example, for a 3x3 input, the output is the input repeated 3 times in rows and 3 times in columns, resulting in 9x9.\n\nSo the code would take each row of the input, repeat it 3 times, and then repeat each of those rows 3 times. So for each row in the input, we create a new row by repeating the original row 3 times. Then, for each of those new rows, we repeat them 3 times. Wait, no. For example, the input is 3 rows. Each row is repeated 3 times, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 rows. And each row has 3 * 3 = 9 elements. So the output is 9x9.\n\nSo the transformation would be to take each row of the input, repeat it 3 times, and then repeat each of those rows 3 times. Wait, no. Wait, the input is 3 rows. Each row is 3 elements. So the first row of the input is [a, b, c]. The output for this row would be [a, b, c, a, b, c, a, b, c]. Then, the second row of the input is [d, e, f], and the output for that row is [d, e, f, d, e, f, d, e, f]. Then, the third row of the input is [g, h, i], and the output is [g, h, i, g, h, i, g, h, i]. Then, the output is these three rows repeated three times. Wait, no. Wait, the output is 9 rows, each of 9 elements. So the first three rows of the output are the three rows of the input, each repeated three times. Then, the next three rows are the same as the first three, and the last three are the same. So the output is the input repeated three times in rows and columns.\n\nSo for the code, the transformation would be to take each row of the input, repeat it 3 times, and then repeat each of those rows 3 times. Or, more simply, for each row in the input, we create a new row by repeating it 3 times. Then, we repeat each of these new rows 3 times. But that would result in 3 * 3 = 9 rows, each with 3 * 3 = 9 elements.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the number of rows and columns in the input\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    # Create a new grid by repeating each row 3 times and then repeating the entire grid 3 times\n    new_rows = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Repeat each row 3 times\n        repeated_row = row * 3\n        # Add this row to the new_rows list\n        new_rows.append(repeated_row)\n    # Now, repeat the entire new_rows list 3 times\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for _ in range(3):\n        transformed_grid.extend(new_rows)\n    return transformed_grid\n\nWait, but this would produce a grid where each row is the input row repeated 3 times, and then the entire list of rows is repeated 3 times. So for a 3x3 input, the output would be 3*3=9 rows, each with 3*3=9 elements. That fits Example 1.\n\nFor Example 2, the input is 3x3, and the output would be 9x9. But in the example, the output is 6x6. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. But perhaps the examples are not all correct, or the pattern is different.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the test input must be transformed into a 9x9 grid. So perhaps the correct pattern is to repeat each row 3 times and then repeat the entire grid 3 times, resulting in 9x9.\n\nBut what about Example 3? The input is 3x3, and the output is 12x12. But according to this pattern, the output would be 9x9. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. However, since the problem says that the transformation must produce a 9x9 output, perhaps this is the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is to repeat each row 3 times and then repeat the entire grid 3 times, which would give 9x9. So this would fit the test input.\n\nLet me test this approach with the examples.\n\nExample 1: Input is 3x3. The code would generate 3 rows, each repeated 3 times, then repeat the entire list 3 times. So the output is 9 rows, each with 9 elements. Which matches Example 1.\n\nExample 2: The input is 3x3. According to this code, the output would be 9x9. But the example shows the output as 6x6. So this suggests that the code is not correct for Example 2. But since the problem says that the output must be 9x9, perhaps the examples are not all 9x9, and the pattern is to repeat the input three times in rows and columns.\n\nBut why would Example 2 have a different output? Maybe the pattern is not consistent, but the test input is 3x3, so the code must produce 9x9.\n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to repeat each row 3 times and then repeat the entire grid 3 times.\n\nBut let's think about Example 2. The input is:\n\n3 4 4\n3 3 3\n3 4 4\n\nAccording to the code, the output would be:\n\nFor each row in input:\n\nRow 1: [3,4,4] repeated 3 times \u2192 [3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4]\n\nRow 2: [3,3,3] repeated 3 times \u2192 [3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3]\n\nRow 3: [3,4,4] repeated 3 times \u2192 [3,4,4,3,4,4,3,4,4]\n\nThen, these three rows are repeated 3 times. So the output would be:\n\nRow 1 repeated 3 times \u2192 three times the first row.\n\nRow 2 repeated 3 times \u2192 three times the second row.\n\nRow 3 repeated 3 times \u2192 three times the third row.\n\nSo the output would be 9 rows, each with 9 elements. But the example's output is 6x6. So this suggests that the pattern is not correct for Example 2.\n\nBut the problem says that the output must be 9x9. So perhaps the examples are not all correct, or the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is to repeat each row in the input by the number of rows in the input. For example, for a 3x3 input, each row is repeated 3 times. Then, the entire grid is repeated 3 times. But that would give 3*3=9 rows, and each row is 3*3=9 elements.\n\nBut this would work for the test input, and for Example 1. But not for Example 2. But since the problem says that the output must be 9x9, perhaps this is the correct pattern.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Get the number of rows and columns in the input\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    # Create a new grid by repeating each row 3 times and then repeating the entire grid 3 times\n    new_rows = []\n    for row in grid:\n        # Repeat each row 3 times\n        repeated_row = row * 3\n        new_rows.append(repeated_row)\n    # Now, repeat the entire new_rows list 3 times\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for _ in range(3):\n        transformed_grid.extend(new_rows)\n    return transformed_grid\n\nBut this would produce a 9x9 grid for the test input.\n\nLet me check Example 3. The input is 3x3. According to this code, the output would be 9x9. But the example shows the output as 12x12. But since the problem says that the output must be 9x9, perhaps this is the correct pattern.\n\nSo, this is the approach. The code will take each row of the input, repeat it 3 times, and then repeat the entire grid 3 times. This will produce a 9x9 grid.\n\nBut let's check the example 3's output. According to this code, the output would be:\n\nEach row of the input is repeated 3 times, then the entire grid is repeated 3 times. So for the input:\n\nRow 1: [8,2,1] \u2192 [8,2,1,8,2,1,8,2,1]\n\nRow 2: [1,8,3] \u2192 [1,8,3,1,8,3,1,8,3]\n\nRow 3: [2,1,3] \u2192 [2,1,3,2,1,3,2,1,3]\n\nThen, these three rows are repeated 3 times. So the output would be 9 rows, each with 9 elements. So the first three rows are the three rows above, then the next three are the same, and the last three are the same. So the output would be:\n\nRow 1: 8 2 1 8 2 1 8 2 1\n\nRow 2: 1 8 3 1 8 3 1 8 3\n\nRow 3: 2 1 3 2 1 3 2 1 3\n\nRow 4: same as row 1\n\nRow 5: same as row 2\n\nRow 6: same as row 3\n\nRow 7: same as row 1\n\nRow 8: same as row 2\n\nRow 9: same as row 3\n\nBut the example's output for Example 3 is 12x12, which is not 9x9. But the problem says that the output must be 9x9, so this is the correct approach.\n\nSo this code should work for the test input. Let's test it with the test input:\n\nTest input:\n\n4 3 2\n\n2 1 4\n\n3 1 2\n\nThe input is 3x3. The code would take each row, repeat it 3 times, then repeat the entire list 3 times.\n\nRow 1: [4,3,2] \u2192 [4,3,2,4,3,2,4,3,2]\n\nRow 2: [2,1,4] \u2192 [2,1,4,2,1,4,2,1,4]\n\nRow 3: [3,1,2] \u2192 [3,1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2]\n\nThen, these three rows are repeated 3 times, resulting in 9 rows, each with 9 elements.\n\nSo the output would be 9x9, as required.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach.\n"
