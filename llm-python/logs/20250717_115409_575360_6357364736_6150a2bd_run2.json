Reversing the order of rows\n2. Reversing the order of columns in each row\n3. Some kind of value transformation (e.g., 3 becomes 8, 5 becomes 2, etc.)\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Reverses the order of rows\n- Reverses the order of columns in each row\n- Applies a value transformation (e.g., 0 becomes 0, 3 becomes 8, 5 becomes 2, etc.)\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse the order of rows\n    reversed_rows = grid[::-1]\n    \n    # Reverse the order of columns in each row\n    reversed_columns = [row[::-1] for row in reversed_rows]\n    \n    # Apply value transformation (this is a simple mapping based on examples)\n    # This is a simple mapping that needs to be adjusted based on more examples\n    value_mapping = {\n        0: 0,\n        3: 8,\n        5: 2,\n        7: 3,\n        8: 3\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the value transformation\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in reversed_columns:\n        transformed_row = [value_mapping.get(val, val) for val in row]\n        transformed_grid.append(transformed_row)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse the order of rows\n    reversed_rows = grid[::-1]\n    \n    # Reverse the order of columns in each row\n    reversed_columns = [row[::-1] for row in reversed_rows]\n    \n    # Apply value transformation (this is a simple mapping based on examples)\n    # This is a simple mapping that needs to be adjusted based on more examples\n    value_mapping = {\n        0: 0,\n        3: 8,\n        5: 2,\n        7: 3,\n        8: 3\n    }\n    \n    # Apply the value transformation\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for row in reversed_columns:\n        transformed_row = [value_mapping.get(val, val) for val in row]\n        transformed_grid.append(transformed_row)\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
