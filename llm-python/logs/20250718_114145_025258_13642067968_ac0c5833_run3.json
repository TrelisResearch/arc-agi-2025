The transformation seems to involve spreading or expanding certain values (like 4, 2, and 0) in specific patterns.\n2. Values like 4 and 2 appear to be \"spread out\" or \"expanded\" in certain regions of the grid.\n3. The transformation appears to involve some kind of diffusion or propagation of values from certain positions to their neighbors.\n4. The transformation seems to involve creating new values (like 2) in certain positions based on the original values.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads values from certain positions to their neighbors in a specific pattern.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert the grid to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the spread pattern\n    # This is a simple diffusion pattern that spreads values to neighboring cells\n    # We'll use a kernel to spread values\n    spread_kernel = np.array([[0, 1, 0],\n                              [1, 1, 1],\n                              [0, 1, 0]])\n    \n    # Apply the spread pattern to the grid\n    # We'll use convolution with the spread kernel\n    from scipy.signal import convolve2d\n    transformed_grid = convolve2d(transformed_grid, spread_kernel, mode='same', boundary='fill', fillvalue=0)\n    \n    # Apply some additional transformation based on the training examples\n    # This is a simple rule that replaces 4 with 2 in certain positions\n    # This is a simplified version of what I observed in the training examples\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    spread_kernel = np.array([[0, 1, 0],\n                              [1, 1, 1],\n                              [0, 1, 0]])\n    \n    transformed_grid = np.convolve2d(transformed_grid, spread_kernel, mode='same', boundary='fill', fillvalue=0)\n    \n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",

The transformation appears to involve some kind of diffusion or propagation of values from certain positions to their neighbors.\n4. The transformation seems to involve creating new values (like 2) in certain positions based on the original values.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads values from certain positions to their neighbors in a specific pattern.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert the grid to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the spread pattern\n    # This is a simple diffusion pattern that spreads values to neighboring cells\n    # We'll use a kernel to spread values\n    spread_kernel = np.array([[0, 1, 0],\n                              [1, 1, 1],\n                              [0, 1, 0]])\n    \n    # Apply the spread pattern to the grid\n    # We'll use convolution with the spread kernel\n    from scipy.signal import convolve2d\n    transformed_grid = convolve2d(transformed_grid, spread_kernel, mode='same', boundary='fill', fillvalue=0)\n    \n    # Apply some additional transformation based on the training examples\n    # This is a simple rule that replaces 4 with 2 in certain positions\n    # This is a simplified version of what I observed in the training examples\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    spread_kernel = np.array([[0, 1, 0],\n                              [1, 1, 1],\n                              [0, 1, 0]])\n    \n    transformed_grid = np.convolve2d(transformed_grid, spread_kernel, mode='same', boundary='fill', fillvalue=0)\n    \n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
