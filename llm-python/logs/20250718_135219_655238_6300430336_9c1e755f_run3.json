          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let's take each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has a 3x3 block of 5s in the third row, then some 5s and 6s and 9s in the fifth row. The output changes those 5s to 6s and 6s to 9s. Wait, the input's third row has 5 in column 2, then the fifth row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9. The output for those rows has 5, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9. So maybe there's some kind of propagation or spread of numbers. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has a 5 in the first row, then a 5 in the second row, and so on. The output seems to have some kind of pattern where certain rows are mirrored or transformed. For example, the input's row 8 has 5,4,3,3,4,4,4,0,0,0. The output for that row is the same as the input. But other rows like row 7 in the input is 5,7,3,7,7,3,3,0,0,0. The output for that row is the same. Wait, but in the output, the rows 7 and 8 are the same as input? Or maybe not. Wait, the output for example 2 is such that the first row is all zeros, then the second row is 5,4,3,3,4,4,4,0,0,0. Then the third row is 5,7,3,7,7,3,3,0,0,0. Then the fourth row is 5,4,3,3,4,4,4,0,0,0 again. So it seems like there's some kind of alternation between two patterns. Like rows 2 and 3 are different, but rows 4 and 5 are same as row 2? Or maybe rows 2 and 4 are same, and rows 3 and 5 are same? Not sure. But the output seems to have some kind of pattern where certain rows are copied or modified based on their position.\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input has a row with 5s in the middle, then rows with 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 1. The output for those rows has the numbers spread out. For example, the second row in input is 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0. The output is same. But the third row in input is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So the 2 is spread to the right. Similarly, the fourth row input is 0 1 0 ... and the output is 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... So it seems that in the input, there are certain positions where numbers are present, and in the output, they are spread out to the right, filling in the adjacent cells. So maybe the pattern is that when a number is present in a cell, it propagates to the right, filling consecutive cells until another number is encountered. But how?\n\nIn Example 4, the input has a 5 in column 6 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), and then some other numbers. The output seems to have some spread of numbers. For example, in the input, row 0 has 5 5 5 5 in columns 6-9. The output has the same. Then in row 1, input has 5 in column 0, then 0s, then 3 in column 6. The output for that row is 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3. So the 3 in column 6 is spread to the right. Also, there's a 7 in column 6 of row 3, which becomes 7 in the output. So maybe the transformation is that when a number is present in a cell, it propagates to the right, but only if the next cell is 0. Or maybe it's a spread of numbers to the right, replacing zeros with the same number. But how?\n\nLooking for a common pattern. In example 3, the input has a 2 in column 1, and the output has 2s from column 1 to 6. Similarly for 1, 6, etc. So it seems that when a number is present in a cell, it spreads to the right as far as possible, filling consecutive cells. But how does that work? For example, in example 3, the input has a 2 in column 1, and the output has 2s from column 1 to 6. So that's 6 cells. But why? Because the original cell is in column 1, and then the next cells are 0. So maybe the rule is that any non-zero value in a cell will spread to the right as far as possible, replacing zeros with the same value. But how to determine the spread?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a matter of replacing all zeros in a row with the nearest non-zero value to the left. But that's not clear. For example, in example 3, the third row has a 2 in column 1. The output has 2s from column 1 to 6. So maybe the 2 spreads to the right until it hits a non-zero value. But in that case, the next cell after column 6 is 0, so it would spread further. But in example 3, the output for row 3 is 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So the 2 is spread from column 1 to 6. So perhaps the rule is that in each row, any non-zero value will spread to the right as long as the next cell is zero. But how to handle overlapping regions?\n\nAnother possibility is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, filling consecutive cells. For example, in example 3, the input row 3 is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So the 2 is spread to the right until the next non-zero value. But in that case, the next non-zero is 0, so it's spread all the way. But how does that work for multiple non-zero values in a row?\n\nLooking at example 2, the input row 7 is 5 7 3 7 7 3 3 0 0 0. The output is same as input. But row 8 is 5 4 3 3 4 4 4 0 0 0. The output is same as input. But in the output, row 7 and 8 are same as input. So maybe that's not the case. Wait, but in example 2, the output is such that the rows 2 and 3 are same as input, but rows 4 and 5 are same as row 2. Hmm, maybe the pattern is that certain rows are copied, but others are transformed. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the numbers. For example, in example 1, the 5s in the third row are spread to the right, and the 6s and 9s are also spread. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, any non-zero value is spread to the right, but only if the next cell is zero. But how to handle overlapping?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are spread to the right, replacing zeros with the same value as the first non-zero in the row. But that doesn't fit with example 3. For example, in example 3's row 3, the first non-zero is 2 in column 1, so all the zeros to the right are replaced with 2. But in example 3's row 4, the input is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So that's the same as the first idea.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each row, any non-zero value in the row is spread to the right as far as possible, replacing zeros with the same value. But how to determine the spread? For example, in a row like 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, the 5 would spread to the right, filling all the zeros with 5. But in example 3, the row 3 is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So the 2 is spread to the right until the next non-zero. But in this case, there is no non-zero after the 2. So the spread is to the right until the end of the row. But what if there are multiple non-zero values in the same row?\n\nFor example, suppose a row is 5 0 0 3 0 0 0. Then according to the rule, the 5 would spread to the right, replacing zeros with 5 until the 3. So the row would become 5 5 5 3 0 0 0. But then the 3 would spread to the right. But in that case, the 3 would spread to the right, replacing zeros with 3. So the final row would be 5 5 5 3 3 3 3. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nLooking at example 4. The input row 1 is 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output for that row is 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3. So the 5 is in column 0, and the 3 is in column 6. The output has 5, then 6, then 3, then 6, 3, then 0, then 3, etc. So the 5 is not spread. The 3 is spread to the right, but there's a 6 in between. So this suggests that the previous idea is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spread is not just to the right, but depends on some other factors. Maybe the numbers are spread based on their position in the grid. For example, in example 4, the input has a 5 in column 0, and then in the output, that 5 is replaced with 6. But that doesn't fit with the previous examples. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern based on the position of the numbers. For example, in example 1, the 5s are in column 2, and the output has 5s in column 2, but then the 6s and 9s are spread. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for the differences between input and output in each example.\n\nIn example 1, the input has 5 in row 2, column 2, then in the output, that 5 is still there, but in row 5, column 2, the 5 is replaced with 6, and then in row 5, column 5, 6 is replaced with 9. So maybe the 5s are spread to the right, but the 6s are spread further. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's non-zero, then the cells to the right and below are filled with the same value. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to the right. In example 4, the 3 in column 6 is spread to the right, but the 5 in column 0 is not spread. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the first non-zero value is spread to the right, replacing zeros with that value. But in example 4, the input row 1 is 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output for that row is 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3. So the first non-zero is 5, which is spread to the right, but in the output, the 5 is followed by 6. So that doesn't fit with the idea.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the examples in terms of how the output is generated.\n\nLooking at example 3 again. The input row 3 is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So the 2 is spread to the right. Similarly, the input row 4 is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So the 1 is spread to the right. Then in row 5, input is 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Output is 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0. So again, the 6 is spread to the right. So maybe the rule is that in each row, any non-zero value is spread to the right as far as possible, replacing zeros with the same value. But how to handle when there are multiple non-zero values in the same row?\n\nFor example, if a row is 2 0 0 3 0 0 0. Then the 2 would spread to the right until the 3. So the row becomes 2 2 2 3 3 3 3. But how does that work?\n\nBut in example 4, the input row 1 is 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output is 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3. So the 5 is not spread. The 3 is spread to the right. But the 5 is in column 0, and the output has 5 followed by 6, then 3. So that doesn't fit with the previous idea. So perhaps the rule is more complex.\n\nAnother possibility is that the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where the numbers are spread in a way that depends on their position in the grid. For example, in example 4, the 5 in column 0 is replaced with 6. But why? Maybe the 5 is in a certain row or column that triggers a different transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's non-zero, then the cell to the right and below are filled with the same value. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are spread to the right, but only if they are in certain columns. For example, in example 3, the 2 is in column 1, and the spread is to the right. But in example 4, the 3 is in column 6, and the spread is to the right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is limited by the nearest non-zero value to the left. For example, in example 3, the 2 is in column 1, so it spreads to the right until the next non-zero. But since there is none, it spreads all the way. But in example 4, the 3 is in column 6, and the spread is to the right. But how does that work with the 5 in column 0?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think of the examples as having a pattern where non-zero values are spread to the right, replacing zeros with the same value. So for each row, we look for the first non-zero value, and then spread it to the right as far as possible. But in example 4, the input row 1 is 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output is 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3. So the first non-zero is 5. But in the output, it's replaced with 6. That doesn't fit with the idea. So that suggests that the spread is not just based on the first non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are spread to the right, but the spread is determined by the position of the cell in the row. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to the right. But in example 4, the 3 is spread to the right. But why in example 4, the 5 is not spread? Maybe the 5 is in a certain position that doesn't trigger the spread.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is limited by the nearest non-zero value to the left. For example, in row 1 of example 4, the first non-zero is 5. The next non-zero is 3 in column 6. So the 5 is spread to the right until the 3. But in the output, the 5 is followed by 6, which is not the same as 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spread is based on the row's position. For example, in example 3, the rows are spread in a certain way, but in example 4, the rows are spread differently. This is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps I should think of the examples in terms of the transformation being that for each row, any non-zero value is spread to the right, but the spread is done in a way that replaces zeros with the same value as the first non-zero in the row. But in example 4, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are spread to the right, but the spread is determined by the value of the cell. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to the right. In example 4, the 3 is spread to the right, and the 5 is not spread. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are spread to the right, but the spread is done in a way that depends on the value of the cell. For example, if a cell is 5, it is spread to the right, but if it's 6, it is spread further. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's non-zero, then the cells to the right and below are filled with the same value. But this would require checking for each cell and propagating the value. However, this might not fit with the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1, the input has a 5 in row 2, column 2. The output has the same 5 there. But in row 5, column 2, there's a 5, which is replaced with 6. So that doesn't fit with the idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are spread to the right, but the spread is limited to certain positions. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to the right, but in example 4, the 3 is spread to the right, but the 5 is not. This is not helpful.\n\nMaybe I should think of the examples as having a pattern where the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is determined by the nearest non-zero value to the left. So, for example, in a row like 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, the 2 is spread to the right until the end. In a row like 0 2 0 3 0 0 0, the 2 is spread to the right until the 3, and the 3 is spread to the right.\n\nBut in example 4, the input row 1 is 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output for that row is 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3. So the 5 is not spread, but the 3 is spread. So why is the 5 not spread? Maybe because it's in a certain position, like the first column, and the 3 is in column 6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is done in a way that depends on the row's position. For example, in example 3, the rows are spread in a certain way, but in example 4, the rows are spread differently.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of the examples as having a pattern where for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, and the spread is done in a way that fills all consecutive zeros with the same value. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to the right. In example 4, the 3 is spread to the right. But why in example 4's row 1, the 5 is not spread? Maybe because it's in a certain position, like the first column, and the transformation is not applied to it. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is limited to a certain number of cells. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to 6 cells, but in example 4, the 3 is spread to 4 cells.\n\nThis is getting too frustrating. Maybe I should think of the examples as having a pattern where for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, and the spread is done by replacing zeros with the same value as the first non-zero in the row. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1: input row 2 is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The first non-zero is 5. So the spread would be 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. But the output for row 2 is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nExample 3: input row 3 is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The first non-zero is 2. So the spread would be 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 4: input row 1 is 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The first non-zero is 5. So the spread would be 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 3 3 3. But the output is 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this approach works for example 3, but not for example 4. So maybe it's not the correct pattern.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is determined by the value of the cell. For example, a 5 is spread to the right, but a 6 is spread further. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is done in a way that depends on their position in the grid. For example, in example 1, the 5 in column 2 is spread to the right, but the 6 in column 5 is spread further. But I don't see a clear pattern.\n\nMaybe I should think about the examples in terms of how the output is generated. For example, in example 3, the output is the same as the input for the first row, but the second row is the same as input. But the third row is transformed. So maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, and the spread is done in a way that the value is replaced with the value of the first non-zero in the row. But again, this doesn't fit with example 4.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I can see. Let's focus on example 3 and example 1.\n\nExample 3: the input has a 2 in column 1, and the output has 2s from column 1 to 6. Similarly for 1 and 6. So this suggests that the spread is to the right, replacing zeros with the same value as the first non-zero in the row.\n\nExample 1: the input has a 5 in column 2 of row 2, and in row 5, the 5 is replaced with 6, and the 6 is replaced with 9. So maybe the spread is not just to the right, but also to the bottom? Or perhaps it's a combination of spreading to the right and down.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's non-zero, then the cell to the right and below are filled with the same value. For example, in example 1, the 5 in row 2, column 2 is spread to the right and down. But in the output, the 5 is in row 2, column 2, and in row 5, column 2, there's a 5, which is replaced with 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero cell, it propagates to the right and down, but in a way that depends on the value. For example, in example 1, the 5 in row 2, column 2 is spread to the right, but the 6 is spread further.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: think about the transformation as a kind of morphological operation. For example, in image processing, dilation. Maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero cell, it is expanded to the right and down, filling zeros with the same value. But how to implement this?\n\nFor example, in example 3, the 2 in column 1 is expanded to the right, and the 1 is expanded to the right. So this would be a dilation operation. But in example 1, the 5 in row 2, column 2 is expanded to the right, but the 6 is expanded further.\n\nBut how to handle multiple cells? For example, if there are multiple non-zero cells in a row, how do they interact?\n\nIf I think of the transformation as a dilation operation, where each non-zero cell is expanded to the right and down, then for each cell (i,j), if it's non-zero, then all cells to the right and below it are filled with the same value. But this would require that the values are propagated in all directions, which might not fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, and for each column, the non-zero values are spread downward. But how to handle this.\n\nFor example, in example 3, the 2 in column 1 is spread to the right, and the 2 in column 1 of row 3 is spread down. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, and for each column, the non-zero values are spread downward. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I can see. Let's assume that the transformation is that for each row, any non-zero value is spread to the right, replacing zeros with the same value. This would work for example 3 and example 1's rows 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's see.\n\nIn example 1, the input row 2 is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So this doesn't fit with the hypothesis. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is limited by the nearest non-zero value to the right. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is done in a way that the value is replaced with the next value in a certain sequence. For example, in example 1, the 5 is replaced with 6, then 6 with 9. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the next value in a certain sequence. For example, 5 \u2192 6 \u2192 9. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, and the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to the right, and the 2 is replaced with 2. But this is the same as before.\n\nI think I need to make a decision. Based on example 3, the hypothesis is that for each row, any non-zero value is spread to the right, replacing zeros with the same value. Let's try to implement this.\n\nSo for each row in the input grid, we process it to replace zeros with the same value as the first non-zero in the row, but only if the cell to the right is zero.\n\nWait, but in example 3, the first non-zero in row 3 is 2 in column 1. So the row becomes 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Which matches the output.\n\nIn example 1, the input row 2 is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The first non-zero is 5 in column 2. So the row would become 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. But the output is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So this doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at example 1 again. The input has a 5 in row 2, column 2, and then in row 5, column 2, there's a 5. In the output, this 5 is replaced with 6, and the 6 is replaced with 9. So maybe the value is increasing as we move down the rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's non-zero, then the cell to the right and below are filled with the same value, but this would require checking for each cell and propagating the value.\n\nBut how to implement this. For example, for each cell (i,j), if it's non-zero, then for all cells (i, k) where k >= j, set to the same value. And similarly for cells (k, j) where k >= i.\n\nBut this would make the entire row and column filled with the same value. But in example 1, this would not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero cell, it is expanded to the right and down, but only if the cell is in a certain position.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, perhaps I should proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, non-zero values are spread to the right, replacing zeros with the same value. Even though it doesn't fit example 1, maybe there's a different explanation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is limited to a certain number of cells. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to 6 cells. But in example 1, the 5 is spread to 3 cells.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is done in a way that the value is replaced with the next value in a certain sequence. For example, 5 \u2192 6 \u2192 9. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to write code that for each row, spreads non-zero values to the right, replacing zeros with the same value as the first non-zero in the row. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it might be the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n   find the first non-zero value in the row\n   if there is one:\n       for each column from that position to the end of the row:\n           if the cell is zero, set it to the first non-zero value\n           else, leave it as is\n\nBut this would work for example 3, but not example 1. However, maybe example 1 is an exception, or maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLet's test this with example 1's input:\n\nInput row 2: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 first non-zero is 5 at column 2. So the row becomes 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. But the output is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So this doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the transformation is more complex. Maybe for each cell, if it's non-zero, then it is spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the next value in a certain sequence. For example, 5 \u2192 6 \u2192 9. But how to determine that sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left. For example, if a cell is non-zero, then the cell to the right is set to the same value. But this would require processing the row from left to right.\n\nLet's try this for example 3:\n\nRow 3: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 process from left to right. The first non-zero is 2. The next cell is 0, so set to 2. Then next cell is 0, set to 2. And so on. This gives 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0, which matches the output.\n\nFor example 1's row 2: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 process from left to right. The first non-zero is 5. Set the next cells to 5. So the row becomes 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. But the output is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So this doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps there's another pattern. Maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the next value in a sequence. For example, 5 is replaced with 6, then 6 with 9. But how to determine this sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left. But this is the same as the previous approach.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for other patterns. Let's look at example 4's input and output.\n\nInput row 1: 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3.\n\nSo the 5 is in column 0, and the output has 5 followed by 6, then 3, then 6, 3, 0, 3, etc. So the 5 is not spread, but the 3 is spread to the right. So perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, if a non-zero is in column 6, it is spread to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left. But in this case, the 3 in column 6 is spread to the right, but the 5 is not. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left, except for the first non-zero in the row. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, replacing zeros with the same value as the first non-zero in the row. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it might be the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(10):\n        row = transformed[i]\n        first_non_zero = None\n        for j in range(10):\n            if row[j] != 0:\n                first_non_zero = j\n                break\n        if first_non_zero is not None:\n            for j in range(first_non_zero, 10):\n                if row[j] == 0:\n                    row[j] = row[first_non_zero]\n    return transformed\n\nBut let's test this with example 3. For example 3's input row 3: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 first_non_zero is 1. So for j from 1 to 9, set to 2. So the row becomes 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Which matches the output.\n\nFor example 1's input row 2: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 first_non_zero is 2. So j from 2 to 9: set to 5. So row becomes 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. But the output is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So this doesn't fit. So this code would not work for example 1.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left. But this would require processing from left to right.\n\nWait, in example 1's row 5, the input is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. The output is the same as input. So perhaps the code is not needed for that row. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but only if it's not already non-zero. This is the same as the previous approach.\n\nBut this doesn't fit example 1. So maybe the code is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but only if it's not already non-zero. This is the same as before.\n\nBut this doesn't fit example 1.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with this code, even if it doesn't fit all examples. Maybe the other examples are special cases, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but only if the cell is in a certain column. For example, in example 1, the 5 is in column 2, and the 6 is in column 3, which is to the right. But this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think I'll proceed with the code that spreads non-zero values to the right, replacing zeros with the first non-zero value in the row. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. Let's take each example one by one.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has a 3x3 block of 5s in the third row, then some 5s and 6s and 9s in the fifth row. The output changes those 5s to 6s and 6s to 9s. Wait, the input's third row has 5 in column 2, then the fifth row has 5, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9. The output for those rows has 5, 6, 6, 6, 9, 9, 9. So maybe there's some kind of propagation or spread of numbers. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has a 5 in the first row, then a 5 in the second row, and so on. The output seems to have some kind of pattern where certain rows are mirrored or transformed. For example, the input's row 8 has 5,4,3,3,4,4,4,0,0,0. The output for that row is the same as the input. But other rows like row 7 in the input is 5,7,3,7,7,3,3,0,0,0. The output for that row is the same. Wait, but in the output, the rows 7 and 8 are the same as input? Or maybe not. Wait, the output for example 2 is such that the first row is all zeros, then the second row is 5,4,3,3,4,4,4,0,0,0. Then the third row is 5,7,3,7,7,3,3,0,0,0. Then the fourth row is 5,4,3,3,4,4,4,0,0,0 again. So it seems like there's some kind of alternation between two patterns. Like rows 2 and 3 are different, but rows 4 and 5 are same as row 2? Or maybe rows 2 and 4 are same, and rows 3 and 5 are same? Not sure. But the output seems to have some kind of pattern where certain rows are copied or modified based on their position.\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input has a row with 5s in the middle, then rows with 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 1. The output for those rows has the numbers spread out. For example, the second row in input is 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0. The output is same. But the third row in input is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So the 2 is spread to the right. Similarly, the fourth row input is 0 1 0 ... and the output is 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 ... So it seems that in the input, there are certain positions where numbers are present, and in the output, they are spread out to the right, filling in the adjacent cells. So maybe the pattern is that when a number is present in a cell, it propagates to the right, filling consecutive cells until another number is encountered. But how?\n\nIn Example 4, the input has a 5 in column 6 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), and then some other numbers. The output seems to have some spread of numbers. For example, in the input, row 0 has 5 5 5 5 in columns 6-9. The output has the same. Then in row 1, input has 5 in column 0, then 0s, then 3 in column 6. The output for that row is 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3. So the 3 in column 6 is spread to the right. Also, there's a 7 in column 6 of row 3, which becomes 7 in the output. So maybe the transformation is that when a number is present in a cell, it propagates to the right, but only if the next cell is 0. Or maybe it's a spread of numbers to the right, replacing zeros with the same number. But how?\n\nLooking for a common pattern. In example 3, the input has a 2 in column 1, and the output has 2s from column 1 to 6. Similarly for 1, 6, etc. So it seems that when a number is present in a cell, it spreads to the right as far as possible, filling consecutive cells. But how does that work? For example, in example 3, the input has a 2 in column 1, and the output has 2s from column 1 to 6. So that's 6 cells. But why? Because the original cell is in column 1, and then the next cells are 0. So maybe the rule is that any non-zero value in a cell will spread to the right as far as possible, replacing zeros with the same value. But how to determine the spread?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a matter of replacing all zeros in a row with the nearest non-zero value to the left. But that's not clear. For example, in example 3, the third row has a 2 in column 1. The output has 2s from column 1 to 6. So maybe the 2 spreads to the right until it hits a non-zero value. But in that case, the next cell after column 6 is 0, so it would spread further. But in example 3, the output for row 3 is 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So the 2 is spread from column 1 to 6. So perhaps the rule is that in each row, any non-zero value will spread to the right as long as the next cell is zero. But how to handle overlapping regions?\n\nAnother possibility is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, filling consecutive cells. For example, in example 3, the input row 3 is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So the 2 is spread to the right until the next non-zero value. But in that case, the next non-zero is 0, so it's spread all the way. But how does that work for multiple non-zero values in a row?\n\nLooking at example 2, the input row 7 is 5 7 3 7 7 3 3 0 0 0. The output is same as input. But row 8 is 5 4 3 3 4 4 4 0 0 0. The output is same as input. But in the output, row 7 and 8 are same as input. So maybe that's not the case. Wait, but in example 2, the output is such that the rows 2 and 3 are same as input, but rows 4 and 5 are same as row 2. Hmm, maybe the pattern is that certain rows are copied, but others are transformed. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the numbers. For example, in example 1, the 5s in the third row are spread to the right, and the 6s and 9s are also spread. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, any non-zero value is spread to the right, but only if the next cell is zero. But how to handle overlapping?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are spread to the right, replacing zeros with the same value as the first non-zero in the row. But that doesn't fit with example 3. For example, in example 3's row 3, the first non-zero is 2 in column 1, so all the zeros to the right are replaced with 2. But in example 3's row 4, the input is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So that's the same as the first idea.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each row, any non-zero value in the row is spread to the right as far as possible, replacing zeros with the same value. But how to determine the spread? For example, in a row like 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, the 5 would spread to the right, filling all the zeros with 5. But in example 3, the row 3 is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So the 2 is spread to the right until the next non-zero. But in this case, there is no non-zero after the 2. So the spread is to the right until the end of the row. But what if there are multiple non-zero values in the same row?\n\nFor example, suppose a row is 5 0 0 3 0 0 0. Then according to the rule, the 5 would spread to the right, replacing zeros with 5 until the 3. So the row would become 5 5 5 3 0 0 0. But then the 3 would spread to the right. But in that case, the 3 would spread to the right, replacing zeros with 3. So the final row would be 5 5 5 3 3 3 3. But how does that fit with the examples?\n\nLooking at example 4. The input row 1 is 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output for that row is 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3. So the 5 is in column 0, and the 3 is in column 6. The output has 5, then 6, then 3, then 6, 3, then 0, then 3, etc. So the 5 is not spread. The 3 is spread to the right, but there's a 6 in between. So this suggests that the previous idea is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spread is not just to the right, but depends on some other factors. Maybe the numbers are spread based on their position in the grid. For example, in example 4, the input has a 5 in column 0, and then in the output, that 5 is replaced with 6. But that doesn't fit with the previous examples. So perhaps that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern based on the position of the numbers. For example, in example 1, the 5s are in column 2, and the output has 5s in column 2, but then the 6s and 9s are spread. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for the differences between input and output in each example.\n\nIn example 1, the input has 5 in row 2, column 2, then in the output, that 5 is still there, but in row 5, column 2, the 5 is replaced with 6, and then in row 5, column 5, 6 is replaced with 9. So maybe the 5s are spread to the right, but the 6s are spread further. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's non-zero, then the cells to the right and below are filled with the same value. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to the right. In example 4, the 3 in column 6 is spread to the right, but the 5 in column 0 is not spread. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the first non-zero value is spread to the right, replacing zeros with that value. But in example 4, the input row 1 is 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output for that row is 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3. So the first non-zero is 5, which is spread to the right, but in the output, the 5 is followed by 6. So that doesn't fit with the idea.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the examples in terms of how the output is generated.\n\nLooking at example 3 again. The input row 3 is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So the 2 is spread to the right. Similarly, the input row 4 is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So the 1 is spread to the right. Then in row 5, input is 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Output is 0 6 6 6 6 6 6 0 0 0. So again, the 6 is spread to the right. So maybe the rule is that in each row, any non-zero value is spread to the right as far as possible, replacing zeros with the same value. But how to handle when there are multiple non-zero values in the same row?\n\nFor example, if a row is 2 0 0 3 0 0 0. Then the 2 would spread to the right until the 3. So the row becomes 2 2 2 3 3 3 3. But how does that work?\n\nBut in example 4, the input row 1 is 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output is 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3. So the 5 is not spread. The 3 is spread to the right. But the 5 is in column 0, and the output has 5 followed by 6, then 3. So that doesn't fit with the previous idea. So perhaps the rule is more complex.\n\nAnother possibility is that the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where the numbers are spread in a way that depends on their position in the grid. For example, in example 4, the 5 in column 0 is replaced with 6. But why? Maybe the 5 is in a certain row or column that triggers a different transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's non-zero, then the cell to the right and below are filled with the same value. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are spread to the right, but only if they are in certain columns. For example, in example 3, the 2 is in column 1, and the spread is to the right. But in example 4, the 3 is in column 6, and the spread is to the right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is limited by the nearest non-zero value to the left. For example, in example 3, the 2 is in column 1, so it spreads to the right until the next non-zero. But since there is none, it spreads all the way. But in example 4, the 3 is in column 6, and the spread is to the right. But how does that work with the 5 in column 0?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should think of the examples as having a pattern where non-zero values are spread to the right, replacing zeros with the same value. So for each row, we look for the first non-zero value, and then spread it to the right as far as possible. But in example 4, the input row 1 is 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output is 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3. So the first non-zero is 5. But in the output, it's replaced with 6. That doesn't fit with the idea. So that suggests that the spread is not just based on the first non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are spread to the right, but the spread is determined by the position of the cell in the row. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to the right. But in example 4, the 3 is spread to the right. But why in example 4, the 5 is not spread? Maybe the 5 is in a certain position that doesn't trigger the spread.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is limited by the nearest non-zero value to the left. For example, in row 1 of example 4, the first non-zero is 5. The next non-zero is 3 in column 6. So the 5 is spread to the right until the 3. But in the output, the 5 is followed by 6, which is not the same as 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the spread is based on the row's position. For example, in example 3, the rows are spread in a certain way, but in example 4, the rows are spread differently. This is getting too vague.\n\nPerhaps I should think of the examples in terms of the transformation being that for each row, any non-zero value is spread to the right, but the spread is done in a way that replaces zeros with the same value as the first non-zero in the row. But in example 4, that doesn't fit. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are spread to the right, but the spread is determined by the value of the cell. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to the right. In example 4, the 3 is spread to the right, and the 5 is not spread. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are spread to the right, but the spread is done in a way that depends on the value of the cell. For example, if a cell is 5, it is spread to the right, but if it's 6, it is spread further. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's non-zero, then the cells to the right and below are filled with the same value. But this would require checking for each cell and propagating the value. However, this might not fit with the examples.\n\nLooking at example 1, the input has a 5 in row 2, column 2. The output has the same 5 there. But in row 5, column 2, there's a 5, which is replaced with 6. So that doesn't fit with the idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the numbers are spread to the right, but the spread is limited to certain positions. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to the right, but in example 4, the 3 is spread to the right, but the 5 is not. This is not helpful.\n\nMaybe I should think of the examples as having a pattern where the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is determined by the nearest non-zero value to the left. So, for example, in a row like 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0, the 2 is spread to the right until the end. In a row like 0 2 0 3 0 0 0, the 2 is spread to the right until the 3, and the 3 is spread to the right.\n\nBut in example 4, the input row 1 is 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The output for that row is 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3. So the 5 is not spread, but the 3 is spread. So why is the 5 not spread? Maybe because it's in a certain position, like the first column, and the 3 is in column 6. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is done in a way that depends on the row's position. For example, in example 3, the rows are spread in a certain way, but in example 4, the rows are spread differently.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of the examples as having a pattern where for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, and the spread is done in a way that fills all consecutive zeros with the same value. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to the right. In example 4, the 3 is spread to the right. But why in example 4's row 1, the 5 is not spread? Maybe because it's in a certain position, like the first column, and the transformation is not applied to it. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is limited to a certain number of cells. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to 6 cells, but in example 4, the 3 is spread to 4 cells.\n\nThis is getting too frustrating. Maybe I should think of the examples as having a pattern where for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, and the spread is done by replacing zeros with the same value as the first non-zero in the row. Let's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1: input row 2 is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The first non-zero is 5. So the spread would be 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. But the output for row 2 is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nExample 3: input row 3 is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The first non-zero is 2. So the spread would be 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 4: input row 1 is 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0. The first non-zero is 5. So the spread would be 5 5 5 5 5 5 3 3 3 3. But the output is 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. So this approach works for example 3, but not for example 4. So maybe it's not the correct pattern.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is determined by the value of the cell. For example, a 5 is spread to the right, but a 6 is spread further. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is done in a way that depends on their position in the grid. For example, in example 1, the 5 in column 2 is spread to the right, but the 6 in column 5 is spread further. But I don't see a clear pattern.\n\nMaybe I should think about the examples in terms of how the output is generated. For example, in example 3, the output is the same as the input for the first row, but the second row is the same as input. But the third row is transformed. So maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but only if they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, and the spread is done in a way that the value is replaced with the value of the first non-zero in the row. But again, this doesn't fit with example 4.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I can see. Let's focus on example 3 and example 1.\n\nExample 3: the input has a 2 in column 1, and the output has 2s from column 1 to 6. Similarly for 1 and 6. So this suggests that the spread is to the right, replacing zeros with the same value as the first non-zero in the row.\n\nExample 1: the input has a 5 in column 2 of row 2, and in row 5, the 5 is replaced with 6, and the 6 is replaced with 9. So maybe the spread is not just to the right, but also to the bottom? Or perhaps it's a combination of spreading to the right and down.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's non-zero, then the cell to the right and below are filled with the same value. For example, in example 1, the 5 in row 2, column 2 is spread to the right and down. But in the output, the 5 is in row 2, column 2, and in row 5, column 2, there's a 5, which is replaced with 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero cell, it propagates to the right and down, but in a way that depends on the value. For example, in example 1, the 5 in row 2, column 2 is spread to the right, but the 6 is spread further.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: think about the transformation as a kind of morphological operation. For example, in image processing, dilation. Maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero cell, it is expanded to the right and down, filling zeros with the same value. But how to implement this?\n\nFor example, in example 3, the 2 in column 1 is expanded to the right, and the 1 is expanded to the right. So this would be a dilation operation. But in example 1, the 5 in row 2, column 2 is expanded to the right, but the 6 is expanded further.\n\nBut how to handle multiple cells? For example, if there are multiple non-zero cells in a row, how do they interact?\n\nIf I think of the transformation as a dilation operation, where each non-zero cell is expanded to the right and down, then for each cell (i,j), if it's non-zero, then all cells to the right and below it are filled with the same value. But this would require that the values are propagated in all directions, which might not fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, and for each column, the non-zero values are spread downward. But how to handle this.\n\nFor example, in example 3, the 2 in column 1 is spread to the right, and the 2 in column 1 of row 3 is spread down. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, and for each column, the non-zero values are spread downward. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I can see. Let's assume that the transformation is that for each row, any non-zero value is spread to the right, replacing zeros with the same value. This would work for example 3 and example 1's rows 2, 3, 4, 5. Let's see.\n\nIn example 1, the input row 2 is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So this doesn't fit with the hypothesis. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is limited by the nearest non-zero value to the right. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is done in a way that the value is replaced with the next value in a certain sequence. For example, in example 1, the 5 is replaced with 6, then 6 with 9. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the next value in a certain sequence. For example, 5 \u2192 6 \u2192 9. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, and the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to the right, and the 2 is replaced with 2. But this is the same as before.\n\nI think I need to make a decision. Based on example 3, the hypothesis is that for each row, any non-zero value is spread to the right, replacing zeros with the same value. Let's try to implement this.\n\nSo for each row in the input grid, we process it to replace zeros with the same value as the first non-zero in the row, but only if the cell to the right is zero.\n\nWait, but in example 3, the first non-zero in row 3 is 2 in column 1. So the row becomes 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Which matches the output.\n\nIn example 1, the input row 2 is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The first non-zero is 5 in column 2. So the row would become 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. But the output is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So this doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at example 1 again. The input has a 5 in row 2, column 2, and then in row 5, column 2, there's a 5. In the output, this 5 is replaced with 6, and the 6 is replaced with 9. So maybe the value is increasing as we move down the rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's non-zero, then the cell to the right and below are filled with the same value, but this would require checking for each cell and propagating the value.\n\nBut how to implement this. For example, for each cell (i,j), if it's non-zero, then for all cells (i, k) where k >= j, set to the same value. And similarly for cells (k, j) where k >= i.\n\nBut this would make the entire row and column filled with the same value. But in example 1, this would not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero cell, it is expanded to the right and down, but only if the cell is in a certain position.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, perhaps I should proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, non-zero values are spread to the right, replacing zeros with the same value. Even though it doesn't fit example 1, maybe there's a different explanation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is limited to a certain number of cells. For example, in example 3, the 2 is spread to 6 cells. But in example 1, the 5 is spread to 3 cells.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the spread is done in a way that the value is replaced with the next value in a certain sequence. For example, 5 \u2192 6 \u2192 9. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to write code that for each row, spreads non-zero values to the right, replacing zeros with the same value as the first non-zero in the row. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it might be the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input grid:\n   find the first non-zero value in the row\n   if there is one:\n       for each column from that position to the end of the row:\n           if the cell is zero, set it to the first non-zero value\n           else, leave it as is\n\nBut this would work for example 3, but not example 1. However, maybe example 1 is an exception, or maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLet's test this with example 1's input:\n\nInput row 2: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 first non-zero is 5 at column 2. So the row becomes 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. But the output is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So this doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the transformation is more complex. Maybe for each cell, if it's non-zero, then it is spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the next value in a certain sequence. For example, 5 \u2192 6 \u2192 9. But how to determine that sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left. For example, if a cell is non-zero, then the cell to the right is set to the same value. But this would require processing the row from left to right.\n\nLet's try this for example 3:\n\nRow 3: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 process from left to right. The first non-zero is 2. The next cell is 0, so set to 2. Then next cell is 0, set to 2. And so on. This gives 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0, which matches the output.\n\nFor example 1's row 2: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 process from left to right. The first non-zero is 5. Set the next cells to 5. So the row becomes 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. But the output is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So this doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps there's another pattern. Maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the next value in a sequence. For example, 5 is replaced with 6, then 6 with 9. But how to determine this sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left. But this is the same as the previous approach.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for other patterns. Let's look at example 4's input and output.\n\nInput row 1: 5 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 \u2192 output is 5 6 3 6 3 0 3 3 3 3.\n\nSo the 5 is in column 0, and the output has 5 followed by 6, then 3, then 6, 3, 0, 3, etc. So the 5 is not spread, but the 3 is spread to the right. So perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, if a non-zero is in column 6, it is spread to the right. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left. But in this case, the 3 in column 6 is spread to the right, but the 5 is not. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left, except for the first non-zero in the row. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear pattern, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, replacing zeros with the same value as the first non-zero in the row. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it might be the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(10):\n        row = transformed[i]\n        first_non_zero = None\n        for j in range(10):\n            if row[j] != 0:\n                first_non_zero = j\n                break\n        if first_non_zero is not None:\n            for j in range(first_non_zero, 10):\n                if row[j] == 0:\n                    row[j] = row[first_non_zero]\n    return transformed\n\nBut let's test this with example 3. For example 3's input row 3: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 first_non_zero is 1. So for j from 1 to 9, set to 2. So the row becomes 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Which matches the output.\n\nFor example 1's input row 2: 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 first_non_zero is 2. So j from 2 to 9: set to 5. So row becomes 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5. But the output is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. So this doesn't fit. So this code would not work for example 1.\n\nBut maybe there's another pattern. Perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left. But this would require processing from left to right.\n\nWait, in example 1's row 5, the input is 0 0 5 6 6 6 9 9 9 0. The output is the same as input. So perhaps the code is not needed for that row. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but only if it's not already non-zero. This is the same as the previous approach.\n\nBut this doesn't fit example 1. So maybe the code is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but only if it's not already non-zero. This is the same as before.\n\nBut this doesn't fit example 1.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with this code, even if it doesn't fit all examples. Maybe the other examples are special cases, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the non-zero values are spread to the right, but the value is replaced with the value of the cell to the left, but only if the cell is in a certain column. For example, in example 1, the 5 is in column 2, and the 6 is in column 3, which is to the right. But this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time I've spent, I think I'll proceed with the code that spreads non-zero values to the right, replacing zeros with the first non-zero value in the row. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n"
