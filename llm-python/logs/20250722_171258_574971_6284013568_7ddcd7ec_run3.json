In Example 1, the number 3 appears in a diagonal pattern from the top-left to bottom-right, spreading outwards.\n2. In Example 2, the number 4 appears in a diagonal pattern from the top-left to bottom-right, spreading outwards.\n3. In Example 3, the number 7 appears in a diagonal pattern from the top-left to bottom-right, spreading outwards.\n\nFrom these examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading a number (from the input) in a diagonal pattern from the top-left to bottom-right, spreading outwards.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the position of the non-zero value\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value diagonally from (i,j) to bottom-right\n                for dx in range(1, 10 - i):\n                    for dy in range(1, 10 - j):\n                        if i + dx < 10 and j + dy < 10:\n                            transformed_grid[i + dx][j + dy] = grid[i][j]\n                # Also spread the value diagonally from (i,j) to top-left\n                for dx in range(1, 10 - i):\n                    for dy in range(1, 10 - j):\n                        if i - dx >= 0 and j - dy >= 0:\n                            transformed_grid[i - dx][j - dy] = grid[i][j]\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the position of the non-zero value\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value diagonally from (i,j) to bottom-right\n                for dx in range(1, 10 - i):\n                    for dy in range(1, 10 - j):\n                        if i + dx < 10 and j + dy < 10:\n                            transformed_grid[i + dx][j + dy] = grid[i][j]\n                # Also spread the value diagonally from (i,j) to top-left\n                for dx in range(1, 10 - i):\n                    for dy in range(1, 10 - j):\n                        if i - dx >= 0 and j - dy >= 0:\n                            transformed_grid[i - dx][j - dy] = grid[i][j]\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 1, the number 3 appears in a diagonal pattern from the top-left to bottom-right, spreading outwards.\n2. In Example 2, the number 4 appears in a diagonal pattern from the top-left to bottom-right, spreading outwards.\n3. In Example 3, the number 7 appears in a diagonal pattern from the top-left to bottom-right, spreading outwards.\n\nFrom these examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading a number (from the input) in a diagonal pattern from the top-left to bottom-right, spreading outwards.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the position of the non-zero value\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value diagonally from (i,j) to bottom-right\n                for dx in range(1, 10 - i):\n                    for dy in range(1, 10 - j):\n                        if i + dx < 10 and j + dy < 10:\n                            transformed_grid[i + dx][j + dy] = grid[i][j]\n                # Also spread the value diagonally from (i,j) to top-left\n                for dx in range(1, 10 - i):\n                    for dy in range(1, 10 - j):\n                        if i - dx >= 0 and j - dy >= 0:\n                            transformed_grid[i - dx][j - dy] = grid[i][j]\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the position of the non-zero value\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value diagonally from (i,j) to bottom-right\n                for dx in range(1, 10 - i):\n                    for dy in range(1, 10 - j):\n                        if i + dx < 10 and j + dy < 10:\n                            transformed_grid[i + dx][j + dy] = grid[i][j]\n                # Also spread the value diagonally from (i,j) to top-left\n                for dx in range(1, 10 - i):\n                    for dy in range(1, 10 - j):\n                        if i - dx >= 0 and j - dy >= 0:\n                            transformed_grid[i - dx][j - dy] = grid[i][j]\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
