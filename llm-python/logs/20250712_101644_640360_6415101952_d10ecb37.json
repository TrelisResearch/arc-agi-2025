          "Analyzing the training examples provided, the key observations are:\n\n1. **Input grids are larger (mostly 6x6 or more)**, but the outputs are always **2x2 grids**.\n2. The outputs seem to be **derived from some prominent features** of the input, likely involving **specific colors/patterns**.\n3. In the first example: \n   - Input is a 6x6 grid with various colors.\n   - Output is the top-left corner, containing the cell `4 3` and `6 0`.\n   - This suggests selecting certain regions based on either color prominence or position.\n   \n4. In the second example:\n   - The output is again a 2x2 grid, with values `2 4` and `2 5`.\n   - The input has a repeated pattern; it seems that the output is derived from the most common or significant colors in the top-left region or globally.\n   \n5. In the third example:\n   - The output is again a 2x2 grid with `3 2` and `1 4`.\n   - The input is a larger, completely filled grid with multiple colors.\n   \n6. **Overall hypothesis:**\n   - The output appears to be a 2x2 grid extracted from the input, perhaps from the top-left region, or based on some dominant colors or patterns.\n   - Given the variation, a plausible pattern is \"select the most common colors in the input\" and map them to a 2x2 grid.\n   \n7. In the test input:\n   - Colors include values (like 9, 6, 2, 5, etc.), which may be related to the dominant or prominent colors.\n\n### Approach:\n- Use the training examples to **identify the most common colors** in the input.\n- Then, **pick the top 2 and bottom 2 most common colors** to fill the 2x2 output.\n- Alternatively, since the examples show focusing on prominent colors in the top-left or dividing the grid into regions, I will implement a solution that:\n  - Counts color frequencies.\n  - Selects the two most frequent colors for the first row.\n  - Selects the next two most frequent colors for the second row.\n  \nThis is an educated heuristic to model the observed pattern.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Flatten grid to count the frequency of each color\n    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]\n    from collections import Counter\n    count = Counter(flat)\n\n    # Get the most common colors\n    most_common = [color for color, _ in count.most_common(4)]\n\n    # Build the 2x2 output grid with the top four most common colors\n    # Split into two rows\n    top_row = most_common[:2]\n    bottom_row = most_common[2:4]\n\n    transformed_grid = [top_row, bottom_row]\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- Counts color frequency globally.\n- Uses the most common four colors.\n- Forms a 2x2 output with top two as row 1, bottom two as row 2.\n\n**Note:** this approach is based on pattern heuristics and may not perfectly match every example, but it captures the core idea of feature extraction and reduction to a 2x2 grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n\n    # Flatten grid to count the frequency of each color\n    flat = [cell for row in grid for cell in row]\n    from collections import Counter\n    count = Counter(flat)\n\n    # Get the most common colors\n    most_common = [color for color, _ in count.most_common(4)]\n\n    # Build the 2x2 output grid with the top four most common colors\n    # Split into two rows\n    top_row = most_common[:2]\n    bottom_row = most_common[2:4]\n\n    transformed_grid = [top_row, bottom_row]\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
