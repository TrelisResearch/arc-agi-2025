The output grid always has a 13x13 size\n2. The transformation seems to involve creating a \"spread\" of 5s around certain positions\n3. The 8 in Example 1 seems to be the center of a pattern that spreads 5s\n4. In Example 2, the 8 is in a different position and the pattern spreads 5s in a different way\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Creating a \"spread\" of 5s around certain positions\n- The spread pattern depends on the position of the 8 in the input grid\n- The spread pattern seems to be a diamond shape expanding from the 8\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the position of the 8 in the input grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Create a diamond pattern of 5s around the 8\n                # The diamond has a radius of 3 (from the example)\n                for x in range(i-3, i+4):\n                    for y in range(j-3, j+4):\n                        if 0 <= x < 13 and 0 <= y < 13:\n                            # Check if the position is within the diamond\n                            if abs(x - i) + abs(y - j) <= 6:\n                                transformed[x][y] = 5\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find the position of the 8 in the input grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Create a diamond pattern of 5s around the 8\n                # The diamond has a radius of 3 (from the example)\n                for x in range(i-3, i+4):\n                    for y in range(j-3, j+4):\n                        if 0 <= x < 13 and 0 <= y < 13:\n                            # Check if the position is within the diamond\n                            if abs(x - i) + abs(y - j) <= 6:\n                                transformed[x][y] = 5\n                break\n        else:\n            continue\n        break\n    \n    return transformed\n```",
