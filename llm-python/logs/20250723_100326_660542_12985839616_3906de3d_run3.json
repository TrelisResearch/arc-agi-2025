          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find a pattern that maps input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that:\n1. The transformation seems to involve propagating values from certain positions to neighboring cells\n2. Values of 2 in the input seem to \"spread\" to adjacent cells, turning them into 1s\n3. There's a pattern where certain cells in the input become 2s in the output, which then influence their neighbors\n\nBased on this, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Identifying cells with value 2 in the input\n- Turning those cells into 1s in the output\n- Propagating the value 1 to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell has value 2, turn it into 1\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                \n                # Propagate the value 1 to adjacent cells\n                # Check up\n                if i > 0 and transformed_grid[i-1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j] = 1\n                # Check down\n                if i < 9 and transformed_grid[i+1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = 1\n                # Check left\n                if j > 0 and transformed_grid[i][j-1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j-1] = 1\n                # Check right\n                if j < 9 and transformed_grid[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = 1\n                    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # If the cell has value 2, turn it into 1\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                \n                # Propagate the value 1 to adjacent cells\n                # Check up\n                if i > 0 and transformed_grid[i-1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j] = 1\n                # Check down\n                if i < 9 and transformed_grid[i+1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = 1\n                # Check left\n                if j > 0 and transformed_grid[i][j-1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j-1] = 1\n                # Check right\n                if j < 9 and transformed_grid[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = 1\n                    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
