It appears that the output grid is formed by repeating the input grid in a certain pattern, possibly in a way that creates a tiling or repetition of the input pattern.\n\nFrom the examples, it seems that the output grid is formed by repeating the input grid in a way that creates a 3x3 tiling of the input pattern. For example, in Example 1, the input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 9x9 grid formed by repeating the input pattern in a 3x3 tiling.\n\nBased on this observation, I will implement a transformation that repeats the input grid in a 3x3 tiling pattern.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 3x3 tiling of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # Repeat the input grid in a 3x3 tiling pattern\n            for row in grid:\n                transformed_grid.append(row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 3x3 tiling of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # Repeat the input grid in a 3x3 tiling pattern\n            for row in grid:\n                transformed_grid.append(row)\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
