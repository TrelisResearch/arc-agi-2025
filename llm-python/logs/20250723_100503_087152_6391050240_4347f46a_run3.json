The output grid always has a 18x16 size\n2. There are patterns where certain values (like 8, 6, 5, 4) are transformed in specific ways\n3. Some values are replaced with 0s or other values in specific patterns\n4. There seems to be a pattern where certain values are \"split\" or \"broken\" into smaller segments\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Keeps the 18x16 size\n- Replaces certain values with 0s or other values in specific patterns\n- Maintains the general structure of the input grid\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the pattern we're trying to implement\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on observations from the training examples\n    # We're trying to replace certain values with 0s or other values in specific patterns\n    \n    # For each row in the grid\n    for row_idx in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        # For each column in the row\n        for col_idx in range(len(transformed_grid[row_idx])):\n            # Check if the value is 8 and we're in a specific pattern\n            if transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 8:\n                # Check if we're in a specific pattern (e.g., in the middle of the grid)\n                if row_idx in [1, 2] and col_idx in [1, 2, 3, 4]:\n                    # Replace with 0\n                    transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0\n            # Check if the value is 6 and we're in a specific pattern\n            elif transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 6:\n                # Check if we're in a specific pattern (e.g., in the middle of the grid)\n                if row_idx in [10, 11, 12, 13] and col_idx in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]:\n                    # Replace with 0\n                    transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0\n            # Check if the value is 5 and we're in a specific pattern\n            elif transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 5:\n                # Check if we're in a specific pattern (e.g., in the middle of the grid)\n                if row_idx in [1, 2] and col_idx in [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]:\n                    # Replace with 0\n                    transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0\n            # Check if the value is 4 and we're in a specific pattern\n            elif transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 4:\n                # Check if we're in a specific pattern (e.g., in the middle of the grid)\n                if row_idx in [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and col_idx in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:\n                    # Replace with 0\n                    transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the pattern we're trying to implement\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on observations from the training examples\n    # We're trying to replace certain values with 0s or other values in specific patterns\n    \n    # For each row in the grid\n    for row_idx in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        # For each column in the row\n        for col_idx in range(len(transformed_grid[row_idx])):\n            # Check if the value is 8 and we're in a specific pattern\n            if transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 8:\n                # Check if we're in a specific pattern (e.g., in the middle of the grid)\n                if row_idx in [1, 2] and col_idx in [1, 2, 3, 4]:\n                    # Replace with 0\n                    transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0\n            # Check if the value is 6 and we're in a specific pattern\n            elif transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 6:\n                # Check if we're in a specific pattern (e.g., in the middle of the grid)\n                if row_idx in [10, 11, 12, 13] and col_idx in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]:\n                    # Replace with 0\n                    transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0\n            # Check if the value is 5 and we're in a specific pattern\n            elif transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 5:\n                # Check if we're in a specific pattern (e.g., in the middle of the grid)\n                if row_idx in [1, 2] and col_idx in [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]:\n                    # Replace with 0\n                    transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0\n            # Check if the value is 4 and we're in a specific pattern\n            elif transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 4:\n                # Check if we're in a specific pattern (e.g., in the middle of the grid)\n                if row_idx in [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and col_idx in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:\n                    # Replace with 0\n                    transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

There are patterns where values are spread out or grouped in specific ways\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Leaves 0s unchanged\n- Replaces 8s with 8s in certain positions\n- Replaces 6s with 6s in certain positions\n- Replaces 5s with 5s in certain positions\n- Replaces 4s with 4s in certain positions\n- Replaces other values with 0s or other values based on patterns observed\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new 18x16 grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(16)] for _ in range(18)]\n    \n    # Copy values from input grid to transformed grid\n    for row in range(18):\n        for col in range(16):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row][col] == 8:\n                # Keep 8s in certain positions\n                if row == 1 or row == 2 or row == 3 or row == 7 or row == 8 or row == 9 or row == 10 or row == 11:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row][col] == 6:\n                # Keep 6s in certain positions\n                if row == 10 or row == 11 or row == 12 or row == 13 or row == 14:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 6\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row][col] == 5:\n                # Keep 5s in certain positions\n                if row == 1 or row == 2 or row == 3 or row == 4 or row == 5 or row == 6 or row == 7 or row == 8 or row == 9 or row == 10 or row == 11:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 5\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row][col] == 4:\n                # Keep 4s in certain positions\n                if row == 6 or row == 7 or row == 8 or row == 9 or row == 10 or row == 11 or row == 12 or row == 13 or row == 14:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 4\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            else:\n                # Replace other values with 0s\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new 18x16 grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(16)] for _ in range(18)]\n    \n    # Copy values from input grid to transformed grid\n    for row in range(18):\n        for col in range(16):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row][col] == 8:\n                # Keep 8s in certain positions\n                if row == 1 or row == 2 or row == 3 or row == 7 or row == 8 or row == 9 or row == 10 or row == 11:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row][col] == 6:\n                # Keep 6s in certain positions\n                if row == 10 or row == 11 or row == 12 or row == 13 or row == 14:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 6\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row][col] == 5:\n                # Keep 5s in certain positions\n                if row == 1 or row == 2 or row == 3 or row == 4 or row == 5 or row == 6 or row == 7 or row == 8 or row == 9 or row == 10 or row == 11:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 5\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row][col] == 4:\n                # Keep 4s in certain positions\n                if row == 6 or row == 7 or row == 8 or row == 9 or row == 10 or row == 11 or row == 12 or row == 13 or row == 14:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 4\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            else:\n                # Replace other values with 0s\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid always has a 18x16 size\n2. There are patterns where certain values (like 8, 6, 5, 4) are transformed in specific ways\n3. Some values are replaced with 0s or other values in specific patterns\n4. There seems to be a pattern where certain values are \"split\" or \"broken\" into smaller segments\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Keeps the 18x16 size\n- Replaces certain values with 0s or other values in specific patterns\n- Maintains the general structure of the input grid\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the pattern we're trying to implement\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on observations from the training examples\n    # We're trying to replace certain values with 0s or other values in specific patterns\n    \n    # For each row in the grid\n    for row_idx in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        # For each column in the row\n        for col_idx in range(len(transformed_grid[row_idx])):\n            # Check if the value is 8 and we're in a specific pattern\n            if transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 8:\n                # Check if we're in a specific pattern (e.g., in the middle of the grid)\n                if row_idx in [1, 2] and col_idx in [1, 2, 3, 4]:\n                    # Replace with 0\n                    transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0\n            # Check if the value is 6 and we're in a specific pattern\n            elif transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 6:\n                # Check if we're in a specific pattern (e.g., in the middle of the grid)\n                if row_idx in [10, 11, 12, 13] and col_idx in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]:\n                    # Replace with 0\n                    transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0\n            # Check if the value is 5 and we're in a specific pattern\n            elif transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 5:\n                # Check if we're in a specific pattern (e.g., in the middle of the grid)\n                if row_idx in [1, 2] and col_idx in [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]:\n                    # Replace with 0\n                    transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0\n            # Check if the value is 4 and we're in a specific pattern\n            elif transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 4:\n                # Check if we're in a specific pattern (e.g., in the middle of the grid)\n                if row_idx in [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and col_idx in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:\n                    # Replace with 0\n                    transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the pattern we're trying to implement\n    # This is a simplified pattern based on observations from the training examples\n    # We're trying to replace certain values with 0s or other values in specific patterns\n    \n    # For each row in the grid\n    for row_idx in range(len(transformed_grid)):\n        # For each column in the row\n        for col_idx in range(len(transformed_grid[row_idx])):\n            # Check if the value is 8 and we're in a specific pattern\n            if transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 8:\n                # Check if we're in a specific pattern (e.g., in the middle of the grid)\n                if row_idx in [1, 2] and col_idx in [1, 2, 3, 4]:\n                    # Replace with 0\n                    transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0\n            # Check if the value is 6 and we're in a specific pattern\n            elif transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 6:\n                # Check if we're in a specific pattern (e.g., in the middle of the grid)\n                if row_idx in [10, 11, 12, 13] and col_idx in [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]:\n                    # Replace with 0\n                    transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0\n            # Check if the value is 5 and we're in a specific pattern\n            elif transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 5:\n                # Check if we're in a specific pattern (e.g., in the middle of the grid)\n                if row_idx in [1, 2] and col_idx in [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]:\n                    # Replace with 0\n                    transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0\n            # Check if the value is 4 and we're in a specific pattern\n            elif transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] == 4:\n                # Check if we're in a specific pattern (e.g., in the middle of the grid)\n                if row_idx in [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and col_idx in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:\n                    # Replace with 0\n                    transformed_grid[row_idx][col_idx] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
