Preserving the original 5s in some positions\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces 5s with 2s in certain positions and spreads 2s around them.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the size of the grid\n    height = len(transformed_grid)\n    width = len(transformed_grid[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(height):\n        for j in range(width):\n            # If the cell contains a 5, replace it with 2 and spread 2s around it\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Replace the 5 with 2\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                \n                # Spread 2s in all directions\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < height and 0 <= nj < width:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the size of the grid\n    height = len(transformed_grid)\n    width = len(transformed_grid[0])\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(height):\n        for j in range(width):\n            # If the cell contains a 5, replace it with 2 and spread 2s around it\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Replace the 5 with 2\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                \n                # Spread 2s in all directions\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < height and 0 <= nj < width:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
