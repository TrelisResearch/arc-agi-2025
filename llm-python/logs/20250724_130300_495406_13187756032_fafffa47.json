The output grid is always 3x3\n2. The output seems to be based on the top 3x3 portion of the input (the first 3 rows)\n3. The value 2 appears in positions where there are 9s in the input\n4. But it's not a simple replacement - there seems to be some kind of pattern or rule\n\nLet me look more carefully at the relationship:\n\nIn Example 1: 9s in positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\nOutput has 2s in positions (0,0), (1,0) - this doesn't seem directly related\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe it's about counting neighbors or some spatial relationship.\n\nActually, let me check if there's a pattern with the bottom 3x3 affecting the top:\n\nLooking more systematically:\n- It seems like the algorithm might be looking at 2x2 patterns or specific configurations\n- In example 2, 2s appear at (0,1) and (2,1) - middle column\n- In example 4, 2s appear at (0,1) and (2,0)\n\nLet me try a different approach - maybe it's about detecting specific patterns in the 3x3 grid and placing 2s accordingly.\n\nLooking at it again:\n- Example 3: Input has a diagonal pattern, output also has a diagonal pattern\n- Example 5: 9s form an L shape on the right, output has 2s at (0,0) and (0,2)\n\nLet me consider that this might be about detecting corners or specific arrangements of 9s.\n\nActually, let me try to see if there's a pattern based on rows or columns:\n- Rows with more 9s might produce 2s in specific positions\n- Or maybe it's about isolated 9s vs connected 9s\n\nLet me look at this differently. What if the output 2s are placed based on some kind of \"corner detection\" or \"end point\" detection in the pattern of 9s?\n\nLooking at example 1:\n9s at: (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\nThis forms a shape with \"ends\" or corners at (0,1), (1,2), (2,0)\nBut output has 2s at (0,0), (1,0)\n\nLet me try one more approach - maybe it's about the \"background\" or negative space of the 9s pattern.\n\nActually, let me look at what happens to isolated 9s vs connected 9s.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n9s at: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)\nOutput 2s at: (0,1), (2,1) - these are positions adjacent to 9s but not 9s themselves\n\nWait, let me check if it's about counting neighbors:\nFor each position, count how many 9s are in adjacent positions (including diagonals), and if that count meets some criteria, place a 2.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis:\n\nFor example 1:\nPosition (0,0): adjacent to (0,1)=9, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=9 -> 2 neighbors that are 9\nPosition (0,1): this is a 9, so maybe skip\nPosition (1,0): adjacent to (0,0)=0, (0,1)=9, (1,1)=9, (2,0)=9, (2,1)=9 -> 4 neighbors that are 9\n\nThis could be it. Let me try a rule: if a position is 0 and has exactly 2 neighboring 9s, place a 2 there.\n\nLet me check example 1 with this rule:\nPosition (0,0): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(0,1),(1,1) = 2 neighbors -> place 2 \u2713\nPosition (0,1): value=9, skip\nPosition (0,2): value=9, skip\nPosition (1,0): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(0,1),(1,1),(2,0),(2,1) = 4 neighbors -> no 2\nPosition (1,1): value=9, skip\nPosition (1,2): value=9, skip\nPosition (2,0): value=9, skip\nPosition (2,1): value=9, skip\nPosition (2,2): value=9, skip\n\nThis gives 2 only at (0,0), but output has 2s at (0,0) and (1,0).\n\nLet me try \"2 or more neighbors\":\nPosition (1,0): 4 neighbors that are 9 -> place 2 \u2713\n\nThis looks promising. Let me check example 2:\nPosition (0,1): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(0,0),(0,2),(1,1) = 3 neighbors -> place 2\nPosition (2,1): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(1,1),(1,2),(2,2) = 3 neighbors -> place 2\n\nThis matches! Output has 2s at (0,1) and (2,1).\n\nLet me verify with example 3:\nPosition (0,0): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(0,1),(1,0) = 2 neighbors -> place 2\nPosition (0,2): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(0,1),(1,2) = 2 neighbors -> place 2\nPosition (1,1): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(0,1),(1,0),(1,2),(2,1) = 4 neighbors -> no 2? \nWait, output has 2 at (1,1). \n\nLet me check if it's \"2 or more\":\nPosition (1,1): 4 neighbors -> should place 2 \u2713\n\nPosition (2,0): value=9, skip\nPosition (2,1): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(1,0),(1,1) = 2 neighbors -> place 2\nPosition (2,2): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(1,2) = 1 neighbor -> no 2\nBut output has 2 at (2,2). \n\nLet me try \"exactly 2 neighbors OR more than 2 neighbors\":\nActually output has 2 at (2,2) but it only has 1 neighbor that's 9.\n\nLet me reconsider the rule. Maybe it's \"2 or 3 neighbors\":\nPosition (2,2): 1 neighbor -> no\nStill doesn't work.\n\nLet me try a different rule: \"2 or more neighbors\" but also consider that a position can become 2 even if it was originally 9, or look at the pattern differently.\n\nActually, let me re-read the problem. The input is 6 rows, output is 3x3. Maybe I should consider the entire 6-row input.\n\nBut the examples show 6 rows and the output is clearly 3x3. Let me assume we're looking at the top 3x3 to determine the output 3x3.\n\nLet me try another approach: maybe it's about the \"perimeter\" or \"boundary\" of the 9s pattern.\n\nOr let me try: for each position in the output grid, look at the corresponding position in the input and its neighbors. If the position is 0 and has 2 or more 9 neighbors, place 2. If it's 9 and has specific neighbor patterns",

All grids are 3\u00d73\n2. Input values are mostly 0s and 9s in the top part, and 0s and 1s in the bottom part\n3. Output values are mostly 0s and 2s\n\nLet me look for patterns:\n- Example 1: The top part has 9s forming a specific pattern, bottom part has 1s\n- Example 2: Different arrangement of 9s and 1s produces a different output\n- Example 3: 9s in a cross pattern in top, 1s in bottom produce a specific 2s pattern\n- Example 4: Another arrangement\n- Example 5: Vertical line of 9s in middle-right produces 2s in specific positions\n\nIt seems like the top 3\u00d73 section might represent some kind of \"pattern\" and the bottom 3\u00d73 section might represent a \"mask\" or \"key\" that determines how the pattern is transformed.\n\nLet me look at this differently - maybe the bottom part indicates where to place the 2s based on the top part's structure.\n\nActually, let me check if there's a relationship between the positions of 9s in the top and 1s in the bottom, and where 2s appear in the output.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- In Example 1: Output has 2s in positions where the top has 0s in the same column but 9s in the row above\n- Let me reconsider... \n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe the output is based on counting or some operation between corresponding positions.\n\nActually, let me look at it as a 6\u00d73 grid where the top 3 rows are one part and bottom 3 rows are another part:\n\nWait, looking at the format again, I see these are 6\u00d73 grids, and the output is 3\u00d73.\n\nLet me re-examine:\nInput grid is 6\u00d73:\n- Top 3\u00d73 section (rows 0-2)\n- Bottom 3\u00d73 section (rows 3-5)\n\nOutput is 3\u00d73.\n\nLet me check if there's a pattern where:\n- If top has 9 and bottom has 1 \u2192 output 0\n- If top has 0 and bottom has 1 \u2192 output 2\n- If top has 9 and bottom has 0 \u2192 output 0\n- If top has 0 and bottom has 0 \u2192 output 0\n\nLet me test this hypothesis on Example 1:\nTop:    Bottom:     Output:\n0 9 9   0 1 0       2 0 0\n0 9 9   0 0 1  \u2192    2 0 0\n9 9 9   1 1 1       0 0 0\n\nPosition [0,0]: top=0, bottom=0 \u2192 output=0 (but expected 2)\nThis doesn't match.\n\nLet me try another approach - maybe it's about the relationship between the top pattern and some kind of transformation based on the bottom pattern.\n\nLet me look at it as: the bottom 3\u00d73 acts as a transformation key for the top 3\u00d73.\n\nAnother hypothesis: maybe output position [i,j] = 2 if (top[i,j] == 0 AND there's a 1 in the same column in the bottom part), with some additional conditions.\n\nLet me test Example 1 more carefully:\nTop: [0,9,9]  Bottom: [0,1,0]  Output: [2,0,0]\n     [0,9,9]          [0,0,1]           [2,0,0]\n     [9,9,9]          [1,1,1]           [0,0,0]\n\nHmm, let me try: output[i,j] = 2 if top[i,j] == 0 and bottom[i,j] == 0 and there exists a 1 in column j of bottom part.\n\nFor position [0,0]: top=0, bottom=0, column 0 of bottom has 0,0,1 (has a 1) \u2192 output = 2 \u2713\nFor position [0,1]: top=9 \u2192 output = 0 \u2713\nFor position [0,2]: top=9 \u2192 output = 0 \u2713\n\nFor position [1,0]: top=0, bottom=0, column 0 of bottom has a 1 \u2192 output = 2 \u2713\nFor position [1,1]: top=9 \u2192 output = 0 \u2713\nFor position [1,2]: top=9 \u2192 output = 0 \u2713\n\nFor position [2,0]: top=9 \u2192 output = 0 \u2713\nFor position [2,1]: top=9 \u2192 output = 0 \u2713\nFor position [2,2]: top=9 \u2192 output = 0 \u2713\n\nThis seems to work for the first row but not entirely for others.\n\nLet me try: output[i,j] = 2 if top[i,j] == 0 AND (some condition based on bottom)\n\nActually, let me try a simpler pattern:\noutput[i,j] = 2 if top[i,j] == 0 AND bottom[i,j] == 0\n\nTesting Example 1:\nPosition [0,0]: 0,0 \u2192 2?

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify patterns in the transformation from input to output grids.\n\nLet me examine each example carefully:\n\nExample 1:\n- Input: 6x3 grid with 9s in specific positions\n- Output: 3x3 grid with 2s replacing some 9s\n\nExample 2:\n- Input: 6x3 grid\n- Output: 3x3 grid with 2s in different positions\n\nLet me look for patterns by comparing input positions to output positions.\n\nLooking at the structure, it seems like:\n1. The input is 6x3 (6 rows, 3 columns)\n2. The output is 3x3 (3 rows, 3 columns)\n3. The top 3x3 portion might relate to the output in some way\n4. The bottom 3x3 portion might be a mask or control pattern\n\nLet me analyze the relationship more systematically:\n\nIn Example 1:\n- Top 3x3: 0 9 9    Bottom 3x3: 0 1 0\n-           0 9 9                0 0 1  \n-           9 9 9                1 1 1\n- Output:   2 0 0\n-           2 0 0\n-           0 0 0\n\nIt looks like where there are 9s in the top part AND 1s in the bottom part, we get 2s. But that doesn't quite match.\n\nLet me reconsider. Maybe it's about counting or some operation between the top and bottom halves.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at Example 1:\n- Where do 2s appear in output? At positions (0,0), (1,0)\n- Looking at top 3x3: positions with 9s are (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n- Looking at bottom 3x3: positions with 1s are (0,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nHmm, let me think differently. Maybe it's about the relationship between 9s in the top and 1s in the bottom.\n\nLet me check if it's about positions where 9s appear in the top but not 1s in the bottom, or vice versa.\n\nActually, let me look at a different pattern. What if the output cell (i,j) depends on some operation between the corresponding cells in top and bottom halves?\n\nFor Example 1:\n- Top(0,0)=0, Bottom(0,0)=0 \u2192 Output(0,0)=2? No, that gives 0.\n- Top(0,1)=9, Bottom(0,1)=1 \u2192 Output(0,1)=0\n- Top(0,2)=9, Bottom(0,2)=0 \u2192 Output(0,2)=0\n\nLet me try: if top=9 and bottom=0, then output=2? \n- (0,1): 9,1 \u2192 0 (doesn't match)\n- (0,2): 9,0 \u2192 0 (doesn't match)\n- (1,2): 9,1 \u2192 0 (doesn't match)\n\nLet me try another approach: what if we're looking at neighbors or patterns around each position?\n\nActually, let me re-examine the examples looking for a simpler pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\nTop: 0 9 0    Bottom: 0 0 0    Output: 2 0 2\n     9 0 9            0 0 1            0 2 0  \n     9 0 0            1 0 0            0 2 2\n\nThis seems like there might be a correspondence, but it's not immediately obvious.\n\nLet me try a hypothesis: For each position in the output, look at the corresponding position in the top 3x3 and bottom 3x3 of input:\n- If top=9 and bottom=0: output=2\n- If top=0 and bottom=0: output=0 or 2 (need to determine)\n- If top=9 and bottom=1: output=0\n- If top=0 and bottom=1: output=0 or 2\n\nChecking Example 1:\n- (0,0): top=0, bottom=0 \u2192 output=2 (matches my rule exception)\n- (0,1): top=9, bottom=1 \u2192 output=0 (matches)\n- (0,2): top=9, bottom=0 \u2192 output=0 (doesn't match my rule)\n\nLet me try a different approach. What if it's based on counting or some other operation?\n\nActually, let me step back and think about this more systematically.\n\nLooking at all examples, let me see if there's a consistent pattern:\nIt seems like the output is determined by some relationship between the top 3x3 and bottom 3x3 portions of the input.\n\nLet me try: output[i][j] = 2 if (top[i][j] == 9 and bottom[i][j] == 0) else 0\n\nChecking Example 1:\nTop: [0,9,9]  Bottom: [0,1,0]  Expected: [2,0,0]\n     [0,9,9]          [0,0,1]            [2,0,0]  \n     [9,9,9]          [1,1,1]            [0,0,0]\n\n- (0,0): 0,0 \u2192 0 (expected 2) - doesn't match\n- (0,1): 9,1 \u2192 0 (expected 0) - matches\n- (0,2): 9,0 \u2192 2 (expected 0) - doesn't match\n\nThis isn't working. Let me try the reverse: 2 if (top=0 and bottom=0)?\n\n- (0,0): 0,0 \u2192 2 (expected 2) - matches\n- (0,1): 9,1 \u2192 0 (expected 0) - matches  \n- (0,2): 9,0 \u2192 0 (expected 0) - doesn't match (would be 0, which is correct)\n\nLet me refine: 2 if (top=0 and bottom=0) OR (top=9 and bottom=0) ? \n- (0,2): 9,0 \u2192 2 (expected 0) - still doesn't match\n\nLet me try a completely different approach and look for spatial patterns.\n\nWhat if it's about connected components or shapes?\n\nActually, let me try: 2 if top=9 and bottom=0, but only in certain positions, or with additional constraints.\n\nLooking at examples more systematically:\n\nExample 5:\nTop: [0,9,0]  Bottom: [0,0,0]  Output: [2,0,2]\n     [0,9,9]          [1,1,1]          [0,0,0]\n     [0,9,9]          [1,0,1]          [0,0,0]\n\n- (0,0): 0,0 \u2192 2 (matches)\n- (0,2): 0,0 \u2192 2 (matches)\n- Others: various combinations \u2192 0 (matches)\n\nThis looks promising for the 0,0\u21922 pattern.\n\nLet me check other examples with this rule and see what exceptions there are.\n\nActually, let me try to code what I think might be the pattern and then refine:\n\nMy current hypothesis: \n- Output[i][j] = 2 if Top[i][j] == 9 and Bottom[i][j] == 0\n- But there are exceptions, so let me look for additional patterns\n\nLet me try a broader pattern search.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Extract top and bottom 3x3 portions\n    top = [row[:] for row in grid[:3]]\n    bottom = [row[:] for row in grid[3:]]\n    \n    # Initialize output grid\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Apply transformation rule\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # Primary rule: if top has 9 and bottom has 0, place 2\n            if top[i][j] == 9 and bottom[i][j] == 0:\n                output[i][j] = 2\n            # Secondary rule: if top has 0 and bottom has 0, place 2  \n            elif top[i][j] == 0 and bottom[i][j] == 0:\n                output[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return output\n```",

The input grids are 6x3, split into a 3x3 top section and 3x3 bottom section\n2. The output grids are always 3x3\n3. The number 2 appears in the output where there might be specific patterns in the input\n4. It seems like the transformation involves some kind of comparison or interaction between the top and bottom sections\n\nLet me look more carefully at the relationship:\n- It appears that when there's a 9 in the top section and a corresponding 1 in the bottom section, it might produce a 2 in the output\n- Or perhaps it's about counting or matching patterns between top and bottom\n\nActually, let me reconsider the structure. The inputs look like they're 6 rows by 3 columns, and outputs are 3x3.\n\nLooking at Example 1 more carefully:\nTop (3x3): \n0 9 9\n0 9 9  \n9 9 9\n\nBottom (3x3):\n0 1 0\n0 0 1\n1 1 1\n\nOutput (3x3):\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nLet me check if there's a pattern where if the top has 9 and bottom has 1, we get 2:\n- Position (0,1): top=9, bottom=1 \u2192 output=2 \u2713\n- Position (0,2): top=9, bottom=1 \u2192 output=2 \u2713\n- Position (1,1): top=9, bottom=0 \u2192 output=0 \u2713\n- Position (1,2): top=9, bottom=1 \u2192 output=2, but output is 0 \u2717\n\nLet me try another approach. Maybe it's about the relationship between the top 3x3 and the pattern they form.\n\nLooking at it differently - maybe it's about which columns or rows in the top section have 9s, and how they relate to the bottom section.\n\nActually, let me check if it's about vertical alignment:\nIn Example 1:\n- Column 0: top has [0,0,9], bottom has [0,0,1] \n- Column 1: top has [9,9,9], bottom has [1,0,1]\n- Column 2: top has [9,9,9], bottom has [0,1,1]\n\nOutput:\n- Column 0: [2,2,0] \n- Column 1: [0,0,0]\n- Column 2: [0,0,0]\n\nLet me try a different hypothesis. Maybe it's about counting or some operation on corresponding positions.\n\nAfter more careful analysis, let me try this hypothesis:\nThe output at position (i,j) depends on the values in the top 3x3 and bottom 3x3 at position (i,j).\n\nLet me check if output = 2 when (top == 9 AND bottom == 1):\nExample 1:\n- (0,1): top=9, bottom=1 \u2192 should be 2, and it is 0 in output. This doesn't match.\n\nLet me try: output = 2 when (top == 9 AND bottom == 0):\nExample 1:\n- (0,1): top=9, bottom=0 \u2192 should be 2, but output is 0\n- (1,1): top=9, bottom=0 \u2192 should be 2, but output is 0\n\nLet me try a more complex pattern. Maybe it's about the entire column or row.\n\nActually, looking at the examples again, let me try to see if there's a pattern with XOR or other operations:\n\nLet me try: if top[i][j] == 9 and bottom[i][j] == 0, then output[i][j] = 2, otherwise 0.\n\nExample 1:\nTop:      Bottom:     Rule result:   Actual output:\n0 9 9     0 1 0       0 2 2          2 0 0\n0 9 9     0 0 1       0 2 2          2 0 0  \n9 9 9     1 1 1       0 0 0          0 0 0\n\nThis doesn't match.\n\nLet me try the reverse: if top[i][j] == 9 and bottom[i][j] == 1, then output[i][j] = 2, otherwise 0.\n\nExample 1:\nTop:      Bottom:     Rule result:   Actual output:\n0 9 9     0 1 0       0 2 0          2 0 0\n0 9 9     0 0 1       0 0 2          2 0 0  \n9 9 9     1 1 1       0 2 2          0 0 0\n\nStill doesn't match exactly.\n\nLet me look for a different pattern. Maybe it's not position-by-position but about counts or specific arrangements.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\nTop:      Bottom:     Output:\n0 9 0     0 0 0       2 0 2\n9 0 9     0 0 1       0 2 0\n9 0 0     1 0 0       0 2 2\n\nThis seems more complex. Let me try to think of it as: for each column, if there are 9s in the top and 1s in the bottom in certain arrangements, place 2s accordingly.\n\nLet me try a new approach: for each column j, if column j in the top has at least one 9 and column j in the bottom has at least one 1, then place 2s in specific positions of that column in the output.\n\nActually, let me step back and just implement my best guess:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Split the 6x3 grid into top 3x3 and bottom 3x3\n    top = grid[:3]\n    bottom = grid[3:]\n    \n    # Initialize output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Apply transformation rule\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            # If top has 9 and bottom has 0, set output to 2\n            if top[i][j] == 9 and bottom[i][j] == 0:\n                output[i][j] = 2\n            # If top has 0 and bottom has 1, set output to 2  \n            elif top[i][j] == 0 and bottom[i][j] == 1:\n                output[i][j] = 2\n            # If both have specific values\n            elif top[i][j] == 9 and bottom[i][j] == 1:\n                # This might depend on other factors, setting to 0 for now\n                output[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return output\n```",

Let me try a different approach.\n\nWhat if I look at it column by column?\n\nColumn 0: top=[0,0,9], bottom=[0,0,1] \u2192 output column=[2,2,0]\nColumn 1: top=[9,9,9], bottom=[1,0,1] \u2192 output column=[0,0,0]\nColumn 2: top=[9,9,9], bottom=[0,1,1] \u2192 output column=[0,0,0]\n\nLet me check other examples:\n\nExample 2, Column 0: top=[9,0,0], bottom=[1,1,1] \u2192 output column=[0,0,0]\nExample 2, Column 1: top=[0,9,0], bottom=[0,0,0] \u2192 output column=[2,0,0]  \nExample 2, Column 2: top=[9,9,9], bottom=[1,0,0] \u2192 output column=[0,0,0]\n\nHmm, let me think differently.

No, that's not right.\nPosition (0,1): top=9, bottom=1 \u2192 output=0\nPosition (0,2): top=9, bottom=0 \u2192 output=0\nPosition (1,0): top=0, bottom=0 \u2192 output=2?

Output is actually in position (2,1)=0\n\nWait, I think I see it now. The output position corresponds to the row in the top half.\n\nLet me recheck Example 1:\nTop rows 0,1,2 map to output rows 0,1,2 respectively.\n\nPosition (0,0): top=0, bottom=0 \u2192 output(0,0)=2 \u2713\nPosition (0,1): top=9, bottom=1 \u2192 output(0,1)=0 \u2713\nPosition (0,2): top=9, bottom=0 \u2192 output(0,2)=0 \u2713\n\nPosition (1,0): top=0, bottom=0 \u2192 output(1,0)=2 \u2713\nPosition (1,1): top=9, bottom=0 \u2192 output(1,1)=0 \u2713\nPosition (1,2): top=9, bottom=1 \u2192 output(1,2)=0 \u2713\n\nPosition (2,0): top=9, bottom=1 \u2192 output(2,0)=0 \u2713\nPosition (2,1): top=9, bottom=1 \u2192 output(2,1)=0 \u2713\nPosition (2,2): top=9, bottom=1 \u2192 output(2,2)=0 \u2713\n\nSo the rule seems to be:\n- If top[i][j] == 0 and bottom[i][j] == 0: output[i][j] = 2\n- Otherwise: output[i][j] = 0\n\nLet me verify with Example 2:\nPosition (0,0): top=9, bottom=1 \u2192 output(0,0)=0 \u2713\nPosition (0,1): top=0, bottom=0 \u2192 output(0,1)=2 \u2713\nPosition (0,2): top=9, bottom=1 \u2192 output(0,2)=0 \u2713\n\nPosition (1,0): top=0, bottom=1 \u2192 output(1,0)=0 \u2713\nPosition (1,1): top=9, bottom=0 \u2192 output(1,1)=0 \u2713\nPosition (1,2): top=9, bottom=0 \u2192 output(1,2)=0 \u2713\n\nPosition (2,0): top=0, bottom=1 \u2192 output(2,0)=0 \u2713\nPosition (2,1): top=0, bottom=0 \u2192 output(2,1)=2 \u2713\nPosition (2,2): top=9, bottom=0 \u2192 output(2,2)=0 \u2713\n\nThis looks correct!\n\nLet me quickly check Example 3:\nTop:          Bottom:       Output:\n0 9 0         0 0 0         2 0 2\n9 0 9         0 0 1         0 2 0  \n9 0 0         1 0 0         0 2 2\n\nPosition (0,0): top=0, bottom=0 \u2192 output(0,0)=2 \u2713\nPosition (0,1): top=9, bottom=0 \u2192 output(0,1)=0 \u2713\nPosition (0,2): top=0, bottom=0 \u2192 output(0,2)=2 \u2713\n\nPosition (1,0): top=9, bottom=0 \u2192 output(1,0)=0 \u2713\nPosition (1,1): top=0, bottom=0 \u2192 output(1,1)=2 \u2713\nPosition (1,2): top=9, bottom=1 \u2192 output(1,2)=0 \u2713\n\nPosition (2,0): top=9, bottom=1 \u2192 output(2,0)=0 \u2713\nPosition (2,1): top=0, bottom=0 \u2192 output(2,1)=2 \u2713\nPosition (2,2): top=0, bottom=0 \u2192 output(2,2)=2 \u2713\n\nPerfect!

I notice that:\n1. The output grid is always 3x3\n2. The output seems to have 2s where there are patterns in the input\n3. Let me check if there's a relationship with the bottom 3x3 affecting the top 3x3\n\nLooking more carefully, let me check if the bottom 3x3 grid affects how we transform the top 3x3:\n\nIn Example 1: Bottom grid has 010/001/111 - Output has 2s in positions where top grid has 0s in certain patterns\nIn Example 2: Bottom grid has 101/100/100 - Output has 2s in (0,1) and (2,1) positions\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe it's about comparing the top and bottom grids:\n\nLooking at positions where 9 appears in the top grid and seeing if there's a corresponding pattern in the bottom grid...\n\nActually, let me look at this more systematically. Let me check if it's about neighbors or specific positional relationships.\n\nLooking at Example 3:\nTop:   Bottom:    Output:\n090    000        202\n909    001        020\n900    100        022\n\nI notice that in positions where the top grid has 0, sometimes the output has 2.\n\nLet me try a different approach. What if the output indicates some kind of \"coverage\" or \"matching\" between top and bottom grids?\n\nActually, let me look at this as: for each position in the 3x3 grid, look at the corresponding positions in both the top and bottom halves, and determine if a 2 should be placed based on some rule.\n\nLooking more carefully at the relationship:\n\nIn Example 1:\nPositions where top=9: (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\nPositions where bottom=1: (0,1), (0,2), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nHmm, let me try a different approach. What if the output cell (i,j) gets a 2 when there's some specific relationship between the top and bottom grids at that position or its neighbors?\n\nLet me look at Example 4:\nTop grid 9s at: (0,2), (1,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,1)\nBottom grid 1s at: (0,0), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)\n\nLet me try one more approach - maybe it's about counting or comparing the number of 9s and 1s in rows/columns.\n\nActually, let me look at what positions get 2s in the output:\nExample 1: (0,0), (1,0) have 2s\nExample 2: (0,1), (2,1) have 2s  \nExample 3: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (2,1), (2,2) have 2s\nExample 4: (0,1), (2,0) have 2s\nExample 5: (0,0), (0,2) have 2s\n\nLet me think about this differently. Maybe it's about:\n- If top grid cell = 0 AND some condition on bottom grid, then output = 2\n- If top grid cell = 9 AND some condition on bottom grid, then output = 2\n- Else output = 0\n\nLet me check: In positions where top grid = 0, when does output = 2?\n\nExample 1: top=0 at (0,0),(1,0),(2,0). Output=2 at (0,0),(1,0). Bottom at these positions: (0,0)=0,(1,0)=0,(2,0)=1\nSo when top=0 and bottom=0? No, that's not consistent.\n\nLet me try: output=2 when the top cell value differs from the bottom cell value?\n\nExample 1: \nTop: 009  Bottom: 010  Diff: 011  Output: 200\n     099          001          010          200  \n     999          111          000          000\n\nThis partially matches - where difference is 1, sometimes output is 2.\n\nBut let me check Example 2:\nTop: 909  Bottom: 101  Diff: 000  Output: 020\n     099          100          111          000\n     009          100          101          020\n\nThis doesn't match as well.\n\nLet me try yet another approach. What if it's about the 8-connected neighbors?\n\nActually, let me look at a simpler pattern. What if:\n- Output cell (i,j) = 2 if top(i,j) = 0 AND bottom(i,j) = 0\n- Output cell (i,j) = 2 if top(i,j) = 9 AND bottom(i,j) = 1  \n- Output cell (i,j) = 0 otherwise\n\nLet me check Example 1:\nTop:009 Bottom:010 -> (0,0):0&0->2 \u2713, (0,1):0&1->0 \u2713, (0,2):9&0->0 \u2713\n     099        001      (1,0):0&0->2 \u2713, (1,1):9&0->0 \u2713, (1,2):9&1->2 \u2717\n     999        111      (2,0):9&1->2 \u2717, (2,1):9&1->2 \u2717, (2,2):9&1->2 \u2717\n\nOutput: 200\n        200  \n        000\n\nThis partially works but not completely.\n\nLet me try: Output = 2 where top = 0 and bottom = 0.\n\nExample 1: (0,0) and (1,0) match \u2713\nExample 2: (0,1) only, but output has (0,1) and (2,1) \u2717\n\nLet me try a neighbor-based approach. For each cell, look at its value and neighbors in both top and bottom.\n\nActually, let me step back and think of this more systematically. Let me check if it's about:\n- Counting neighbors with specific values\n- Checking specific patterns like corners, edges\n- Some convolution operation\n\nLet me try: Output(i,j) = 2 if the 3x3 pattern around (i,j) in top matches some condition with bottom.\n\nOr even simpler: What if we're just transforming based on simple rules?\n\nLet me go back to the simplest hypothesis that partially works:\nOutput(i,j) = 2 if top(i,j) == 0 and bottom(i,j) == 0\n\nExample 1: positions where both are 0: (0,0), (1,0) -> output 2 at (0,0), (1,0) \u2713\nExample 2: positions where both are 0: (1,0), (1,1), (2,1) -> but output only at (0,1), (2,1) \u2717\n\nHmm. What about: Output(i,j) = 2 if top(i,j) == 0 and bottom(i,j) == 0, but also considering some",

But it's not a simple replacement - there seems to be some kind of pattern or rule\n\nLet me look more carefully at the relationship:\n\nIn Example 1: 9s in positions (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\nOutput has 2s in positions (0,0), (1,0) - this doesn't seem directly related\n\nLet me think differently.

What if the output 2s are placed based on some kind of \"corner detection\" or \"end point\" detection in the pattern of 9s?\n\nLooking at example 1:\n9s at: (0,1), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\nThis forms a shape with \"ends\" or corners at (0,1), (1,2), (2,0)\nBut output has 2s at (0,0), (1,0)\n\nLet me try one more approach - maybe it's about the \"background\" or negative space of the 9s pattern.\n\nActually, let me look at what happens to isolated 9s vs connected 9s.\n\nLooking at example 2:\n9s at: (0,0), (0,2), (1,1), (1,2), (2,2)\nOutput 2s at: (0,1), (2,1) - these are positions adjacent to 9s but not 9s themselves\n\nWait, let me check if it's about counting neighbors:\nFor each position, count how many 9s are in adjacent positions (including diagonals), and if that count meets some criteria, place a 2.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis:\n\nFor example 1:\nPosition (0,0): adjacent to (0,1)=9, (1,0)=0, (1,1)=9 -> 2 neighbors that are 9\nPosition (0,1): this is a 9, so maybe skip\nPosition (1,0): adjacent to (0,0)=0, (0,1)=9, (1,1)=9, (2,0)=9, (2,1)=9 -> 4 neighbors that are 9\n\nThis could be it. Let me try a rule: if a position is 0 and has exactly 2 neighboring 9s, place a 2 there.\n\nLet me check example 1 with this rule:\nPosition (0,0): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(0,1),(1,1) = 2 neighbors -> place 2 \u2713\nPosition (0,1): value=9, skip\nPosition (0,2): value=9, skip\nPosition (1,0): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(0,1),(1,1),(2,0),(2,1) = 4 neighbors -> no 2\nPosition (1,1): value=9, skip\nPosition (1,2): value=9, skip\nPosition (2,0): value=9, skip\nPosition (2,1): value=9, skip\nPosition (2,2): value=9, skip\n\nThis gives 2 only at (0,0), but output has 2s at (0,0) and (1,0).\n\nLet me try \"2 or more neighbors\":\nPosition (1,0): 4 neighbors that are 9 -> place 2 \u2713\n\nThis looks promising. Let me check example 2:\nPosition (0,1): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(0,0),(0,2),(1,1) = 3 neighbors -> place 2\nPosition (2,1): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(1,1),(1,2),(2,2) = 3 neighbors -> place 2\n\nThis matches! Output has 2s at (0,1) and (2,1).\n\nLet me verify with example 3:\nPosition (0,0): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(0,1),(1,0) = 2 neighbors -> place 2\nPosition (0,2): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(0,1),(1,2) = 2 neighbors -> place 2\nPosition (1,1): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(0,1),(1,0),(1,2),(2,1) = 4 neighbors -> no 2? \nWait, output has 2 at (1,1). \n\nLet me check if it's \"2 or more\":\nPosition (1,1): 4 neighbors -> should place 2 \u2713\n\nPosition (2,0): value=9, skip\nPosition (2,1): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(1,0),(1,1) = 2 neighbors -> place 2\nPosition (2,2): value=0, neighbors with 9s=(1,2) = 1 neighbor -> no 2\nBut output has 2 at (2,2). \n\nLet me try \"exactly 2 neighbors OR more than 2 neighbors\":\nActually output has 2 at (2,2) but it only has 1 neighbor that's 9.\n\nLet me reconsider the rule. Maybe it's \"2 or 3 neighbors\":\nPosition (2,2): 1 neighbor -> no\nStill doesn't work.\n\nLet me try a different rule: \"2 or more neighbors\" but also consider that a position can become 2 even if it was originally 9, or look at the pattern differently.\n\nActually, let me re-read the problem. The input is 6 rows, output is 3x3. Maybe I should consider the entire 6-row input.\n\nBut the examples show 6 rows and the output is clearly 3x3. Let me assume we're looking at the top 3x3 to determine the output 3x3.\n\nLet me try another approach: maybe it's about the \"perimeter\" or \"boundary\" of the 9s pattern.\n\nOr let me try: for each position in the output grid, look at the corresponding position in the input and its neighbors.
