          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe that the transformation involves converting certain patterns of 8s and 1s into specific numbers (2, 3, 7) based on their shape and position. The patterns seem to be related to the number of adjacent 8s or 1s in a certain direction.\n\nFrom the examples, it appears that:\n1. A single 8 in a row or column may be converted to a 2\n2. A group of 8s forming a line or block may be converted to a 3 or 7\n3. A single 1 in a row or column may be converted to a 2 or 3\n4. The transformation seems to be based on the shape and position of the numbers, not just their value\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that converts certain patterns of 8s and 1s into specific numbers based on their shape and position.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # Convert 8s to 2s in certain patterns\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Check if it's part of a horizontal line of 8s\n                if j + 1 < 14 and grid[i][j+1] == 8:\n                    # Check if it's part of a vertical line of 8s\n                    if i + 1 < 14 and grid[i+1][j] == 8:\n                        # Convert to 2\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                        transformed_grid[i+1][j] = 2\n                        transformed_grid[i][j+1] = 2\n                    else:\n                        # Convert to 2\n                        transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                        transformed_grid[i][j+1] = 2\n                elif j -

The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with others in a structured pattern.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain values (like 8) are replaced with other values (like 2, 3, 7) in a specific spatial arrangement.\n3. The transformation seems to be based on the position and value of cells, with some kind of spatial pattern or rule that determines which cells get transformed.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with others in a pattern that depends on the position and value of cells.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # We'll replace 8 with 2, 3, 7, and 1 with 0 in certain patterns\n    # This is a simplified version that captures some of the observed patterns\n    \n    # Replace 8 with 2 in certain patterns\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Simple pattern: replace 8 with 2 in certain positions\n                if (i + j) % 3 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Replace 1 with 0 in certain patterns\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Simple pattern: replace 1 with 0 in certain positions\n                if (i - j) % 3 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # We'll replace 8 with 2, 3, 7, and 1 with 0 in certain patterns\n    # This is a simplified version that captures some of the observed patterns\n    \n    # Replace 8 with 2 in certain patterns\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Simple pattern: replace 8 with 2 in certain positions\n                if (i + j) % 3 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Replace 1 with 0 in certain patterns\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid[i][j] == 1:\n                # Simple pattern: replace 1 with 0 in certain positions\n                if (i - j) % 3 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
