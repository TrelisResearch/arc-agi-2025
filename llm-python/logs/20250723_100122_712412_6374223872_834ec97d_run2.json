In Example 1, the center cell (position [1][1]) changes from 0 to 2, and the center row and column cells (positions [1][0], [1][2], [0][1], [2][1]) change from 0 to 4, 2, 0, 0 respectively.\n2. In Example 2, the center cell (position [2][2]) changes from 6 to 6, and the surrounding cells in the middle row and column change from 0 to 4.\n3. In Example 3, the center cell (position [4][2]) changes from 9 to 9, and the surrounding cells in the middle row and column change from 0 to 4.\n\nFrom these examples, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Leaving the center cell (position [4][2] in a 9x9 grid) unchanged.\n- Changing the surrounding cells in the middle row and column to 4 if they are 0.\n- Changing the center cell to 2 if it is 0.\n\nBased on this pattern, I will implement a transformation that:\n- Leaves the center cell (position [4][2]) unchanged.\n- Changes the surrounding cells in the middle row and column to 4 if they are 0.\n- Changes the center cell to 2 if it is 0.\n\nHere is the implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Check if the grid is 9x9\n    if grid_np.shape != (9, 9):\n        return grid\n    \n    # Leave the center cell (position [4][2]) unchanged\n    center_cell = grid_np[4][2]\n    \n    # Change the surrounding cells in the middle row and column to 4 if they are 0\n    grid_np[4] = np.where(grid_np[4] == 0, 4, grid_np[4])\n    for col in [2, 3, 4]:\n        grid_np[:, col] = np.where(grid_np[:, col] == 0, 4, grid_np[:, col])\n    \n    # Change the center cell to 2 if it is 0\n    if center_cell == 0:\n        grid_np[4][2] = 2\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.tolist()\n    return transformed_grid\n```",
