              "Let's analyze the training data and outputs to derive a transformation:\n\nObservations:\n- All inputs contain shapes formed by color code `5` on a background `0`.\n- Training outputs are all columns of 0s.\n- The outputs are always a 4\u00d71 grid with all zeros.\n- Some examples (like Example 2) have outputs smaller than 4 rows, but the instruction says output must always be 4\u00d71.\n\nGiven that all training outputs are just a vertical column of zeros, despite the input shapes, one hypothesis is:\n- The output is some form of a blank 4x1 column (all zeros).\n- Perhaps the task is to extract a shape representation or feature, but since no other number appears in outputs, returning zeros is a safe fallback.\n\nLooking at the provided visual and input-output structure, it may be that the task is to return a 4\u00d71 column of zeros every time, regardless of the input, because the given outputs are all zeros only of variable height and the requirement states output must be fixed 4x1.\n\nSince the test output is not required, and given repeated output patterns, the transformation function is best guessed as:\n- Produce a 4\u00d71 grid of zeros.\n\nIf I wanted to try something else, I could:\n- Count number of 5's or clusters and encode in output column, but no such info is shown in training outputs.\n- But all outputs are zeros anyway.\n\nThus, the safest minimal solution is:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # According to training data and outputs, the output is always 4x1 column of zeros\n    return [[0] for _ in range(4)]\n```"
