          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from input to output. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a lot of 2s in certain positions, and the output has 2s, 8s, and 3s. For instance, in the first input row, the output is all 0s. But in the second row of input, the output has 2s and 8s. Wait, looking at the output for Example 1, the second row of output is 0 2 2 2 2 0 8 8 8 8 0. So the original input had 2s in the middle, and the output has 2s in the middle and 8s in the middle. Hmm. Maybe the 8s are replacing some of the 2s in certain positions?\n\nLooking at the third row of input for Example 1: it's 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0. So the 2 in the middle of the input is still there, but the 2 in the 8th position (column 7) becomes 8. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 8 or 3 based on their position or some other criteria.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, there are 8s and 3s. For example, in the second row of output, the middle part is 8s and then 2s. Maybe the 8s are replacing 2s in certain positions that are part of a specific shape or pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle. For example, in the second row of output, columns 2-5 are 2s, but columns 6-9 are 8s. Wait, maybe the 8s are in certain regions that are surrounded by 2s. Or perhaps the 8s are in positions that are part of a larger structure.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the output has 3s and 8s. For instance, in the second row of input, the output has 3s in some positions. Maybe the numbers are changing based on their position in the grid, like certain rows or columns.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 2 and is part of a certain shape, it becomes 8 or 3. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, certain cells in the grid are replaced based on their row or column. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle columns of certain rows. Let me check the rows where 8s appear.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nRow 1 (second row of output) has 8s in columns 6-9. The input for that row was 0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0. So the original 2s in the middle are replaced with 8s in the output. Wait, but in the output, the 8s are in columns 6-9. Wait, the input's original row was 0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0. The output is 0 2 2 2 2 0 8 8 8 8 0. So the original 2s in columns 6-9 (positions 6,7,8,9?) Wait, the input's original row is 0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0. So the original 2s are in columns 1-4 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but maybe the output's 8s are in the middle part. Hmm, maybe it's about the positions where the 2s are in certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 3s are replacing the 2s in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle part of the grid. Maybe the 8s are in positions that are part of a vertical line or a horizontal line. For example, in the input, there are vertical lines of 2s, and the output replaces those with 8s in certain positions.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the second row has 8s in the middle, then 2s. The third row has 8s in some positions. Maybe the 8s are replacing 2s in certain positions where there's a specific pattern, like a vertical line.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the 8s and 3s are replacing the 2s in certain regions based on their distance from the edges. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a different number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is 2 and is part of a certain shape (like a vertical line), it becomes 8. If it's part of another shape, it becomes 3.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the third row of output is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0. The input for that row was 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 2 in the 8th column (position 7) becomes 8. But in the same row, the 2 in the 2nd column (position 1) remains 2. So maybe the 8s are replacing the 2s that are in certain positions, like the middle of the grid.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle columns of certain rows. For example, in rows 2, 5, 7, etc., there are 8s in the middle. Also, in Example 3's output, there are 3s and 8s in certain positions.\n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 6-9. The input's second row was 0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0. So the original 2s in columns 6-9 (positions 6,7,8,9) are replaced with 8s? Wait, no. The original input row is 0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0. So the 2s are in columns 1-4 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but maybe the 8s are in the middle of the row. Wait, perhaps the 8s are in the middle columns of the grid. Let me think about the positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is part of a vertical line. For example, in the input, there are vertical lines of 2s, and the output replaces those with 8s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing 2s in certain positions based on the row number. For example, in rows where the row index is even or odd, certain transformations happen.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is part of a vertical line. For example, in the second row of input, the original 2s are in the middle, but the output has 8s in the middle. Wait, maybe the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 3s are replacing 2s based on the position's row and column. For example, in certain rows, the 2s are replaced with 8s, and in other rows, they are replaced with 3s.\n\nLooking at the outputs for the three examples:\n\nExample 1 has 8s and 3s. Example 2 has 8s and 3s. Example 3 has 3s and 8s. So maybe the 8s are in certain positions based on their row and column.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s and 3s are replacing the 2s in certain regions. For example, in the middle of the grid. Let me think about the positions where 8s appear.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 8s appear in the middle columns (columns 6-9) of certain rows. For example, row 1 (second row of input) has 8s in columns 6-9. Similarly, in row 5 (the fifth row of input?), the output has 8s. Maybe the 8s are in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell relative to the center of the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle columns, it's replaced with 8 or 3.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for the positions where the 8s and 3s are in the output and compare them to the input. For example, in Example 1's output, the 8s are in positions where the original cell was 2, and the 3s are in other positions. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3's output, the second row has 3s in certain positions. The input for that row was 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0. The output is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 8 8 0 0. So the original 2s in columns 2-3 and 7-8 are replaced with 3s and 8s. Maybe the 3s are in the left part of the grid, and 8s in the right part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 3s are based on the distance from the center. For example, if a cell is in the middle columns, it's replaced with 8, and if it's in another part, it's replaced with 3.\n\nBut how to determine this. Let's think of the grid as 16 rows and 11 columns. The middle column would be column 5 (since 11 columns, 0-based, middle is 5). Maybe cells in columns 5-6 are replaced with 8s, and others with 3s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 2s in the middle, and the output has 8s in the middle columns.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle columns of certain rows, and 3s in other rows. For example, the 8s appear in rows 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. Wait, looking at the output of Example 1, the 8s are in rows 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. But the input has 2s in those rows. Maybe the 8s are in rows where the row index is even or odd?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the row is even, and 3s in odd rows. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 3s are based on the position of the cell in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid (columns 5-6), then it's replaced with 8 or 3 based on the row.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle columns of certain rows. Let's consider that the 8s are in the middle of the grid. For example, in the input, the 2s are in vertical lines, and the output replaces those with 8s in the middle columns.\n\nBut how to code this. Maybe for each cell, if the original value is 2, and it's in a certain position (like middle columns), then replace with 8 or 3 based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 2 and is surrounded by 2s, then it becomes 8. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original cell's value and the row and column. For example, if the cell is in column 5 (middle), and the row is even, then replace with 8. But how to test this.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is given. Let's see the test input's structure. The test input is:\n\nRow 0: 0s\nRow 1: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 2: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\nRow 3: 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0s\nRow 6: 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\nRow 7: 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 10: 0s\nRow 11: 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 12: 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 13: 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow 14: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\nRow 15: 0s\n\nThe output for the test input is not given, but the task is to write a transformation that maps the input to the output. The problem is to find the pattern.\n\nBut given that the training examples have outputs with 8s and 3s, perhaps the transformation is based on the cell's value and its position. For example, if the cell is 2 and is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 8 or 3.\n\nLooking back at Example 1's output, the 8s appear in the middle columns of certain rows. Let me think about the middle columns. The grid has 11 columns (0-10). The middle is column 5. So maybe cells in columns 5 and 6 are replaced with 8s or 3s based on their row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in cells that are in the middle of the grid. For example, in rows where the row is even, the middle columns are replaced with 8s, and in odd rows, with 3s. But how to verify.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 3's output, the 3s are in certain positions. For example, in the second row of output, the 3s are in columns 2-3 and 7-8. The input for that row was 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0. So the 2s in columns 2-3 and 7-8 are replaced with 3s and 8s. Maybe the 3s are in the left part of the grid and 8s in the right part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a vertical line of 2s, then replace with 8. But how to detect that.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle columns of certain rows. For example, in row 1 (second row of input), the output has 8s in columns 6-9. The original input for that row was 0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0. So the original 2s are in columns 1-4 and 6-9. The output replaces the 2s in columns 6-9 with 8s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain pattern. For example, in the middle of the grid, the 8s are replacing the 2s that are part of a vertical line. But how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the cell is part of a vertical line of 2s, and the 3s are in positions that are part of a different pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find the exact pattern. However, the problem says that the output must be a 16x11 grid. So the function must return a grid of that size.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is based on the cell's value and whether it's in a certain region of the grid. For example, if the cell is 2 and is in the middle columns (columns 5-6), then it becomes 8. If it's in other columns, it remains 2. But then, in Example 1, the 8s are in the middle columns. But in Example 3, the 3s are in columns 2-3 and 7-8. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation depends on the row. For example, in even rows, the middle columns are replaced with 8s, and in odd rows, replaced with 3s. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at the outputs for the training examples:\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 8s in certain rows. For example, row 1 (second row of output) has 8s in the middle. Row 4 (fifth row of output) has 8s in the middle. Row 6 (seventh row of output) has 8s in the middle. Row 8 (ninth row of output) has 8s in the middle. Row 10 (eleventh row of output) has 8s in the middle. Row 12 (thirteenth row of output) has 8s in the middle. Row 14 (fifteenth row of output) has 8s in the middle. Wait, but in the output of Example 1, the 8s are in rows 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. These are rows with even indices (assuming rows are 0-based). For example, row 1 is odd, but maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in rows where the row index is even or odd, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the row is even and the column is in the middle. For example, in row 1 (which is odd), there are 8s. So this approach may not work.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is based on the cell's position relative to the center of the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with 8 or 3. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if the cell is 2 and is surrounded by 2s, it becomes 8. But how to code that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of the examples, maybe the 8s are in the middle of the grid, and the 3s are in other parts. For example, in Example 1, the output has 3s in rows 12 and 14, but that's not clear.\n\nAt this point, it's challenging to find the exact pattern. However, given the examples, I need to make an educated guess. One possible pattern is that cells with value 2 in certain positions (like the middle columns) are replaced with 8s, and in other positions with 3s. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the cell's row and column. For example, if the cell is in column 5 or 6 (middle columns), then it's replaced with 8 if the row is even, and 3 if the row is odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet me try to code this. For each cell, if the original value is 2, and the column is 5 or 6, then replace with 8 if the row is even, else 3. But I need to check if this fits the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the second row (row index 1) has 8s in columns 6-9. If column 6 is in the middle, then for row 1 (odd), it should be 3. But in the output, it's 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the column. For example, if the column is 5 or 6, replace with 8. But then in Example 1, the output has 8s in columns 6-9, which may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the row. For example, if the row is even, replace 2 with 8, and if odd, replace with 3. But in Example 1, the output has 8s in row 1 (odd), which would not fit.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Another approach: look at the outputs of the examples and see if there's a pattern in the positions of the 8s and 3s.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle columns of certain rows. For example, row 1 (second row of input) has 8s in columns 6-9. The original input for that row is 0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0. So the 2s in columns 6-9 (original) are replaced with 8s. But why?\n\nMaybe the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is part of a vertical line. For example, in the input, there are vertical lines of 2s in the middle of the grid, and the output replaces those with 8s.\n\nBut how to detect that. Perhaps the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is part of a vertical line. For example, in the input, the 2s are in vertical lines, and the output replaces those with 8s.\n\nBut how to code that. Maybe the 8s are in positions where the cell is 2 and the cell to the left and right are also 2, and the cell above and below are 2. But this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, rows where the row is even, and columns 5-6.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I need to make a decision. Based on the examples, perhaps the transformation is that cells with value 2 in certain positions (like middle columns) are replaced with 8 or 3 based on their row. For example, in even rows, replace with 8, in odd rows, replace with 3.\n\nBut in Example 1, the second row (row 1) has 8s. If row 1 is odd, this would not fit. But maybe the rows are 0-based. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for row 1 (second row of input) has 8s. If the rows are 0-based, then row 1 is odd. But in the output, it's replaced with 8. So this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the column. For example, columns 5-6 are replaced with 8 if the cell is 2. But in Example 1, the output has 8s in columns 6-9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s and 3s are replacing the 2s in certain patterns. For example, in the input, there are certain shapes (like vertical lines) that are replaced with 8s or 3s. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are in the middle of the grid, and the 3s are in other parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain pattern, like a vertical line. For example, in the input, there are vertical lines of 2s in the middle, and the output replaces those with 8s.\n\nBut how to detect that. Perhaps the 8s are in positions where the cell is 2 and the cell to the left and right are also 2, and the cell above and below are 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the cell is 2 and the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, in rows 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 (which are odd rows in 0-based indexing), replace with 8.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to make a hypothesis. Let's assume that the 8s are in positions where the cell is 2 and is in the middle columns (columns 5-6) and the row is even. The 3s are in positions where the cell is 2 and in the middle columns but the row is odd.\n\nBut how to test this. Let's look at Example 1's output. For row 1 (which is odd), the 8s are in columns 6-9. So this would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in columns 5-6, regardless of the row. For example, if the cell is 2 and in columns 5 or 6, replace with 8. But in Example 1, the output has 8s in columns 6-9, which would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the cell is 2 and the column is 5 or 6, and the row is even. In Example 1's output, the second row (row 1) has 8s in columns 6-9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is very challenging. Maybe the transformation is based on the original cell's value and its position relative to the center of the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid (columns 5-6), and the row is even, replace with 8. If the row is odd, replace with 3.\n\nBut I need to code this. Let's try to write a function that for each cell, if it is 2, and the column is 5 or 6, then replace with 8 if the row is even, else 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's output. For example, in row 1 (which is odd), the 8s are in columns 6-9. According to this hypothesis, since the column is 6 (which is in 5-6), and the row is odd, it should be 3. But the output is 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in columns 5-6, and the row is even or odd. But how.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the best approach is to look for the positions where the 8s and 3s appear in the examples and try to find a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8s appear in certain rows and columns. Let's look at the output for Example 1:\n\nRow 1 (second row of output): 0 2 2 2 2 0 8 8 8 8 0\nRow 4 (fifth row of output): 0 2 2 2 2 0 8 8 8 8 0\nRow 6 (seventh row of output): 0 8 8 8 8 0 2 2 2 2 0\nRow 8 (ninth row of output): 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 2 0 0\nWait, no, in Example 1's output, the third row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0. So the 8 is in column 7 (index 7). The middle columns are 5 and 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the column is 6, and the row is even.\n\nIn Example 1, row 1 (second row of output) has 8s in column 6-9. So column 6 is 6, which is in the middle. But how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in columns 6-9 for certain rows. But this is not a general rule.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with a possible hypothesis. Perhaps the transformation is that any cell with value 2 and in columns 5 or 6 is replaced with 8, and if it's in columns 2 or 3, it's replaced with 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and its position in the grid. For example, if the cell is 2 and is in the middle of the grid (columns 5-6), replace with 8. Otherwise, leave it as 2. But this would not explain the 3s in some examples.\n\nBut in Example 3's output, there are 3s. So this suggests that there are other conditions.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s and 3s are replacing the 2s in certain positions based on the row and column. For example, if the row is even and the column is 5, replace with 8; if the row is odd and column is 5, replace with 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to code a function that replaces 2s in certain positions with 8 or 3 based on some criteria, even if it's not perfect. For example, replace 2s in columns 5 and 6 with 8, and in other columns with 3. But this may not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the cell's value and whether it is in a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is 2 and is part of a vertical line, replace with 8. If it's part of a horizontal line, replace with 3. But how to detect that.\n\nGiven the time, I think I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell, if the value is 2 and the column is 5 or 6, replace with 8. If the value is 2 and the column is 2 or 3, replace with 3. Otherwise, leave it as 2. This is a guess, but it may fit some examples.\n\nBut in Example 1, the third row of output has 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0. So column 7 (index 7) is 8. But according to this hypothesis, column 7 is not 5 or 6, so it should remain 2. But in the output, it's 8. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 8s are in positions where the cell is 2 and is in the middle of the grid (columns 5-6), and the row is even. The 3s are in the same columns but odd rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the second row (row 1, odd) has 8s in columns 6-9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for a different pattern. Maybe the 8s and 3s are replacing 2s in certain positions based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, in the middle of the grid, the 8s are replaced, and in other parts, the 3s are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the cell is 2 and is in a certain pattern, like a vertical line. For example, in Example 1, the input has vertical lines of 2s in the middle, and the output replaces those with 8s.\n\nBut how to detect that. Perhaps the 8s are in positions where the cell is 2 and the cell to the left and right are also 2, and the cell above and below are 2.\n\nBut this would require checking the surrounding cells.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the code would be something like:\n\nfor each cell in grid:\n    if cell is 2 and (left and right are 2 and above and below are 2):\n        replace with 8\n    elif cell is 2 and (some other condition):\n        replace with 3\n    else:\n        leave as is\n\nBut this is complex to implement and may not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the number of 2s in the cell's row or column. For example, if a cell is 2 and its row has many 2s, replace with 8.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with a possible solution. Based on the examples, I'll assume that the 8s and 3s are replacing the 2s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in columns 5 and 6, replace with 8 if the row is even, and 3 if odd.\n\nBut in Example 1, row 1 (odd) has 8s in columns 6-9. So this doesn't fit. However, maybe the columns are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in columns 5-6 for all rows. So for any cell that is 2 and in columns 5 or 6, replace with 8. But in Example 3's output, there are 3s in columns 2-3 and 7-8. So this would not fit.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s are in columns 5-6, and 3s are in columns 2-3 and 7-8. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll write a function that replaces 2s in columns 5-6 with 8, and 2s in columns 2-3 and 7-8 with 3. For other columns, leave as 2.\n\nBut this may not fit all examples, but it's a possible approach.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's output. For example, in row 1, the output has 8s in columns 6-9. According to this hypothesis, columns 5-6 are replaced with 8, but columns 6-9 are not. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in columns 6-9 for certain rows.\n\nBut this is getting too complex. I think I need to make a decision and write the code based on the best possible hypothesis, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBased on the examples, I'll assume that the 8s are in the middle columns (columns 5-6) and the 3s are in other columns. For example, if the cell is 2 and in columns 5-6, replace with 8. If it's in other columns, replace with 3. But this would not fit all examples, but it's a start.\n\nBut in Example 1, the third row of output has 8 in column 7, which is not 5-6. So this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for another pattern. Perhaps the 8s and 3s are replacing the 2s based on the row. For example, in even rows, replace with 8, in odd rows, replace with 3.\n\nBut in Example 1, the second row (row 1, odd) has 8s. So this would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are 0-based, and the 8s are in rows where the row index is even. For example, row 0, 2, 4, etc. But in Example 1's output, row 1 has 8s.\n\nThis is not working. I think I need to give up and make a guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the 8s and 3s seem to replace the 2s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are in the middle of the grid, and the 3s are in other parts.\n\nMaybe the 8s are in positions where the cell is in the middle of the grid (columns 5-6), and the 3s are in other parts. For example, in Example 3, the 3s are in columns 2-3 and 7-8.\n\nBut how to code this. Perhaps, for each cell, if it is 2 and in columns 5 or 6, replace with 8. If it is 2 and in columns 2-3 or 7-8, replace with 3. Otherwise, leave as 2.\n\nThis would explain some of the examples. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the second row has 8s in columns 6-9. According to this, column 6 is replaced with 8. But columns 7-9 are not in 5-6, so they would not be replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in the output, columns 6-9 are 8s. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible guess, even if it's not perfect. Based on the examples, I'll assume that the 8s and 3s are replacing 2s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in columns 5-6, replace with 8 if the row is even, and 3 if odd.\n\nBut in Example 1, row 1 is odd, but has 8s in columns 6-9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time, I'll write a function that replaces 2s in columns 5-6 with 8, and 2s in columns 2-3 with 3. This is a guess, but it may fit some examples.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for col in range(11):\n            if row[col] == 2:\n                if col in [5, 6]:\n                    new_row.append(8)\n                elif col in [2, 3]:\n                    new_row.append(3)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(2)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(row[col])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not fit all examples. For example, in Example 1, the third row of input has 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0. So column 7 (index 7) is 2 in input, and in the output it's 8. According to the code, column 7 is not 5 or 6, so it should remain 2. But in the output, it's 8. So this code is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the code should replace 2s in columns 6-9 with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should replace 2s in columns 5-6 with 8, and 2s in columns 7-8 with 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with this code, even if it's not correct for all examples. The user asked for a transformation that captures the patterns observed, even if not perfect.\n\nBut based on the examples, I think the correct approach is to replace 2s in certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their position in the grid. For example, in the middle columns, replace with 8, and in other columns with 3. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in the middle columns (columns 5-6), and 3s in other columns. But this would not explain the 3s in some examples.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 2s in columns 5-6 with 8, and others with 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut in the example, the third row of output has 8 in column 7. So this code would not handle it.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a final decision and write the code based on the best guess, even if it's not perfect. The code may not pass all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from input to output. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a lot of 2s in certain positions, and the output has 2s, 8s, and 3s. For instance, in the first input row, the output is all 0s. But in the second row of input, the output has 2s and 8s. Wait, looking at the output for Example 1, the second row of output is 0 2 2 2 2 0 8 8 8 8 0. So the original input had 2s in the middle, and the output has 2s in the middle and 8s in the middle. Hmm. Maybe the 8s are replacing some of the 2s in certain positions?\n\nLooking at the third row of input for Example 1: it's 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0. So the 2 in the middle of the input is still there, but the 2 in the 8th position (column 7) becomes 8. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced with 8 or 3 based on their position or some other criteria.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, there are 8s and 3s. For example, in the second row of output, the middle part is 8s and then 2s. Maybe the 8s are replacing 2s in certain positions that are part of a specific shape or pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 8s in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle. For example, in the second row of output, columns 2-5 are 2s, but columns 6-9 are 8s. Wait, maybe the 8s are in certain regions that are surrounded by 2s. Or perhaps the 8s are in positions that are part of a larger structure.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the output has 3s and 8s. For instance, in the second row of input, the output has 3s in some positions. Maybe the numbers are changing based on their position in the grid, like certain rows or columns.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 2 and is part of a certain shape, it becomes 8 or 3. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, certain cells in the grid are replaced based on their row or column. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle columns of certain rows. Let me check the rows where 8s appear.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output:\n\nRow 1 (second row of output) has 8s in columns 6-9. The input for that row was 0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0. So the original 2s in the middle are replaced with 8s in the output. Wait, but in the output, the 8s are in columns 6-9. Wait, the input's original row was 0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0. The output is 0 2 2 2 2 0 8 8 8 8 0. So the original 2s in columns 6-9 (positions 6,7,8,9?) Wait, the input's original row is 0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0. So the original 2s are in columns 1-4 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but maybe the output's 8s are in the middle part. Hmm, maybe it's about the positions where the 2s are in certain patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 3s are replacing the 2s in certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle part of the grid. Maybe the 8s are in positions that are part of a vertical line or a horizontal line. For example, in the input, there are vertical lines of 2s, and the output replaces those with 8s in certain positions.\n\nLooking at Example 2's output, the second row has 8s in the middle, then 2s. The third row has 8s in some positions. Maybe the 8s are replacing 2s in certain positions where there's a specific pattern, like a vertical line.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the 8s and 3s are replacing the 2s in certain regions based on their distance from the edges. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a different number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is 2 and is part of a certain shape (like a vertical line), it becomes 8. If it's part of another shape, it becomes 3.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the third row of output is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0. The input for that row was 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 2 in the 8th column (position 7) becomes 8. But in the same row, the 2 in the 2nd column (position 1) remains 2. So maybe the 8s are replacing the 2s that are in certain positions, like the middle of the grid.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle columns of certain rows. For example, in rows 2, 5, 7, etc., there are 8s in the middle. Also, in Example 3's output, there are 3s and 8s in certain positions.\n\nWait, looking at the output of Example 1, the second row has 8s in columns 6-9. The input's second row was 0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0. So the original 2s in columns 6-9 (positions 6,7,8,9) are replaced with 8s? Wait, no. The original input row is 0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0. So the 2s are in columns 1-4 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but maybe the 8s are in the middle of the row. Wait, perhaps the 8s are in the middle columns of the grid. Let me think about the positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is part of a vertical line. For example, in the input, there are vertical lines of 2s, and the output replaces those with 8s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are replacing 2s in certain positions based on the row number. For example, in rows where the row index is even or odd, certain transformations happen.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is part of a vertical line. For example, in the second row of input, the original 2s are in the middle, but the output has 8s in the middle. Wait, maybe the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 3s are replacing 2s based on the position's row and column. For example, in certain rows, the 2s are replaced with 8s, and in other rows, they are replaced with 3s.\n\nLooking at the outputs for the three examples:\n\nExample 1 has 8s and 3s. Example 2 has 8s and 3s. Example 3 has 3s and 8s. So maybe the 8s are in certain positions based on their row and column.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s and 3s are replacing the 2s in certain regions. For example, in the middle of the grid. Let me think about the positions where 8s appear.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 8s appear in the middle columns (columns 6-9) of certain rows. For example, row 1 (second row of input) has 8s in columns 6-9. Similarly, in row 5 (the fifth row of input?), the output has 8s. Maybe the 8s are in positions that are part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell relative to the center of the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle columns, it's replaced with 8 or 3.\n\nAnother approach: let's look for the positions where the 8s and 3s are in the output and compare them to the input. For example, in Example 1's output, the 8s are in positions where the original cell was 2, and the 3s are in other positions. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 3's output, the second row has 3s in certain positions. The input for that row was 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0. The output is 0 0 3 3 0 0 0 8 8 0 0. So the original 2s in columns 2-3 and 7-8 are replaced with 3s and 8s. Maybe the 3s are in the left part of the grid, and 8s in the right part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 3s are based on the distance from the center. For example, if a cell is in the middle columns, it's replaced with 8, and if it's in another part, it's replaced with 3.\n\nBut how to determine this. Let's think of the grid as 16 rows and 11 columns. The middle column would be column 5 (since 11 columns, 0-based, middle is 5). Maybe cells in columns 5-6 are replaced with 8s, and others with 3s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is part of a vertical line in the middle of the grid. For example, in Example 1, the second row has 2s in the middle, and the output has 8s in the middle columns.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle columns of certain rows, and 3s in other rows. For example, the 8s appear in rows 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. Wait, looking at the output of Example 1, the 8s are in rows 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. But the input has 2s in those rows. Maybe the 8s are in rows where the row index is even or odd?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the row is even, and 3s in odd rows. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s and 3s are based on the position of the cell in the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid (columns 5-6), then it's replaced with 8 or 3 based on the row.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle columns of certain rows. Let's consider that the 8s are in the middle of the grid. For example, in the input, the 2s are in vertical lines, and the output replaces those with 8s in the middle columns.\n\nBut how to code this. Maybe for each cell, if the original value is 2, and it's in a certain position (like middle columns), then replace with 8 or 3 based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 2 and is surrounded by 2s, then it becomes 8. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original cell's value and the row and column. For example, if the cell is in column 5 (middle), and the row is even, then replace with 8. But how to test this.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is given. Let's see the test input's structure. The test input is:\n\nRow 0: 0s\nRow 1: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 2: 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\nRow 3: 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0s\nRow 6: 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\nRow 7: 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 10: 0s\nRow 11: 0 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 2 0 0\nRow 12: 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 13: 0 2 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 2 0\nRow 14: 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\nRow 15: 0s\n\nThe output for the test input is not given, but the task is to write a transformation that maps the input to the output. The problem is to find the pattern.\n\nBut given that the training examples have outputs with 8s and 3s, perhaps the transformation is based on the cell's value and its position. For example, if the cell is 2 and is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 8 or 3.\n\nLooking back at Example 1's output, the 8s appear in the middle columns of certain rows. Let me think about the middle columns. The grid has 11 columns (0-10). The middle is column 5. So maybe cells in columns 5 and 6 are replaced with 8s or 3s based on their row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in cells that are in the middle of the grid. For example, in rows where the row is even, the middle columns are replaced with 8s, and in odd rows, with 3s. But how to verify.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 3's output, the 3s are in certain positions. For example, in the second row of output, the 3s are in columns 2-3 and 7-8. The input for that row was 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 2 2 0 0. So the 2s in columns 2-3 and 7-8 are replaced with 3s and 8s. Maybe the 3s are in the left part of the grid and 8s in the right part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is in a vertical line of 2s, then replace with 8. But how to detect that.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle columns of certain rows. For example, in row 1 (second row of input), the output has 8s in columns 6-9. The original input for that row was 0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0. So the original 2s are in columns 1-4 and 6-9. The output replaces the 2s in columns 6-9 with 8s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain pattern. For example, in the middle of the grid, the 8s are replacing the 2s that are part of a vertical line. But how to code this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the cell is part of a vertical line of 2s, and the 3s are in positions that are part of a different pattern.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to find the exact pattern. However, the problem says that the output must be a 16x11 grid. So the function must return a grid of that size.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is based on the cell's value and whether it's in a certain region of the grid. For example, if the cell is 2 and is in the middle columns (columns 5-6), then it becomes 8. If it's in other columns, it remains 2. But then, in Example 1, the 8s are in the middle columns. But in Example 3, the 3s are in columns 2-3 and 7-8. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation depends on the row. For example, in even rows, the middle columns are replaced with 8s, and in odd rows, replaced with 3s. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at the outputs for the training examples:\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 8s in certain rows. For example, row 1 (second row of output) has 8s in the middle. Row 4 (fifth row of output) has 8s in the middle. Row 6 (seventh row of output) has 8s in the middle. Row 8 (ninth row of output) has 8s in the middle. Row 10 (eleventh row of output) has 8s in the middle. Row 12 (thirteenth row of output) has 8s in the middle. Row 14 (fifteenth row of output) has 8s in the middle. Wait, but in the output of Example 1, the 8s are in rows 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14. These are rows with even indices (assuming rows are 0-based). For example, row 1 is odd, but maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in rows where the row index is even or odd, but that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the row is even and the column is in the middle. For example, in row 1 (which is odd), there are 8s. So this approach may not work.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is based on the cell's position relative to the center of the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with 8 or 3. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if the cell is 2 and is surrounded by 2s, it becomes 8. But how to code that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs of the examples, maybe the 8s are in the middle of the grid, and the 3s are in other parts. For example, in Example 1, the output has 3s in rows 12 and 14, but that's not clear.\n\nAt this point, it's challenging to find the exact pattern. However, given the examples, I need to make an educated guess. One possible pattern is that cells with value 2 in certain positions (like the middle columns) are replaced with 8s, and in other positions with 3s. But how to determine which positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the cell's row and column. For example, if the cell is in column 5 or 6 (middle columns), then it's replaced with 8 if the row is even, and 3 if the row is odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet me try to code this. For each cell, if the original value is 2, and the column is 5 or 6, then replace with 8 if the row is even, else 3. But I need to check if this fits the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the second row (row index 1) has 8s in columns 6-9. If column 6 is in the middle, then for row 1 (odd), it should be 3. But in the output, it's 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the column. For example, if the column is 5 or 6, replace with 8. But then in Example 1, the output has 8s in columns 6-9, which may not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the row. For example, if the row is even, replace 2 with 8, and if odd, replace with 3. But in Example 1, the output has 8s in row 1 (odd), which would not fit.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Another approach: look at the outputs of the examples and see if there's a pattern in the positions of the 8s and 3s.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 8s in the middle columns of certain rows. For example, row 1 (second row of input) has 8s in columns 6-9. The original input for that row is 0 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 0. So the 2s in columns 6-9 (original) are replaced with 8s. But why?\n\nMaybe the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is part of a vertical line. For example, in the input, there are vertical lines of 2s in the middle of the grid, and the output replaces those with 8s.\n\nBut how to detect that. Perhaps the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is part of a vertical line. For example, in the input, the 2s are in vertical lines, and the output replaces those with 8s.\n\nBut how to code that. Maybe the 8s are in positions where the cell is 2 and the cell to the left and right are also 2, and the cell above and below are 2. But this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, rows where the row is even, and columns 5-6.\n\nBut given the time constraints, I need to make a decision. Based on the examples, perhaps the transformation is that cells with value 2 in certain positions (like middle columns) are replaced with 8 or 3 based on their row. For example, in even rows, replace with 8, in odd rows, replace with 3.\n\nBut in Example 1, the second row (row 1) has 8s. If row 1 is odd, this would not fit. But maybe the rows are 0-based. Let's check.\n\nIn Example 1, the output for row 1 (second row of input) has 8s. If the rows are 0-based, then row 1 is odd. But in the output, it's replaced with 8. So this approach may not work.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the column. For example, columns 5-6 are replaced with 8 if the cell is 2. But in Example 1, the output has 8s in columns 6-9. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s and 3s are replacing the 2s in certain patterns. For example, in the input, there are certain shapes (like vertical lines) that are replaced with 8s or 3s. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are in the middle of the grid, and the 3s are in other parts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the original cell is 2 and is in a certain pattern, like a vertical line. For example, in the input, there are vertical lines of 2s in the middle, and the output replaces those with 8s.\n\nBut how to detect that. Perhaps the 8s are in positions where the cell is 2 and the cell to the left and right are also 2, and the cell above and below are 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the cell is 2 and the cell is in a certain row or column. For example, in rows 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 (which are odd rows in 0-based indexing), replace with 8.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to make a hypothesis. Let's assume that the 8s are in positions where the cell is 2 and is in the middle columns (columns 5-6) and the row is even. The 3s are in positions where the cell is 2 and in the middle columns but the row is odd.\n\nBut how to test this. Let's look at Example 1's output. For row 1 (which is odd), the 8s are in columns 6-9. So this would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in columns 5-6, regardless of the row. For example, if the cell is 2 and in columns 5 or 6, replace with 8. But in Example 1, the output has 8s in columns 6-9, which would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the cell is 2 and the column is 5 or 6, and the row is even. In Example 1's output, the second row (row 1) has 8s in columns 6-9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is very challenging. Maybe the transformation is based on the original cell's value and its position relative to the center of the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid (columns 5-6), and the row is even, replace with 8. If the row is odd, replace with 3.\n\nBut I need to code this. Let's try to write a function that for each cell, if it is 2, and the column is 5 or 6, then replace with 8 if the row is even, else 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's output. For example, in row 1 (which is odd), the 8s are in columns 6-9. According to this hypothesis, since the column is 6 (which is in 5-6), and the row is odd, it should be 3. But the output is 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in columns 5-6, and the row is even or odd. But how.\n\nAt this point, perhaps the best approach is to look for the positions where the 8s and 3s appear in the examples and try to find a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8s appear in certain rows and columns. Let's look at the output for Example 1:\n\nRow 1 (second row of output): 0 2 2 2 2 0 8 8 8 8 0\nRow 4 (fifth row of output): 0 2 2 2 2 0 8 8 8 8 0\nRow 6 (seventh row of output): 0 8 8 8 8 0 2 2 2 2 0\nRow 8 (ninth row of output): 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 2 0 0\nWait, no, in Example 1's output, the third row is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0. So the 8 is in column 7 (index 7). The middle columns are 5 and 6. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the column is 6, and the row is even.\n\nIn Example 1, row 1 (second row of output) has 8s in column 6-9. So column 6 is 6, which is in the middle. But how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in columns 6-9 for certain rows. But this is not a general rule.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with a possible hypothesis. Perhaps the transformation is that any cell with value 2 and in columns 5 or 6 is replaced with 8, and if it's in columns 2 or 3, it's replaced with 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the cell's value and its position in the grid. For example, if the cell is 2 and is in the middle of the grid (columns 5-6), replace with 8. Otherwise, leave it as 2. But this would not explain the 3s in some examples.\n\nBut in Example 3's output, there are 3s. So this suggests that there are other conditions.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s and 3s are replacing the 2s in certain positions based on the row and column. For example, if the row is even and the column is 5, replace with 8; if the row is odd and column is 5, replace with 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to code a function that replaces 2s in certain positions with 8 or 3 based on some criteria, even if it's not perfect. For example, replace 2s in columns 5 and 6 with 8, and in other columns with 3. But this may not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the cell's value and whether it is in a certain pattern. For example, if the cell is 2 and is part of a vertical line, replace with 8. If it's part of a horizontal line, replace with 3. But how to detect that.\n\nGiven the time, I think I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell, if the value is 2 and the column is 5 or 6, replace with 8. If the value is 2 and the column is 2 or 3, replace with 3. Otherwise, leave it as 2. This is a guess, but it may fit some examples.\n\nBut in Example 1, the third row of output has 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0. So column 7 (index 7) is 8. But according to this hypothesis, column 7 is not 5 or 6, so it should remain 2. But in the output, it's 8. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 8s are in positions where the cell is 2 and is in the middle of the grid (columns 5-6), and the row is even. The 3s are in the same columns but odd rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the second row (row 1, odd) has 8s in columns 6-9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Perhaps I should look for a different pattern. Maybe the 8s and 3s are replacing 2s in certain positions based on the cell's position in the grid. For example, in the middle of the grid, the 8s are replaced, and in other parts, the 3s are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in positions where the cell is 2 and is in a certain pattern, like a vertical line. For example, in Example 1, the input has vertical lines of 2s in the middle, and the output replaces those with 8s.\n\nBut how to detect that. Perhaps the 8s are in positions where the cell is 2 and the cell to the left and right are also 2, and the cell above and below are 2.\n\nBut this would require checking the surrounding cells.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the code would be something like:\n\nfor each cell in grid:\n    if cell is 2 and (left and right are 2 and above and below are 2):\n        replace with 8\n    elif cell is 2 and (some other condition):\n        replace with 3\n    else:\n        leave as is\n\nBut this is complex to implement and may not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the number of 2s in the cell's row or column. For example, if a cell is 2 and its row has many 2s, replace with 8.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with a possible solution. Based on the examples, I'll assume that the 8s and 3s are replacing the 2s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in columns 5 and 6, replace with 8 if the row is even, and 3 if odd.\n\nBut in Example 1, row 1 (odd) has 8s in columns 6-9. So this doesn't fit. However, maybe the columns are different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in columns 5-6 for all rows. So for any cell that is 2 and in columns 5 or 6, replace with 8. But in Example 3's output, there are 3s in columns 2-3 and 7-8. So this would not fit.\n\nAnother idea: the 8s are in columns 5-6, and 3s are in columns 2-3 and 7-8. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll write a function that replaces 2s in columns 5-6 with 8, and 2s in columns 2-3 and 7-8 with 3. For other columns, leave as 2.\n\nBut this may not fit all examples, but it's a possible approach.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's output. For example, in row 1, the output has 8s in columns 6-9. According to this hypothesis, columns 5-6 are replaced with 8, but columns 6-9 are not. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in columns 6-9 for certain rows.\n\nBut this is getting too complex. I think I need to make a decision and write the code based on the best possible hypothesis, even if it's not perfect.\n\nBased on the examples, I'll assume that the 8s are in the middle columns (columns 5-6) and the 3s are in other columns. For example, if the cell is 2 and in columns 5-6, replace with 8. If it's in other columns, replace with 3. But this would not fit all examples, but it's a start.\n\nBut in Example 1, the third row of output has 8 in column 7, which is not 5-6. So this is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to look for another pattern. Perhaps the 8s and 3s are replacing the 2s based on the row. For example, in even rows, replace with 8, in odd rows, replace with 3.\n\nBut in Example 1, the second row (row 1, odd) has 8s. So this would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rows are 0-based, and the 8s are in rows where the row index is even. For example, row 0, 2, 4, etc. But in Example 1's output, row 1 has 8s.\n\nThis is not working. I think I need to give up and make a guess based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the outputs, the 8s and 3s seem to replace the 2s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the 8s are in the middle of the grid, and the 3s are in other parts.\n\nMaybe the 8s are in positions where the cell is in the middle of the grid (columns 5-6), and the 3s are in other parts. For example, in Example 3, the 3s are in columns 2-3 and 7-8.\n\nBut how to code this. Perhaps, for each cell, if it is 2 and in columns 5 or 6, replace with 8. If it is 2 and in columns 2-3 or 7-8, replace with 3. Otherwise, leave as 2.\n\nThis would explain some of the examples. Let's test this.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the second row has 8s in columns 6-9. According to this, column 6 is replaced with 8. But columns 7-9 are not in 5-6, so they would not be replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in the output, columns 6-9 are 8s. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible guess, even if it's not perfect. Based on the examples, I'll assume that the 8s and 3s are replacing 2s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in columns 5-6, replace with 8 if the row is even, and 3 if odd.\n\nBut in Example 1, row 1 is odd, but has 8s in columns 6-9. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time, I'll write a function that replaces 2s in columns 5-6 with 8, and 2s in columns 2-3 with 3. This is a guess, but it may fit some examples.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for col in range(11):\n            if row[col] == 2:\n                if col in [5, 6]:\n                    new_row.append(8)\n                elif col in [2, 3]:\n                    new_row.append(3)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(2)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(row[col])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not fit all examples. For example, in Example 1, the third row of input has 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0. So column 7 (index 7) is 2 in input, and in the output it's 8. According to the code, column 7 is not 5 or 6, so it should remain 2. But in the output, it's 8. So this code is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the code should replace 2s in columns 6-9 with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code should replace 2s in columns 5-6 with 8, and 2s in columns 7-8 with 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with this code, even if it's not correct for all examples. The user asked for a transformation that captures the patterns observed, even if not perfect.\n\nBut based on the examples, I think the correct approach is to replace 2s in certain positions with 8 or 3 based on their position in the grid. For example, in the middle columns, replace with 8, and in other columns with 3. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8s are in the middle columns (columns 5-6), and 3s in other columns. But this would not explain the 3s in some examples.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 2s in columns 5-6 with 8, and others with 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut in the example, the third row of output has 8 in column 7. So this code would not handle it.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a final decision and write the code based on the best guess, even if it's not perfect. The code may not pass all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n"
