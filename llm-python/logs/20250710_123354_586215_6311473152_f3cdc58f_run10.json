          "Let's analyze the transformation from the training examples step-by-step:\n\n### Observations from the training examples:\n\n- **Grids are always 10x10, output also 10x10.**\n- Input grids have colored dots scattered in various places.\n- Output grids always show vertical colored \"stripes\" aligned to the left side of the grid.\n- Each output grid forms vertical columns representing colors seen in the input.\n- Color order in the vertical stripes in output:\n  - Predominantly blue (1) stripe first (leftmost column).\n  - Then red (2),\n  - Then green (3),\n  - Then yellow (4).\n- The stripes grow vertically from bottom to top, ascending by color value.\n- The height of each stripe in the output equals the **count of that color present in the input grid**.\n- The colors not present in the input do not appear in the output.\n- All non-stripe cells are zero.\n- When multiple instances of a color appear, the corresponding vertical stripe's height equals the count of occurrences for that color.\n- The stripes start at the bottom of the output grid (row 9 for zero-based indexing) and extend upward.\n- Colors are mapped as follows (from the visual and numerical cues):\n  - Blue \u2192 color=1\n  - Red \u2192 color=2\n  - Green \u2192 color=3\n  - Yellow \u2192 color=4\n\n### Thus:\nFor each color in [1,2,3,4]:\n- Count how many times it appears in the input.\n- Draw a vertical stripe at column corresponding to that color's rank (Blue=0, Red=1, Green=2, Yellow=3).\n- Fill from bottom upwards the counted number of pixels with that color.\n\n### Verification with example 1:\n- Blue(1) count = 9 \u2192 leftmost column filled 9 from bottom with 1\n- Red(2) count = 3 \u2192 next column, 3 cells filled with 2 at bottom\n- Green(3) count = 3 \u2192 third column, 3 cells filled with 3 at bottom\n- Yellow(4) count = 4 \u2192 fourth column, 4 cells filled with 4 at bottom\n\nMatches well.\n\n---\n\n### Implementation plan:\n- Initialize 10x10 grid of zeros.\n- For each color in [1,2,3,4]:\n  - Count occurrences in input.\n  - If count > 0:\n    - Fill a vertical stripe at column index = color-1 (0-based index) from bottom row upwards by count with that color.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize output grid with zeros\n    HEIGHT = WIDTH = 10\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(WIDTH)] for _ in range(HEIGHT)]\n\n    # Colors to create stripes for and their output columns (0-based)\n    colors = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n\n    for idx, color in enumerate(colors):\n        # Count occurrences of this color in the input grid\n        count = sum(row.count(color) for row in grid)\n        # Fill from bottom row upwards\n        for i in range(count):\n            output[HEIGHT - 1 - i][idx] = color\n\n    return output\n```"
