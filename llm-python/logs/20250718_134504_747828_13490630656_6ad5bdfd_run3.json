          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. I need to look at the input and output grids for each example and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 10x6 grid. The output is also 10x6. Let me look at the input and output for this example.\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nFirst input row is 0 0 0 0 8 8. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the first row of input becomes all zeros in the output. But then the next rows in the input are 3 0 0 4 0 0, which in the output become 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, but in the output, the 7th row (index 6?) is 3 0 0 4 8 8. Hmm, maybe there's some kind of transformation where certain positions are kept or modified based on some criteria.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1, the first six rows are all zeros. Then the seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The eighth row is 3 0 0 4 0 6. The ninth row is 1 1 5 5 0 6. The tenth row is 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nWait, maybe the output is derived by some kind of selection or replacement based on certain conditions. Let me check the input again.\n\nIn the input for example 1, the first row is 0 0 0 0 8 8. The output for that row is all zeros. But in the seventh row of the output, there's 3 0 0 4 8 8. Looking at the input, the seventh row is 0 0 5 5 0 0. Wait, maybe the output is taking some values from the input but replacing others? Or maybe it's about grouping certain numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain cells with zeros, but keeping some values. For example, in the first input row, the last two elements are 8, which are kept in the output? But no, the output first row is all zeros. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain positions are kept if they meet certain criteria. Let me think about the output for example 1. The output has some rows where the values are 3, 4, 8, etc. Looking at the input, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input and replacing others. For example, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where they are part of a certain pattern, like adjacent numbers or something.\n\nLooking at example 2. The input is a 11x11 grid? Wait, no, the input for example 2 is given as 11 columns? Wait, the input for example 2 is:\n\nInput:\n2 0 0 3 3 0 0 4 4 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 6 6 0\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n2 0 7 7 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nOutput:\n2 3 3 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 5 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 7 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo for example, the first input row is 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 4 4 0 0. The output is 2 3 3 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the first row of input becomes the first row of output, but with the 3s and 4s in positions 3,4 and 7,8. Wait, but the original input has 3s at positions 3 and 4 (indices 3 and 4?), and 4s at 7 and 8. The output has those values in the same positions. But the output first row has 2 followed by 3,3,4,4, then zeros. So maybe the output is taking the values from the input where they are part of certain patterns. For example, in the first row, the 3s and 4s are kept, but the 2 is kept as well. But why?\n\nLooking at the output for example 2, the first row of output is 2 3 3 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The input's first row is 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 4 4 0 0. So the output seems to have the 2, then the 3s, then the 4s, and then zeros. So perhaps the output is taking the values from the input where they are part of a group of same numbers, and replacing others with zero. Or maybe it's about grouping adjacent numbers. For example, in the first row, the 3s are adjacent and the 4s are adjacent. So the output is keeping those and replacing others with zero. But then in the second row of the output, the first element is 2, then 5, then zeros. The input's second row is 2 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. So the output is 2 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5 is kept, and the 2 is kept. So maybe the output is taking the first occurrence of a number and then replacing others? Or maybe it's about taking the first occurrence of a number in a row and then replacing others with zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first occurrence of each unique number in a row and then replacing other instances with zero. But that doesn't fit all examples. Let's check example 3.\n\nExample 3's input is:\n\n0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 5 5 0 0 6 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 2\n0 9 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 2\n0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 6 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 9 8 8 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 2\n\nLooking at the first input row: 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. So the output seems to have the 4s and 2 in the end, but the 0s in the beginning. So maybe the output is replacing all numbers except for the first occurrence of each number in the row. Or maybe it's taking the first occurrence of each number and then replacing others with zero. But in this case, the 4s are in positions 1 and 2. The output has 4s in positions 7 and 8. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the numbers that are in certain positions. For example, in the first input row, the 4s are in positions 1 and 2 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), and the output has 4s in positions 7 and 8. That seems like a shift. But that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the numbers that are part of certain patterns. For example, in the first input row, the 4s are adjacent. In the output, the 4s are in positions 7 and 8. Wait, maybe the output is taking the numbers that are in the same column as certain positions. Or maybe it's about the positions where the numbers are in certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output, the first row's output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. The input row was 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. So the output has the 4s in the 7th and 8th positions (assuming 0-based, but maybe 1-based?), and the 2 is at the end. So maybe the output is taking the numbers that are in the same row but in certain columns, like columns 7 and 8 for the 4s and column 9 for the 2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the numbers that are in the same row but in certain positions. For example, in the first row of example 3, the 4s are in columns 1 and 2. The output has them in columns 7 and 8. That seems like a shift. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing all numbers except for those that are part of a group of same numbers. For example, in the first row of example 3, the 4s are in positions 1 and 2. The output has them in positions 7 and 8. So maybe the output is taking those numbers and moving them to the end of the row. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the numbers that are in the same row and column as certain positions. For example, in example 1, the output for the seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The input for that row is 0 0 5 5 0 0. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the numbers that are in certain positions and replacing others. For example, in example 1, the output's seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. Looking at the input, the seventh row is 0 0 5 5 0 0. But where do the 3, 4, 8, 8 come from? Maybe those numbers are from other rows. For example, the first row of input has 8 and 8. The seventh row of output has 8 and 8. But that's not directly connected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where the value is part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the output for the seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The input for the seventh row is 0 0 5 5 0 0. But where do the 3, 4, 8 come from? Maybe these numbers are from other rows. For example, the first row has 8s, and the third row has 3 and 4. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where they are in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the output's seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The input's first row is 0 0 0 0 8 8. The third row is 3 0 0 4 0 0. So maybe the output is taking the 3 and 4 from the third row and the 8s from the first row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values with zeros, but keeping others. For example, in example 1, the first six rows of the output are all zeros. Then, in the seventh row, the 3 and 4 are from the third row of input, and the 8 and 8 from the first row. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the values from the input and replacing them with zeros unless they are part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the output's seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The 3 and 4 are from the third row of the input (3 0 0 4 0 0). The 8s are from the first row (0 0 0 0 8 8). So maybe the output is taking the values from the input where they are part of a group of same numbers and keeping them, while replacing others with zero. But how to determine which groups?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first occurrence of each number in the row and keeping it, while replacing others with zero. But in example 1, the first row of input is 0 0 0 0 8 8. The first occurrence of 0 is in position 0, and the first occurrence of 8 is in position 4. The output is all zeros, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the numbers that are in the same column as certain positions. For example, in example 1, the output's seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The 3 is in column 0, 4 in column 3, and 8 in columns 4 and 5. But where do these numbers come from?\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to look for a pattern that applies to multiple examples. Let's look at example 2. The input's first row is 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 4 4 0 0. The output's first row is 2 3 3 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is kept, followed by the 3s and 4s. Maybe the output is taking the first occurrence of each number in the row and then replacing others with zero. But in this case, the 2 is the first occurrence, then the 3s are next, then the 4s. So maybe the output is taking the first occurrence of each number in the row and then replacing others with zero. But how?\n\nIn example 2's first row, the numbers are 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0. The output is 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the first occurrence of 2 is kept, then the first occurrence of 3 is at position 3, then the first occurrence of 4 is at position 7. So maybe the output is taking the first occurrence of each unique number in the row and then replacing other instances with zero. But then in the first row, the 3s and 4s are kept, and the 2 is kept. But the 0s are replaced with zero. That seems to fit.\n\nLet me check the second row of example 2. Input is 2 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. Output is 2 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the first occurrence of 2 is kept, then the first occurrence of 5 is at position 5. The rest are zeros. So this seems to fit the pattern.\n\nIn example 3's first input row: 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. The first occurrence of 4 is at position 1, and the first occurrence of 2 is at position 9. So the output has 4s at positions 7 and 8 (but that's not the first occurrence of 4). Wait, this doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe my hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first occurrence of each unique number in the row, but then replacing other instances with zero. But in example 3's first row, the 4s are in positions 1 and 2. The output has 4s in positions 7 and 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the numbers that are in the same row and column as certain positions. For example, in example 3, the first row of output has 4s in positions 7 and 8. The input's first row has 4s in positions 1 and 2. Maybe the output is taking those values and moving them to the end of the row. But that would mean that in the first row of example 3, the 4s are moved to the end. However, the output has 4s in positions 7 and 8, which is the 7th and 8th columns. The original row has 10 columns. So maybe the output is taking the numbers that are in the same row and column as certain positions, but this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the numbers that are in the same row and column as certain positions, but this seems too vague.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for example 1. The first six rows of output are all zeros. The seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The eighth row is 3 0 0 4 0 6. The ninth row is 1 1 5 5 0 6. The tenth row is 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 8 8\nRow 1: 3 0 0 4 0 0\nRow 2: 3 0 0 4 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 6\nRow 4: 1 1 0 0 0 6\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 5 5 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nThe output for row 6 (seventh row) is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2. The 8s are from row 0. The 8s in the output's row 6 are from row 0. So maybe the output is taking certain values from different rows and combining them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from certain rows and columns. For example, the seventh row of the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2, and the 8s are from row 0. But how to determine which rows and columns to take?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from the input where the value is part of a group of same numbers. For example, in example 1, the first row has 8s, which are kept in the output. The third row has 3 and 4, which are kept in the output. But this doesn't explain the seventh row's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values with zeros and keeping others. For example, in example 1, the first six rows of output are all zeros, but the seventh row has some values. Maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input that are not zero and placing them in certain positions. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for example 1, the seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The input's row 6 is 0 0 5 5 0 0. So where do the 3, 4, 8, 8 come from? Maybe the 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2. The 8s are from row 0. But how to determine which values to take.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first non-zero value in each row and then replacing others with zero. But in example 1's first row, the first non-zero is 0, which is zero. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where they are in certain columns. For example, in example 1, the output for row 6 is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The columns 0 and 3 are 3 and 4, which are from row 1 and 2. The 8s are from row 0. But again, this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input that are in certain positions, such as the first occurrence of each number in the row. For example, in example 1's row 6 (input is 0 0 5 5 0 0), the first non-zero is 5. But the output for row 6 is 3 0 0 4 8 8, which doesn't include 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to multiple examples. Let's look at example 3's output again.\n\nIn example 3, the input's first row is 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. So the output has the 4s in columns 7 and 8, and the 2 at the end. So maybe the output is taking the 4s and 2 from the input and placing them in the end of the row. But how?\n\nIn the input's first row, the 4s are in columns 1 and 2. The output has them in columns 7 and 8. So maybe the output is taking the 4s and moving them to the end, and the 2 is also moved to the end. But in the output, the 4s are in columns 7 and 8, which is the 7th and 8th positions. But the input's row has 10 columns, so the output is 10 columns. So maybe the output is taking the last two non-zero values from the input row and placing them at the end.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the input is 0 0 0 0 8 8. The output is all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values that are in the same row as certain positions. For example, in example 3's first row, the 4s are in columns 1 and 2. The output has them in columns 7 and 8. So maybe the output is taking the values from the input and placing them in the last two columns. But this doesn't fit other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from the input where they are part of a certain pattern, like adjacent numbers. For example, in example 3's first row, the 4s are adjacent, so they are kept, and the 2 is kept. But how to determine which ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing all values with zero except for the first occurrence of each unique number in the row. But in example 3's first row, the first occurrence of 4 is at column 1, and the first occurrence of 2 is at column 9. So the output would have 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2, but the actual output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the output for example 3's first row again. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. The input row is 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. So the output has the 4s in columns 7 and 8, and the 2 in column 9. So maybe the output is taking the values that are in the same row and columns 7 and 8, and column 9. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values that are in the same column as certain positions. For example, in example 3's first row, the 4s are in columns 1 and 2, and the output has them in columns 7 and 8. That's a shift of 6 columns. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where they are part of a certain group. For example, in example 3's first row, the 4s are part of a group, and the 2 is part of another group. But how to determine which groups.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where the value is part of a certain pattern, like the first occurrence of a number in the row, and then replacing other instances with zero. But in example 3's first row, the first occurrence of 4 is at column 1, and the first occurrence of 2 is at column 9. So the output would have 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2, but the actual output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the output for example 1. The first six rows of the output are all zeros. The seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The eighth row is 3 0 0 4 0 6. The ninth row is 1 1 5 5 0 6. The tenth row is 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nLooking at the input for these rows:\n\nRow 6 (seventh row of output): input is 0 0 5 5 0 0. Output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. So the 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2. The 8s are from row 0. But how?\n\nRow 7 (eighth row of output): input is 0 0 0 0 0 0. Output is 3 0 0 4 0 6. So where do these values come from? Maybe the 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2, and 6 from row 3.\n\nRow 8 (ninth row of output): input is 0 0 0 0 0 0. Output is 1 1 5 5 0 6. So the 1s and 5s are from row 4, and 6 from row 3.\n\nRow 9 (tenth row of output): input is 2 2 2 2 2 2. Output is 2 2 2 2 2 2. So it's the same as input.\n\nSo maybe the output is taking certain values from different rows and columns. For example, the 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2, the 8s from row 0, the 6 from row 3, and the 1s and 5s from row 4.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns to take these values from.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from certain rows and columns, like the first two rows, then the third row, etc. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the values from the input where they are in certain positions, like columns 0 and 3. For example, in example 1's row 6 (input is 0 0 5 5 0 0), the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2, and the 8s from row 0. So maybe the output is taking the values from the first two rows (rows 0 and 1) and the third row (row 2), and combining them.\n\nBut this seems too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where they are part of certain patterns, like the first occurrence of a number in the row and then replacing others with zero. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that applies to multiple examples. Let's look at the output for example 2. The first row of output is 2 3 3 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The input's first row is 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 4 4 0 0. So the output seems to take the 2, then the 3s, then the 4s, and replace others with zero. So maybe the output is taking the values from the input and keeping the first occurrence of each number in the row, and replacing others with zero. But in example 3's first row, this doesn't fit.\n\nBut let's try this hypothesis. For example, in example 3's first row, the input is 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. The first occurrence of 4 is at position 1, and the first occurrence of 2 is at position 9. So the output should be 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. But the actual output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. So this doesn't fit. So the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from the input where they are in certain columns. For example, in example 2, the output's first row is 2 3 3 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The 3s and 4s are in columns 3,4 and 7,8. So maybe the output is taking the values from columns 3,4,7,8 and replacing others with zero. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where the value is part of a certain pattern, like adjacent numbers. For example, in example 2's first row, the 3s are adjacent and the 4s are adjacent. So the output keeps them, and replaces others with zero.\n\nIn example 3's first row, the 4s are adjacent and the 2 is at the end. So the output keeps them, but the 4s are moved to the end. So maybe the output is taking the adjacent numbers and placing them at the end of the row.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nAnother idea: for each row in the input, the output row is generated by taking the values that are part of a group of same numbers, and placing them at the end of the row, while replacing others with zero. For example, in example 2's first row, the 3s and 4s are in groups, so they are kept at the end. In example 3's first row, the 4s are in a group and the 2 is at the end, so they are kept.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the 8s are in a group, so they are kept at the end. But the output for that row is all zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where they are part of a group of same numbers and placing them at the end of the row, but only if the group is of a certain length. But this is just speculation.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the output for example 1. The first six rows of output are all zeros. The seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The eighth row is 3 0 0 4 0 6. The ninth row is 1 1 5 5 0 6. The tenth row is 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nLooking at the input for these rows:\n\nRow 6 (input): 0 0 5 5 0 0. Output: 3 0 0 4 8 8. So the 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2, and the 8s from row 0.\n\nRow 7 (input): 0 0 0 0 0 0. Output: 3 0 0 4 0 6. The 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2, and 6 from row 3.\n\nRow 8 (input): 0 0 0 0 0 0. Output: 1 1 5 5 0 6. The 1s and 5s are from row 4, and 6 from row 3.\n\nRow 9 (input): 2 2 2 2 2 2. Output: same as input.\n\nSo maybe the output is taking values from certain rows and columns. For example, for row 6, the output is taking 3 from row 1, 4 from row 2, and 8 from row 0. For row 7, it's taking 3 from row 1, 4 from row 2, and 6 from row 3. For row 8, it's taking 1 and 5 from row 4, and 6 from row 3.\n\nThis suggests that the output is taking values from certain rows and columns, but it's not clear which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from the input where they are in certain columns. For example, in row 6 of example 1, the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The 3 is at column 0, 4 at column 3, and 8 at columns 4 and 5. So perhaps the output is taking the values from columns 0, 3, 4, 5 of the input rows. But how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from certain columns of the input. For example, in example 1's output, the seventh row has 3 at column 0, 4 at column 3, and 8 at columns 4 and 5. These columns are 0, 3, 4, 5. But how to determine which columns to take.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that applies to all examples. Let's think about the output for example 1's seventh row. The 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2, and the 8s from row 0. The 3 and 4 are in columns 0 and 3 of the output. Maybe these are the first and third columns of the input.\n\nBut this is too vague. Maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where the value is not zero and placing them in certain positions. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see.\n\nLooking at example 2, the output seems to take the first occurrence of each unique number in the row and replace others with zero. For example, in the first row of example 2, the output is 2 3 3 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. This suggests that the first occurrence of 2 is kept, then the first occurrence of 3 is at position 3, and the first occurrence of 4 is at position 7. So the output is taking the first occurrence of each unique number in the row, and replacing others with zero.\n\nBut in example 3's first row, this doesn't fit. The input is 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. The first occurrence of 4 is at position 1, and the first occurrence of 2 is at position 9. So the output would be 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. But the actual output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. So this doesn't fit. So maybe this pattern is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from the input where the value is part of a group of same numbers, and placing them at the end of the row. For example, in example 2's first row, the 3s and 4s are in groups, so they are moved to the end. In example 3's first row, the 4s are in a group, so they are moved to the end, and the 2 is at the end.\n\nBut how to implement this in code. For each row, we can find all the groups of same numbers, and then place them at the end of the row, replacing others with zero.\n\nLet's try this hypothesis.\n\nFor example, in example 2's first row: 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 4 4 0 0.\n\nThe groups are [2], [0, 0], [3, 3], [0, 0], [4, 4], [0, 0]. The groups of non-zero are [2], [3,3], [4,4]. So the output would be [2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Which matches the example's output.\n\nIn example 3's first row: 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. The groups are [0], [4,4], [0,0,0,0], [0,0], [2]. So the non-zero groups are [4,4], [2]. So the output would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 2], which matches the example's output.\n\nIn example 1's first row: 0 0 0 0 8 8. The groups are [0,0,0,0], [8,8]. So the non-zero group is [8,8]. The output would be [0,0,0,0,0,0], which matches the example's output.\n\nFor example 1's seventh row (input is 0 0 5 5 0 0). The groups are [0,0], [5,5], [0,0]. Non-zero group is [5,5]. So the output would be [0,0,0,0,0,0], but the example's output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. So this doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. But why does it work for some examples but not others?\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking the groups of non-zero values and placing them at the end, but also including other values from other rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the groups of non-zero values from the input and placing them at the end of the row, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the input is 0 0 5 5 0 0. The groups are [5,5]. So the output would be [0,0,0,0,0,0], but the actual output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1's seventh row, the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. These values are from other rows. So this suggests that the pattern is more complex.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and the examples I have, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output is generated by taking the groups of non-zero values from each row and placing them at the end, replacing others with zero. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it fits some, and maybe the other examples have other patterns.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each row in the input, identify the groups of non-zero values, and then place them at the end of the row, replacing other values with zero.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with example 1's seventh row. The input is 0 0 5 5 0 0. The groups of non-zero are [5,5]. So the output would be [0,0,0,0,0,0], but the actual output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. So this doesn't fit. But maybe the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from certain columns of the input. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2, and the 8s from row 0. So maybe the output is taking values from certain rows and columns.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide a solution, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output is generated by taking the groups of non-zero values from each row and placing them at the end, replacing others with zero. This fits examples 2 and 3, but not example 1. But maybe the example 1's output is an exception, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from the input where they are in certain columns, like columns 0, 3, 4, 5, and others. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. These values are from columns 0, 3, 4, 5 of the input rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the output for example 1's seventh row. The output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. These values are 3, 4, 8, 8. The 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2 (3 0 0 4 0 0). The 8s are from row 0 (0 0 0 0 8 8). So maybe the output is taking the values from certain rows and columns. For example, the 3 is from row 1, column 0; 4 from row 1, column 3; 8 from row 0, columns 4 and 5.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns to take.\n\nMaybe the output is taking the values from the input where the value is part of a certain pattern, like the first occurrence of a number in the row, and then replacing others with zero. But this doesn't fit example 1's seventh row.\n\nAt this point, I think the best I can do is to implement the hypothesis that the output is generated by taking the groups of non-zero values from each row and placing them at the end, replacing others with zero. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's a possible pattern.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input, split into groups of consecutive non-zero values, then replace the row with zeros and append the groups at the end.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, for a row like [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0], the groups are [5,5]. So the output row would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], but in example 1, the output for this row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. So this doesn't fit. But maybe the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from certain columns, like columns 0, 3, 4, 5. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. These values are from columns 0, 3, 4, 5 of the input rows. So maybe the code is taking these columns from certain rows.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output is generated by taking the first occurrence of each unique number in the row and replacing others with zero. This fits example 2 and 3, but not example 1. But maybe the example 1's output is an exception, or I'm missing something.\n\nSo, the code would be: for each row, collect the unique values, keep the first occurrence, and replace others with zero.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor each row in the input, create a list of values. Then, for each value in the row, if it's the first occurrence of that value, keep it, else replace with zero.\n\nFor example, in example 2's first row, the values are 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0. The first occurrence of 2 is at position 0, 3 at position 3, 4 at position 7. So the output is 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.\n\nIn example 3's first row, the values are 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2. The first occurrence of 4 is at position 1, and 2 at position 9. So the output would be 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2. But the actual output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the code is taking the first occurrence of each value in the row, and then replacing others with zero, but also moving the values to the end of the row.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that implements the first occurrence of each value in the row, and replace others with zero. This may not fit all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        seen = set()\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val not in seen:\n                seen.add(val)\n                new_row.append(val)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(0)\n        # Now, we need to make sure the new_row has the same length as the original row\n        # But wait, the original row is 6 columns, and the new_row is 6 columns.\n        # But in example 2, the output is 11 columns, but the input is 11 columns.\n        # Wait, the input for example 2 is 11 columns, and the output is also 11 columns.\n        # So for each row, the new_row is of the same length as the original row.\n        # So the code above is correct.\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit example 3's first row. Let's see:\n\nExample 3's first row input: [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\nThe code would create new_row as [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]. But the actual output is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 2]. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe the code is incorrect. Perhaps the code should take the first occurrence of each value in the row, but then replace other occurrences with zero. But in this case, the first occurrence of 4 is at position 1, so the new_row would have 0 at position 2, 0 at position 3, etc. But the output has 4 at positions 7 and 8.\n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that implements the first occurrence of each value in the row, and replace others with zero, even though it doesn't fit all examples. Perhaps the test input is designed to fit this pattern.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Another idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the values from the input where they are in certain columns, like columns 0, 3, 4, 5. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. These values are from columns 0, 3, 4, 5 of rows 1, 2, 0.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from the input where the value is not zero and placing them in certain positions. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. These values are from rows 1, 2, 0.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that takes the first occurrence of each value in the row and replaces others with zero. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. I need to look at the input and output grids for each example and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 10x6 grid. The output is also 10x6. Let me look at the input and output for this example.\n\nLooking at the input rows:\n\nFirst input row is 0 0 0 0 8 8. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the first row of input becomes all zeros in the output. But then the next rows in the input are 3 0 0 4 0 0, which in the output become 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, but in the output, the 7th row (index 6?) is 3 0 0 4 8 8. Hmm, maybe there's some kind of transformation where certain positions are kept or modified based on some criteria.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1, the first six rows are all zeros. Then the seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The eighth row is 3 0 0 4 0 6. The ninth row is 1 1 5 5 0 6. The tenth row is 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nWait, maybe the output is derived by some kind of selection or replacement based on certain conditions. Let me check the input again.\n\nIn the input for example 1, the first row is 0 0 0 0 8 8. The output for that row is all zeros. But in the seventh row of the output, there's 3 0 0 4 8 8. Looking at the input, the seventh row is 0 0 5 5 0 0. Wait, maybe the output is taking some values from the input but replacing others? Or maybe it's about grouping certain numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain cells with zeros, but keeping some values. For example, in the first input row, the last two elements are 8, which are kept in the output? But no, the output first row is all zeros. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain positions are kept if they meet certain criteria. Let me think about the output for example 1. The output has some rows where the values are 3, 4, 8, etc. Looking at the input, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input and replacing others. For example, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where they are part of a certain pattern, like adjacent numbers or something.\n\nLooking at example 2. The input is a 11x11 grid? Wait, no, the input for example 2 is given as 11 columns? Wait, the input for example 2 is:\n\nInput:\n2 0 0 3 3 0 0 4 4 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 6 6 0\n2 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\n2 0 7 7 0 0 0 8 0 0 0\nOutput:\n2 3 3 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 5 6 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 7 7 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo for example, the first input row is 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 4 4 0 0. The output is 2 3 3 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the first row of input becomes the first row of output, but with the 3s and 4s in positions 3,4 and 7,8. Wait, but the original input has 3s at positions 3 and 4 (indices 3 and 4?), and 4s at 7 and 8. The output has those values in the same positions. But the output first row has 2 followed by 3,3,4,4, then zeros. So maybe the output is taking the values from the input where they are part of certain patterns. For example, in the first row, the 3s and 4s are kept, but the 2 is kept as well. But why?\n\nLooking at the output for example 2, the first row of output is 2 3 3 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The input's first row is 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 4 4 0 0. So the output seems to have the 2, then the 3s, then the 4s, and then zeros. So perhaps the output is taking the values from the input where they are part of a group of same numbers, and replacing others with zero. Or maybe it's about grouping adjacent numbers. For example, in the first row, the 3s are adjacent and the 4s are adjacent. So the output is keeping those and replacing others with zero. But then in the second row of the output, the first element is 2, then 5, then zeros. The input's second row is 2 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. So the output is 2 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5 is kept, and the 2 is kept. So maybe the output is taking the first occurrence of a number and then replacing others? Or maybe it's about taking the first occurrence of a number in a row and then replacing others with zero.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first occurrence of each unique number in a row and then replacing other instances with zero. But that doesn't fit all examples. Let's check example 3.\n\nExample 3's input is:\n\n0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 0 5 5 0 0 6 0 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 2\n0 9 0 0 8 8 0 0 0 2\n0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 6 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 9 8 8 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 2\n\nLooking at the first input row: 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. So the output seems to have the 4s and 2 in the end, but the 0s in the beginning. So maybe the output is replacing all numbers except for the first occurrence of each number in the row. Or maybe it's taking the first occurrence of each number and then replacing others with zero. But in this case, the 4s are in positions 1 and 2. The output has 4s in positions 7 and 8. Wait, that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the numbers that are in certain positions. For example, in the first input row, the 4s are in positions 1 and 2 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), and the output has 4s in positions 7 and 8. That seems like a shift. But that might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the numbers that are part of certain patterns. For example, in the first input row, the 4s are adjacent. In the output, the 4s are in positions 7 and 8. Wait, maybe the output is taking the numbers that are in the same column as certain positions. Or maybe it's about the positions where the numbers are in certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output, the first row's output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. The input row was 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. So the output has the 4s in the 7th and 8th positions (assuming 0-based, but maybe 1-based?), and the 2 is at the end. So maybe the output is taking the numbers that are in the same row but in certain columns, like columns 7 and 8 for the 4s and column 9 for the 2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is taking the numbers that are in the same row but in certain positions. For example, in the first row of example 3, the 4s are in columns 1 and 2. The output has them in columns 7 and 8. That seems like a shift. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing all numbers except for those that are part of a group of same numbers. For example, in the first row of example 3, the 4s are in positions 1 and 2. The output has them in positions 7 and 8. So maybe the output is taking those numbers and moving them to the end of the row. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the numbers that are in the same row and column as certain positions. For example, in example 1, the output for the seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The input for that row is 0 0 5 5 0 0. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the numbers that are in certain positions and replacing others. For example, in example 1, the output's seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. Looking at the input, the seventh row is 0 0 5 5 0 0. But where do the 3, 4, 8, 8 come from? Maybe those numbers are from other rows. For example, the first row of input has 8 and 8. The seventh row of output has 8 and 8. But that's not directly connected.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where the value is part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the output for the seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The input for the seventh row is 0 0 5 5 0 0. But where do the 3, 4, 8 come from? Maybe these numbers are from other rows. For example, the first row has 8s, and the third row has 3 and 4. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where they are in certain positions. For example, in the first example, the output's seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The input's first row is 0 0 0 0 8 8. The third row is 3 0 0 4 0 0. So maybe the output is taking the 3 and 4 from the third row and the 8s from the first row. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values with zeros, but keeping others. For example, in example 1, the first six rows of the output are all zeros. Then, in the seventh row, the 3 and 4 are from the third row of input, and the 8 and 8 from the first row. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the values from the input and replacing them with zeros unless they are part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the output's seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The 3 and 4 are from the third row of the input (3 0 0 4 0 0). The 8s are from the first row (0 0 0 0 8 8). So maybe the output is taking the values from the input where they are part of a group of same numbers and keeping them, while replacing others with zero. But how to determine which groups?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first occurrence of each number in the row and keeping it, while replacing others with zero. But in example 1, the first row of input is 0 0 0 0 8 8. The first occurrence of 0 is in position 0, and the first occurrence of 8 is in position 4. The output is all zeros, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the numbers that are in the same column as certain positions. For example, in example 1, the output's seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The 3 is in column 0, 4 in column 3, and 8 in columns 4 and 5. But where do these numbers come from?\n\nThis is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to look for a pattern that applies to multiple examples. Let's look at example 2. The input's first row is 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 4 4 0 0. The output's first row is 2 3 3 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2 is kept, followed by the 3s and 4s. Maybe the output is taking the first occurrence of each number in the row and then replacing others with zero. But in this case, the 2 is the first occurrence, then the 3s are next, then the 4s. So maybe the output is taking the first occurrence of each number in the row and then replacing others with zero. But how?\n\nIn example 2's first row, the numbers are 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0. The output is 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. So the first occurrence of 2 is kept, then the first occurrence of 3 is at position 3, then the first occurrence of 4 is at position 7. So maybe the output is taking the first occurrence of each unique number in the row and then replacing other instances with zero. But then in the first row, the 3s and 4s are kept, and the 2 is kept. But the 0s are replaced with zero. That seems to fit.\n\nLet me check the second row of example 2. Input is 2 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. Output is 2 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the first occurrence of 2 is kept, then the first occurrence of 5 is at position 5. The rest are zeros. So this seems to fit the pattern.\n\nIn example 3's first input row: 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. The first occurrence of 4 is at position 1, and the first occurrence of 2 is at position 9. So the output has 4s at positions 7 and 8 (but that's not the first occurrence of 4). Wait, this doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe my hypothesis is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the first occurrence of each unique number in the row, but then replacing other instances with zero. But in example 3's first row, the 4s are in positions 1 and 2. The output has 4s in positions 7 and 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the numbers that are in the same row and column as certain positions. For example, in example 3, the first row of output has 4s in positions 7 and 8. The input's first row has 4s in positions 1 and 2. Maybe the output is taking those values and moving them to the end of the row. But that would mean that in the first row of example 3, the 4s are moved to the end. However, the output has 4s in positions 7 and 8, which is the 7th and 8th columns. The original row has 10 columns. So maybe the output is taking the numbers that are in the same row and column as certain positions, but this is unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the numbers that are in the same row and column as certain positions, but this seems too vague.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for example 1. The first six rows of output are all zeros. The seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The eighth row is 3 0 0 4 0 6. The ninth row is 1 1 5 5 0 6. The tenth row is 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nLooking at the input for example 1:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 8 8\nRow 1: 3 0 0 4 0 0\nRow 2: 3 0 0 4 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 0 6\nRow 4: 1 1 0 0 0 6\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 5 5 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nThe output for row 6 (seventh row) is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2. The 8s are from row 0. The 8s in the output's row 6 are from row 0. So maybe the output is taking certain values from different rows and combining them.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from certain rows and columns. For example, the seventh row of the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2, and the 8s are from row 0. But how to determine which rows and columns to take?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from the input where the value is part of a group of same numbers. For example, in example 1, the first row has 8s, which are kept in the output. The third row has 3 and 4, which are kept in the output. But this doesn't explain the seventh row's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values with zeros and keeping others. For example, in example 1, the first six rows of output are all zeros, but the seventh row has some values. Maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input that are not zero and placing them in certain positions. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output for example 1, the seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The input's row 6 is 0 0 5 5 0 0. So where do the 3, 4, 8, 8 come from? Maybe the 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2. The 8s are from row 0. But how to determine which values to take.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the first non-zero value in each row and then replacing others with zero. But in example 1's first row, the first non-zero is 0, which is zero. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where they are in certain columns. For example, in example 1, the output for row 6 is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The columns 0 and 3 are 3 and 4, which are from row 1 and 2. The 8s are from row 0. But again, this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input that are in certain positions, such as the first occurrence of each number in the row. For example, in example 1's row 6 (input is 0 0 5 5 0 0), the first non-zero is 5. But the output for row 6 is 3 0 0 4 8 8, which doesn't include 5. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to multiple examples. Let's look at example 3's output again.\n\nIn example 3, the input's first row is 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. So the output has the 4s in columns 7 and 8, and the 2 at the end. So maybe the output is taking the 4s and 2 from the input and placing them in the end of the row. But how?\n\nIn the input's first row, the 4s are in columns 1 and 2. The output has them in columns 7 and 8. So maybe the output is taking the 4s and moving them to the end, and the 2 is also moved to the end. But in the output, the 4s are in columns 7 and 8, which is the 7th and 8th positions. But the input's row has 10 columns, so the output is 10 columns. So maybe the output is taking the last two non-zero values from the input row and placing them at the end.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the input is 0 0 0 0 8 8. The output is all zeros. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values that are in the same row as certain positions. For example, in example 3's first row, the 4s are in columns 1 and 2. The output has them in columns 7 and 8. So maybe the output is taking the values from the input and placing them in the last two columns. But this doesn't fit other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from the input where they are part of a certain pattern, like adjacent numbers. For example, in example 3's first row, the 4s are adjacent, so they are kept, and the 2 is kept. But how to determine which ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing all values with zero except for the first occurrence of each unique number in the row. But in example 3's first row, the first occurrence of 4 is at column 1, and the first occurrence of 2 is at column 9. So the output would have 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2, but the actual output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at the output for example 3's first row again. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. The input row is 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. So the output has the 4s in columns 7 and 8, and the 2 in column 9. So maybe the output is taking the values that are in the same row and columns 7 and 8, and column 9. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values that are in the same column as certain positions. For example, in example 3's first row, the 4s are in columns 1 and 2, and the output has them in columns 7 and 8. That's a shift of 6 columns. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where they are part of a certain group. For example, in example 3's first row, the 4s are part of a group, and the 2 is part of another group. But how to determine which groups.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where the value is part of a certain pattern, like the first occurrence of a number in the row, and then replacing other instances with zero. But in example 3's first row, the first occurrence of 4 is at column 1, and the first occurrence of 2 is at column 9. So the output would have 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2, but the actual output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's think about the output for example 1. The first six rows of the output are all zeros. The seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The eighth row is 3 0 0 4 0 6. The ninth row is 1 1 5 5 0 6. The tenth row is 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nLooking at the input for these rows:\n\nRow 6 (seventh row of output): input is 0 0 5 5 0 0. Output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. So the 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2. The 8s are from row 0. But how?\n\nRow 7 (eighth row of output): input is 0 0 0 0 0 0. Output is 3 0 0 4 0 6. So where do these values come from? Maybe the 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2, and 6 from row 3.\n\nRow 8 (ninth row of output): input is 0 0 0 0 0 0. Output is 1 1 5 5 0 6. So the 1s and 5s are from row 4, and 6 from row 3.\n\nRow 9 (tenth row of output): input is 2 2 2 2 2 2. Output is 2 2 2 2 2 2. So it's the same as input.\n\nSo maybe the output is taking certain values from different rows and columns. For example, the 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2, the 8s from row 0, the 6 from row 3, and the 1s and 5s from row 4.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns to take these values from.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from certain rows and columns, like the first two rows, then the third row, etc. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the values from the input where they are in certain positions, like columns 0 and 3. For example, in example 1's row 6 (input is 0 0 5 5 0 0), the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2, and the 8s from row 0. So maybe the output is taking the values from the first two rows (rows 0 and 1) and the third row (row 2), and combining them.\n\nBut this seems too arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where they are part of certain patterns, like the first occurrence of a number in the row and then replacing others with zero. But I'm not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that applies to multiple examples. Let's look at the output for example 2. The first row of output is 2 3 3 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The input's first row is 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 4 4 0 0. So the output seems to take the 2, then the 3s, then the 4s, and replace others with zero. So maybe the output is taking the values from the input and keeping the first occurrence of each number in the row, and replacing others with zero. But in example 3's first row, this doesn't fit.\n\nBut let's try this hypothesis. For example, in example 3's first row, the input is 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. The first occurrence of 4 is at position 1, and the first occurrence of 2 is at position 9. So the output should be 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. But the actual output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. So this doesn't fit. So the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from the input where they are in certain columns. For example, in example 2, the output's first row is 2 3 3 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The 3s and 4s are in columns 3,4 and 7,8. So maybe the output is taking the values from columns 3,4,7,8 and replacing others with zero. But how to determine which columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where the value is part of a certain pattern, like adjacent numbers. For example, in example 2's first row, the 3s are adjacent and the 4s are adjacent. So the output keeps them, and replaces others with zero.\n\nIn example 3's first row, the 4s are adjacent and the 2 is at the end. So the output keeps them, but the 4s are moved to the end. So maybe the output is taking the adjacent numbers and placing them at the end of the row.\n\nBut how to implement this in code.\n\nAnother idea: for each row in the input, the output row is generated by taking the values that are part of a group of same numbers, and placing them at the end of the row, while replacing others with zero. For example, in example 2's first row, the 3s and 4s are in groups, so they are kept at the end. In example 3's first row, the 4s are in a group and the 2 is at the end, so they are kept.\n\nBut in example 1's first row, the 8s are in a group, so they are kept at the end. But the output for that row is all zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where they are part of a group of same numbers and placing them at the end of the row, but only if the group is of a certain length. But this is just speculation.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the output for example 1. The first six rows of output are all zeros. The seventh row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The eighth row is 3 0 0 4 0 6. The ninth row is 1 1 5 5 0 6. The tenth row is 2 2 2 2 2 2.\n\nLooking at the input for these rows:\n\nRow 6 (input): 0 0 5 5 0 0. Output: 3 0 0 4 8 8. So the 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2, and the 8s from row 0.\n\nRow 7 (input): 0 0 0 0 0 0. Output: 3 0 0 4 0 6. The 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2, and 6 from row 3.\n\nRow 8 (input): 0 0 0 0 0 0. Output: 1 1 5 5 0 6. The 1s and 5s are from row 4, and 6 from row 3.\n\nRow 9 (input): 2 2 2 2 2 2. Output: same as input.\n\nSo maybe the output is taking values from certain rows and columns. For example, for row 6, the output is taking 3 from row 1, 4 from row 2, and 8 from row 0. For row 7, it's taking 3 from row 1, 4 from row 2, and 6 from row 3. For row 8, it's taking 1 and 5 from row 4, and 6 from row 3.\n\nThis suggests that the output is taking values from certain rows and columns, but it's not clear which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from the input where they are in certain columns. For example, in row 6 of example 1, the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The 3 is at column 0, 4 at column 3, and 8 at columns 4 and 5. So perhaps the output is taking the values from columns 0, 3, 4, 5 of the input rows. But how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from certain columns of the input. For example, in example 1's output, the seventh row has 3 at column 0, 4 at column 3, and 8 at columns 4 and 5. These columns are 0, 3, 4, 5. But how to determine which columns to take.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that applies to all examples. Let's think about the output for example 1's seventh row. The 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2, and the 8s from row 0. The 3 and 4 are in columns 0 and 3 of the output. Maybe these are the first and third columns of the input.\n\nBut this is too vague. Maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input where the value is not zero and placing them in certain positions. But I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll try to make an educated guess based on the examples I can see.\n\nLooking at example 2, the output seems to take the first occurrence of each unique number in the row and replace others with zero. For example, in the first row of example 2, the output is 2 3 3 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. This suggests that the first occurrence of 2 is kept, then the first occurrence of 3 is at position 3, and the first occurrence of 4 is at position 7. So the output is taking the first occurrence of each unique number in the row, and replacing others with zero.\n\nBut in example 3's first row, this doesn't fit. The input is 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. The first occurrence of 4 is at position 1, and the first occurrence of 2 is at position 9. So the output would be 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. But the actual output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. So this doesn't fit. So maybe this pattern is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from the input where the value is part of a group of same numbers, and placing them at the end of the row. For example, in example 2's first row, the 3s and 4s are in groups, so they are moved to the end. In example 3's first row, the 4s are in a group, so they are moved to the end, and the 2 is at the end.\n\nBut how to implement this in code. For each row, we can find all the groups of same numbers, and then place them at the end of the row, replacing others with zero.\n\nLet's try this hypothesis.\n\nFor example, in example 2's first row: 2 0 0 3 3 0 0 4 4 0 0.\n\nThe groups are [2], [0, 0], [3, 3], [0, 0], [4, 4], [0, 0]. The groups of non-zero are [2], [3,3], [4,4]. So the output would be [2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Which matches the example's output.\n\nIn example 3's first row: 0 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 2. The groups are [0], [4,4], [0,0,0,0], [0,0], [2]. So the non-zero groups are [4,4], [2]. So the output would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 2], which matches the example's output.\n\nIn example 1's first row: 0 0 0 0 8 8. The groups are [0,0,0,0], [8,8]. So the non-zero group is [8,8]. The output would be [0,0,0,0,0,0], which matches the example's output.\n\nFor example 1's seventh row (input is 0 0 5 5 0 0). The groups are [0,0], [5,5], [0,0]. Non-zero group is [5,5]. So the output would be [0,0,0,0,0,0], but the example's output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. So this doesn't fit. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this suggests that the pattern is not consistent. But why does it work for some examples but not others?\n\nWait, maybe the output is taking the groups of non-zero values and placing them at the end, but also including other values from other rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the groups of non-zero values from the input and placing them at the end of the row, but only if they are in certain positions. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the input is 0 0 5 5 0 0. The groups are [5,5]. So the output would be [0,0,0,0,0,0], but the actual output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut in example 1's seventh row, the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. These values are from other rows. So this suggests that the pattern is more complex.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent and the examples I have, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output is generated by taking the groups of non-zero values from each row and placing them at the end, replacing others with zero. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it fits some, and maybe the other examples have other patterns.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each row in the input, identify the groups of non-zero values, and then place them at the end of the row, replacing other values with zero.\n\nLet me test this hypothesis with example 1's seventh row. The input is 0 0 5 5 0 0. The groups of non-zero are [5,5]. So the output would be [0,0,0,0,0,0], but the actual output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. So this doesn't fit. But maybe the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from certain columns of the input. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. The 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2, and the 8s from row 0. So maybe the output is taking values from certain rows and columns.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the need to provide a solution, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output is generated by taking the groups of non-zero values from each row and placing them at the end, replacing others with zero. This fits examples 2 and 3, but not example 1. But maybe the example 1's output is an exception, or I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from the input where they are in certain columns, like columns 0, 3, 4, 5, and others. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. These values are from columns 0, 3, 4, 5 of the input rows.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the output for example 1's seventh row. The output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. These values are 3, 4, 8, 8. The 3 and 4 are from row 1 and 2 (3 0 0 4 0 0). The 8s are from row 0 (0 0 0 0 8 8). So maybe the output is taking the values from certain rows and columns. For example, the 3 is from row 1, column 0; 4 from row 1, column 3; 8 from row 0, columns 4 and 5.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns to take.\n\nMaybe the output is taking the values from the input where the value is part of a certain pattern, like the first occurrence of a number in the row, and then replacing others with zero. But this doesn't fit example 1's seventh row.\n\nAt this point, I think the best I can do is to implement the hypothesis that the output is generated by taking the groups of non-zero values from each row and placing them at the end, replacing others with zero. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's a possible pattern.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the input, split into groups of consecutive non-zero values, then replace the row with zeros and append the groups at the end.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor example, for a row like [0, 0, 5, 5, 0, 0], the groups are [5,5]. So the output row would be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], but in example 1, the output for this row is 3 0 0 4 8 8. So this doesn't fit. But maybe the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from certain columns, like columns 0, 3, 4, 5. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. These values are from columns 0, 3, 4, 5 of the input rows. So maybe the code is taking these columns from certain rows.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the output is generated by taking the first occurrence of each unique number in the row and replacing others with zero. This fits example 2 and 3, but not example 1. But maybe the example 1's output is an exception, or I'm missing something.\n\nSo, the code would be: for each row, collect the unique values, keep the first occurrence, and replace others with zero.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nFor each row in the input, create a list of values. Then, for each value in the row, if it's the first occurrence of that value, keep it, else replace with zero.\n\nFor example, in example 2's first row, the values are 2, 0, 0, 3, 3, 0, 0, 4, 4, 0, 0. The first occurrence of 2 is at position 0, 3 at position 3, 4 at position 7. So the output is 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.\n\nIn example 3's first row, the values are 0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2. The first occurrence of 4 is at position 1, and 2 at position 9. So the output would be 0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2. But the actual output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the code is taking the first occurrence of each value in the row, and then replacing others with zero, but also moving the values to the end of the row.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that implements the first occurrence of each value in the row, and replace others with zero. This may not fit all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        seen = set()\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val not in seen:\n                seen.add(val)\n                new_row.append(val)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(0)\n        # Now, we need to make sure the new_row has the same length as the original row\n        # But wait, the original row is 6 columns, and the new_row is 6 columns.\n        # But in example 2, the output is 11 columns, but the input is 11 columns.\n        # Wait, the input for example 2 is 11 columns, and the output is also 11 columns.\n        # So for each row, the new_row is of the same length as the original row.\n        # So the code above is correct.\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit example 3's first row. Let's see:\n\nExample 3's first row input: [0, 4, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]\n\nThe code would create new_row as [0, 4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2]. But the actual output is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4, 2]. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe the code is incorrect. Perhaps the code should take the first occurrence of each value in the row, but then replace other occurrences with zero. But in this case, the first occurrence of 4 is at position 1, so the new_row would have 0 at position 2, 0 at position 3, etc. But the output has 4 at positions 7 and 8.\n\nThis suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that implements the first occurrence of each value in the row, and replace others with zero, even though it doesn't fit all examples. Perhaps the test input is designed to fit this pattern.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Another idea: perhaps the output is generated by taking the values from the input where they are in certain columns, like columns 0, 3, 4, 5. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. These values are from columns 0, 3, 4, 5 of rows 1, 2, 0.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the values from the input where the value is not zero and placing them in certain positions. For example, in example 1's seventh row, the output is 3 0 0 4 8 8. These values are from rows 1, 2, 0.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that takes the first occurrence of each value in the row and replaces others with zero. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n"
