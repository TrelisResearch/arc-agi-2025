    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start with Example 1.\n\nExample 1 Input:\n3 3 8\n3 7 0\n5 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 5\n0 7 3\n8 3 3\n\nHmm. Let me write down the positions. Let's index the input as rows 0,1,2 and columns 0,1,2.\n\nOriginal input:\nRow 0: [3, 3, 8]\nRow 1: [3, 7, 0]\nRow 2: [5, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: [0, 0, 5]\nRow 1: [0, 7, 3]\nRow 2: [8, 3, 3]\n\nLooking at the output, maybe there's some kind of rotation or reflection. Let me check each cell.\n\nLooking at the first row of input (3,3,8) and the first row of output (0,0,5). The third element of input's first row is 8, which becomes the first element of the output's third row. Wait, the output's third row is [8,3,3]. So the input's first row's third element (8) is in the output's third row's first element. That seems like a rotation. Let's think about rotating the grid 90 degrees clockwise. Wait, rotating a 3x3 grid 90 degrees clockwise would make the first row become the third column in reverse. Let me think.\n\nOriginal positions (row, column):\n\nFor a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the new position (row, col) would be (col, 2 - row). Let me check:\n\nOriginal (0,0) \u2192 (0, 2-0) \u2192 (0,2)? Wait, maybe I need to think about the rotation steps. For a 90-degree rotation, the original (row, col) becomes (col, 2 - row). For example, the original (0,0) would be at (0, 2) in the new grid? Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the rotation as:\n\nOriginal grid:\nRow 0: A B C\nRow 1: D E F\nRow 2: G H I\n\nAfter 90-degree rotation clockwise, the grid becomes:\nG D A\nH E B\nI F C\n\nSo the new row 0 is [G, D, A], which is original column 0 in reverse order. So for each cell (row, col) in original, the new position is (col, 2 - row). So for example, original (0,0) \u2192 new (0, 2-0) \u2192 (0, 2)? Wait, no. Wait in the rotated grid, the first column of the original becomes the last row in reverse. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal positions:\n\nAfter rotation, the new grid is:\n\nRow 0: G D A \u2192 original column 0, from bottom to top.\nRow 1: H E B \u2192 original column 1, from bottom to top.\nRow 2: I F C \u2192 original column 2, from bottom to top.\n\nSo for the original cell (row, col), the new position is (col, 2 - row). For example, original (0,0) is G, which is in new row 0, column 2? Wait no. Wait in the new grid, row 0 is G D A. So G is at (0,0) in new grid. Original (row, col) is (2,0) \u2192 new (0, 0). So the formula is new_row = col, new_col = 2 - row. So original (row, col) \u2192 new (col, 2 - row). So for original (0,0), new_row is 0, new_col is 2 - 0 = 2? But that would be (0,2) in new grid. But in the rotated grid, (0,0) is G which is original (2,0). So perhaps the formula is new_row = col, new_col = 2 - row. So original (row, col) becomes new (col, 2 - row). Let me check for original (2,0) \u2192 new (0, 2-2=0) \u2192 (0,0). Which is correct. So for the original cell (row, col), the new position is (col, 2 - row). \n\nNow, let's check if the output of example 1 is a 90-degree rotation. Let's take the input and rotate it. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 8 \u2192 positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\nRow 1: 3 7 0 \u2192 (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\nRow 2: 5 0 0 \u2192 (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nRotating 90 degrees clockwise would give:\n\nNew grid:\n\nRow 0: 5, 3, 3 \u2192 from original column 0, bottom to top: 5 (row2, col0), 3 (row1, col0), 3 (row0, col0)\nRow 1: 0,7,3 \u2192 original column 1: 0 (row2, col1), 7 (row1, col1), 3 (row0, col1)\nRow 2: 0, 0, 8 \u2192 original column 2: 0 (row2, col2), 0 (row1, col2), 8 (row0, col2)\n\nSo the rotated grid would be:\n\n5 3 3\n0 7 3\n0 0 8\n\nBut the output for example 1 is:\n\n0 0 5\n0 7 3\n8 3 3\n\nHmm, that's not matching. So maybe it's not a rotation. Alternatively, maybe it's a reflection or some other transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the original grid rotated 180 degrees. Let's check. Rotating 180 degrees would be two 90-degree rotations. So for each cell (row, col), new position is (2 - row, 2 - col). Let's check:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 8 \u2192 rotated 180 would be row 2, col 2 \u2192 8, row 2, col 1 \u2192 0, row 2, col 0 \u2192 5. So row 2 would be 5 0 8? Wait, no. Wait rotating 180 degrees would flip both rows and columns. So for example, original (0,0) becomes (2,2). So the rotated grid would be:\n\nOriginal row 0 becomes row 2 reversed. So original row 0 is [3,3,8] \u2192 reversed is [8,3,3], and placed in row 2. Original row 1 is [3,7,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,7,3], placed in row 1. Original row 2 is [5,0,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,0,5], placed in row 0. So the rotated grid would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 5\nRow 1: 0 7 3\nRow 2: 8 3 3\n\nWhich matches the output of example 1! Oh! So that's the transformation. So the output is the original grid rotated 180 degrees. Let's check example 2.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n\n5 5 2\n1 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n0 0 0\n0 0 1\n2 5 5\n\nLet's apply the same 180-degree rotation. Original grid:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 2 \u2192 reversed is 2 5 5 \u2192 row 2 of output.\nRow 1: 1 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 1 \u2192 row 1 of output.\nRow 2: 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 \u2192 row 0 of output.\n\nSo the rotated grid would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 1\nRow 2: 2 5 5\n\nWhich matches the output of example 2. So that seems to be the pattern. So the transformation is to rotate the grid 180 degrees. So the function should take the input grid and rotate it 180 degrees.\n\nSo how to implement this in Python. For each cell (row, col), the new position is (2 - row, 2 - col). So for each cell in the original grid, we need to place it in the new grid at (2 - row, 2 - col). So the new grid is created by taking the original grid, reversing each row, and then reversing the order of the rows.\n\nAlternatively, for each row in the original grid, reverse it and then reverse the order of the rows. For example, original rows are [row0, row1, row2]. Reverse each row to get [row0_reversed, row1_reversed, row2_reversed], then reverse the order of the rows to get [row2_reversed, row1_reversed, row0_reversed].\n\nSo for example, in example 1, original rows are:\n\nRow0: [3,3,8] \u2192 reversed is [8,3,3]\nRow1: [3,7,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,7,3]\nRow2: [5,0,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,0,5]\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows: [ [0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3] ] which is the output.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    transformed = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return transformed\n\nWait, let's test this with example 1. The original grid is:\n\ngrid = [\n    [3,3,8],\n    [3,7,0],\n    [5,0,0]\n]\n\nreversed_rows would be:\n\n[ [8,3,3], [0,7,3], [0,0,5] ]\n\nthen reversed_rows[::-1] would be [ [0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3] ] which matches the output.\n\nYes. And example 2:\n\noriginal grid:\n\n[\n    [5,5,2],\n    [1,0,0],\n    [0,0,0]\n]\n\nreversed_rows is:\n\n[ [2,5,5], [0,0,1], [0,0,0] ]\n\nreversed_rows[::-1] is [ [0,0,0], [0,0,1], [2,5,5] ] which matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to work. Therefore, the transformation is to reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows. So the code would be as above.\n\nSo the Python function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    transformed = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, let me check the test input. Let's see the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n6 3 5\n6 8 0\n4 0 0\n\nSo the input grid is:\n\n[\n    [6,3,5],\n    [6,8,0],\n    [4,0,0]\n]\n\nReversed rows would be:\n\n[ [5,3,6], [0,8,6], [0,0,4] ]\n\nThen reversed order of rows:\n\n[ [0,0,4], [0,8,6], [5,3,6] ]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n0 0 4\n0 8 6\n5 3 6\n\nBut I don't know if that's correct. But according to the pattern, this is what the code would generate. However, since the test input is just for context, and the problem says to focus on the training examples, this code should be correct.\n\nSo the final answer is to reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows.\n"

Let's index the input as rows 0,1,2 and columns 0,1,2.\n\nOriginal input:\nRow 0: [3, 3, 8]\nRow 1: [3, 7, 0]\nRow 2: [5, 0, 0]\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: [0, 0, 5]\nRow 1: [0, 7, 3]\nRow 2: [8, 3, 3]\n\nLooking at the output, maybe there's some kind of rotation or reflection. Let me check each cell.\n\nLooking at the first row of input (3,3,8) and the first row of output (0,0,5). The third element of input's first row is 8, which becomes the first element of the output's third row. Wait, the output's third row is [8,3,3]. So the input's first row's third element (8) is in the output's third row's first element. That seems like a rotation. Let's think about rotating the grid 90 degrees clockwise. Wait, rotating a 3x3 grid 90 degrees clockwise would make the first row become the third column in reverse. Let me think.\n\nOriginal positions (row, column):\n\nFor a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the new position (row, col) would be (col, 2 - row). Let me check:\n\nOriginal (0,0) \u2192 (0, 2-0) \u2192 (0,2)? Wait, maybe I need to think about the rotation steps. For a 90-degree rotation, the original (row, col) becomes (col, 2 - row). For example, the original (0,0) would be at (0, 2) in the new grid? Wait, maybe not. Let me think of the rotation as:\n\nOriginal grid:\nRow 0: A B C\nRow 1: D E F\nRow 2: G H I\n\nAfter 90-degree rotation clockwise, the grid becomes:\nG D A\nH E B\nI F C\n\nSo the new row 0 is [G, D, A], which is original column 0 in reverse order. So for each cell (row, col) in original, the new position is (col, 2 - row). So for example, original (0,0) \u2192 new (0, 2-0) \u2192 (0, 2)? Wait, no. Wait in the rotated grid, the first column of the original becomes the last row in reverse. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal positions:\n\nAfter rotation, the new grid is:\n\nRow 0: G D A \u2192 original column 0, from bottom to top.\nRow 1: H E B \u2192 original column 1, from bottom to top.\nRow 2: I F C \u2192 original column 2, from bottom to top.\n\nSo for the original cell (row, col), the new position is (col, 2 - row). For example, original (0,0) is G, which is in new row 0, column 2? Wait no. Wait in the new grid, row 0 is G D A. So G is at (0,0) in new grid. Original (row, col) is (2,0) \u2192 new (0, 0). So the formula is new_row = col, new_col = 2 - row. So original (row, col) \u2192 new (col, 2 - row). So for original (0,0), new_row is 0, new_col is 2 - 0 = 2? But that would be (0,2) in new grid. But in the rotated grid, (0,0) is G which is original (2,0). So perhaps the formula is new_row = col, new_col = 2 - row. So original (row, col) becomes new (col, 2 - row). Let me check for original (2,0) \u2192 new (0, 2-2=0) \u2192 (0,0). Which is correct. So for the original cell (row, col), the new position is (col, 2 - row). \n\nNow, let's check if the output of example 1 is a 90-degree rotation. Let's take the input and rotate it. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 8 \u2192 positions (0,0), (0,1), (0,2)\nRow 1: 3 7 0 \u2192 (1,0), (1,1), (1,2)\nRow 2: 5 0 0 \u2192 (2,0), (2,1), (2,2)\n\nRotating 90 degrees clockwise would give:\n\nNew grid:\n\nRow 0: 5, 3, 3 \u2192 from original column 0, bottom to top: 5 (row2, col0), 3 (row1, col0), 3 (row0, col0)\nRow 1: 0,7,3 \u2192 original column 1: 0 (row2, col1), 7 (row1, col1), 3 (row0, col1)\nRow 2: 0, 0, 8 \u2192 original column 2: 0 (row2, col2), 0 (row1, col2), 8 (row0, col2)\n\nSo the rotated grid would be:\n\n5 3 3\n0 7 3\n0 0 8\n\nBut the output for example 1 is:\n\n0 0 5\n0 7 3\n8 3 3\n\nHmm, that's not matching. So maybe it's not a rotation. Alternatively, maybe it's a reflection or some other transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the original grid rotated 180 degrees. Let's check. Rotating 180 degrees would be two 90-degree rotations. So for each cell (row, col), new position is (2 - row, 2 - col). Let's check:\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 8 \u2192 rotated 180 would be row 2, col 2 \u2192 8, row 2, col 1 \u2192 0, row 2, col 0 \u2192 5. So row 2 would be 5 0 8? Wait, no. Wait rotating 180 degrees would flip both rows and columns. So for example, original (0,0) becomes (2,2). So the rotated grid would be:\n\nOriginal row 0 becomes row 2 reversed. So original row 0 is [3,3,8] \u2192 reversed is [8,3,3], and placed in row 2. Original row 1 is [3,7,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,7,3], placed in row 1. Original row 2 is [5,0,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,0,5], placed in row 0. So the rotated grid would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 5\nRow 1: 0 7 3\nRow 2: 8 3 3\n\nWhich matches the output of example 1! Oh! So that's the transformation. So the output is the original grid rotated 180 degrees. Let's check example 2.\n\nExample 2 Input:\n\n5 5 2\n1 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n0 0 0\n0 0 1\n2 5 5\n\nLet's apply the same 180-degree rotation. Original grid:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 2 \u2192 reversed is 2 5 5 \u2192 row 2 of output.\nRow 1: 1 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 1 \u2192 row 1 of output.\nRow 2: 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 \u2192 row 0 of output.\n\nSo the rotated grid would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 1\nRow 2: 2 5 5\n\nWhich matches the output of example 2. So that seems to be the pattern. So the transformation is to rotate the grid 180 degrees. So the function should take the input grid and rotate it 180 degrees.\n\nSo how to implement this in Python. For each cell (row, col), the new position is (2 - row, 2 - col). So for each cell in the original grid, we need to place it in the new grid at (2 - row, 2 - col). So the new grid is created by taking the original grid, reversing each row, and then reversing the order of the rows.\n\nAlternatively, for each row in the original grid, reverse it and then reverse the order of the rows. For example, original rows are [row0, row1, row2]. Reverse each row to get [row0_reversed, row1_reversed, row2_reversed], then reverse the order of the rows to get [row2_reversed, row1_reversed, row0_reversed].\n\nSo for example, in example 1, original rows are:\n\nRow0: [3,3,8] \u2192 reversed is [8,3,3]\nRow1: [3,7,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,7,3]\nRow2: [5,0,0] \u2192 reversed is [0,0,5]\n\nThen reverse the order of the rows: [ [0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3] ] which is the output.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    transformed = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return transformed\n\nWait, let's test this with example 1. The original grid is:\n\ngrid = [\n    [3,3,8],\n    [3,7,0],\n    [5,0,0]\n]\n\nreversed_rows would be:\n\n[ [8,3,3], [0,7,3], [0,0,5] ]\n\nthen reversed_rows[::-1] would be [ [0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3] ] which matches the output.\n\nYes. And example 2:\n\noriginal grid:\n\n[\n    [5,5,2],\n    [1,0,0],\n    [0,0,0]\n]\n\nreversed_rows is:\n\n[ [2,5,5], [0,0,1], [0,0,0] ]\n\nreversed_rows[::-1] is [ [0,0,0], [0,0,1], [2,5,5] ] which matches the output.\n\nSo this seems to work. Therefore, the transformation is to reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows. So the code would be as above.\n\nSo the Python function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    transformed = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, let me check the test input. Let's see the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n6 3 5\n6 8 0\n4 0 0\n\nSo the input grid is:\n\n[\n    [6,3,5],\n    [6,8,0],\n    [4,0,0]\n]\n\nReversed rows would be:\n\n[ [5,3,6], [0,8,6], [0,0,4] ]\n\nThen reversed order of rows:\n\n[ [0,0,4], [0,8,6], [5,3,6] ]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n0 0 4\n0 8 6\n5 3 6\n\nBut I don't know if that's correct. But according to the pattern, this is what the code would generate. However, since the test input is just for context, and the problem says to focus on the training examples, this code should be correct.\n\nSo the final answer is to reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows.\n"
