          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. I need to look at the input and output grids for each example and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has some 0s and 5s and 1s and 2s. The output seems to have some changes. Let me look at the first row of input and output. Input first row is 1 5 1 5 5 2 5 5 5 1. The output first row is the same. So maybe the first row isn't changed. But looking at the second row of input: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. Hmm. So the 0s are being replaced by 1s and 2s. But how?\n\nLooking at the second row of input, the 5 is in position 4 (index 3?), and the output has 5 there. But the other positions are 0s. The output for the second row is 1s and 2s. Maybe there's some kind of expansion or replacement based on neighboring cells?\n\nWait, looking at the output for example 1, the second row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The original input's second row was 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. So the 5s are in positions 3 and 7. The output has 5s in those positions. The other positions are filled with 1s and 2s. Maybe the 0s are being replaced based on some rule. For example, maybe the 0s are being converted to 1s if they are adjacent to a 5? Or maybe there's a pattern where 0s are replaced by 1s and 2s based on their position relative to other cells.\n\nLooking at the third row of input: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the 5 is in position 3, and the 2 is in position 7. The output for the third row has 5 in position 3, and then 2s. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on some criteria. \n\nWait, in example 1, the output for row 2 is 1s and 2s. The first three positions are 1s, then 5, then 2s. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with numbers based on their distance from the nearest 5. For example, in the second row of input, the 5s are at positions 3 and 7. The 0s in between are being replaced with 1s and 2s. Maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are adjacent to a 5, and 2s if they are further away. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s and 2s based on some pattern. For example, in the second row of input, the 0s are replaced with 1s in the first three positions and 2s in the next three. But that seems arbitrary. \n\nLooking at example 2. The input's second row is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. So the 5s are in positions 2 and 7. The 0s are replaced with 1s. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are adjacent to a 5? Or maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in a certain position relative to the 5s.\n\nBut in example 1, the second row's output has 2s in some positions. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on their position. For example, maybe the 0s are being converted to 1s if they are in the first half of the row and 2s in the second half. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with numbers based on the value of the cell in the same column in the previous row. For example, in example 1, the second row's input is 0s, but the first row's input is 1 5 1 5 5 2 5 5 5 1. The output for the second row is 1s and 2s. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is 1, and 2s if the cell above is 2? But in example 1, the first row's second column is 5, and the output's second row's second column is 1. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced based on some kind of expansion. For example, in example 1, the second row has 0s. The output is 1s and 2s. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are adjacent to a 5, and 2s if they are adjacent to a 2. But how?\n\nLooking at example 2's input. The first row is 2 5 5 5 1 5 5 5 5 2. The output is same as input. So the first row is unchanged. The second row of input is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. So the 0s are replaced with 1s. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are adjacent to a 5. Let's check. The 5 is in position 2 (third column) of the input row. The 0s to the left of it (positions 0 and 1) are replaced with 1s. The 0s to the right of the 5 (positions 3,4,5,6,8,9) are replaced with 1s. But in the output, positions 3,4,5,6 are 1s. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are adjacent to a 5. But how about the 0s in the same row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5. But that's not the case for example 1's second row. Let's check example 1's second row input: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. So the 0s in the first three positions are replaced with 1s, then the 5 is there, then the 0s between 5 and the next 5 are replaced with 2s. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5 and in a certain position. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell in the same column in the previous row. For example, in example 1, the second row's output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The first row is 1 5 1 5 5 2 5 5 5 1. So for the second row's first column, the input is 0, but the output is 1. The first row's first column is 1. So maybe the output is based on the value of the cell above. So if the cell above is 1, then the current cell is 1. If the cell above is 2, then the current cell is 2. But in example 1's second row, the first column is 0, but the output is 1. So that would fit if the cell above is 1. But in the second row, the first column is 0. The cell above is 1. So maybe the 0s are replaced with the value of the cell above. But in example 1's second row, the first three columns are 0s. The cell above is 1, 5, 1. So the output is 1, 1, 1. Which matches. Then the next column is 5, so the output is 5. Then the next columns are 0s. The cell above is 2. So the output is 2. So that seems to fit. \n\nLet me check that. For example 1's second row, the first column is 0. The cell above is 1. So output is 1. Second column is 0, cell above is 5. So output is 5. Third column is 0, cell above is 1. Output is 1. Fourth column is 5. So output is 5. Fifth column is 0, cell above is 2. Output is 2. Sixth column is 0, cell above is 5. Output is 5? Wait, but in the output for example 1's second row, the sixth column is 2. Wait, the input's second row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The fifth column (index 4) is 0. The cell above is 5 (from first row's fifth column). So according to this idea, the output would be 5. But in the output, the fifth column is 2. So this contradicts the hypothesis. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 0s are being replaced based on the value of the cell to the left. Or maybe the value of the cell in the same row but previous column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5 and in a certain position. For example, in example 1's second row, the 0s are in positions 0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9. The 5s are in positions 3 and 7. So maybe the 0s between the 5s are replaced with 1s and 2s based on their position. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's output for the second row: 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The first three 0s are replaced with 1s. Then between the two 5s, the 0s are replaced with 2s. Then after the second 5, the 0s are replaced with 2s. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the first part of the row, and 2s if they are in the middle. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5 and in a certain position. For example, the first three 0s are in the same row as the 5 at position 3. So maybe they are replaced with 1s. Then the next 0s are in between the two 5s. So maybe they are replaced with 2s. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nLooking at example 2's input. The second row is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. So the 0s are replaced with 1s. The 5s are in positions 2 and 7. The 0s are in positions 0,1,3,4,5,6,8,9. So the 0s to the left of the first 5 are replaced with 1s. The 0s between the two 5s are replaced with 1s. The 0s to the right of the second 5 are replaced with 1s. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5. But why in example 1's second row, some 0s are replaced with 2s?\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's look at example 3. The input's second row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced with 2s. The 5 is in position 3. The 2 is in position 6. So the 0s are replaced with 2s. But in example 1's second row, the 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. So maybe the pattern depends on the value of the cell in the same column in the previous row?\n\nWait, in example 1's second row, the first column is 0. The cell above is 1. The output is 1. So maybe the output is the same as the cell above if it's 0. But in example 1's third row, the input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. The first column of input is 0, and the cell above is 0 (from second row's first column, which was 1 in the output? Wait no. Wait the second row's first column in output is 1. The third row's first column is 0. So maybe the cell above is 1. So the output is 1. But the third row's first column is 0, and the cell above is 1. So the output is 1. That fits. Then the third row's second column is 0. The cell above is 1 (second row's second column is 1). So output is 1. Third column is 0, cell above is 1. Output is 1. Fourth column is 5. So output is 5. Fifth column is 0. Cell above is 2 (second row's fifth column is 2). So output is 2. Sixth column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. Seventh column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. Eighth column is 2. So output is 2. Ninth column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. Tenth column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. So that seems to fit. \n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each cell in the output grid, if the input cell is 0, then the output cell is the same as the cell above it. But what if the cell above is also 0? Then it would be replaced with the cell above it, which would be 0. But in example 1's third row, the input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So for the third row, the first three cells are 0s, and the cell above them (second row) is 1, 1, 1. So output is 1s. The fifth column is 0, and the cell above is 2. So output is 2. \n\nThis seems to fit. Let's check example 2. For example 2's second row, the input is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. The cell above (first row) is 2 5 5 5 1 5 5 5 5 2. So for the second row's first column, input is 0. The cell above is 2. So output is 2? But in the output, it's 1. That contradicts. \n\nWait example 2's second row output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. The first column is 1. But the cell above is 2. So that doesn't fit. So maybe my hypothesis is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that if the input cell is 0, then the output is the same as the cell to the left. But in example 1's second row, the first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing, so maybe 0. But the output is 1. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that for each 0 in the input, the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2. But that's just a guess. \n\nLooking at example 2's second row. The input is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. The cell above (first row) is 2 5 5 5 1 5 5 5 5 2. So for the first column, the cell above is 2. So output is 1? That doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that for 0s, the output is 1 if the cell to the left is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell to the left is 2. But this seems arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell in the same row but previous column. For example, if the current cell is 0, then the output is the same as the previous cell. But in example 1's second row, the first column is 0. The previous cell doesn't exist, so maybe 1. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in a certain pattern. For example, in example 1's second row, the 0s are between two 5s. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the first part of the row and 2s if they are in the middle. But how to determine that?\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for example 1's second row. The 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. The 1s are in the first three positions and the 2s are in the middle. The 5s are in positions 3 and 7. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the first part of the row, and 2s if they are in the middle. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5 and to the left of it, and 2s if they are to the right. But this is not clear.\n\nLooking at example 3. The input's second row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced with 2s. The 5 is in position 3, and the 2 is in position 6. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 2s if they are in the same row as a 2. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each 0, the output is the same as the value of the cell in the same column in the previous row. Let's test this. For example 1's second row, first column is 0. The cell above is 1. So output is 1. Which matches. Second column is 0, cell above is 5. Output is 5. But in the output, it's 1. So that doesn't fit. \n\nWait, but in example 1's second row, the output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The second column is 1. But the cell above is 5. So this doesn't fit. So that hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the same as the cell to the left. For example, in example 1's second row, first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing, so maybe 1. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced based on the value of the cell in the same column in the previous row. For example, if the cell above is 0, then the current cell is 0. But in example 1's second row, the first column is 0. The cell above is 1. So output is 1. Which matches. The second column is 0. The cell above is 5. So output is 5. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at the outputs for example 1's third row. Input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. Output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the first three 0s are replaced with 1s, then the 5 is there, then the 0s are replaced with 2s. The 2 is in the eighth column. So maybe the 0s are replaced based on the value of the cell in the same column in the previous row. For example, the first three 0s in row 2 are replaced with 1s, which is the same as the cell above (row 1, column 1 is 1). Then the fifth column is 0, and the cell above is 2. So output is 2. That fits. \n\nBut in example 2's second row, the first column is 0. The cell above is 2. So output would be 2, but the output is 1. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the same as the cell above if it's not zero. But for example 2's second row, the first column is 0. The cell above is 2. So output is 2. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to look for other patterns. Maybe the output is a combination of the input and some other rule. For example, in example 1, the first row is unchanged. The second row is transformed, and the third row is transformed. Maybe the transformation is that for each 0, it's replaced with the minimum of the cell above and the cell to the left. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the cell in the same row but previous column. For example, if the current cell is 0, then the output is the same as the previous cell. Let's see:\n\nIn example 1's second row: first column is 0. Previous cell is nothing. So maybe 1. Second column is 0. Previous cell is 1. Output is 1. Third column is 0. Previous cell is 1. Output is 1. Fourth column is 5. So output is 5. Fifth column is 0. Previous cell is 5. Output is 5. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 if they are in the same row as a 5, and 2 if they are in the same row as a 2. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each 0, the output is 1 if the cell to the left is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell to the left is 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output for the second row. The input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the first three 0s are replaced with 2s. The 5 is in position 3. The 2 is in position 6. The 0s after the 2 are replaced with 2s. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 2s if they are in the same row as a 2.\n\nBut in example 1's second row, the 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 if they are in the first part of the row and 2 if they are in the middle. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each 0, the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2. But in example 2's second row, the first column is 0, and the cell above is 2. So output would be 2, but the output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's look at the outputs for all examples.\n\nIn example 1, the output for the second row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The input's second row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. So the 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. The 5s are in the same positions. The 1s are in the first three positions, and the 2s are in the middle. \n\nIn example 2's second row, the input is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. So the 0s are replaced with 1s. The 5s are in the same positions.\n\nIn example 3's second row, the input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced with 2s.\n\nSo it seems that the 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value of the cell above. But why in example 1's second row, some 0s are replaced with 1 and others with 2?\n\nWait, in example 1's second row, the first three 0s are replaced with 1s. The fifth column is 0, which is replaced with 2. The sixth and seventh columns are 0, replaced with 2. So maybe the value of the cell above determines the replacement. For example, if the cell above is 1, replace with 1. If the cell above is 2, replace with 2. But in example 1's second row, the fifth column is 0, and the cell above is 2. So output is 2. That fits. The first three columns are 0, and the cell above is 1,5,1. So the output is 1, 1, 1. But the second column's cell above is 5. So why is it replaced with 1? That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell to the left. For example, if the cell to the left is 1, then replace with 1. But in example 1's second row, the first column is 0, and there's no cell to the left. So maybe it's replaced with 1. The second column is 0, the cell to the left is 1. So replaced with 1. Third column is 0, cell to the left is 1. Replaced with 1. Fourth column is 5, so no change. Fifth column is 0, cell to the left is 5. So replaced with 5? But output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell in the same column in the previous row. For example, in example 1's second row, the first column is 0. The cell above is 1. So output is 1. Second column is 0. Cell above is 5. So output is 5. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in example 1's third row, the input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. The first three 0s are replaced with 1s. The fifth column is 0, replaced with 2. The sixth and seventh columns are 0, replaced with 2. The eighth column is 2, so output is 2. The ninth and tenth are 0, replaced with 2. \n\nSo the first three 0s are replaced with 1s. The rest are replaced with 2s. But why? Maybe because the first three columns are in a certain position relative to the 5 in the fourth column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 if they are in the same row as a 5 and in the first part of the row, and 2 otherwise. \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each 0, the output is 1 if the cell to the left is 1 or 5, and 2 if it's 2. But this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2. Let's check example 1's second row. The first column is 0, cell above is 1. Output is 1. Second column is 0, cell above is 5. Output is 1. Third column is 0, cell above is 1. Output is 1. Fourth column is 5. Output is 5. Fifth column is 0, cell above is 2. Output is 2. Sixth column is 0, cell above is 5. Output is 2. Seventh column is 0, cell above is 2. Output is 2. Eighth column is 5. Output is 5. Ninth column is 0, cell above is 2. Output is 2. Tenth column is 0, cell above is 2. Output is 2. This would fit. \n\nSo the rule would be: if the input cell is 0, then the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2. \n\nLet's test this with example 2's second row. Input is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The cell above is 2 5 5 5 1 5 5 5 5 2. So for the first column (0), cell above is 2. So output should be 2. But in the output, it's 1. So this contradicts. \n\nHmm. So this rule doesn't work for example 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: for a 0 cell, the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2 or 0. But this is just guessing. \n\nIn example 2's second row, the first column is 0, and the cell above is 2. So according to this rule, output is 2. But the output is 1. So this doesn't fit. \n\nI'm really not sure. Maybe the pattern is more complex. Let's try to think of other possibilities. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's 0, then the output is the same as the cell to the left, unless the cell to the left is 0, in which case it's 1. But this is just a guess. \n\nFor example 1's second row: first column is 0. No cell to the left, so output is 1. Second column is 0, cell to the left is 1. Output is 1. Third column is 0, cell to the left is 1. Output is 1. Fourth column is 5. Output is 5. Fifth column is 0, cell to the left is 5. Output is 5. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each 0, the output is 1 if the cell to the left is 1 or 5, and 2 if it's 2. But in example 2's second row, the first column is 0, cell to the left is nothing, so output is 1. Which matches the output. Second column is 0, cell to the left is 1. Output is 1. Third column is 5. Output is 5. Fourth column is 0, cell to the left is 5. Output is 5. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. \n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the second row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The 5s are in positions 3 and 7. The 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. Maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5 and in the first part of the row, and 2s if they are in the middle. \n\nBut how to determine that. Maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are to the left of a 5, and 2s if they are to the right. \n\nIn example 1's second row, the 0s are to the left of the first 5 (positions 0-2), so replaced with 1s. The 0s between the two 5s (positions 4-6) are replaced with 2s. The 0s to the right of the second 5 (positions 8-9) are replaced with 2s. \n\nIn example 2's second row, the 0s are to the left of the first 5 (positions 0-1), replaced with 1s. Between the two 5s (positions 3-6), replaced with 1s. To the right of the second 5 (positions 8-9), replaced with 1s. \n\nIn example 3's second row, the 0s are to the left of the 5 (positions 0-2), replaced with 2s. Between the 5 and the 2 (positions 4-5), replaced with 2s. To the right of the 2 (positions 7-9), replaced with 2s. \n\nSo maybe the rule is: for 0s, if they are in the same row as a 5 and are to the left of the 5, replace with 1. If they are between two 5s, replace with 2. If they are to the right of a 5, replace with 2. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5 and are in the first part of the row, and 2s if they are in the middle or after. \n\nBut this is too vague. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5 and the cell to the left is 1 or 5, and 2 otherwise. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for all examples. \n\nLooking at the output of example 1's second row, the 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s based on the value of the cell above. For example, the first three 0s are replaced with 1s because the cell above is 1, 5, 1. The fifth column is 0, and the cell above is 2, so replaced with 2. \n\nSo maybe the rule is: if the input cell is 0, the output is the same as the cell above. \n\nLet's test this for example 1's second row. The cell above for the first column is 1, so output is 1. Second column is 5, so output is 5. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit. \n\nBut in example 1's third row, the input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. The cell above for the first column is 1 (second row's first column is 1). So output is 1. Second column is 1 (second row's second column is 1). Output is 1. Third column is 1. Output is 1. Fourth column is 5. Output is 5. Fifth column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. Sixth column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. Seventh column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. Eighth column is 2. Output is 2. Ninth column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. Tenth column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. So this fits. \n\nBut for example 1's second row, the second column is 0. The cell above is 5. So according to this rule, the output should be 5. But in the output, it's 1. So this contradicts. \n\nHmm. So this rule works for some cases but not others. \n\nMaybe the rule is: if the input cell is 0, then the output is the same as the cell above if the cell above is not 0, otherwise it's 1. But in example 1's second row, the second column is 0, and the cell above is 5. So output should be 5. But it's 1. So this doesn't fit. \n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. \n\nLooking at the outputs for all examples, it seems that 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value of the cell in the same column in the previous row. For example, in example 1's second row, the first column is 0, and the cell above is 1, so output is 1. Second column is 0, cell above is 5, so output is 1. Third column is 0, cell above is 1, output is 1. Fourth column is 5. Fifth column is 0, cell above is 2, output is 2. So why is the second column's output 1 when the cell above is 5? Maybe the rule is that if the cell above is 5, replace with 1. But that's arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2 or 0. But this is just a guess. \n\nIn example 1's second row, the second column is 0. Cell above is 5. So output is 1. Third column is 0, cell above is 1. Output is 1. Fifth column is 0, cell above is 2. Output is 2. This fits. \n\nFor example 2's second row, the first column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 1. So this doesn't fit. \n\nBut maybe there's a different rule. Maybe the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2 or 0. But in example 2's second row, the first column is 0. Cell above is 2. So output is 2, but the output is 1. So this doesn't fit. \n\nI'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for a pattern that involves expanding 0s into 1s and 2s based on the nearest non-zero cell. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each 0, it is replaced with 1 if the cell to the left is 1 or 5, and 2 if it's 2. Let's try this for example 1's second row:\n\nFirst column is 0. No cell to the left. So output is 1. Second column is 0. Left cell is 1. Output is 1. Third column is 0. Left cell is 1. Output is 1. Fourth column is 5. Output is 5. Fifth column is 0. Left cell is 5. Output is 5. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. I think I need to make a guess based on the patterns I see. \n\nFrom the examples, it seems that 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value of the cell above. For example, in example 1's second row, the 0s are replaced with 1s if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2. This seems to fit for some cases. \n\nSo the rule could be: for each cell in the grid, if the input cell is 0, then the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2. Otherwise, if the input cell is not 0, leave it as is. \n\nLet's test this for example 1's second row:\n\n- First column: input is 0. Cell above is 1 \u2192 output 1.\n- Second column: input is 0. Cell above is 5 \u2192 output 1.\n- Third column: input is 0. Cell above is 1 \u2192 output 1.\n- Fourth column: input is 5 \u2192 output 5.\n- Fifth column: input is 0. Cell above is 2 \u2192 output 2.\n- Sixth column: input is 0. Cell above is 5 \u2192 output 1. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nBut in the output, the sixth column is 2. So this rule doesn't work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: for each 0, the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2 or 0. But in example 1's second row, the sixth column is 0. Cell above is 5 \u2192 output 1, but in the output it's 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on what I can see, even if it's not perfect. \n\nThe most consistent pattern I see is that 0s are replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value of the cell above. For example, if the cell above is 1 or 5, replace with 1. If it's 2, replace with 2. \n\nSo the code would be: for each cell, if it's 0, then the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, else 2. \n\nLet's implement this and see if it works for the examples. \n\nFor example 1's second row:\n\n- First column: 0 \u2192 cell above is 1 \u2192 1.\n- Second column: 0 \u2192 cell above is 5 \u2192 1.\n- Third column: 0 \u2192 cell above is 1 \u2192 1.\n- Fourth column: 5 \u2192 5.\n- Fifth column: 0 \u2192 cell above is 2 \u2192 2.\n- Sixth column: 0 \u2192 cell above is 5 \u2192 1. But in the output, it's 2. So this would be incorrect. \n\nBut maybe the sixth column's cell above is 5, and the output is 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that if the cell above is 1 or 5, replace with 1, and if it's 2, replace with 2. But in example 1's second row, the sixth column is 0, and the cell above is 5, so output should be 1, but it's 2. \n\nThis suggests that the rule is not correct. \n\nBut given the time I've spent and the lack of a better idea, I'll proceed with this hypothesis, even if it doesn't fit all examples. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if the input is 0, then the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, else 2. \n\nBut how to handle the cell above? For the first row, there is no cell above, so we can assume it's 0 or some default. But in example 1's first row, the input is not 0, so it remains the same. \n\nBut for the second row, the first column is 0, and the cell above is 1 (from first row, first column). So output is 1. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                if i == 0:\n                    # no cell above, but in example 1's first row, input is not 0.\n                    # but for other cases, maybe assume 0?\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    above = grid[i-1][j]\n                    if above in (1, 5):\n                        transformed[i][j] = 1\n                    else:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not work for example 1's second row, as the sixth column would be 0, and the cell above is 5, so output is 1. But the output is 2. \n\nBut maybe the cell above is not the correct value. Maybe I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell to the left is used instead of the cell above. \n\nBut without more examples, I can't be sure. \n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not fit all examples. \n\nBut looking at example 2's second row, the first column is 0. The cell above is 2. So according to this code, the output is 2. But the output is 1. So this code would not work for example 2. \n\nHmm. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell to the left is used. \n\nFor example, in example 1's second row, the first column is 0. No cell to the left, so assume 1. Output is 1. Second column is 0, left cell is 1 \u2192 output 1. Third column is 0, left cell is 1 \u2192 output 1. Fourth column is 5. Fifth column is 0, left cell is 5 \u2192 output 5. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples, even if it's not perfect. \n\nLooking at example 1's second row, the output for the fifth column is 2. The cell above is 2. So maybe the rule is: if the cell above is 2, replace with 2. If the cell above is 1 or 5, replace with 1. \n\nSo for example 1's second row, the sixth column is 0. Cell above is 5 \u2192 replaced with 1. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell to the left is used. For example, in example 1's second row, the fifth column is 0. The cell to the left is 5. So replaced with 5. But output is 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nI'm really stuck. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that 0s are replaced with 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 otherwise. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                if i == 0:\n                    # no cell above, but in example 1's first row, input is not 0.\n                    # but for other cases, maybe assume 0?\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    above = grid[i-1][j]\n                    if above in (1, 5):\n                        transformed[i][j] = 1\n                    else:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not work for all examples. For example, in example 2's second row, the first column is 0. Cell above is 2 \u2192 replaced with 2. But the output is 1. So this would be wrong. \n\nBut given that, I'll proceed. Maybe the actual pattern is different, but this is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. I need to look at the input and output grids for each example and see what's happening.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has some 0s and 5s and 1s and 2s. The output seems to have some changes. Let me look at the first row of input and output. Input first row is 1 5 1 5 5 2 5 5 5 1. The output first row is the same. So maybe the first row isn't changed. But looking at the second row of input: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. Hmm. So the 0s are being replaced by 1s and 2s. But how?\n\nLooking at the second row of input, the 5 is in position 4 (index 3?), and the output has 5 there. But the other positions are 0s. The output for the second row is 1s and 2s. Maybe there's some kind of expansion or replacement based on neighboring cells?\n\nWait, looking at the output for example 1, the second row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The original input's second row was 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. So the 5s are in positions 3 and 7. The output has 5s in those positions. The other positions are filled with 1s and 2s. Maybe the 0s are being replaced based on some rule. For example, maybe the 0s are being converted to 1s if they are adjacent to a 5? Or maybe there's a pattern where 0s are replaced by 1s and 2s based on their position relative to other cells.\n\nLooking at the third row of input: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the 5 is in position 3, and the 2 is in position 7. The output for the third row has 5 in position 3, and then 2s. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on some criteria. \n\nWait, in example 1, the output for row 2 is 1s and 2s. The first three positions are 1s, then 5, then 2s. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with numbers based on their distance from the nearest 5. For example, in the second row of input, the 5s are at positions 3 and 7. The 0s in between are being replaced with 1s and 2s. Maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are adjacent to a 5, and 2s if they are further away. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing 0s with 1s and 2s based on some pattern. For example, in the second row of input, the 0s are replaced with 1s in the first three positions and 2s in the next three. But that seems arbitrary. \n\nLooking at example 2. The input's second row is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. So the 5s are in positions 2 and 7. The 0s are replaced with 1s. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are adjacent to a 5? Or maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in a certain position relative to the 5s.\n\nBut in example 1, the second row's output has 2s in some positions. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on their position. For example, maybe the 0s are being converted to 1s if they are in the first half of the row and 2s in the second half. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with numbers based on the value of the cell in the same column in the previous row. For example, in example 1, the second row's input is 0s, but the first row's input is 1 5 1 5 5 2 5 5 5 1. The output for the second row is 1s and 2s. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if the cell above is 1, and 2s if the cell above is 2? But in example 1, the first row's second column is 5, and the output's second row's second column is 1. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced based on some kind of expansion. For example, in example 1, the second row has 0s. The output is 1s and 2s. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are adjacent to a 5, and 2s if they are adjacent to a 2. But how?\n\nLooking at example 2's input. The first row is 2 5 5 5 1 5 5 5 5 2. The output is same as input. So the first row is unchanged. The second row of input is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. So the 0s are replaced with 1s. Maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are adjacent to a 5. Let's check. The 5 is in position 2 (third column) of the input row. The 0s to the left of it (positions 0 and 1) are replaced with 1s. The 0s to the right of the 5 (positions 3,4,5,6,8,9) are replaced with 1s. But in the output, positions 3,4,5,6 are 1s. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are adjacent to a 5. But how about the 0s in the same row?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5. But that's not the case for example 1's second row. Let's check example 1's second row input: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. So the 0s in the first three positions are replaced with 1s, then the 5 is there, then the 0s between 5 and the next 5 are replaced with 2s. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5 and in a certain position. But this seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell in the same column in the previous row. For example, in example 1, the second row's output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The first row is 1 5 1 5 5 2 5 5 5 1. So for the second row's first column, the input is 0, but the output is 1. The first row's first column is 1. So maybe the output is based on the value of the cell above. So if the cell above is 1, then the current cell is 1. If the cell above is 2, then the current cell is 2. But in example 1's second row, the first column is 0, but the output is 1. So that would fit if the cell above is 1. But in the second row, the first column is 0. The cell above is 1. So maybe the 0s are replaced with the value of the cell above. But in example 1's second row, the first three columns are 0s. The cell above is 1, 5, 1. So the output is 1, 1, 1. Which matches. Then the next column is 5, so the output is 5. Then the next columns are 0s. The cell above is 2. So the output is 2. So that seems to fit. \n\nLet me check that. For example 1's second row, the first column is 0. The cell above is 1. So output is 1. Second column is 0, cell above is 5. So output is 5. Third column is 0, cell above is 1. Output is 1. Fourth column is 5. So output is 5. Fifth column is 0, cell above is 2. Output is 2. Sixth column is 0, cell above is 5. Output is 5? Wait, but in the output for example 1's second row, the sixth column is 2. Wait, the input's second row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The fifth column (index 4) is 0. The cell above is 5 (from first row's fifth column). So according to this idea, the output would be 5. But in the output, the fifth column is 2. So this contradicts the hypothesis. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nHmm. Maybe the 0s are being replaced based on the value of the cell to the left. Or maybe the value of the cell in the same row but previous column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5 and in a certain position. For example, in example 1's second row, the 0s are in positions 0,1,2,4,5,6,8,9. The 5s are in positions 3 and 7. So maybe the 0s between the 5s are replaced with 1s and 2s based on their position. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's output for the second row: 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The first three 0s are replaced with 1s. Then between the two 5s, the 0s are replaced with 2s. Then after the second 5, the 0s are replaced with 2s. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the first part of the row, and 2s if they are in the middle. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5 and in a certain position. For example, the first three 0s are in the same row as the 5 at position 3. So maybe they are replaced with 1s. Then the next 0s are in between the two 5s. So maybe they are replaced with 2s. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nLooking at example 2's input. The second row is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. So the 0s are replaced with 1s. The 5s are in positions 2 and 7. The 0s are in positions 0,1,3,4,5,6,8,9. So the 0s to the left of the first 5 are replaced with 1s. The 0s between the two 5s are replaced with 1s. The 0s to the right of the second 5 are replaced with 1s. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5. But why in example 1's second row, some 0s are replaced with 2s?\n\nHmm. Maybe there's a different pattern. Let's look at example 3. The input's second row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced with 2s. The 5 is in position 3. The 2 is in position 6. So the 0s are replaced with 2s. But in example 1's second row, the 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. So maybe the pattern depends on the value of the cell in the same column in the previous row?\n\nWait, in example 1's second row, the first column is 0. The cell above is 1. The output is 1. So maybe the output is the same as the cell above if it's 0. But in example 1's third row, the input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. The first column of input is 0, and the cell above is 0 (from second row's first column, which was 1 in the output? Wait no. Wait the second row's first column in output is 1. The third row's first column is 0. So maybe the cell above is 1. So the output is 1. But the third row's first column is 0, and the cell above is 1. So the output is 1. That fits. Then the third row's second column is 0. The cell above is 1 (second row's second column is 1). So output is 1. Third column is 0, cell above is 1. Output is 1. Fourth column is 5. So output is 5. Fifth column is 0. Cell above is 2 (second row's fifth column is 2). So output is 2. Sixth column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. Seventh column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. Eighth column is 2. So output is 2. Ninth column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. Tenth column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. So that seems to fit. \n\nSo maybe the rule is: for each cell in the output grid, if the input cell is 0, then the output cell is the same as the cell above it. But what if the cell above is also 0? Then it would be replaced with the cell above it, which would be 0. But in example 1's third row, the input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So for the third row, the first three cells are 0s, and the cell above them (second row) is 1, 1, 1. So output is 1s. The fifth column is 0, and the cell above is 2. So output is 2. \n\nThis seems to fit. Let's check example 2. For example 2's second row, the input is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. The cell above (first row) is 2 5 5 5 1 5 5 5 5 2. So for the second row's first column, input is 0. The cell above is 2. So output is 2? But in the output, it's 1. That contradicts. \n\nWait example 2's second row output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. The first column is 1. But the cell above is 2. So that doesn't fit. So maybe my hypothesis is wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that if the input cell is 0, then the output is the same as the cell to the left. But in example 1's second row, the first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing, so maybe 0. But the output is 1. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that for each 0 in the input, the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2. But that's just a guess. \n\nLooking at example 2's second row. The input is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. The cell above (first row) is 2 5 5 5 1 5 5 5 5 2. So for the first column, the cell above is 2. So output is 1? That doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. Maybe the rule is that for 0s, the output is 1 if the cell to the left is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell to the left is 2. But this seems arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell in the same row but previous column. For example, if the current cell is 0, then the output is the same as the previous cell. But in example 1's second row, the first column is 0. The previous cell doesn't exist, so maybe 1. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in a certain pattern. For example, in example 1's second row, the 0s are between two 5s. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the first part of the row and 2s if they are in the middle. But how to determine that?\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for example 1's second row. The 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. The 1s are in the first three positions and the 2s are in the middle. The 5s are in positions 3 and 7. So maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the first part of the row, and 2s if they are in the middle. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are being replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5 and to the left of it, and 2s if they are to the right. But this is not clear.\n\nLooking at example 3. The input's second row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced with 2s. The 5 is in position 3, and the 2 is in position 6. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 2s if they are in the same row as a 2. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each 0, the output is the same as the value of the cell in the same column in the previous row. Let's test this. For example 1's second row, first column is 0. The cell above is 1. So output is 1. Which matches. Second column is 0, cell above is 5. Output is 5. But in the output, it's 1. So that doesn't fit. \n\nWait, but in example 1's second row, the output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The second column is 1. But the cell above is 5. So this doesn't fit. So that hypothesis is invalid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the same as the cell to the left. For example, in example 1's second row, first column is 0. The cell to the left is nothing, so maybe 1. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced based on the value of the cell in the same column in the previous row. For example, if the cell above is 0, then the current cell is 0. But in example 1's second row, the first column is 0. The cell above is 1. So output is 1. Which matches. The second column is 0. The cell above is 5. So output is 5. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at the outputs for example 1's third row. Input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. Output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the first three 0s are replaced with 1s, then the 5 is there, then the 0s are replaced with 2s. The 2 is in the eighth column. So maybe the 0s are replaced based on the value of the cell in the same column in the previous row. For example, the first three 0s in row 2 are replaced with 1s, which is the same as the cell above (row 1, column 1 is 1). Then the fifth column is 0, and the cell above is 2. So output is 2. That fits. \n\nBut in example 2's second row, the first column is 0. The cell above is 2. So output would be 2, but the output is 1. So this contradicts.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the same as the cell above if it's not zero. But for example 2's second row, the first column is 0. The cell above is 2. So output is 2. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Let me try to look for other patterns. Maybe the output is a combination of the input and some other rule. For example, in example 1, the first row is unchanged. The second row is transformed, and the third row is transformed. Maybe the transformation is that for each 0, it's replaced with the minimum of the cell above and the cell to the left. Or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the value of the cell in the same row but previous column. For example, if the current cell is 0, then the output is the same as the previous cell. Let's see:\n\nIn example 1's second row: first column is 0. Previous cell is nothing. So maybe 1. Second column is 0. Previous cell is 1. Output is 1. Third column is 0. Previous cell is 1. Output is 1. Fourth column is 5. So output is 5. Fifth column is 0. Previous cell is 5. Output is 5. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 if they are in the same row as a 5, and 2 if they are in the same row as a 2. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each 0, the output is 1 if the cell to the left is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell to the left is 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3's output for the second row. The input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the first three 0s are replaced with 2s. The 5 is in position 3. The 2 is in position 6. The 0s after the 2 are replaced with 2s. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 2s if they are in the same row as a 2.\n\nBut in example 1's second row, the 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 if they are in the first part of the row and 2 if they are in the middle. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each 0, the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2. But in example 2's second row, the first column is 0, and the cell above is 2. So output would be 2, but the output is 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Let's look at the outputs for all examples.\n\nIn example 1, the output for the second row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The input's second row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. So the 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. The 5s are in the same positions. The 1s are in the first three positions, and the 2s are in the middle. \n\nIn example 2's second row, the input is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 1 1 5 1 1 1 1 5 1 1. So the 0s are replaced with 1s. The 5s are in the same positions.\n\nIn example 3's second row, the input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 2 2 2 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. So the 0s are replaced with 2s.\n\nSo it seems that the 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value of the cell above. But why in example 1's second row, some 0s are replaced with 1 and others with 2?\n\nWait, in example 1's second row, the first three 0s are replaced with 1s. The fifth column is 0, which is replaced with 2. The sixth and seventh columns are 0, replaced with 2. So maybe the value of the cell above determines the replacement. For example, if the cell above is 1, replace with 1. If the cell above is 2, replace with 2. But in example 1's second row, the fifth column is 0, and the cell above is 2. So output is 2. That fits. The first three columns are 0, and the cell above is 1,5,1. So the output is 1, 1, 1. But the second column's cell above is 5. So why is it replaced with 1? That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell to the left. For example, if the cell to the left is 1, then replace with 1. But in example 1's second row, the first column is 0, and there's no cell to the left. So maybe it's replaced with 1. The second column is 0, the cell to the left is 1. So replaced with 1. Third column is 0, cell to the left is 1. Replaced with 1. Fourth column is 5, so no change. Fifth column is 0, cell to the left is 5. So replaced with 5? But output is 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is based on the value of the cell in the same column in the previous row. For example, in example 1's second row, the first column is 0. The cell above is 1. So output is 1. Second column is 0. Cell above is 5. So output is 5. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. I'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in example 1's third row, the input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. The first three 0s are replaced with 1s. The fifth column is 0, replaced with 2. The sixth and seventh columns are 0, replaced with 2. The eighth column is 2, so output is 2. The ninth and tenth are 0, replaced with 2. \n\nSo the first three 0s are replaced with 1s. The rest are replaced with 2s. But why? Maybe because the first three columns are in a certain position relative to the 5 in the fourth column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 if they are in the same row as a 5 and in the first part of the row, and 2 otherwise. \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each 0, the output is 1 if the cell to the left is 1 or 5, and 2 if it's 2. But this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2. Let's check example 1's second row. The first column is 0, cell above is 1. Output is 1. Second column is 0, cell above is 5. Output is 1. Third column is 0, cell above is 1. Output is 1. Fourth column is 5. Output is 5. Fifth column is 0, cell above is 2. Output is 2. Sixth column is 0, cell above is 5. Output is 2. Seventh column is 0, cell above is 2. Output is 2. Eighth column is 5. Output is 5. Ninth column is 0, cell above is 2. Output is 2. Tenth column is 0, cell above is 2. Output is 2. This would fit. \n\nSo the rule would be: if the input cell is 0, then the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2. \n\nLet's test this with example 2's second row. Input is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The cell above is 2 5 5 5 1 5 5 5 5 2. So for the first column (0), cell above is 2. So output should be 2. But in the output, it's 1. So this contradicts. \n\nHmm. So this rule doesn't work for example 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: for a 0 cell, the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2 or 0. But this is just guessing. \n\nIn example 2's second row, the first column is 0, and the cell above is 2. So according to this rule, output is 2. But the output is 1. So this doesn't fit. \n\nI'm really not sure. Maybe the pattern is more complex. Let's try to think of other possibilities. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's 0, then the output is the same as the cell to the left, unless the cell to the left is 0, in which case it's 1. But this is just a guess. \n\nFor example 1's second row: first column is 0. No cell to the left, so output is 1. Second column is 0, cell to the left is 1. Output is 1. Third column is 0, cell to the left is 1. Output is 1. Fourth column is 5. Output is 5. Fifth column is 0, cell to the left is 5. Output is 5. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each 0, the output is 1 if the cell to the left is 1 or 5, and 2 if it's 2. But in example 2's second row, the first column is 0, cell to the left is nothing, so output is 1. Which matches the output. Second column is 0, cell to the left is 1. Output is 1. Third column is 5. Output is 5. Fourth column is 0, cell to the left is 5. Output is 5. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. \n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the second row is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 5 2 2. The input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The 5s are in positions 3 and 7. The 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s. Maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5 and in the first part of the row, and 2s if they are in the middle. \n\nBut how to determine that. Maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are to the left of a 5, and 2s if they are to the right. \n\nIn example 1's second row, the 0s are to the left of the first 5 (positions 0-2), so replaced with 1s. The 0s between the two 5s (positions 4-6) are replaced with 2s. The 0s to the right of the second 5 (positions 8-9) are replaced with 2s. \n\nIn example 2's second row, the 0s are to the left of the first 5 (positions 0-1), replaced with 1s. Between the two 5s (positions 3-6), replaced with 1s. To the right of the second 5 (positions 8-9), replaced with 1s. \n\nIn example 3's second row, the 0s are to the left of the 5 (positions 0-2), replaced with 2s. Between the 5 and the 2 (positions 4-5), replaced with 2s. To the right of the 2 (positions 7-9), replaced with 2s. \n\nSo maybe the rule is: for 0s, if they are in the same row as a 5 and are to the left of the 5, replace with 1. If they are between two 5s, replace with 2. If they are to the right of a 5, replace with 2. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5 and are in the first part of the row, and 2s if they are in the middle or after. \n\nBut this is too vague. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1s if they are in the same row as a 5 and the cell to the left is 1 or 5, and 2 otherwise. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for all examples. \n\nLooking at the output of example 1's second row, the 0s are replaced with 1s and 2s based on the value of the cell above. For example, the first three 0s are replaced with 1s because the cell above is 1, 5, 1. The fifth column is 0, and the cell above is 2, so replaced with 2. \n\nSo maybe the rule is: if the input cell is 0, the output is the same as the cell above. \n\nLet's test this for example 1's second row. The cell above for the first column is 1, so output is 1. Second column is 5, so output is 5. But in the output, it's 1. So this doesn't fit. \n\nBut in example 1's third row, the input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 2 0 0. The output is 1 1 1 5 2 2 2 2 2 2. The cell above for the first column is 1 (second row's first column is 1). So output is 1. Second column is 1 (second row's second column is 1). Output is 1. Third column is 1. Output is 1. Fourth column is 5. Output is 5. Fifth column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. Sixth column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. Seventh column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. Eighth column is 2. Output is 2. Ninth column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. Tenth column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 2. So this fits. \n\nBut for example 1's second row, the second column is 0. The cell above is 5. So according to this rule, the output should be 5. But in the output, it's 1. So this contradicts. \n\nHmm. So this rule works for some cases but not others. \n\nMaybe the rule is: if the input cell is 0, then the output is the same as the cell above if the cell above is not 0, otherwise it's 1. But in example 1's second row, the second column is 0, and the cell above is 5. So output should be 5. But it's 1. So this doesn't fit. \n\nI'm really stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. \n\nLooking at the outputs for all examples, it seems that 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value of the cell in the same column in the previous row. For example, in example 1's second row, the first column is 0, and the cell above is 1, so output is 1. Second column is 0, cell above is 5, so output is 1. Third column is 0, cell above is 1, output is 1. Fourth column is 5. Fifth column is 0, cell above is 2, output is 2. So why is the second column's output 1 when the cell above is 5? Maybe the rule is that if the cell above is 5, replace with 1. But that's arbitrary. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s are replaced with 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2 or 0. But this is just a guess. \n\nIn example 1's second row, the second column is 0. Cell above is 5. So output is 1. Third column is 0, cell above is 1. Output is 1. Fifth column is 0, cell above is 2. Output is 2. This fits. \n\nFor example 2's second row, the first column is 0. Cell above is 2. Output is 1. So this doesn't fit. \n\nBut maybe there's a different rule. Maybe the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2 or 0. But in example 2's second row, the first column is 0. Cell above is 2. So output is 2, but the output is 1. So this doesn't fit. \n\nI'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for a pattern that involves expanding 0s into 1s and 2s based on the nearest non-zero cell. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each 0, it is replaced with 1 if the cell to the left is 1 or 5, and 2 if it's 2. Let's try this for example 1's second row:\n\nFirst column is 0. No cell to the left. So output is 1. Second column is 0. Left cell is 1. Output is 1. Third column is 0. Left cell is 1. Output is 1. Fourth column is 5. Output is 5. Fifth column is 0. Left cell is 5. Output is 5. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nHmm. I think I need to make a guess based on the patterns I see. \n\nFrom the examples, it seems that 0s are being replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value of the cell above. For example, in example 1's second row, the 0s are replaced with 1s if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2. This seems to fit for some cases. \n\nSo the rule could be: for each cell in the grid, if the input cell is 0, then the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2. Otherwise, if the input cell is not 0, leave it as is. \n\nLet's test this for example 1's second row:\n\n- First column: input is 0. Cell above is 1 \u2192 output 1.\n- Second column: input is 0. Cell above is 5 \u2192 output 1.\n- Third column: input is 0. Cell above is 1 \u2192 output 1.\n- Fourth column: input is 5 \u2192 output 5.\n- Fifth column: input is 0. Cell above is 2 \u2192 output 2.\n- Sixth column: input is 0. Cell above is 5 \u2192 output 1. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nBut in the output, the sixth column is 2. So this rule doesn't work. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is: for each 0, the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 if the cell above is 2 or 0. But in example 1's second row, the sixth column is 0. Cell above is 5 \u2192 output 1, but in the output it's 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on what I can see, even if it's not perfect. \n\nThe most consistent pattern I see is that 0s are replaced with 1s or 2s based on the value of the cell above. For example, if the cell above is 1 or 5, replace with 1. If it's 2, replace with 2. \n\nSo the code would be: for each cell, if it's 0, then the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, else 2. \n\nLet's implement this and see if it works for the examples. \n\nFor example 1's second row:\n\n- First column: 0 \u2192 cell above is 1 \u2192 1.\n- Second column: 0 \u2192 cell above is 5 \u2192 1.\n- Third column: 0 \u2192 cell above is 1 \u2192 1.\n- Fourth column: 5 \u2192 5.\n- Fifth column: 0 \u2192 cell above is 2 \u2192 2.\n- Sixth column: 0 \u2192 cell above is 5 \u2192 1. But in the output, it's 2. So this would be incorrect. \n\nBut maybe the sixth column's cell above is 5, and the output is 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that if the cell above is 1 or 5, replace with 1, and if it's 2, replace with 2. But in example 1's second row, the sixth column is 0, and the cell above is 5, so output should be 1, but it's 2. \n\nThis suggests that the rule is not correct. \n\nBut given the time I've spent and the lack of a better idea, I'll proceed with this hypothesis, even if it doesn't fit all examples. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each cell in the grid, if the input is 0, then the output is 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, else 2. \n\nBut how to handle the cell above? For the first row, there is no cell above, so we can assume it's 0 or some default. But in example 1's first row, the input is not 0, so it remains the same. \n\nBut for the second row, the first column is 0, and the cell above is 1 (from first row, first column). So output is 1. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                if i == 0:\n                    # no cell above, but in example 1's first row, input is not 0.\n                    # but for other cases, maybe assume 0?\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    above = grid[i-1][j]\n                    if above in (1, 5):\n                        transformed[i][j] = 1\n                    else:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not work for example 1's second row, as the sixth column would be 0, and the cell above is 5, so output is 1. But the output is 2. \n\nBut maybe the cell above is not the correct value. Maybe I'm missing something. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell to the left is used instead of the cell above. \n\nBut without more examples, I can't be sure. \n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not fit all examples. \n\nBut looking at example 2's second row, the first column is 0. The cell above is 2. So according to this code, the output is 2. But the output is 1. So this code would not work for example 2. \n\nHmm. This is a problem. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell to the left is used. \n\nFor example, in example 1's second row, the first column is 0. No cell to the left, so assume 1. Output is 1. Second column is 0, left cell is 1 \u2192 output 1. Third column is 0, left cell is 1 \u2192 output 1. Fourth column is 5. Fifth column is 0, left cell is 5 \u2192 output 5. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples, even if it's not perfect. \n\nLooking at example 1's second row, the output for the fifth column is 2. The cell above is 2. So maybe the rule is: if the cell above is 2, replace with 2. If the cell above is 1 or 5, replace with 1. \n\nSo for example 1's second row, the sixth column is 0. Cell above is 5 \u2192 replaced with 1. But in the output, it's 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cell to the left is used. For example, in example 1's second row, the fifth column is 0. The cell to the left is 5. So replaced with 5. But output is 2. So this doesn't fit. \n\nI'm really stuck. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that 0s are replaced with 1 if the cell above is 1 or 5, and 2 otherwise. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                if i == 0:\n                    # no cell above, but in example 1's first row, input is not 0.\n                    # but for other cases, maybe assume 0?\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    above = grid[i-1][j]\n                    if above in (1, 5):\n                        transformed[i][j] = 1\n                    else:\n                        transformed[i][j] = 2\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not work for all examples. For example, in example 2's second row, the first column is 0. Cell above is 2 \u2192 replaced with 2. But the output is 1. So this would be wrong. \n\nBut given that, I'll proceed. Maybe the actual pattern is different, but this is the best I can do.\n"
