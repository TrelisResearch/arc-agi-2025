          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the transformation involves replacing certain values with 8 in specific patterns. It seems like the transformation is replacing certain shapes or regions with 8s, but the exact pattern is not immediately clear.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n1. The value 8 appears in specific positions in the output grid\n2. The positions of 8s seem to follow certain patterns related to the input grid\n3. The transformation appears to be more about replacing certain patterns with 8s rather than simple value substitution\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain patterns with 8s. I'll look for regions of 1s that are surrounded by 0s and replace them with 8s.\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define a function to check if a cell is surrounded by 0s\n    def is_surrounded_by_zeros(i, j):\n        for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                    continue\n                if 0 <= i + dx < 13 and 0 <= j + dy < 13:\n                    if grid_np[i + dx][j + dy] != 0:\n                        return False\n        return True\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            # If the cell is 1 and surrounded by 0s, replace with 8\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 1 and is_surrounded_by_zeros(i, j):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nThis implementation replaces cells with value 1 that are surrounded by 0s with value 8. This seems to align with the patterns observed in the training examples.",

The value 8 appears in specific positions in the output grid\n2. The positions of 8s seem to follow certain patterns related to the input grid\n3. The transformation appears to be more about replacing certain patterns with 8s rather than simple value substitution\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain patterns with 8s. I'll look for regions of 1s that are surrounded by 0s and replace them with 8s.\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define a function to check if a cell is surrounded by 0s\n    def is_surrounded_by_zeros(i, j):\n        for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n            for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                    continue\n                if 0 <= i + dx < 13 and 0 <= j + dy < 13:\n                    if grid_np[i + dx][j + dy] != 0:\n                        return False\n        return True\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            # If the cell is 1 and surrounded by 0s, replace with 8\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 1 and is_surrounded_by_zeros(i, j):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nThis implementation replaces cells with value 1 that are surrounded by 0s with value 8. This seems to align with the patterns observed in the training examples.",
