    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. I need to look at the input and output grids for each example and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 4x4 grid. The output is also 4x4. Let me write them down:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 6 6 6 2\nRow 1: 6 1 6 2\nRow 2: 7 2 7 2\nRow 3: 1 7 2 2\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 2 6 6 6\nRow 1: 2 6 1 6\nRow 2: 2 7 2 7\nRow 3: 2 2 7 1\n\nLooking at the first row of input and output. Input row 0 is [6,6,6,2], output row 0 is [2,6,6,6]. So the first element of the output row is 2, which is the last element of the input row. Then the rest are shifted? Like, maybe the first element becomes the last element, and others shift left? Wait, but the output row is [2,6,6,6], which is the original input row's last element (2) followed by the first three elements (6,6,6). So maybe for each row, the first element is moved to the end, and the rest are shifted left? Let's check other rows.\n\nInput row 1: [6,1,6,2]. Output row 1: [2,6,1,6]. Wait, original row is [6,1,6,2]. The output starts with 2 (the last element of input row), then the first three elements are 6,1,6. But that's not exactly the same as shifting. Wait, the original row's last element is 2. So the output row is [2, 6, 1, 6]. Hmm, that's not just shifting. Because the original row is 6,1,6,2. The output is 2,6,1,6. So the first element is 2 (original last element), then 6 (original first), then 1 (original second), then 6 (original third). So the order is last element, then first, second, third. So for each row, the output row is [last_element] followed by the first three elements. But that would make the output row for input row 0 be [2,6,6,6], which matches. For input row 1, [2,6,1,6], which is correct. Then input row 2 is [7,2,7,2], output is [2,7,2,7]. So the last element is 2, followed by 7,2,7. Which matches. And input row 3 is [1,7,2,2], output is [2,2,7,1]. Wait, the original row is 1,7,2,2. The last element is 2. Then the output starts with 2, then the first three elements are 1,7,2. But the output row is [2,2,7,1]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait the output row 3 is [2, 2, 7, 1]. The original input row is [1,7,2,2]. The output is [2, 2, 7, 1]. So the first element is 2 (original last element), then the next element is 2 (original third element?), then 7 (original second element?), then 1 (original first element). That seems like the output row is the last element, then the third element, then the second, then the first? That seems inconsistent with the previous rows. Maybe there's another pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a rotation or some transformation involving the entire grid. Let's look at the output for example 1. The output is:\n\nRow 0: 2 6 6 6\nRow 1: 2 6 1 6\nRow 2: 2 7 2 7\nRow 3: 2 2 7 1\n\nLooking at the first column of the output. It's 2, 2, 2, 2. The original input's first column is 6,6,7,1. So the first column of output is all 2s. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the output is a rotation. Let's think about the entire grid. For example, maybe the output is the input rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Let's check.\n\nOriginal input is:\n\nRow 0: 6 6 6 2\nRow 1: 6 1 6 2\nRow 2: 7 2 7 2\nRow 3: 1 7 2 2\n\nRotating 90 degrees clockwise would make the first column of the original become the last row in reverse. Let me think. Rotating a 4x4 grid 90 degrees clockwise would turn the first row into the last column in reverse. So original first row [6,6,6,2] becomes the last column of the output. But the output's first column is all 2s. That doesn't fit. Maybe not a rotation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is transformed by taking the last element and putting it first, then shifting the rest. But for row 3 of input, that would be [2,1,7,2] \u2192 [2, 1, 7, 2]? Wait, no. Wait, original row is [1,7,2,2]. The last element is 2. So if the output row is [2] followed by the first three elements [1,7,2], then the output row would be [2,1,7,2]. But the actual output row is [2,2,7,1]. So that's not matching. So that idea is wrong.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is more complex. Let's look for other patterns. For example, looking at the output of example 1, the first column is all 2s. The original input's first column is 6,6,7,1. So how does that become 2s? Not sure. Maybe the output is related to some kind of transformation where certain elements are replaced based on their position.\n\nLooking at example 2. The input is a 7x7 grid. The output is also 7x7. But maybe the pattern is different. Let me check example 2's input and output. For example, the first row of input is 7 7 7 6 6 6 2, and the output first row is 2 6 6 6 7 7 7. So the first element is 2 (original last element), then 6,6,6 (original elements 4-6?), then 7,7,7 (original elements 0-2). So maybe for each row, the first element is the last element of the input row, then the next elements are the first three elements, then the next three elements? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rotated in some way. For example, in example 1, the output's first row is [2,6,6,6], which is the original input's last element (2) followed by the first three elements. But for the second row, the output is [2,6,1,6], which is original last element (2) followed by first three elements (6,1,6). So that seems to fit. But for the third row, original row is [7,2,7,2], output is [2,7,2,7]. So that would be the last element (2) followed by the first three elements (7,2,7). Which is correct. But for the fourth row, original is [1,7,2,2], output is [2,2,7,1]. Wait, that's not matching. The original last element is 2, then the first three elements are 1,7,2. So the output would be [2,1,7,2]. But the actual output is [2,2,7,1]. So that's different.\n\nHmm, maybe there's another pattern. Maybe the first element of the output row is the last element of the input row, but the rest are shifted in a different way. Let me think again. For the fourth row of example 1:\n\nOriginal input row: [1,7,2,2]. Last element is 2. Output row is [2,2,7,1]. So after the first element (2), the next elements are 2,7,1. How do those relate to the original row? The original row is [1,7,2,2]. So the second element of the output is 2 (the third element of the original?), third element is 7 (second element?), fourth is 1 (first element). So maybe the output row is [last element, third element, second element, first element]. That would make for the fourth row: 2 (last), 2 (third), 7 (second), 1 (first). Which matches the output. But for the first row, original is [6,6,6,2]. The output row is [2,6,6,6]. Which would be last element, then first, second, third. So that's not matching. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the original row reversed. But for row 0, reversed would be [2,6,6,6], which matches the output. For row 1, original is [6,1,6,2], reversed is [2,6,1,6], which matches the output. Row 2: [7,2,7,2] reversed is [2,7,2,7], which matches. Row 3: [1,7,2,2] reversed is [2,2,7,1], which matches the output. Oh! Wait, that's exactly what's happening. So for each row, the output is the reverse of the input row. Let me check again.\n\nYes! For example 1, each row of the input is reversed to get the output. Let's check:\n\nInput row 0: 6 6 6 2 \u2192 reversed is 2 6 6 6 \u2192 matches output row 0.\nInput row 1: 6 1 6 2 \u2192 reversed is 2 6 1 6 \u2192 matches output row 1.\nInput row 2: 7 2 7 2 \u2192 reversed is 2 7 2 7 \u2192 matches output row 2.\nInput row 3: 1 7 2 2 \u2192 reversed is 2 2 7 1 \u2192 matches output row 3.\n\nYes! So the transformation for example 1 is reversing each row. But wait, example 2's input and output?\n\nLet me check example 2. The input is a 7x7 grid. The first row of input is 7 7 7 6 6 6 2. The output first row is 2 6 6 6 7 7 7. Which is the reversed of the input row. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input row: [7,7,7,6,6,6,2]. Reversed is [2,6,6,6,7,7,7], which matches the output. Similarly, the second input row is [6,7,1,1,7,7,1]. Reversed is [1,7,7,1,1,7,6]. Which matches the output row 1 of example 2. Let's check:\n\nOutput row 1 of example 2 is [1,7,7,1,1,7,6]. Which is indeed the reversed of the input row. So that seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly for example 3. Let's check the first row of example 3.\n\nInput row 0: 1 2 7 1 1 1 \u2192 output row 0 is 1 1 1 7 2 1. Wait, original input row is [1,2,7,1,1,1]. Reversed would be [1,1,1,7,2,1]. Which matches the output row. So that's correct.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that each row is reversed. So the transformation is to reverse each row of the input grid.\n\nBut wait, the test input is 3x3. The input is:\n\n7 6 1\n\n6 7 6\n\n6 2 2\n\nSo the output would be each row reversed. So the output would be:\n\n1 6 7\n\n6 7 6\n\n2 2 6\n\nBut the test input is given as a 3x3 grid. The problem says the output must be 4x4. Wait, but the test input is a 3x3 grid. But according to the problem statement, the function must take a grid (any size?), but the output must be 4x4. Wait, no. The problem says that the function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value. But the examples have 4x4, 7x7, 6x6 (example 3's input is 6x6). The test input is 3x3. But the output must be 4x4. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the problem says that the function must return a 4x4 output grid. But the test input is a 3x3 grid. How can that be? Or is the test input a 3x3 grid, but the function is supposed to process it into a 4x4 grid? Wait, perhaps the test input is a 3x3 grid but the function is supposed to return a 4x4 grid. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the function must return a 4x4 output grid. So regardless of the input size, the output is 4x4. But the training examples have input sizes of 4x4, 7x7, and 6x6. But the test input is 3x3. So for the test input, the function must process it into a 4x4 grid. But how?\n\nBut according to the examples, the transformation seems to be reversing each row. But that would not change the size. So perhaps the problem is that the test input is a 3x3 grid, but the output is 4x4. That would imply that the transformation is not just reversing each row. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial examples are not 4x4. Let me check. For example 1, the input is 4x4, output is 4x4. Example 2's input is 7x7, output is 7x7. Example 3's input is 6x6, output is 6x6. So the output is same size as input. But the test input is 3x3, and the output must be 4x4. So the transformation must be something else.\n\nBut according to the examples, the transformation is reversing each row. But that would not change the size. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my earlier assumption must be wrong.\n\nHmm. So maybe the test input is a 3x3 grid, but the output is 4x4. So how can that be? That suggests that the transformation is not simply reversing each row. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the test input is not part of the training examples. The test input is given for context, but the training examples are the ones that should be used to find the pattern. So the test input is a 3x3 grid, but the function is supposed to output a 4x4 grid. Therefore, the transformation must be something else.\n\nSo let's re-examine the examples. Maybe the pattern is not reversing each row, but something else.\n\nLooking again at example 1, where input is 4x4 and output is 4x4. The output is the reversed rows. But according to that, the output is same size as input. But the test input is 3x3, and the output is 4x4. So how can that be?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the test input is not part of the training examples. The user says that the test input is shown for context. So the function must take any input grid (could be any size) and output a 4x4 grid.\n\nBut according to the examples, the input and output are same size. So maybe the test input is a 3x3 grid, but the function is supposed to output a 4x4 grid. Therefore, the transformation is not just reversing each row.\n\nBut how? How can the examples be consistent with that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test input is not part of the training examples, but the pattern is that the output is the input reversed row-wise, but for some reason the test input is 3x3, and the output is 4x4. That seems impossible. Therefore, there must be a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is not reversing rows, but something else. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at example 1's output. The output is:\n\nRow 0: 2 6 6 6\nRow 1: 2 6 1 6\nRow 2: 2 7 2 7\nRow 3: 2 2 7 1\n\nOriginal input is:\n\nRow 0: 6 6 6 2\nRow 1: 6 1 6 2\nRow 2: 7 2 7 2\nRow 3: 1 7 2 2\n\nLet me check if there's a pattern involving the entire grid. For example, maybe the output is the input rotated 90 degrees clockwise, but with some modifications.\n\nFor example, a 4x4 grid rotated 90 degrees clockwise would have the first row become the last column in reverse. Let's try that.\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: 6 6 6 2\nRow 1: 6 1 6 2\nRow 2: 7 2 7 2\nRow 3: 1 7 2 2\n\nRotating 90 degrees clockwise would give:\n\nNew row 0: 2 2 2 2 (original column 3)\nNew row 1: 2 6 2 7 (original column 2)\nNew row 2: 2 6 7 1 (original column 1)\nNew row 3: 2 6 6 6 (original column 0)\n\nBut the output of example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 6 6 6\nRow 1: 2 6 1 6\nRow 2: 2 7 2 7\nRow 3: 2 2 7 1\n\nWhich doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input rows and columns. For example, maybe the first column of the output is the last column of the input, and the other columns are transformed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input with each row reversed, but then padded with some values. But that would not explain the test input's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input with each row reversed and then some other transformation. But I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that for each cell (i,j) in the input grid, the output cell (i,j) is the value from the input cell (i, 3-j), but that's for 4x4 grids. Let's check.\n\nIn example 1, input row 0 is [6,6,6,2]. Output row 0 is [2,6,6,6]. Which is input row 0 reversed. So for j=0, output is input j=3. For j=1, output is input j=2. For j=2, input j=1. For j=3, input j=0. So that's reversing the row.\n\nBut the test input is 3x3, and the output must be 4x4. So how to handle that?\n\nAh! Maybe the transformation is to reverse each row of the input, and then pad with some values to make it 4x4. But that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the input is 4x4, but the test input is 3x3, which is a different case. But the problem says that the function should return a 4x4 output grid regardless of the input size. So how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input reversed row-wise, and for the test input, which is 3x3, the output is a 4x4 grid. But that would require that the input is extended somehow. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is not row reversal. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLooking at example 1: the output's first column is all 2s. The input's first column is 6,6,7,1. How to get 2s? Maybe it's the last element of the input row. For each row, the first element of the output is the last element of the input row. Then, for the second element of the output row, it's the third element of the input row. For the third element, it's the second element of the input row. For the fourth element, it's the first element of the input row. So the output row is [last, third, second, first]. Let's check for example 1.\n\nFor input row 0: [6,6,6,2]. Output row is [2 (last), 6 (third), 6 (second), 6 (first)]? No, the output row is [2, 6, 6, 6]. Which is [last, first, second, third]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input reversed, and then for some reason, the test input is 3x3, but the output is 4x4. That is, the function must take the input and produce a 4x4 grid, but how?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. The input is 6x6. The output is 6x6. Let's take the first row of input: 1 2 7 1 1 1 \u2192 output row is 1 1 1 7 2 1. Which is the input row reversed. So again, this supports the idea that the transformation is reversing each row. But then the test input is 3x3, but the output must be 4x4. So how?\n\nMaybe the test input is a 3x3 grid, but the output is 4x4. So the function must take the input and produce a 4x4 grid. How? Perhaps the function is not simply reversing each row. But then, how to explain the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test input is not part of the training examples, but the pattern is that the output is the input with each row reversed, and if the input is smaller than 4x4, then some padding is added. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is 4x4, so the function is not just reversing rows. Maybe the pattern is something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each row is reversed, and then the output is padded with a row of 2s. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is 4x4, but the transformation is to reverse each row and then add a row of 2s. But that's just a guess.\n\nBut the training examples all have output grids of the same size as the input. So the function must return a grid of the same size as the input. But the problem says that the output must always be 4x4. Wait, this is conflicting with the examples.\n\nWait the problem says: \"Your task is to: 1. Analyze the training examples to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids 2. Write a Python program that implements your best understanding of the transformation 3. DO NOT predict or generate the test output - your job is only to write the transformation program 4. Attempt a solution - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis 5. Do not repeat the same transformation - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\"\n\nThe problem says that the function must return a 4x4 output grid. So regardless of the input size, the output is 4x4. So the training examples must be part of this. For example, in example 1, the input is 4x4 and the output is 4x4. In example 2, the input is 7x7 and the output is 7x7. But according to the problem, the output must be 4x4. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"Your task is to: ... 2. Write a Python program that implements your best understanding of the transformation ... 4. Attempt a solution ... 5. Do not repeat the same transformation ... 6. Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe.\"\n\nThe problem says that the function must return a 4x4 output grid. So regardless of the input, the output is 4x4. But in the training examples, the input and output are of the same size. This suggests that the function is supposed to take an input of any size and return a 4x4 grid. But that seems impossible unless the transformation is something else.\n\nBut how to reconcile this with the examples? For example, in example 1, the input is 4x4, and the output is 4x4. So the transformation is to reverse each row. So for a 4x4 input, the output is 4x4. For a 3x3 input, the function would reverse each row, but then how to make it 4x4?\n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the function should return a 4x4 grid, but the training examples have inputs and outputs of the same size. So for the test input, which is 3x3, the function must output a 4x4 grid.\n\nBut how? Let's think. Maybe the transformation is to reverse each row and then pad with some values. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the input and return a 4x4 grid by some transformation, but the examples are not part of that. But this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a mistake, and the output should be the same size as the input. But the user says that the output must always be 4x4.\n\nThis is very confusing. But given that the examples have outputs of the same size as the input, but the problem says that the output must always be 4x4, perhaps the test input is 3x3, and the function is supposed to output a 4x4 grid, but the training examples are not part of that. This would mean that the pattern is different.\n\nBut given that the examples show that reversing each row works for them, perhaps the function is supposed to return a 4x4 grid, and the test input is 3x3, but the function is supposed to pad or do something to make it 4x4.\n\nBut this is not clear. However, given the examples, the most plausible pattern is that each row is reversed. So for the test input, which is 3x3, the function would reverse each row, but the output is 4x4. So that's not possible. Therefore, there must be another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take the input and return a 4x4 grid where each row is the input row reversed and padded with a 2. For example, for the test input, which is 3x3, the output is 4x4. So each row is reversed and then padded with a 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nBut how to handle the training examples. In example 1, the input is 4x4. Reversing each row gives 4x4 output. So that fits. For example 2, the input is 7x7, output is 7x7. So the function would return the same size.\n\nBut the problem says that the output must always be 4x4. So this is conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that the initial assumption about reversing each row is incorrect.\n\nLet me re-examine the examples again, but this time look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at example 1: the output's first column is [2, 2, 2, 2]. The input's first column is [6, 6, 7, 1]. How to get 2s? Maybe it's the last element of the input row. For each row, the first element of the output is the last element of the input row. For example, row 0's output first element is 2 (last of input row 0). Row 1's output first element is 2 (last of input row 1). Row 2's output first element is 2 (last of input row 2). Row 3's output first element is 2 (last of input row 3). So the first column of the output is all the last elements of the input rows.\n\nBut what about the other columns? For example, the second column of the output is [6, 6, 7, 2]. Let's see:\n\nInput row 0: [6,6,6,2]. Output row 0 is [2,6,6,6]. So the second element is 6, which is the first element of the input row.\n\nInput row 1: [6,1,6,2]. Output row 1 is [2,6,1,6]. So the second element is 6, which is the first element of the input row.\n\nInput row 2: [7,2,7,2]. Output row 2 is [2,7,2,7]. Second element is 7, first element of input row.\n\nInput row 3: [1,7,2,2]. Output row 3 is [2,2,7,1]. Second element is 2, which is the third element of the input row (2).\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. For row 3, the second element of the output is 2, which is the third element of the input row (input row is [1,7,2,2], third element is 2).\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent. But for rows 0, 1, 2, the second element of the output is the first element of the input row. For row 3, it's the third element.\n\nThis is confusing. But if the pattern is that the output row is the input row reversed, then for row 3, it would be [2, 2, 7, 1], which is the reversed input row. So that fits.\n\nBut how to explain the test input. If the function is supposed to return a 4x4 grid, but the test input is 3x3, then perhaps the function is to pad the input with a row of 2s and then reverse each row.\n\nBut that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is to reverse each row and then pad with a new row of 2s to make it 4x4. For example, if the input is 3x3, reverse each row to get 3x3, then add a row of 2s. But this is speculative.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the function must return a 4x4 grid. So perhaps the pattern is to reverse each row of the input and then pad with a row of 2s. But this is not consistent with the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid where each row is the input row reversed and then padded with a 2. For example, the input is 3x3. Reversed rows would be 3x3. Then add a row of 2s to make it 4x4. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut given that the training examples show that reversing each row works, but the test input requires a 4x4 output, perhaps the function is supposed to reverse each row and then add a row of 2s. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the row reversal, and assume that the test input is 3x3, but the function is supposed to return a 4x4 grid, which is not possible with row reversal. So this suggests that my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test input is a 3x3 grid, and the function is supposed to return a 4x4 grid by some other transformation. But how?\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that the output is the input with each row reversed, and then the output is padded with a row of 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is to create a 4x4 grid where each row is the input row reversed, and if the input has fewer rows, the missing rows are filled with 2s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is to take the input grid, and for each row, reverse it, and then add a new row of 2s to make it 4x4. For example, if the input is 3x3, reverse each row to get 3x3, then add a row of [2,2,2] to make it 4x4.\n\nBut this is not supported by the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is to create a 4x4 grid where each row is the input row reversed, and if the input is smaller, the extra rows are filled with 2s.\n\nBut this is speculation.\n\nGiven that the examples show that reversing each row works, and the problem says that the output must be 4x4, I'm stuck. But perhaps the test input is a 3x3 grid, and the function is supposed to return a 4x4 grid by reversing each row and then adding a row of 2s. Let's try that.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nInput is:\n7 6 1\n6 7 6\n6 2 2\n\nReversing each row gives:\n1 6 7\n6 7 6\n2 2 6\n\nThen add a row of 2s: [2,2,2]. So the output is 4x3, but the problem says it must be 4x4. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is to pad each row with a 2 on the end to make it 4 columns. For example, for each row, reverse it, then add a 2 at the end.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow 0: [7,6,1] \u2192 reversed is [1,6,7] \u2192 add 2 \u2192 [1,6,7,2]\n\nRow 1: [6,7,6] \u2192 reversed [6,7,6] \u2192 add 2 \u2192 [6,7,6,2]\n\nRow 2: [6,2,2] \u2192 reversed [2,2,6] \u2192 add 2 \u2192 [2,2,6,2]\n\nThen add a row of [2,2,2,2] to make it 4x4. So the output would be:\n\n1 6 7 2\n\n6 7 6 2\n\n2 2 6 2\n\n2 2 2 2\n\nBut this is just a guess, and not supported by the examples.\n\nBut the examples show that for 4x4 inputs, the output is 4x4, which would be the reversed rows. So this suggests that the function should return the reversed rows, and the test input is a 3x3 grid, which is not part of the training examples.\n\nBut the problem says that the function must return a 4x4 grid. So perhaps the test input is a 3x3 grid, and the function is to reverse each row and pad with a 2 to make it 4x4.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given the time constraints, I think the best approach is to proceed with the row reversal pattern, even though it doesn't fit the test input's size requirement. Perhaps the test input is part of the training examples, and I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is 4x4, but the pattern is to take the input and create a 4x4 grid where each row is the input row reversed, and then add a new row of 2s. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nGiven that the examples show that reversing each row is the pattern, I will proceed with that. Even though the test input is 3x3, the function is supposed to return a 4x4 grid. So perhaps the function is to reverse each row and then add a row of 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the function must return a 4x4 grid, and the examples show that for 4x4 inputs, it's the same. So perhaps the function is to reverse each row, and if the input is not 4x4, then it's padded with 2s to make it 4x4.\n\nBut this is not clear. However, given the examples, the most logical transformation is to reverse each row.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    return [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n\nBut this would return a grid of the same size as the input. But the problem says that the output must be 4x4. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement is wrong, and the function is supposed to return the same size as the input. Or perhaps the test input is 3x3, but the output is 4x4, and the pattern is different.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the row reversal, as it fits the training examples, and assume that the test input is part of the training examples, but the problem statement is incorrect.\n\nSo, the final code would be to reverse each row.\n"

        "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. I need to look at the input and output grids for each example and see what's going on.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 4x4 grid. The output is also 4x4. Let me write them down:\n\nInput:\nRow 0: 6 6 6 2\nRow 1: 6 1 6 2\nRow 2: 7 2 7 2\nRow 3: 1 7 2 2\n\nOutput:\nRow 0: 2 6 6 6\nRow 1: 2 6 1 6\nRow 2: 2 7 2 7\nRow 3: 2 2 7 1\n\nLooking at the first row of input and output. Input row 0 is [6,6,6,2], output row 0 is [2,6,6,6]. So the first element of the output row is 2, which is the last element of the input row. Then the rest are shifted? Like, maybe the first element becomes the last element, and others shift left? Wait, but the output row is [2,6,6,6], which is the original input row's last element (2) followed by the first three elements (6,6,6). So maybe for each row, the first element is moved to the end, and the rest are shifted left? Let's check other rows.\n\nInput row 1: [6,1,6,2]. Output row 1: [2,6,1,6]. Wait, original row is [6,1,6,2]. The output starts with 2 (the last element of input row), then the first three elements are 6,1,6. But that's not exactly the same as shifting. Wait, the original row's last element is 2. So the output row is [2, 6, 1, 6]. Hmm, that's not just shifting. Because the original row is 6,1,6,2. The output is 2,6,1,6. So the first element is 2 (original last element), then 6 (original first), then 1 (original second), then 6 (original third). So the order is last element, then first, second, third. So for each row, the output row is [last_element] followed by the first three elements. But that would make the output row for input row 0 be [2,6,6,6], which matches. For input row 1, [2,6,1,6], which is correct. Then input row 2 is [7,2,7,2], output is [2,7,2,7]. So the last element is 2, followed by 7,2,7. Which matches. And input row 3 is [1,7,2,2], output is [2,2,7,1]. Wait, the original row is 1,7,2,2. The last element is 2. Then the output starts with 2, then the first three elements are 1,7,2. But the output row is [2,2,7,1]. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait the output row 3 is [2, 2, 7, 1]. The original input row is [1,7,2,2]. The output is [2, 2, 7, 1]. So the first element is 2 (original last element), then the next element is 2 (original third element?), then 7 (original second element?), then 1 (original first element). That seems like the output row is the last element, then the third element, then the second, then the first? That seems inconsistent with the previous rows. Maybe there's another pattern here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a rotation or some transformation involving the entire grid. Let's look at the output for example 1. The output is:\n\nRow 0: 2 6 6 6\nRow 1: 2 6 1 6\nRow 2: 2 7 2 7\nRow 3: 2 2 7 1\n\nLooking at the first column of the output. It's 2, 2, 2, 2. The original input's first column is 6,6,7,1. So the first column of output is all 2s. But that's not helpful. Alternatively, maybe the output is a rotation. Let's think about the entire grid. For example, maybe the output is the input rotated 90 degrees clockwise. Let's check.\n\nOriginal input is:\n\nRow 0: 6 6 6 2\nRow 1: 6 1 6 2\nRow 2: 7 2 7 2\nRow 3: 1 7 2 2\n\nRotating 90 degrees clockwise would make the first column of the original become the last row in reverse. Let me think. Rotating a 4x4 grid 90 degrees clockwise would turn the first row into the last column in reverse. So original first row [6,6,6,2] becomes the last column of the output. But the output's first column is all 2s. That doesn't fit. Maybe not a rotation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps each row is transformed by taking the last element and putting it first, then shifting the rest. But for row 3 of input, that would be [2,1,7,2] \u2192 [2, 1, 7, 2]? Wait, no. Wait, original row is [1,7,2,2]. The last element is 2. So if the output row is [2] followed by the first three elements [1,7,2], then the output row would be [2,1,7,2]. But the actual output row is [2,2,7,1]. So that's not matching. So that idea is wrong.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is more complex. Let's look for other patterns. For example, looking at the output of example 1, the first column is all 2s. The original input's first column is 6,6,7,1. So how does that become 2s? Not sure. Maybe the output is related to some kind of transformation where certain elements are replaced based on their position.\n\nLooking at example 2. The input is a 7x7 grid. The output is also 7x7. But maybe the pattern is different. Let me check example 2's input and output. For example, the first row of input is 7 7 7 6 6 6 2, and the output first row is 2 6 6 6 7 7 7. So the first element is 2 (original last element), then 6,6,6 (original elements 4-6?), then 7,7,7 (original elements 0-2). So maybe for each row, the first element is the last element of the input row, then the next elements are the first three elements, then the next three elements? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is the input rotated in some way. For example, in example 1, the output's first row is [2,6,6,6], which is the original input's last element (2) followed by the first three elements. But for the second row, the output is [2,6,1,6], which is original last element (2) followed by first three elements (6,1,6). So that seems to fit. But for the third row, original row is [7,2,7,2], output is [2,7,2,7]. So that would be the last element (2) followed by the first three elements (7,2,7). Which is correct. But for the fourth row, original is [1,7,2,2], output is [2,2,7,1]. Wait, that's not matching. The original last element is 2, then the first three elements are 1,7,2. So the output would be [2,1,7,2]. But the actual output is [2,2,7,1]. So that's different.\n\nHmm, maybe there's another pattern. Maybe the first element of the output row is the last element of the input row, but the rest are shifted in a different way. Let me think again. For the fourth row of example 1:\n\nOriginal input row: [1,7,2,2]. Last element is 2. Output row is [2,2,7,1]. So after the first element (2), the next elements are 2,7,1. How do those relate to the original row? The original row is [1,7,2,2]. So the second element of the output is 2 (the third element of the original?), third element is 7 (second element?), fourth is 1 (first element). So maybe the output row is [last element, third element, second element, first element]. That would make for the fourth row: 2 (last), 2 (third), 7 (second), 1 (first). Which matches the output. But for the first row, original is [6,6,6,2]. The output row is [2,6,6,6]. Which would be last element, then first, second, third. So that's not matching. So maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the original row reversed. But for row 0, reversed would be [2,6,6,6], which matches the output. For row 1, original is [6,1,6,2], reversed is [2,6,1,6], which matches the output. Row 2: [7,2,7,2] reversed is [2,7,2,7], which matches. Row 3: [1,7,2,2] reversed is [2,2,7,1], which matches the output. Oh! Wait, that's exactly what's happening. So for each row, the output is the reverse of the input row. Let me check again.\n\nYes! For example 1, each row of the input is reversed to get the output. Let's check:\n\nInput row 0: 6 6 6 2 \u2192 reversed is 2 6 6 6 \u2192 matches output row 0.\nInput row 1: 6 1 6 2 \u2192 reversed is 2 6 1 6 \u2192 matches output row 1.\nInput row 2: 7 2 7 2 \u2192 reversed is 2 7 2 7 \u2192 matches output row 2.\nInput row 3: 1 7 2 2 \u2192 reversed is 2 2 7 1 \u2192 matches output row 3.\n\nYes! So the transformation for example 1 is reversing each row. But wait, example 2's input and output?\n\nLet me check example 2. The input is a 7x7 grid. The first row of input is 7 7 7 6 6 6 2. The output first row is 2 6 6 6 7 7 7. Which is the reversed of the input row. Let's check:\n\nOriginal input row: [7,7,7,6,6,6,2]. Reversed is [2,6,6,6,7,7,7], which matches the output. Similarly, the second input row is [6,7,1,1,7,7,1]. Reversed is [1,7,7,1,1,7,6]. Which matches the output row 1 of example 2. Let's check:\n\nOutput row 1 of example 2 is [1,7,7,1,1,7,6]. Which is indeed the reversed of the input row. So that seems to fit.\n\nSimilarly for example 3. Let's check the first row of example 3.\n\nInput row 0: 1 2 7 1 1 1 \u2192 output row 0 is 1 1 1 7 2 1. Wait, original input row is [1,2,7,1,1,1]. Reversed would be [1,1,1,7,2,1]. Which matches the output row. So that's correct.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that each row is reversed. So the transformation is to reverse each row of the input grid.\n\nBut wait, the test input is 3x3. The input is:\n\n7 6 1\n\n6 7 6\n\n6 2 2\n\nSo the output would be each row reversed. So the output would be:\n\n1 6 7\n\n6 7 6\n\n2 2 6\n\nBut the test input is given as a 3x3 grid. The problem says the output must be 4x4. Wait, but the test input is a 3x3 grid. But according to the problem statement, the function must take a grid (any size?), but the output must be 4x4. Wait, no. The problem says that the function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value. But the examples have 4x4, 7x7, 6x6 (example 3's input is 6x6). The test input is 3x3. But the output must be 4x4. Wait, that's confusing. Wait, the problem says that the function must return a 4x4 output grid. But the test input is a 3x3 grid. How can that be? Or is the test input a 3x3 grid, but the function is supposed to process it into a 4x4 grid? Wait, perhaps the test input is a 3x3 grid but the function is supposed to return a 4x4 grid. But how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the function must return a 4x4 output grid. So regardless of the input size, the output is 4x4. But the training examples have input sizes of 4x4, 7x7, and 6x6. But the test input is 3x3. So for the test input, the function must process it into a 4x4 grid. But how?\n\nBut according to the examples, the transformation seems to be reversing each row. But that would not change the size. So perhaps the problem is that the test input is a 3x3 grid, but the output is 4x4. That would imply that the transformation is not just reversing each row. So there's a contradiction here.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial examples are not 4x4. Let me check. For example 1, the input is 4x4, output is 4x4. Example 2's input is 7x7, output is 7x7. Example 3's input is 6x6, output is 6x6. So the output is same size as input. But the test input is 3x3, and the output must be 4x4. So the transformation must be something else.\n\nBut according to the examples, the transformation is reversing each row. But that would not change the size. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my earlier assumption must be wrong.\n\nHmm. So maybe the test input is a 3x3 grid, but the output is 4x4. So how can that be? That suggests that the transformation is not simply reversing each row. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the test input is not part of the training examples. The test input is given for context, but the training examples are the ones that should be used to find the pattern. So the test input is a 3x3 grid, but the function is supposed to output a 4x4 grid. Therefore, the transformation must be something else.\n\nSo let's re-examine the examples. Maybe the pattern is not reversing each row, but something else.\n\nLooking again at example 1, where input is 4x4 and output is 4x4. The output is the reversed rows. But according to that, the output is same size as input. But the test input is 3x3, and the output is 4x4. So how can that be?\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the test input is not part of the training examples. The user says that the test input is shown for context. So the function must take any input grid (could be any size) and output a 4x4 grid.\n\nBut according to the examples, the input and output are same size. So maybe the test input is a 3x3 grid, but the function is supposed to output a 4x4 grid. Therefore, the transformation is not just reversing each row.\n\nBut how? How can the examples be consistent with that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test input is not part of the training examples, but the pattern is that the output is the input reversed row-wise, but for some reason the test input is 3x3, and the output is 4x4. That seems impossible. Therefore, there must be a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is not reversing rows, but something else. Let's think again.\n\nLooking at example 1's output. The output is:\n\nRow 0: 2 6 6 6\nRow 1: 2 6 1 6\nRow 2: 2 7 2 7\nRow 3: 2 2 7 1\n\nOriginal input is:\n\nRow 0: 6 6 6 2\nRow 1: 6 1 6 2\nRow 2: 7 2 7 2\nRow 3: 1 7 2 2\n\nLet me check if there's a pattern involving the entire grid. For example, maybe the output is the input rotated 90 degrees clockwise, but with some modifications.\n\nFor example, a 4x4 grid rotated 90 degrees clockwise would have the first row become the last column in reverse. Let's try that.\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: 6 6 6 2\nRow 1: 6 1 6 2\nRow 2: 7 2 7 2\nRow 3: 1 7 2 2\n\nRotating 90 degrees clockwise would give:\n\nNew row 0: 2 2 2 2 (original column 3)\nNew row 1: 2 6 2 7 (original column 2)\nNew row 2: 2 6 7 1 (original column 1)\nNew row 3: 2 6 6 6 (original column 0)\n\nBut the output of example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: 2 6 6 6\nRow 1: 2 6 1 6\nRow 2: 2 7 2 7\nRow 3: 2 2 7 1\n\nWhich doesn't match. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a combination of the input rows and columns. For example, maybe the first column of the output is the last column of the input, and the other columns are transformed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input with each row reversed, but then padded with some values. But that would not explain the test input's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input with each row reversed and then some other transformation. But I'm stuck.\n\nWait, perhaps the pattern is that for each cell (i,j) in the input grid, the output cell (i,j) is the value from the input cell (i, 3-j), but that's for 4x4 grids. Let's check.\n\nIn example 1, input row 0 is [6,6,6,2]. Output row 0 is [2,6,6,6]. Which is input row 0 reversed. So for j=0, output is input j=3. For j=1, output is input j=2. For j=2, input j=1. For j=3, input j=0. So that's reversing the row.\n\nBut the test input is 3x3, and the output must be 4x4. So how to handle that?\n\nAh! Maybe the transformation is to reverse each row of the input, and then pad with some values to make it 4x4. But that doesn't make sense. Or maybe the input is 4x4, but the test input is 3x3, which is a different case. But the problem says that the function should return a 4x4 output grid regardless of the input size. So how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is that the output is the input reversed row-wise, and for the test input, which is 3x3, the output is a 4x4 grid. But that would require that the input is extended somehow. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is not row reversal. Let me think of another approach.\n\nLooking at example 1: the output's first column is all 2s. The input's first column is 6,6,7,1. How to get 2s? Maybe it's the last element of the input row. For each row, the first element of the output is the last element of the input row. Then, for the second element of the output row, it's the third element of the input row. For the third element, it's the second element of the input row. For the fourth element, it's the first element of the input row. So the output row is [last, third, second, first]. Let's check for example 1.\n\nFor input row 0: [6,6,6,2]. Output row is [2 (last), 6 (third), 6 (second), 6 (first)]? No, the output row is [2, 6, 6, 6]. Which is [last, first, second, third]. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the input reversed, and then for some reason, the test input is 3x3, but the output is 4x4. That is, the function must take the input and produce a 4x4 grid, but how?\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. The input is 6x6. The output is 6x6. Let's take the first row of input: 1 2 7 1 1 1 \u2192 output row is 1 1 1 7 2 1. Which is the input row reversed. So again, this supports the idea that the transformation is reversing each row. But then the test input is 3x3, but the output must be 4x4. So how?\n\nMaybe the test input is a 3x3 grid, but the output is 4x4. So the function must take the input and produce a 4x4 grid. How? Perhaps the function is not simply reversing each row. But then, how to explain the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test input is not part of the training examples, but the pattern is that the output is the input with each row reversed, and if the input is smaller than 4x4, then some padding is added. But that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is 4x4, so the function is not just reversing rows. Maybe the pattern is something else.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that each row is reversed, and then the output is padded with a row of 2s. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is 4x4, but the transformation is to reverse each row and then add a row of 2s. But that's just a guess.\n\nBut the training examples all have output grids of the same size as the input. So the function must return a grid of the same size as the input. But the problem says that the output must always be 4x4. Wait, this is conflicting with the examples.\n\nWait the problem says: \"Your task is to: 1. Analyze the training examples to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids 2. Write a Python program that implements your best understanding of the transformation 3. DO NOT predict or generate the test output - your job is only to write the transformation program 4. Attempt a solution - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis 5. Do not repeat the same transformation - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\"\n\nThe problem says that the function must return a 4x4 output grid. So regardless of the input size, the output is 4x4. So the training examples must be part of this. For example, in example 1, the input is 4x4 and the output is 4x4. In example 2, the input is 7x7 and the output is 7x7. But according to the problem, the output must be 4x4. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, perhaps the problem statement is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding. Let me re-read the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"Your task is to: ... 2. Write a Python program that implements your best understanding of the transformation ... 4. Attempt a solution ... 5. Do not repeat the same transformation ... 6. Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe.\"\n\nThe problem says that the function must return a 4x4 output grid. So regardless of the input, the output is 4x4. But in the training examples, the input and output are of the same size. This suggests that the function is supposed to take an input of any size and return a 4x4 grid. But that seems impossible unless the transformation is something else.\n\nBut how to reconcile this with the examples? For example, in example 1, the input is 4x4, and the output is 4x4. So the transformation is to reverse each row. So for a 4x4 input, the output is 4x4. For a 3x3 input, the function would reverse each row, but then how to make it 4x4?\n\nThis suggests that there's a misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem statement is correct, and the function should return a 4x4 grid, but the training examples have inputs and outputs of the same size. So for the test input, which is 3x3, the function must output a 4x4 grid.\n\nBut how? Let's think. Maybe the transformation is to reverse each row and then pad with some values. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the function is supposed to take the input and return a 4x4 grid by some transformation, but the examples are not part of that. But this is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem statement has a mistake, and the output should be the same size as the input. But the user says that the output must always be 4x4.\n\nThis is very confusing. But given that the examples have outputs of the same size as the input, but the problem says that the output must always be 4x4, perhaps the test input is 3x3, and the function is supposed to output a 4x4 grid, but the training examples are not part of that. This would mean that the pattern is different.\n\nBut given that the examples show that reversing each row works for them, perhaps the function is supposed to return a 4x4 grid, and the test input is 3x3, but the function is supposed to pad or do something to make it 4x4.\n\nBut this is not clear. However, given the examples, the most plausible pattern is that each row is reversed. So for the test input, which is 3x3, the function would reverse each row, but the output is 4x4. So that's not possible. Therefore, there must be another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is supposed to take the input and return a 4x4 grid where each row is the input row reversed and padded with a 2. For example, for the test input, which is 3x3, the output is 4x4. So each row is reversed and then padded with a 2. But that's just a guess.\n\nBut how to handle the training examples. In example 1, the input is 4x4. Reversing each row gives 4x4 output. So that fits. For example 2, the input is 7x7, output is 7x7. So the function would return the same size.\n\nBut the problem says that the output must always be 4x4. So this is conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that the initial assumption about reversing each row is incorrect.\n\nLet me re-examine the examples again, but this time look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at example 1: the output's first column is [2, 2, 2, 2]. The input's first column is [6, 6, 7, 1]. How to get 2s? Maybe it's the last element of the input row. For each row, the first element of the output is the last element of the input row. For example, row 0's output first element is 2 (last of input row 0). Row 1's output first element is 2 (last of input row 1). Row 2's output first element is 2 (last of input row 2). Row 3's output first element is 2 (last of input row 3). So the first column of the output is all the last elements of the input rows.\n\nBut what about the other columns? For example, the second column of the output is [6, 6, 7, 2]. Let's see:\n\nInput row 0: [6,6,6,2]. Output row 0 is [2,6,6,6]. So the second element is 6, which is the first element of the input row.\n\nInput row 1: [6,1,6,2]. Output row 1 is [2,6,1,6]. So the second element is 6, which is the first element of the input row.\n\nInput row 2: [7,2,7,2]. Output row 2 is [2,7,2,7]. Second element is 7, first element of input row.\n\nInput row 3: [1,7,2,2]. Output row 3 is [2,2,7,1]. Second element is 2, which is the third element of the input row (2).\n\nWait, that's inconsistent. For row 3, the second element of the output is 2, which is the third element of the input row (input row is [1,7,2,2], third element is 2).\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not consistent. But for rows 0, 1, 2, the second element of the output is the first element of the input row. For row 3, it's the third element.\n\nThis is confusing. But if the pattern is that the output row is the input row reversed, then for row 3, it would be [2, 2, 7, 1], which is the reversed input row. So that fits.\n\nBut how to explain the test input. If the function is supposed to return a 4x4 grid, but the test input is 3x3, then perhaps the function is to pad the input with a row of 2s and then reverse each row.\n\nBut that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is to reverse each row and then pad with a new row of 2s to make it 4x4. For example, if the input is 3x3, reverse each row to get 3x3, then add a row of 2s. But this is speculative.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the function must return a 4x4 grid. So perhaps the pattern is to reverse each row of the input and then pad with a row of 2s. But this is not consistent with the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 4x4 grid where each row is the input row reversed and then padded with a 2. For example, the input is 3x3. Reversed rows would be 3x3. Then add a row of 2s to make it 4x4. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut given that the training examples show that reversing each row works, but the test input requires a 4x4 output, perhaps the function is supposed to reverse each row and then add a row of 2s. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to implement the row reversal, and assume that the test input is 3x3, but the function is supposed to return a 4x4 grid, which is not possible with row reversal. So this suggests that my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test input is a 3x3 grid, and the function is supposed to return a 4x4 grid by some other transformation. But how?\n\nPerhaps the pattern is that the output is the input with each row reversed, and then the output is padded with a row of 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is to create a 4x4 grid where each row is the input row reversed, and if the input has fewer rows, the missing rows are filled with 2s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is to take the input grid, and for each row, reverse it, and then add a new row of 2s to make it 4x4. For example, if the input is 3x3, reverse each row to get 3x3, then add a row of [2,2,2] to make it 4x4.\n\nBut this is not supported by the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is to create a 4x4 grid where each row is the input row reversed, and if the input is smaller, the extra rows are filled with 2s.\n\nBut this is speculation.\n\nGiven that the examples show that reversing each row works, and the problem says that the output must be 4x4, I'm stuck. But perhaps the test input is a 3x3 grid, and the function is supposed to return a 4x4 grid by reversing each row and then adding a row of 2s. Let's try that.\n\nFor the test input:\n\nInput is:\n7 6 1\n6 7 6\n6 2 2\n\nReversing each row gives:\n1 6 7\n6 7 6\n2 2 6\n\nThen add a row of 2s: [2,2,2]. So the output is 4x3, but the problem says it must be 4x4. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the function is to pad each row with a 2 on the end to make it 4 columns. For example, for each row, reverse it, then add a 2 at the end.\n\nSo for the test input:\n\nRow 0: [7,6,1] \u2192 reversed is [1,6,7] \u2192 add 2 \u2192 [1,6,7,2]\n\nRow 1: [6,7,6] \u2192 reversed [6,7,6] \u2192 add 2 \u2192 [6,7,6,2]\n\nRow 2: [6,2,2] \u2192 reversed [2,2,6] \u2192 add 2 \u2192 [2,2,6,2]\n\nThen add a row of [2,2,2,2] to make it 4x4. So the output would be:\n\n1 6 7 2\n\n6 7 6 2\n\n2 2 6 2\n\n2 2 2 2\n\nBut this is just a guess, and not supported by the examples.\n\nBut the examples show that for 4x4 inputs, the output is 4x4, which would be the reversed rows. So this suggests that the function should return the reversed rows, and the test input is a 3x3 grid, which is not part of the training examples.\n\nBut the problem says that the function must return a 4x4 grid. So perhaps the test input is a 3x3 grid, and the function is to reverse each row and pad with a 2 to make it 4x4.\n\nBut this is not clear. Given the time constraints, I think the best approach is to proceed with the row reversal pattern, even though it doesn't fit the test input's size requirement. Perhaps the test input is part of the training examples, and I made a mistake in the analysis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the test input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is 4x4, but the pattern is to take the input and create a 4x4 grid where each row is the input row reversed, and then add a new row of 2s. But this is just a hypothesis.\n\nGiven that the examples show that reversing each row is the pattern, I will proceed with that. Even though the test input is 3x3, the function is supposed to return a 4x4 grid. So perhaps the function is to reverse each row and then add a row of 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut the problem statement says that the function must return a 4x4 grid, and the examples show that for 4x4 inputs, it's the same. So perhaps the function is to reverse each row, and if the input is not 4x4, then it's padded with 2s to make it 4x4.\n\nBut this is not clear. However, given the examples, the most logical transformation is to reverse each row.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    return [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n\nBut this would return a grid of the same size as the input. But the problem says that the output must be 4x4. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut perhaps the problem statement is wrong, and the function is supposed to return the same size as the input. Or perhaps the test input is 3x3, but the output is 4x4, and the pattern is different.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the row reversal, as it fits the training examples, and assume that the test input is part of the training examples, but the problem statement is incorrect.\n\nSo, the final code would be to reverse each row.\n"
