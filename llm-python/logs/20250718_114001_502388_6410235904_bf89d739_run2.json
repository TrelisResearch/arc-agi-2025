There's a pattern where certain cells (like the 2s in the input) get transformed into sequences of 2s and 3s in the output\n4. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"expansion\" or \"propagation\" of values\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Expands 2s into sequences of 2s and 3s\n- Propagates values to neighboring cells\n- Maintains the 19x13 output size\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

The transformation seems to involve expanding or modifying certain cells based on their position and value\n3. There's a pattern where certain cells (like the 2s in the input) get transformed into sequences of 2s and 3s in the output\n4. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"expansion\" or \"propagation\" of values\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Expands 2s into sequences of 2s and 3s\n- Propagates values to neighboring cells\n- Maintains the 19x13 output size\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 19x13 output grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(19)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(19):\n        for col in range(13):\n            #
