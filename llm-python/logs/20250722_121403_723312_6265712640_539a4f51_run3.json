          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the output grid seems to be a repetition of the input grid's rows, but with some transformation. For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows of the input are repeated in the output, but with some changes in the last few columns.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n1. The output grid is always 10x10\n2. The first few rows of the output seem to be repetitions of the input rows\n3. There's a pattern where the last few columns of the output are filled with a specific value (like 2 or 3)\n4. There's a pattern where the bottom rows of the output are filled with a specific value (like 2 or 3)\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Repeats the input rows in the output\n- Fills the last few columns with a specific value (like 2 or 3)\n- Fills the bottom rows with a specific value (like 2 or 3)\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Copy the input rows to the top of the output grid\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill the last few columns with a specific value (2 or 3)\n    # This is based on observing the examples where the last few columns are filled with 2 or 3\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5, 10):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Fill the bottom rows with a specific value (2 or 3)\n    # This is based on observing the examples where the bottom rows are filled with 2 or 3\n    for i in range(5, 10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Copy the input rows to the top of the output grid\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill the last few columns with a specific value (2 or 3)\n    # This is based on observing the examples where the last few columns are filled with 2 or 3\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5, 10):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Fill the bottom rows with a specific value (2 or 3)\n    # This is based on observing the examples where the bottom rows are filled with 2 or 3\n    for i in range(5, 10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

For example, in Example 1, the first 5 rows of the input are repeated in the output, but with some changes in the last few columns.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n1. The output grid is always 10x10\n2. The first few rows of the output seem to be repetitions of the input rows\n3. There's a pattern where the last few columns of the output are filled with a specific value (like 2 or 3)\n4. There's a pattern where the bottom rows of the output are filled with a specific value (like 2 or 3)\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Repeats the input rows in the output\n- Fills the last few columns with a specific value (like 2 or 3)\n- Fills the bottom rows with a specific value (like 2 or 3)\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Copy the input rows to the top of the output grid\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill the last few columns with a specific value (2 or 3)\n    # This is based on observing the examples where the last few columns are filled with 2 or 3\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5, 10):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Fill the bottom rows with a specific value (2 or 3)\n    # This is based on observing the examples where the bottom rows are filled with 2 or 3\n    for i in range(5, 10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Copy the input rows to the top of the output grid\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Fill the last few columns with a specific value (2 or 3)\n    # This is based on observing the examples where the last few columns are filled with 2 or 3\n    for i in range(5):\n        for j in range(5, 10):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Fill the bottom rows with a specific value (2 or 3)\n    # This is based on observing the examples where the bottom rows are filled with 2 or 3\n    for i in range(5, 10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
