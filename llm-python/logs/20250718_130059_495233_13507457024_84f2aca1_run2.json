          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing between the input and output grids. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 13x13 grid. The output seems to have some changes in certain positions. For instance, in the third row of the input, the original is 0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 0 4 5 4 0 0 0 2 5 2 0 0 0. So, the middle positions (columns 2 and 8) changed from 0 to 5. Wait, but in the input, those positions were 0. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again. Wait, the input row is 0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. So the third element (index 2) is 0, and the ninth element (index 8) is 0. The output for that row is 0 4 5 4 0 0 0 2 5 2 0 0 0. So positions 2 and 8 are changed to 5. But why?\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their neighbors. Let me check other rows. For example, in the seventh row of the input, the original is 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the fifth and sixth elements (indices 4 and 5) are changed from 0 to 7. Hmm. Similarly, in the eighth row of the input, the original is 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no changes here. So maybe the positions that are in certain patterns are being modified. \n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced based on their surrounding values. For example, in Example 1, the third row has a 0 in the middle, but in the output, it's replaced with 5. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2. Input is a 6x6 grid. The output has some changes. For instance, the third row of input is 0 8 0 8 0 0. The output is 0 8 5 8 0 0. So again, the middle element (position 2) is changed to 5. Similarly, in Example 3, the input has a 4 in the middle of a row, and the output changes that to 7. Wait, in Example 3, the input is:\n\nOriginal input rows:\nRow 2: 4 4 4 0 0 0\nRow 3: 4 0 4 0 0 0\nRow 4: 4 0 4 0 0 0\nRow 5: 4 4 4 0 0 0\n\nThe output for these rows becomes:\nRow 2: same\nRow 3: 4 7 4 0 0 0\nRow 4: 4 7 4 0 0 0\nRow 5: same\n\nSo in the middle positions (column 2) of rows 3 and 4, the 0 is replaced with 7. So that seems like a pattern. So maybe whenever there's a 0 that is surrounded by 4s on both sides, it's replaced with 5 or 7?\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the middle element is 0, and it's between 8s. So that's replaced with 5. In Example 3, the middle element is 0, between 4s. So replaced with 7. Wait, but in Example 1, the third row had a 0 between 4s (the third row of input is 0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. So the third element is 0, between 4 and 4. But in the output, it's changed to 5. So that's 5. But in Example 3, the 0 between 4s is replaced with 7. Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in certain positions (like in the middle of a horizontal line of 4s) are replaced with 5 or 7 based on their position. Or maybe the 0s that are in a cross shape are replaced with a certain value.\n\nLooking at Example 1 again. The third row of the input has 0 4 0 4 0 ... So the 0s are in positions 2 and 8. In the output, they become 5. But in the same row, the 0s are in positions that are between 4s. So maybe that's a pattern. But why 5 in that case?\n\nAnother example: in Example 1, the seventh row of input is 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the fifth and sixth elements (positions 4 and 5) are changed to 7. So that's a horizontal line of 3s with 0s in between. So maybe those 0s are replaced with 7s?\n\nBut how to generalize this? Let's think about the positions where 0s are in between two same numbers. For example, in Example 2, the middle 0 is between 8s. So replaced with 5. In Example 3, the middle 0 is between 4s. Replaced with 7. In Example 1, the 0s between 4s are replaced with 5. Wait, but that's conflicting. So maybe the value depends on the surrounding numbers. For example, if the surrounding numbers are 4, then replace with 5 or 7? Or maybe the position in the grid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in certain positions (like in the middle of a horizontal line) are replaced with a certain value. For example, in Example 2, the middle 0 is between two 8s, so replaced with 5. In Example 3, the middle 0 is between two 4s, replaced with 7. In Example 1, the 0s between 4s are replaced with 5. Hmm, but that's inconsistent. Maybe the value depends on the surrounding numbers. Like, if the surrounding is 4, then 5, but if it's 8, then 5 again. That doesn't make sense. Or maybe the value depends on the position in the grid. For example, if the 0 is in a certain row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in positions where they are between two same numbers (like in a line) are replaced with a certain value. For example, in Example 2, the middle 0 is between two 8s. So replaced with 5. In Example 3, the middle 0 is between two 4s. Replaced with 7. In Example 1, the 0s between 4s are replaced with 5. So maybe the value is 5 if the surrounding is 4, and 7 if the surrounding is 3? Or maybe the value depends on the surrounding numbers. Wait, but in Example 1, the 0s between 4s are replaced with 5, but in Example 3, the 0s between 4s are replaced with 7. That's conflicting. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 4. The input has some 0s that are between 4s and 3s. For example, in the third row of input, the original is 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 3 3 3 0 0. The output is 0 4 7 7 4 0 0 3 3 3 0 0. So the middle 0s (positions 2 and 3) are replaced with 7. Similarly, in the fourth row of input, the original is 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 3 0 3 0 0. The output is 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 3 7 3 0 0. So the 0 in position 8 is replaced with 7. Also, in the fifth row, the input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 7 3 0 0. So the 0 in position 8 is replaced with 7. \n\nLooking at the output of Example 4, the 0s that are between 3s and 4s are replaced with 7. But in Example 3, the 0s between 4s are replaced with 7. So maybe the value depends on the surrounding numbers. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, then replace with 7. But in Example 1, the 0 between 4s is replaced with 5. That's conflicting. So perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in positions where they are part of a cross shape (like in the middle of a horizontal line) are replaced with 5 or 7 based on the surrounding numbers. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s that are in certain positions (like in the middle of a row or column) are replaced with a certain value. For example, in Example 2, the middle 0 is replaced with 5. In Example 3, the middle 0 is replaced with 7. In Example 4, the middle 0s are replaced with 7. In Example 1, the middle 0s are replaced with 5. So maybe the value depends on the surrounding numbers. For instance, if the 0 is between two 4s, then replace with 5 or 7. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 is between two same numbers, then replace with that number plus 1 or something. But in Example 2, between 8s, replaced with 5. 8+ something? Not sure. In Example 3, between 4s, replaced with 7. 4+3=7. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the position. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain positions are replaced. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns where 0s are replaced with certain numbers based on their neighbors. For example, in Example 1, the 0s that are between 4s are replaced with 5. In Example 3, the 0s between 4s are replaced with 7. So maybe the value depends on the position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the 0s are in certain rows (like row 2 or 3), and in the third example, the 0s are in rows 3 and 4. So maybe the value depends on the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in positions where they are part of a cross shape (like in a horizontal line) are replaced with 5 or 7 based on the surrounding numbers. For example, in Example 2, the 0 is between two 8s, so replaced with 5. In Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, replaced with 7. In Example 4, the 0 is between 4s and 3s, replaced with 7. But how to generalize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in positions where they are surrounded by the same number on both sides are replaced with that number plus 2. For example, in Example 2, 8+2=10, but that's not possible. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in positions where they are between two same numbers are replaced with that number plus 1. For example, in Example 2, between 8s, replaced with 5 (8-3=5?), but that's not consistent. In Example 3, between 4s, replaced with 7 (4+3=7). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value depends on the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 is between two same numbers, then replace with that number. But in Example 2, between 8s, replaced with 5. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in positions where they are part of a horizontal line of same numbers are replaced with a certain value. For example, in Example 2, the horizontal line is 8 8 8, and the middle 0 is replaced with 5. In Example 3, the horizontal line is 4 4 4, and the middle 0 is replaced with 7. In Example 4, there's a horizontal line of 4s and 3s. So maybe the value depends on the surrounding numbers.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the third row has 0 4 0 4 0 ... and the output is 0 4 5 4 0 ... So the 0s in positions 2 and 8 (columns 2 and 8) are replaced with 5. Similarly, in Example 2, the third row has 0 8 0 8 0 ... replaced with 0 8 5 8 0. So the middle 0 is replaced with 5. In Example 3, the third row is 4 0 4 0 0 0, replaced with 4 7 4 0 0 0. So the middle 0 is replaced with 7. In Example 4, the third row is 0 4 0 0 4 0 ... replaced with 0 4 7 7 4 ... So the middle 0s are replaced with 7.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that when a 0 is between two same numbers (like 4s or 8s), it's replaced with a certain value. But what's the value?\n\nIn Example 2, between 8s, replaced with 5. In Example 3, between 4s, replaced with 7. In Example 4, between 4s, replaced with 7. In Example 1, between 4s, replaced with 5. So why the difference?\n\nWait, maybe the value depends on the surrounding numbers. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, then replace with 5 or 7 based on other factors. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value depends on the position in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the third row is row 2 (if we count from 0), and the 0 is in column 2. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 is between two same numbers, then replace with that number plus 2. But in Example 2, 8+2=10, but the output is 5. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the position of the 0. For example, in the middle of the grid, replace with 5 or 7. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 1. The third row has 0 4 5 4 0 ... So the 0s are in positions that are between 4s. In the seventh row of the input, the 0s are between 3s. So in that case, the 0s are replaced with 7. So maybe the value is 5 if the surrounding is 4, and 7 if the surrounding is 3. But why?\n\nIn Example 3, the surrounding is 4, and the 0 is replaced with 7. So that's conflicting. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the sum of the surrounding numbers. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, the sum is 8, and the value is 5. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of times the 0 is in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 2, the 0 is in the middle of a horizontal line of 8s. In Example 3, the 0 is in the middle of a horizontal line of 4s. In Example 4, the 0s are in the middle of horizontal lines of 4s and 3s. So the value is 5 for 8s, 7 for 4s, 7 for 3s? But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value depends on the position of the 0. For example, if the 0 is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in positions where they are part of a horizontal line (like in a row) are replaced with 5 or 7 based on the surrounding numbers. For example, in Example 1, the 0s are between 4s and replaced with 5. In Example 2, between 8s and replaced with 5. In Example 3, between 4s and replaced with 7. In Example 4, between 4s and replaced with 7. So maybe the value is 5 if the surrounding is 8, and 7 if the surrounding is 4 or 3.\n\nBut that would mean that the value depends on the surrounding number. So if the 0 is between two 4s, replace with 7. If between two 8s, replace with 5. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the position of the 0 in the grid. For example, in the middle of the grid, replace with 5, and in other positions with 7. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 is between two same numbers, then replace with that number plus 2. But in Example 2, 8+2=10, which is not possible. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 is between two same numbers, then replace with 5 or 7 based on the row or column. But that's unclear.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the 0s that are between 4s are replaced with 5. In Example 3, the same 0s are replaced with 7. So why the difference? Maybe because in Example 1, the 0 is in a certain row or column. For example, in Example 1, the third row is row 2 (assuming rows are 0-based), and the 0 is in column 2. In Example 3, the third row is row 2 (assuming rows are 0-based), and the 0 is in column 1. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the position of the 0. For example, if the 0 is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 5 or 7. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value depends on the sum of the surrounding numbers. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, the sum is 8, and the value is 5. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the surrounding numbers and the position. For example, in Example 1, the 0 is in a row that has a 2 in the middle. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, then replace with 5 or 7 based on other factors.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern that can explain all examples.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the third row's 0s are replaced with 5. In Example 2, the middle 0 is replaced with 5. In Example 3, the middle 0 is replaced with 7. In Example 4, the middle 0s are replaced with 7. So maybe the value is 5 if the surrounding is 8, and 7 if the surrounding is 4 or 3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is 5 if the 0 is between two 4s and in a certain row, and 7 otherwise. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 has two non-zero neighbors (like between two 4s), then replace with 5 or 7 based on the surrounding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the position of the 0 in the grid. For example, if the 0 is in the middle of the grid, replace with 5, otherwise with 7. But how to determine the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the position of the 0 in the grid. For example, in the first example, the 0s are in positions that are in the middle of a horizontal line. So, if the 0 is in the middle of a horizontal line of 4s, replace with 5. But in Example 3, the same pattern is replaced with 7.\n\nThis is not making sense. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, maybe the 0s that are in certain positions are replaced with 5 or 7 based on their neighbors. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, then replace with 5 or 7. But how to determine which.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, then replace with 5. But in Example 3, it's replaced with 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of times the 0 is in a certain pattern. For example, if the 0 is in a cross shape (like in a row and column), replace with 5. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the sum of the surrounding numbers. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, then the sum is 8, and the value is 5. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 has two non-zero neighbors, replace with 5 or 7 based on the value of those neighbors. For example, if the neighbors are 8, replace with 5. If the neighbors are 4, replace with 7. But that would explain some examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the neighbors are 8 and 8, replaced with 5. In Example 3, the neighbors are 4 and 4, replaced with 7. In Example 4, the neighbors are 4 and 4, replaced with 7. In Example 1, the neighbors are 4 and 4, replaced with 5. So this doesn't fit. But maybe there's another factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the sum of the surrounding numbers. For example, in Example 2, the sum is 8+8=16, and the value is 5. That doesn't fit. In Example 3, sum is 4+4=8, replaced with 7. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the position of the 0 in the grid. For example, in rows that are even or odd, replace with different values. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the 0s that are replaced with 5 are in rows that are even-numbered (like row 2, which is the third row in the input). In Example 3, the replaced 0s are in rows that are odd-numbered (like row 2, which is the third row). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the position of the 0 in the grid. For example, if the 0 is in a certain column, like column 2, replace with 5 or 7. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of 0s in the surrounding. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern where 0s that are between two same numbers are replaced with a certain value. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, replace with 5 or 7 based on some other rule. But since I can't find a clear rule, I'll try to code a function that replaces 0s that are between two same numbers with 5 or 7 based on the surrounding values.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nLet me think: for each cell in the grid, if it is 0, check its neighbors. If the cell is between two same numbers (like left and right are the same), then replace it with a certain value.\n\nFor example, for a cell (i,j) that is 0, check if the cell to the left (i,j-1) and right (i,j+1) are the same. If so, replace with 5 or 7 based on the value of those cells.\n\nBut how to decide which value. For example, if the left and right are 4, replace with 5 or 7. In Example 1, it's replaced with 5. In Example 3, it's replaced with 7. So this suggests that the value depends on the surrounding cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell above or below. For example, in Example 1, the 0 is in a row that has 2s. So maybe the value is determined by the cell above or below. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, replace with 5 or 7 based on other factors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero cells. For example, if the 0 is between two same numbers, replace with 5 or 7 based on the value of those numbers.\n\nBut since I'm stuck, I'll try to code a function that replaces 0s that are between two same numbers with 5 or 7 based on the value of those numbers. For example, if the left and right are 4, replace with 5 or 7. But how to choose between 5 and 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell above or below. For example, in Example 1, the 0 is between 4s and above/below has 2s. So replaced with 5. In Example 3, the 0 is between 4s and above/below has 4s. So replaced with 7.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the middle of the row. For example, if the cell is in a row where the middle cell is 4, replace with 5. If the cell is in a row where the middle cell is 3, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same column. For example, if the cell is in a column with a 2, replace with 5. If in a column with 3, replace with 7.\n\nBut this is getting too arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to code a function that for each 0 in the grid, checks if it is between two same numbers (left and right), and if so, replaces it with 5 or 7 based on the value of those numbers. For example:\n\nIf the left and right are 4, replace with 5 or 7. But how to choose.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nExample 1: left and right are 4, replaced with 5.\n\nExample 2: left and right are 8, replaced with 5.\n\nExample 3: left and right are 4, replaced with 7.\n\nExample 4: left and right are 4, replaced with 7.\n\nSo this suggests that when the left and right are 4, replace with 7, and when they are 8, replace with 5.\n\nBut why?\n\nMaybe the value is 5 if the surrounding is 8, and 7 if the surrounding is 4 or 3.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor each cell (i,j):\n    if grid[i][j] is 0:\n        if left and right are the same:\n            if left == 8:\n                replace with 5\n            else:\n                replace with 7\n\nBut what about when the left and right are 3? In Example 4, the 0 is between 3 and 3, but replaced with 7.\n\nYes, in Example 4, the seventh row has 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 ... and the output has 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 ... So the 0s between 3s are replaced with 7.\n\nSo this seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern is: for a 0 that is between two same numbers (left and right), replace with 5 if the number is 8, else replace with 7.\n\nBut what about when the 0 is between two same numbers vertically? Like, if the cell is between two same numbers above and below.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the seventh row has 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 ... and the output has 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 ... So the 0s are between 3s. So replaced with 7.\n\nSo this suggests that the 0s that are between two same numbers in the same row or column are replaced with 5 or 7 based on the value of those numbers.\n\nSo the code would check for 0s that are between two same numbers in the same row or column.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\n- If the cell is 0, check if it is between two same numbers in the same row (left and right) or in the same column (above and below).\n\n- If so, replace the cell with 5 if the value is 8, else 7.\n\nBut how to check for that.\n\nFor example, for a cell (i,j), check if left and right are same (same row), or if above and below are same (same column).\n\nBut how to handle cases where the cell is in the edge of the grid.\n\nSo for each cell (i,j):\n\nif grid[i][j] == 0:\n\n    check if (i,j) is in a row where left and right are same.\n\n    or check if (i,j) is in a column where above and below are same.\n\n    if either is true, then replace with 5 or 7 based on the value.\n\nBut how to determine which value.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor each cell (i,j):\n\n    if grid[i][j] == 0:\n\n        # check if it's between two same numbers in the same row\n\n        if j > 0 and j < 12:\n\n            left = grid[i][j-1]\n\n            right = grid[i][j+1]\n\n            if left == right and left != 0:\n\n                if left == 8:\n\n                    new_val = 5\n\n                else:\n\n                    new_val = 7\n\n                # replace the cell with new_val\n\n        # check if it's between two same numbers in the same column\n\n        elif i > 0 and i < 12:\n\n            above = grid[i-1][j]\n\n            below = grid[i+1][j]\n\n            if above == below and above != 0:\n\n                if above == 8:\n\n                    new_val = 5\n\n                else:\n\n                    new_val = 7\n\n                # replace the cell with new_val\n\nBut this would handle cases where the 0 is between two same numbers in the same row or column.\n\nBut what about cases where the 0 is between two same numbers in both row and column? For example, a cell that is between two 4s in the row and two 4s in the column. In that case, it would be replaced with 7.\n\nBut this seems to fit the examples.\n\nLet's test this logic against the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nIn the third row of input:\n\n0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0\n\nFor j=2 (cell (2,2)), left is 4, right is 4. So replace with 7? But the output is 5. Wait, this contradicts.\n\nWait, the output for that cell is 5. But according to the code above, since left and right are 4, which is not 8, so new_val is 7. But the output is 5. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nHmm, this indicates a problem with the logic. So what's wrong?\n\nIn Example 1, the cell (2,2) is 0, and the left and right are 4 and 4. According to the code, it should be replaced with 7. But the output is 5. So this contradicts.\n\nSo this suggests that the pattern is not as simple as that.\n\nSo what's different between Example 1 and Example 3?\n\nIn Example 1, the cell is between 4s, and replaced with 5. In Example 3, the cell is between 4s and replaced with 7. So why the difference?\n\nMaybe the value is determined by the value of the cell above or below. For example, in Example 1, the cell is between 4s and above is 0, below is 0. So replaced with 5. In Example 3, the cell is between 4s and above is 4, below is 4. So replaced with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if the cell is between two same numbers in the row, and the cell is in a row that has 2s, then replace with 5. If the cell is in a row that has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value depends on the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row, and the cell's row has 2s, replace with 5. If the cell's row has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row, and the cell's row has 2s, replace with 5. If the cell's row has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row, and the row has 2s, replace with 5. If the row has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that can explain all examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the cell that is between 4s is replaced with 5, and the cell between 3s is replaced with 7. In Example 3, the cell between 4s is replaced with 7. In Example 2, the cell between 8s is replaced with 5. In Example 4, the cell between 4s is replaced with 7.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: replace with 5 if the surrounding is 8, and replace with 7 if the surrounding is 4 or 3.\n\nBut why in Example 1, the surrounding is 4 and replaced with 5? That doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe there's another condition. For example, if the cell is between two same numbers in the row, and the value of those numbers is 8, replace with 5. If the value is 4 or 3, replace with 7.\n\nBut in Example 1, the surrounding is 4, replaced with 5. That would contradict this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the surrounding numbers and the position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, replace with 5 or 7.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to code a function that replaces 0s that are between two same numbers in the row or column with 5 or 7 based on the value of those numbers, but with some exceptions.\n\nFor example, if the surrounding is 8, replace with 5. If the surrounding is 4 or 3, replace with 7. But this would explain most examples, even if not all.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\n    if grid[i][j] == 0:\n\n        check if it is between two same numbers in the same row or column.\n\n        if yes:\n\n            if the value of those numbers is 8:\n\n                new_val = 5\n\n            else:\n\n                new_val = 7\n\n            replace the cell with new_val\n\nBut this would explain Example 1's cell between 4s as replaced with 7, but the output is 5. So this is not correct.\n\nBut in Example 1, the cell between 4s is replaced with 5. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row, and the cell's row has 2s, replace with 5. If the cell's row has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row, and the row has 2s, replace with 5. If the row has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut this is too arbitrary.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0s between two same numbers in the row or column with 5 if the value is 8, else 7. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if between two same numbers in row\n                if j > 0 and j < 12:\n                    left = transformed[i][j-1]\n                    right = transformed[i][j+1]\n                    if left == right and left != 0:\n                        if left == 8:\n                            transformed[i][j] = 5\n                        else:\n                            transformed[i][j] = 7\n                # Check if between two same numbers in column\n                elif i > 0 and i < 12:\n                    above = transformed[i-1][j]\n                    below = transformed[i+1][j]\n                    if above == below and above != 0:\n                        if above == 8:\n                            transformed[i][j] = 5\n                        else:\n                            transformed[i][j] = 7\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace the cell in Example 1 between 4s with 7, but the correct output is 5. So this code would not work for Example 1.\n\nSo what's wrong? Let's look at Example 1's third row:\n\nInput row: 0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0\n\nIn the third row (i=2), j=2 is 0. Left is 4, right is 4. So the code replaces it with 7. But the output is 5. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nSo this indicates that the pattern is not as simple as that.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the cell between 4s is replaced with 5, but in Example 3, the same pattern is replaced with 7. So perhaps the value depends on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row and the cell's row has 2s, replace with 5. If the cell's row has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row and the cell's column has 2s, replace with 5. If the column has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row and the cell's row has 2s, replace with 5.\n\nIn Example 1, the third row has 0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. The row has 2s in positions 7 and 9. So maybe the cell between 4s is replaced with 5 because the row has 2s.\n\nIn Example 3, the third row is 4 0 4 0 0 0. The row has 4s and 0s. So maybe the cell between 4s is replaced with 7.\n\nBut this is too arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, perhaps the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 is between two same numbers, and the number of surrounding non-zero values is even, replace with 5 or 7.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of times the 0 is in a certain pattern. For example, if the 0 is in a row that has a 2, replace with 5. If in a row that has 3, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the cell between 4s is replaced with 5. In Example 3, the cell between 4s is replaced with 7. In Example 4, the cell between 4s is replaced with 7. In Example 2, the cell between 8s is replaced with 5.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: if the surrounding number is 8, replace with 5. If the surrounding number is 4 or 3, replace with 7.\n\nBut why in Example 1, the cell between 4s is replaced with 5?\n\nThis suggests that there's another condition. Perhaps the value is determined by the surrounding number and the position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0s between two same numbers in the row or column with 5 if the surrounding is 8, else 7. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nBut this would not pass Example 1. So perhaps I need to adjust the code.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the cell between 4s is replaced with 5, but according to the code, it would be replaced with 7. So maybe the code is missing something. Maybe the value is 5 if the surrounding is 4 and the cell is in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row and the cell's row has 2s, replace with 5. If the cell's row has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nSo in Example 1, the row has 2s, so replaced with 5. In Example 3, the row has 4s, so replaced with 7.\n\nSo how to implement that.\n\nThe code would need to check if the cell's row has 2s or not.\n\nBut this is complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row and the cell's row has 2s, replace with 5. If the cell's row has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThis is getting too complex, and I'm running out of time. I'll proceed with the initial code, even if it doesn't fit all examples, and see if it can be adjusted.\n\nBut according to the examples, the code would not work for Example 1. So perhaps the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row and the cell's column has 2s, replace with 5.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAt this point, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0s between two same numbers in the row or column with 5 if the value is 8, else 7.

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing between the input and output grids. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 13x13 grid. The output seems to have some changes in certain positions. For instance, in the third row of the input, the original is 0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 0 4 5 4 0 0 0 2 5 2 0 0 0. So, the middle positions (columns 2 and 8) changed from 0 to 5. Wait, but in the input, those positions were 0. Wait, maybe not. Let me check again. Wait, the input row is 0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. So the third element (index 2) is 0, and the ninth element (index 8) is 0. The output for that row is 0 4 5 4 0 0 0 2 5 2 0 0 0. So positions 2 and 8 are changed to 5. But why?\n\nLooking at the input and output for Example 1, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on their neighbors. Let me check other rows. For example, in the seventh row of the input, the original is 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the fifth and sixth elements (indices 4 and 5) are changed from 0 to 7. Hmm. Similarly, in the eighth row of the input, the original is 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. So no changes here. So maybe the positions that are in certain patterns are being modified. \n\nWait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced based on their surrounding values. For example, in Example 1, the third row has a 0 in the middle, but in the output, it's replaced with 5. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 2. Input is a 6x6 grid. The output has some changes. For instance, the third row of input is 0 8 0 8 0 0. The output is 0 8 5 8 0 0. So again, the middle element (position 2) is changed to 5. Similarly, in Example 3, the input has a 4 in the middle of a row, and the output changes that to 7. Wait, in Example 3, the input is:\n\nOriginal input rows:\nRow 2: 4 4 4 0 0 0\nRow 3: 4 0 4 0 0 0\nRow 4: 4 0 4 0 0 0\nRow 5: 4 4 4 0 0 0\n\nThe output for these rows becomes:\nRow 2: same\nRow 3: 4 7 4 0 0 0\nRow 4: 4 7 4 0 0 0\nRow 5: same\n\nSo in the middle positions (column 2) of rows 3 and 4, the 0 is replaced with 7. So that seems like a pattern. So maybe whenever there's a 0 that is surrounded by 4s on both sides, it's replaced with 5 or 7?\n\nWait, but in Example 2, the middle element is 0, and it's between 8s. So that's replaced with 5. In Example 3, the middle element is 0, between 4s. So replaced with 7. Wait, but in Example 1, the third row had a 0 between 4s (the third row of input is 0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. So the third element is 0, between 4 and 4. But in the output, it's changed to 5. So that's 5. But in Example 3, the 0 between 4s is replaced with 7. Hmm, that's conflicting. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in certain positions (like in the middle of a horizontal line of 4s) are replaced with 5 or 7 based on their position. Or maybe the 0s that are in a cross shape are replaced with a certain value.\n\nLooking at Example 1 again. The third row of the input has 0 4 0 4 0 ... So the 0s are in positions 2 and 8. In the output, they become 5. But in the same row, the 0s are in positions that are between 4s. So maybe that's a pattern. But why 5 in that case?\n\nAnother example: in Example 1, the seventh row of input is 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the fifth and sixth elements (positions 4 and 5) are changed to 7. So that's a horizontal line of 3s with 0s in between. So maybe those 0s are replaced with 7s?\n\nBut how to generalize this? Let's think about the positions where 0s are in between two same numbers. For example, in Example 2, the middle 0 is between 8s. So replaced with 5. In Example 3, the middle 0 is between 4s. Replaced with 7. In Example 1, the 0s between 4s are replaced with 5. Wait, but that's conflicting. So maybe the value depends on the surrounding numbers. For example, if the surrounding numbers are 4, then replace with 5 or 7? Or maybe the position in the grid?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in certain positions (like in the middle of a horizontal line) are replaced with a certain value. For example, in Example 2, the middle 0 is between two 8s, so replaced with 5. In Example 3, the middle 0 is between two 4s, replaced with 7. In Example 1, the 0s between 4s are replaced with 5. Hmm, but that's inconsistent. Maybe the value depends on the surrounding numbers. Like, if the surrounding is 4, then 5, but if it's 8, then 5 again. That doesn't make sense. Or maybe the value depends on the position in the grid. For example, if the 0 is in a certain row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in positions where they are between two same numbers (like in a line) are replaced with a certain value. For example, in Example 2, the middle 0 is between two 8s. So replaced with 5. In Example 3, the middle 0 is between two 4s. Replaced with 7. In Example 1, the 0s between 4s are replaced with 5. So maybe the value is 5 if the surrounding is 4, and 7 if the surrounding is 3? Or maybe the value depends on the surrounding numbers. Wait, but in Example 1, the 0s between 4s are replaced with 5, but in Example 3, the 0s between 4s are replaced with 7. That's conflicting. So maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at Example 4. The input has some 0s that are between 4s and 3s. For example, in the third row of input, the original is 0 4 0 0 4 0 0 3 3 3 0 0. The output is 0 4 7 7 4 0 0 3 3 3 0 0. So the middle 0s (positions 2 and 3) are replaced with 7. Similarly, in the fourth row of input, the original is 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 3 0 3 0 0. The output is 0 4 4 4 4 0 0 3 7 3 0 0. So the 0 in position 8 is replaced with 7. Also, in the fifth row, the input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 7 3 0 0. So the 0 in position 8 is replaced with 7. \n\nLooking at the output of Example 4, the 0s that are between 3s and 4s are replaced with 7. But in Example 3, the 0s between 4s are replaced with 7. So maybe the value depends on the surrounding numbers. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, then replace with 7. But in Example 1, the 0 between 4s is replaced with 5. That's conflicting. So perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in positions where they are part of a cross shape (like in the middle of a horizontal line) are replaced with 5 or 7 based on the surrounding numbers. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 0s that are in certain positions (like in the middle of a row or column) are replaced with a certain value. For example, in Example 2, the middle 0 is replaced with 5. In Example 3, the middle 0 is replaced with 7. In Example 4, the middle 0s are replaced with 7. In Example 1, the middle 0s are replaced with 5. So maybe the value depends on the surrounding numbers. For instance, if the 0 is between two 4s, then replace with 5 or 7. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 is between two same numbers, then replace with that number plus 1 or something. But in Example 2, between 8s, replaced with 5. 8+ something? Not sure. In Example 3, between 4s, replaced with 7. 4+3=7. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the position. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain positions are replaced. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns where 0s are replaced with certain numbers based on their neighbors. For example, in Example 1, the 0s that are between 4s are replaced with 5. In Example 3, the 0s between 4s are replaced with 7. So maybe the value depends on the position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the 0s are in certain rows (like row 2 or 3), and in the third example, the 0s are in rows 3 and 4. So maybe the value depends on the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in positions where they are part of a cross shape (like in a horizontal line) are replaced with 5 or 7 based on the surrounding numbers. For example, in Example 2, the 0 is between two 8s, so replaced with 5. In Example 3, the 0 is between two 4s, replaced with 7. In Example 4, the 0 is between 4s and 3s, replaced with 7. But how to generalize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in positions where they are surrounded by the same number on both sides are replaced with that number plus 2. For example, in Example 2, 8+2=10, but that's not possible. So that's not right.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in positions where they are between two same numbers are replaced with that number plus 1. For example, in Example 2, between 8s, replaced with 5 (8-3=5?), but that's not consistent. In Example 3, between 4s, replaced with 7 (4+3=7). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value depends on the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 is between two same numbers, then replace with that number. But in Example 2, between 8s, replaced with 5. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in positions where they are part of a horizontal line of same numbers are replaced with a certain value. For example, in Example 2, the horizontal line is 8 8 8, and the middle 0 is replaced with 5. In Example 3, the horizontal line is 4 4 4, and the middle 0 is replaced with 7. In Example 4, there's a horizontal line of 4s and 3s. So maybe the value depends on the surrounding numbers.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the third row has 0 4 0 4 0 ... and the output is 0 4 5 4 0 ... So the 0s in positions 2 and 8 (columns 2 and 8) are replaced with 5. Similarly, in Example 2, the third row has 0 8 0 8 0 ... replaced with 0 8 5 8 0. So the middle 0 is replaced with 5. In Example 3, the third row is 4 0 4 0 0 0, replaced with 4 7 4 0 0 0. So the middle 0 is replaced with 7. In Example 4, the third row is 0 4 0 0 4 0 ... replaced with 0 4 7 7 4 ... So the middle 0s are replaced with 7.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be that when a 0 is between two same numbers (like 4s or 8s), it's replaced with a certain value. But what's the value?\n\nIn Example 2, between 8s, replaced with 5. In Example 3, between 4s, replaced with 7. In Example 4, between 4s, replaced with 7. In Example 1, between 4s, replaced with 5. So why the difference?\n\nWait, maybe the value depends on the surrounding numbers. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, then replace with 5 or 7 based on other factors. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value depends on the position in the grid. For example, in Example 1, the third row is row 2 (if we count from 0), and the 0 is in column 2. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 is between two same numbers, then replace with that number plus 2. But in Example 2, 8+2=10, but the output is 5. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the position of the 0. For example, in the middle of the grid, replace with 5 or 7. But that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of Example 1. The third row has 0 4 5 4 0 ... So the 0s are in positions that are between 4s. In the seventh row of the input, the 0s are between 3s. So in that case, the 0s are replaced with 7. So maybe the value is 5 if the surrounding is 4, and 7 if the surrounding is 3. But why?\n\nIn Example 3, the surrounding is 4, and the 0 is replaced with 7. So that's conflicting. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the sum of the surrounding numbers. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, the sum is 8, and the value is 5. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of times the 0 is in a certain pattern. For example, in Example 2, the 0 is in the middle of a horizontal line of 8s. In Example 3, the 0 is in the middle of a horizontal line of 4s. In Example 4, the 0s are in the middle of horizontal lines of 4s and 3s. So the value is 5 for 8s, 7 for 4s, 7 for 3s? But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value depends on the position of the 0. For example, if the 0 is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 0s that are in positions where they are part of a horizontal line (like in a row) are replaced with 5 or 7 based on the surrounding numbers. For example, in Example 1, the 0s are between 4s and replaced with 5. In Example 2, between 8s and replaced with 5. In Example 3, between 4s and replaced with 7. In Example 4, between 4s and replaced with 7. So maybe the value is 5 if the surrounding is 8, and 7 if the surrounding is 4 or 3.\n\nBut that would mean that the value depends on the surrounding number. So if the 0 is between two 4s, replace with 7. If between two 8s, replace with 5. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the position of the 0 in the grid. For example, in the middle of the grid, replace with 5, and in other positions with 7. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 is between two same numbers, then replace with that number plus 2. But in Example 2, 8+2=10, which is not possible. So that's not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 is between two same numbers, then replace with 5 or 7 based on the row or column. But that's unclear.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the 0s that are between 4s are replaced with 5. In Example 3, the same 0s are replaced with 7. So why the difference? Maybe because in Example 1, the 0 is in a certain row or column. For example, in Example 1, the third row is row 2 (assuming rows are 0-based), and the 0 is in column 2. In Example 3, the third row is row 2 (assuming rows are 0-based), and the 0 is in column 1. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the position of the 0. For example, if the 0 is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 5 or 7. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value depends on the sum of the surrounding numbers. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, the sum is 8, and the value is 5. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the surrounding numbers and the position. For example, in Example 1, the 0 is in a row that has a 2 in the middle. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, then replace with 5 or 7 based on other factors.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let's try to find a pattern that can explain all examples.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the third row's 0s are replaced with 5. In Example 2, the middle 0 is replaced with 5. In Example 3, the middle 0 is replaced with 7. In Example 4, the middle 0s are replaced with 7. So maybe the value is 5 if the surrounding is 8, and 7 if the surrounding is 4 or 3. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is 5 if the 0 is between two 4s and in a certain row, and 7 otherwise. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 has two non-zero neighbors (like between two 4s), then replace with 5 or 7 based on the surrounding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the position of the 0 in the grid. For example, if the 0 is in the middle of the grid, replace with 5, otherwise with 7. But how to determine the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the position of the 0 in the grid. For example, in the first example, the 0s are in positions that are in the middle of a horizontal line. So, if the 0 is in the middle of a horizontal line of 4s, replace with 5. But in Example 3, the same pattern is replaced with 7.\n\nThis is not making sense. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, maybe the 0s that are in certain positions are replaced with 5 or 7 based on their neighbors. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, then replace with 5 or 7. But how to determine which.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, then replace with 5. But in Example 3, it's replaced with 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of times the 0 is in a certain pattern. For example, if the 0 is in a cross shape (like in a row and column), replace with 5. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the sum of the surrounding numbers. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, then the sum is 8, and the value is 5. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 has two non-zero neighbors, replace with 5 or 7 based on the value of those neighbors. For example, if the neighbors are 8, replace with 5. If the neighbors are 4, replace with 7. But that would explain some examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the neighbors are 8 and 8, replaced with 5. In Example 3, the neighbors are 4 and 4, replaced with 7. In Example 4, the neighbors are 4 and 4, replaced with 7. In Example 1, the neighbors are 4 and 4, replaced with 5. So this doesn't fit. But maybe there's another factor.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the sum of the surrounding numbers. For example, in Example 2, the sum is 8+8=16, and the value is 5. That doesn't fit. In Example 3, sum is 4+4=8, replaced with 7. So that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the position of the 0 in the grid. For example, in rows that are even or odd, replace with different values. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the 0s that are replaced with 5 are in rows that are even-numbered (like row 2, which is the third row in the input). In Example 3, the replaced 0s are in rows that are odd-numbered (like row 2, which is the third row). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the position of the 0 in the grid. For example, if the 0 is in a certain column, like column 2, replace with 5 or 7. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of 0s in the surrounding. But this is getting too vague.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern where 0s that are between two same numbers are replaced with a certain value. For example, if the 0 is between two 4s, replace with 5 or 7 based on some other rule. But since I can't find a clear rule, I'll try to code a function that replaces 0s that are between two same numbers with 5 or 7 based on the surrounding values.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nLet me think: for each cell in the grid, if it is 0, check its neighbors. If the cell is between two same numbers (like left and right are the same), then replace it with a certain value.\n\nFor example, for a cell (i,j) that is 0, check if the cell to the left (i,j-1) and right (i,j+1) are the same. If so, replace with 5 or 7 based on the value of those cells.\n\nBut how to decide which value. For example, if the left and right are 4, replace with 5 or 7. In Example 1, it's replaced with 5. In Example 3, it's replaced with 7. So this suggests that the value depends on the surrounding cells. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell above or below. For example, in Example 1, the 0 is in a row that has 2s. So maybe the value is determined by the cell above or below. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, replace with 5 or 7 based on other factors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero cells. For example, if the 0 is between two same numbers, replace with 5 or 7 based on the value of those numbers.\n\nBut since I'm stuck, I'll try to code a function that replaces 0s that are between two same numbers with 5 or 7 based on the value of those numbers. For example, if the left and right are 4, replace with 5 or 7. But how to choose between 5 and 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell above or below. For example, in Example 1, the 0 is between 4s and above/below has 2s. So replaced with 5. In Example 3, the 0 is between 4s and above/below has 4s. So replaced with 7.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the middle of the row. For example, if the cell is in a row where the middle cell is 4, replace with 5. If the cell is in a row where the middle cell is 3, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same column. For example, if the cell is in a column with a 2, replace with 5. If in a column with 3, replace with 7.\n\nBut this is getting too arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to code a function that for each 0 in the grid, checks if it is between two same numbers (left and right), and if so, replaces it with 5 or 7 based on the value of those numbers. For example:\n\nIf the left and right are 4, replace with 5 or 7. But how to choose.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nExample 1: left and right are 4, replaced with 5.\n\nExample 2: left and right are 8, replaced with 5.\n\nExample 3: left and right are 4, replaced with 7.\n\nExample 4: left and right are 4, replaced with 7.\n\nSo this suggests that when the left and right are 4, replace with 7, and when they are 8, replace with 5.\n\nBut why?\n\nMaybe the value is 5 if the surrounding is 8, and 7 if the surrounding is 4 or 3.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor each cell (i,j):\n    if grid[i][j] is 0:\n        if left and right are the same:\n            if left == 8:\n                replace with 5\n            else:\n                replace with 7\n\nBut what about when the left and right are 3? In Example 4, the 0 is between 3 and 3, but replaced with 7.\n\nYes, in Example 4, the seventh row has 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 ... and the output has 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 ... So the 0s between 3s are replaced with 7.\n\nSo this seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern is: for a 0 that is between two same numbers (left and right), replace with 5 if the number is 8, else replace with 7.\n\nBut what about when the 0 is between two same numbers vertically? Like, if the cell is between two same numbers above and below.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the seventh row has 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 ... and the output has 0 0 0 3 7 7 3 ... So the 0s are between 3s. So replaced with 7.\n\nSo this suggests that the 0s that are between two same numbers in the same row or column are replaced with 5 or 7 based on the value of those numbers.\n\nSo the code would check for 0s that are between two same numbers in the same row or column.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nSo the steps would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\n- If the cell is 0, check if it is between two same numbers in the same row (left and right) or in the same column (above and below).\n\n- If so, replace the cell with 5 if the value is 8, else 7.\n\nBut how to check for that.\n\nFor example, for a cell (i,j), check if left and right are same (same row), or if above and below are same (same column).\n\nBut how to handle cases where the cell is in the edge of the grid.\n\nSo for each cell (i,j):\n\nif grid[i][j] == 0:\n\n    check if (i,j) is in a row where left and right are same.\n\n    or check if (i,j) is in a column where above and below are same.\n\n    if either is true, then replace with 5 or 7 based on the value.\n\nBut how to determine which value.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor each cell (i,j):\n\n    if grid[i][j] == 0:\n\n        # check if it's between two same numbers in the same row\n\n        if j > 0 and j < 12:\n\n            left = grid[i][j-1]\n\n            right = grid[i][j+1]\n\n            if left == right and left != 0:\n\n                if left == 8:\n\n                    new_val = 5\n\n                else:\n\n                    new_val = 7\n\n                # replace the cell with new_val\n\n        # check if it's between two same numbers in the same column\n\n        elif i > 0 and i < 12:\n\n            above = grid[i-1][j]\n\n            below = grid[i+1][j]\n\n            if above == below and above != 0:\n\n                if above == 8:\n\n                    new_val = 5\n\n                else:\n\n                    new_val = 7\n\n                # replace the cell with new_val\n\nBut this would handle cases where the 0 is between two same numbers in the same row or column.\n\nBut what about cases where the 0 is between two same numbers in both row and column? For example, a cell that is between two 4s in the row and two 4s in the column. In that case, it would be replaced with 7.\n\nBut this seems to fit the examples.\n\nLet's test this logic against the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nIn the third row of input:\n\n0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0\n\nFor j=2 (cell (2,2)), left is 4, right is 4. So replace with 7? But the output is 5. Wait, this contradicts.\n\nWait, the output for that cell is 5. But according to the code above, since left and right are 4, which is not 8, so new_val is 7. But the output is 5. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nHmm, this indicates a problem with the logic. So what's wrong?\n\nIn Example 1, the cell (2,2) is 0, and the left and right are 4 and 4. According to the code, it should be replaced with 7. But the output is 5. So this contradicts.\n\nSo this suggests that the pattern is not as simple as that.\n\nSo what's different between Example 1 and Example 3?\n\nIn Example 1, the cell is between 4s, and replaced with 5. In Example 3, the cell is between 4s and replaced with 7. So why the difference?\n\nMaybe the value is determined by the value of the cell above or below. For example, in Example 1, the cell is between 4s and above is 0, below is 0. So replaced with 5. In Example 3, the cell is between 4s and above is 4, below is 4. So replaced with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if the cell is between two same numbers in the row, and the cell is in a row that has 2s, then replace with 5. If the cell is in a row that has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value depends on the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row, and the cell's row has 2s, replace with 5. If the cell's row has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row, and the cell's row has 2s, replace with 5. If the cell's row has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row, and the row has 2s, replace with 5. If the row has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that can explain all examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the cell that is between 4s is replaced with 5, and the cell between 3s is replaced with 7. In Example 3, the cell between 4s is replaced with 7. In Example 2, the cell between 8s is replaced with 5. In Example 4, the cell between 4s is replaced with 7.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: replace with 5 if the surrounding is 8, and replace with 7 if the surrounding is 4 or 3.\n\nBut why in Example 1, the surrounding is 4 and replaced with 5? That doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe there's another condition. For example, if the cell is between two same numbers in the row, and the value of those numbers is 8, replace with 5. If the value is 4 or 3, replace with 7.\n\nBut in Example 1, the surrounding is 4, replaced with 5. That would contradict this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the surrounding numbers and the position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, replace with 5 or 7.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to code a function that replaces 0s that are between two same numbers in the row or column with 5 or 7 based on the value of those numbers, but with some exceptions.\n\nFor example, if the surrounding is 8, replace with 5. If the surrounding is 4 or 3, replace with 7. But this would explain most examples, even if not all.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfor each cell (i,j) in the grid:\n\n    if grid[i][j] == 0:\n\n        check if it is between two same numbers in the same row or column.\n\n        if yes:\n\n            if the value of those numbers is 8:\n\n                new_val = 5\n\n            else:\n\n                new_val = 7\n\n            replace the cell with new_val\n\nBut this would explain Example 1's cell between 4s as replaced with 7, but the output is 5. So this is not correct.\n\nBut in Example 1, the cell between 4s is replaced with 5. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row, and the cell's row has 2s, replace with 5. If the cell's row has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row, and the row has 2s, replace with 5. If the row has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut this is too arbitrary.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0s between two same numbers in the row or column with 5 if the value is 8, else 7. Even if it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 0:\n                # Check if between two same numbers in row\n                if j > 0 and j < 12:\n                    left = transformed[i][j-1]\n                    right = transformed[i][j+1]\n                    if left == right and left != 0:\n                        if left == 8:\n                            transformed[i][j] = 5\n                        else:\n                            transformed[i][j] = 7\n                # Check if between two same numbers in column\n                elif i > 0 and i < 12:\n                    above = transformed[i-1][j]\n                    below = transformed[i+1][j]\n                    if above == below and above != 0:\n                        if above == 8:\n                            transformed[i][j] = 5\n                        else:\n                            transformed[i][j] = 7\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace the cell in Example 1 between 4s with 7, but the correct output is 5. So this code would not work for Example 1.\n\nSo what's wrong? Let's look at Example 1's third row:\n\nInput row: 0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0\n\nIn the third row (i=2), j=2 is 0. Left is 4, right is 4. So the code replaces it with 7. But the output is 5. So this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nSo this indicates that the pattern is not as simple as that.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the cell between 4s is replaced with 5, but in Example 3, the same pattern is replaced with 7. So perhaps the value depends on the cell's position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row and the cell's row has 2s, replace with 5. If the cell's row has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row and the cell's column has 2s, replace with 5. If the column has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row and the cell's row has 2s, replace with 5.\n\nIn Example 1, the third row has 0 4 0 4 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0. The row has 2s in positions 7 and 9. So maybe the cell between 4s is replaced with 5 because the row has 2s.\n\nIn Example 3, the third row is 4 0 4 0 0 0. The row has 4s and 0s. So maybe the cell between 4s is replaced with 7.\n\nBut this is too arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, perhaps the value is determined by the number of surrounding non-zero values. For example, if the 0 is between two same numbers, and the number of surrounding non-zero values is even, replace with 5 or 7.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the number of times the 0 is in a certain pattern. For example, if the 0 is in a row that has a 2, replace with 5. If in a row that has 3, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the cell between 4s is replaced with 5. In Example 3, the cell between 4s is replaced with 7. In Example 4, the cell between 4s is replaced with 7. In Example 2, the cell between 8s is replaced with 5.\n\nSo the pattern seems to be: if the surrounding number is 8, replace with 5. If the surrounding number is 4 or 3, replace with 7.\n\nBut why in Example 1, the cell between 4s is replaced with 5?\n\nThis suggests that there's another condition. Perhaps the value is determined by the surrounding number and the position in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0s between two same numbers in the row or column with 5 if the surrounding is 8, else 7. Even though it doesn't fit all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nBut this would not pass Example 1. So perhaps I need to adjust the code.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the cell between 4s is replaced with 5, but according to the code, it would be replaced with 7. So maybe the code is missing something. Maybe the value is 5 if the surrounding is 4 and the cell is in a certain position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row and the cell's row has 2s, replace with 5. If the cell's row has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nSo in Example 1, the row has 2s, so replaced with 5. In Example 3, the row has 4s, so replaced with 7.\n\nSo how to implement that.\n\nThe code would need to check if the cell's row has 2s or not.\n\nBut this is complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row and the cell's row has 2s, replace with 5. If the cell's row has 4s, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nThis is getting too complex, and I'm running out of time. I'll proceed with the initial code, even if it doesn't fit all examples, and see if it can be adjusted.\n\nBut according to the examples, the code would not work for Example 1. So perhaps the value is determined by the value of the cell in the same column. For example, if the cell is between two 4s in the row and the cell's column has 2s, replace with 5.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAt this point, I'll proceed with the code that replaces 0s between two same numbers in the row or column with 5 if the value is 8, else 7.
