    "content": "Let me analyze the training examples to identify the pattern.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nExample 1:\n- Input has two 2x2 blocks: one with value 1 at position (2,2) and one with value 2 at position (6,4)\n- Output: The 2x2 blocks remain in place, but diagonal lines of their respective colors are drawn from their positions\n\nExample 2:\n- Input has a 2x2 block of 2s at position (0,2) and a 2x2 block of 1s at position (7,6)\n- Output: The blocks remain, and diagonal lines are drawn - 2s go diagonally down-right, 1s go diagonally up-left\n\nExample 3:\n- Input has a 2x2 block of 2s at position (2,5) and a 2x2 block of 1s at position (5,3)\n- Output: The blocks remain, and diagonal lines are drawn for both colors\n\nThe pattern seems to be:\n1. Identify all 2x2 blocks of the same non-zero value\n2. Keep these blocks in their original positions\n3. For each block, draw a diagonal line of that same value:\n   - For value 1: diagonal goes up-left (towards top-left corner)\n   - For value 2: diagonal goes down-right (towards bottom-right corner)\n\nLet me trace this more carefully:\n\nIn Example 1:\n- 2x2 block of 1s at (2,2): diagonal goes up-left from (2,2) -> (1,1) -> (0,0)\n- 2x2 block of 2s at (6,4): diagonal goes down-right from (7,5) -> (8,6) -> (9,7)\n\nIn Example 2:\n- 2x2 block of 2s at (0,2): diagonal goes down-right from (1,4) -> (2,5) -> (3,6) -> (4,7) -> (5,8) -> (6,9)\n- 2x2 block of 1s at (7,6): diagonal goes up-left from (6,5) -> (5,4) -> (4,3) -> (3,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,0)\n\nIn Example 3:\n- 2x2 block of 2s at (2,5): diagonal goes down-right from (3,7) -> (4,8) -> (5,9)\n- 2x2 block of 1s at (5,3): diagonal goes up-left from (4,2) -> (3,1) -> (2,0)\n\nThis looks like the pattern. I'll implement a function that:\n1. Finds all 2x2 blocks of the same non-zero value\n2. Keeps them in place\n3. Draws diagonal lines from the corners of these blocks\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    result = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find all 2x2 blocks\n    blocks = []\n    for i in range(9):  # 9 because we need space for 2x2 block\n        for j in range(9):\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            if value != 0 and \\\n               grid[i][j] == grid[i][j+1] and \\\n               grid[i+1][j] == grid[i+1][j+1] and \\\n               grid[i][j] == grid[i+1][j]:\n                blocks.append((i, j, value))\n    \n    # For each block, draw diagonal lines\n    for i, j, value in blocks:\n        if value == 1:  # Diagonal up-left\n            row, col = i, j\n            while row >= 0 and col >= 0:\n                result[row][col] = value\n                row -= 1\n                col -= 1\n        elif value == 2:  # Diagonal down-right\n            # Start from the position diagonally adjacent to the block\n            row, col = i + 1, j + 1\n            while row < 10 and col < 10:\n                result[row][col] = value\n                row += 1\n                col += 1\n    \n    return result\n```",

Identify all 2x2 blocks of the same non-zero value\n2. Keep these blocks in their original positions\n3. For each block, draw a diagonal line of that same value:\n   - For value 1: diagonal goes up-left (towards top-left corner)\n   - For value 2: diagonal goes down-right (towards bottom-right corner)\n\nLet me trace this more carefully:\n\nIn Example 1:\n- 2x2 block of 1s at (2,2): diagonal goes up-left from (2,2) -> (1,1) -> (0,0)\n- 2x2 block of 2s at (6,4): diagonal goes down-right from (7,5) -> (8,6) -> (9,7)\n\nIn Example 2:\n- 2x2 block of 2s at (0,2): diagonal goes down-right from (1,4) -> (2,5) -> (3,6) -> (4,7) -> (5,8) -> (6,9)\n- 2x2 block of 1s at (7,6): diagonal goes up-left from (6,5) -> (5,4) -> (4,3) -> (3,2) -> (2,1) -> (1,0)\n\nIn Example 3:\n- 2x2 block of 2s at (2,5): diagonal goes down-right from (3,7) -> (4,8) -> (5,9)\n- 2x2 block of 1s at (5,3): diagonal goes up-left from (4,2) -> (3,1) -> (2,0)\n\nThis looks like the pattern. I'll implement a function that:\n1. Finds all 2x2 blocks of the same non-zero value\n2. Keeps them in place\n3. Draws diagonal lines from the corners of these blocks\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the input grid\n    result = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Find all 2x2 blocks\n    blocks = []\n    for i in range(9):  # 9 because we need space for 2x2 block\n        for j in range(9):\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            if value != 0 and \\\n               grid[i][j] == grid[i][j+1] and \\\n               grid[i+1][j] == grid[i+1][j+1] and \\\n               grid[i][j] == grid[i+1][j]:\n                blocks.append((i, j, value))\n    \n    # For each block, draw diagonal lines\n    for i, j, value in blocks:\n        if value == 1:  # Diagonal up-left\n            row, col = i, j\n            while row >= 0 and col >= 0:\n                result[row][col] = value\n                row -= 1\n                col -= 1\n        elif value == 2:  # Diagonal down-right\n            # Start from the position diagonally adjacent to the block\n            row, col = i + 1, j + 1\n            while row < 10 and col < 10:\n                result[row][col] = value\n                row += 1\n                col += 1\n    \n    return result\n```",
