          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the three training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has some numbers in specific positions. The output seems to have those numbers replaced or transformed in certain areas. For instance, in the input, the third row has a 4 and 2 in positions (2,1) and (2,4) (assuming rows and columns start at 0). In the output, those positions are replaced with 0s. Wait, no, looking at the output for example 1, the third row (row index 2) in the output is all zeros. But the input's third row had 0 4 0 0 2 0 ... So maybe the transformation is about spreading or replacing certain numbers?\n\nWait, looking at example 1's output. The output has some numbers in specific positions. For example, in the fourth row of the input (row 3), there's 0 0 5 5 0 0 ... and in the output, row 3 becomes 0 0 4 2 0 0 ... Hmm, maybe the 5s are being replaced by 4 and 2? But why? Also, in the fifth row of the input, it's the same as the fourth row. In the output, the fifth row is 0 0 7 1 0 0 ... So maybe there's some pattern where certain numbers are being replaced by others based on their positions?\n\nLooking at example 2. The input has a 3 in position (2,2), and in the output, that's replaced by 0s. But in the output, the fourth row has 0 0 0 3 3 4 4 ... So maybe the 3 and 4 are being spread out? Also, in the input, there's a 5 in positions (3,3) to (6,3), and in the output, those positions are replaced with 3s and 4s. But in example 2's output, the fourth row has 3 and 4 in positions (3,3) and (3,4), but maybe that's part of a spread?\n\nWait, example 2's input has a block of 5s in columns 3-7 (rows 3-6). The output for those rows has 3s and 4s in the same columns. But in the output, the fourth row (row 3) has 3 and 4 in columns 3 and 4. Then in row 4, same. But in the output, the 3 and 4 are spread across the columns. Maybe the 5s are being replaced by 3 and 4 in certain positions based on their positions?\n\nLooking at example 3. The input has a 8 in (0,0), 5s in rows 1-7, columns 1-6, and 7 in (7,0), 9 in (0,7). The output for example 3 has 0s except for certain rows. For example, the first row of the output is all 0s. But the second row has 8 and 9 in positions (1,1) and (1,7). Wait, the input's first row is 8 0 0 ... 9 0 0. The output's second row is 0 8 8 8 9 9 9 ... So maybe the 8 and 9 are spread out in certain positions?\n\nHmm, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in example 3, the 8 and 9 in the input are spread out in the output. Also, the 5s in the input are replaced by 8s and 9s in some rows, but in other rows, they are replaced by 7s and 6s. Wait, in example 3, the input has 5s in rows 1-7, columns 1-6. The output for those rows has 8s and 9s in the first few columns, then 7s and 6s in other rows. Maybe there's a pattern where numbers are spread out based on their positions and some kind of transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the 4 and 2 in the input are replaced by 0s in the output. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the output is replacing numbers with others based on their positions in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain numbers are spread out in specific areas. For example, in example 2, the 5s in the input are replaced by 3s and 4s in the output. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the positions where numbers are present. For example, in example 1, the input has 4 and 2 in row 2, columns 1 and 4. The output for row 3 (third row) is all zeros. But in the output, row 3 (the fourth row in the input) has 4 and 2 in columns 2 and 3. Wait, maybe the 4 and 2 are being spread out to other positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers with other numbers based on their positions. For example, in example 3, the input has 8 and 9 in certain positions. The output has those numbers spread out in certain rows. For example, the first row of the input has 8 and 9. The output's second row has 8s and 9s in the first and seventh columns. Maybe the 8 and 9 are being spread out in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers with other numbers based on their positions and the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell has a value, it's replaced by a certain value based on its row or column.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 3. The input has a 8 in (0,0) and 9 in (0,7). The output's second row (row 1) has 8s in columns 1-3 and 9s in columns 6-7. So maybe the 8 and 9 are spread out in the output. Also, in the input, there's a 7 in (7,0) and 6 in (7,6). The output for row 7 (original row 7) has 7s and 6s in columns 1-3 and 6-7. So maybe the numbers are spread out in certain regions.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced by other numbers in specific regions. For example, in example 3, the 5s in the input are replaced by 8s and 9s in the first few rows, and 7s and 6s in other rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers with other numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced by a certain value. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1 again. The input's third row has 0 4 0 0 2 0 ... and the output's third row is all zeros. But in the output, the fourth row has 0 0 4 2 ... and the fifth row has 0 0 7 1 ... So maybe the numbers in the input are being spread out to other rows. For example, the 4 and 2 in row 2 are moved to row 3 and 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the 4 and 2 are in row 2 (third row), and in the output, those numbers are spread to other rows. But how?\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output is a transformation where certain numbers are replaced by others based on their positions. For example, in example 3, the 5s in the input are replaced by 8s and 9s in certain rows, and 7s and 6s in others. Maybe the rows are being transformed based on their position. Like, rows 1-3 (original rows 1-3) have 8s and 9s, and rows 4-7 have 7s and 6s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers in certain positions are replaced by others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in the first column, it's replaced by a certain value. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output grid is a combination of certain patterns. For example, in example 2, the input has a block of 5s in rows 3-6 and columns 3-7. The output has 3s and 4s in those positions. But in example 2, the output for rows 3-6 have 3s and 4s in columns 3-4, and 8s and 6s in other rows. Maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced by others based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the first row, it's replaced by 0. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers with other numbers based on their position in certain regions. For example, in example 3, the 5s in the input are replaced by 8s and 9s in the first few rows, and 7s and 6s in other rows. So maybe the transformation is that certain regions of the grid are replaced with certain numbers based on their row or column.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where numbers are present in the input and output. For example, in example 1, the input has a 4 in (2,1) and 2 in (2,4). The output has 4 and 2 in (3,2) and (3,3). So maybe those numbers are being moved to the next row. Similarly, the 7 and 1 in the input are moved to the next row. So perhaps the numbers are being shifted down one row. But in example 2, the 3 is in (2,2) and in the output, it's in (3,3) and (3,4). So maybe the numbers are being spread out in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced by others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain column, it's replaced by a certain value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced by others based on their positions in certain patterns. For example, in example 3, the 8 and 9 in the input are spread out in the output. Maybe the 8 is spread to the first few columns of certain rows, and the 9 is spread to the last few columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that numbers are replaced by others based on their positions in certain regions. For example, in example 3, the input has 5s in rows 1-7, columns 1-6. The output for those rows has 8s and 9s in the first few columns and 7s and 6s in other columns. But how?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of a general pattern that can explain all three examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's output. The input has 8 in (0,0), 9 in (0,7). The output has 8 in (1,1), 9 in (1,7). So maybe the 8 and 9 are being moved down one row and spread out. Also, the 7 in (7,0) is replaced by 7 in (7,1) and (7,2), and 6 in (7,6) is replaced by 6 in (7,6) and (7,7). Wait, the output for row 7 (original row 7) is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. But in the input, row 7 has 7 0 0 ... 0 6 0 0. The output for row 7 is all zeros. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced by others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in the first column and has a value, it's replaced by a certain value. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is a transformation where certain numbers are replaced based on their positions. For example, in example 3, the input has 5s in rows 1-7, columns 1-6. The output for those rows has 8s and 9s in columns 1-3 and 6-7, and 7s and 6s in columns 4-5. Maybe the 5s are being replaced by 8s and 9s in the first part of the row and 7s and 6s in the latter part. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a combination of certain patterns. For example, in example 3, the first row's 8 and 9 are spread out in the second row. The 5s in the input are replaced by 8s and 9s in the first few rows and 7s and 6s in other rows. So perhaps the transformation is that certain numbers are spread out in certain regions based on their original positions.\n\nBut how to model this in code? Maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if it's part of a certain pattern, it's replaced by another value based on its position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced by a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced by others based on their positions. For example, in example 3, the 5s are replaced by 8s and 9s in certain rows and 7s and 6s in others. So maybe the rows are being transformed based on their position. Like, rows 1-3 have 8s and 9s, rows 4-7 have 7s and 6s.\n\nBut how to determine this? Let's look at example 3's output. The output for rows 1-3 (original rows 1-3) have 8s and 9s in columns 1-3 and 6-7. The output for rows 4-7 have 7s and 6s in columns 1-3 and 6-7. So perhaps the rows are being transformed based on their original row number. For example, rows 1-3 are transformed to 8s and 9s, and rows 4-7 to 7s and 6s.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the values are replaced by other values based on their position in the row. For example, in rows 1-3, the first three columns are replaced by 8s, and the last three columns are replaced by 9s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced by other numbers based on their original positions. For example, if a cell is in the first column, it's replaced by 8, and if it's in the seventh column, it's replaced by 9. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAnother approach: think of the output as a combination of certain patterns. For example, in example 3, the output has 8s and 9s in certain positions, which are spread out in rows. Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are spread out in certain regions of the grid.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern. Maybe I should think of the examples in terms of the positions of the numbers. For example, in example 1, the 4 and 2 are in row 2, columns 1 and 4. In the output, they are in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So maybe the numbers are being shifted down one row and left one column. But in example 2, the 3 is in row 2, column 2. In the output, it's in row 3, column 3. So that's similar. The 5s in example 2 are in rows 3-6, columns 3-7. In the output, they are replaced by 3s and 4s in the same rows and columns. So maybe that's not shifting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced by other numbers based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced by a certain value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced by other numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the first column, it's replaced by 8, if in the second column by 8, etc. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain numbers are replaced by others based on their original positions. For example, in example 3, the 8 and 9 are spread out in the output, and the 5s are replaced by 8s and 9s in certain rows. Maybe the transformation is that for certain cells, their value is replaced by another value based on their row and column.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 3. The input has 8 in (0,0) and 9 in (0,7). The output has 8 in (1,1) and 9 in (1,7). So maybe the 8 and 9 are moved down one row and spread out. Similarly, the 7 in (7,0) is replaced by 7 in (7,1) and (7,2), and the 6 in (7,6) is replaced by 6 in (7,6) and (7,7). So maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are spread out in their rows.\n\nBut how to code this? Maybe for each cell in the input, if it's a non-zero value, it's replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, if the cell is in the first row, then it's replaced by 0. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced by others based on their positions in certain regions. For example, in example 3, the 5s are replaced by 8s and 9s in the first few rows and 7s and 6s in the latter rows. So perhaps the rows are being transformed based on their position.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in the first three rows, then certain values are replaced by 8 and 9, and for rows 4-7, replaced by 7 and 6. But how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are replaced based on their position in the row. For example, in example 3, the first three rows have 8s and 9s in certain columns, and the latter rows have 7s and 6s.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in example 3, the 5s are replaced by 8s and 9s in rows 1-3 and 7s and 6s in rows 4-7. So maybe the rows are being transformed based on their row index.\n\nBut how to implement this? Maybe for each row in the input, if it's in certain rows, then the values are replaced by certain numbers. For example, in example 3, the input has 5s in rows 1-7. The output for these rows has 8s and 9s in the first few columns and 7s and 6s in others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the first three columns are replaced by 8s and the last three columns by 9s, but that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain columns are replaced by other values. For example, in example 3, the first three columns are replaced by 8s and the last three by 9s, but this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output grid is a combination of certain patterns. For example, in example 3, the output has 8s and 9s in the first few columns of rows 1-3 and 7s and 6s in rows 4-7. But how to determine this?\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can explain all three examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output: the 4 and 2 are replaced by 4 and 2 in the output. But wait, in example 1, the input has 4 and 2 in row 2, columns 1 and 4. The output has 4 and 2 in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So maybe the transformation is that numbers are shifted down one row and left one column. But in example 2, the input has 3 in row 2, column 2. The output has 3 in row 3, column 3. So that's similar. The 5s in example 2 are in rows 3-6, columns 3-7. The output has 3s and 4s in those rows and columns. So maybe the transformation is that the numbers are replaced by other numbers based on their position. For example, if a cell is in row r, column c, then in the output, it's replaced by a value based on some function of r and c.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if it's a non-zero value, then in the output, it's replaced by a value based on its position. For example, if the cell is in row 2, column 1, it's replaced by 4. If it's in row 2, column 4, it's replaced by 2. But this seems too specific to example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced by others based on their positions. For example, in example 3, the 8 and 9 are replaced by 8s and 9s in certain positions, and the 5s are replaced by 8s and 9s in certain rows.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern. Maybe I should think of the output as a combination of certain patterns that are applied to the input. For example, in example 3, the output has 8s and 9s in certain positions, which are spread out in the rows.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it's part of a certain pattern in the input, it's replaced by a certain value. For example, in example 1, the 4 and 2 are part of a pattern that is replaced by 4 and 2 in the output. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain numbers are replaced by others based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the first column, it's replaced by 8, if it's in the second column, it's replaced by 8, etc. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I have, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to find a pattern that can explain at least some of the examples.\n\nLooking at example 3, the output seems to replace certain numbers with others based on their row. For example, the first three rows (rows 0-2 in input) have 8s and 9s in certain columns, and the other rows have 7s and 6s. So maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are replaced based on their row index.\n\nFor example, if the row is in the first three rows (rows 0-2), then certain columns are replaced by 8 and 9. For rows 3-6, replaced by 7 and 6. For rows 7-9, replaced by 0s.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nIn example 3, the input has 5s in rows 1-7 (original rows 1-7). The output for those rows has 8s and 9s in columns 1-3 and 6-7, and 7s and 6s in columns 4-5.\n\nSo perhaps for rows 1-3 (original rows 1-3), the first three columns are replaced by 8s and the last three columns by 9s. For rows 4-7, the first three columns are replaced by 7s and the last three by 6s.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the transformation is that for each row, based on its index, certain columns are replaced by certain values.\n\nBut how to code this? Maybe for each row in the input, if the row is in a certain range, then replace the values in certain columns with others.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's try to code this.\n\nFor example, in example 3:\n\n- For rows 0 (input row 0), the output is all zeros. But the input has 8 and 9 in row 0. So maybe this is an exception.\n\n- For rows 1-3 (input rows 1-3), replace the first three columns with 8s and the last three columns with 9s.\n\n- For rows 4-7 (input rows 4-7), replace the first three columns with 7s and the last three columns with 6s.\n\n- For rows 8-9, replace with zeros.\n\nBut this is just for example 3. How to apply this to other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the output has certain numbers in certain rows. For example, row 3 (input row 3) has 0 0 4 2 0 0 ... which could be the first three columns replaced by 4 and 2, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the values are replaced based on their position. For example, in example 1, the fourth row (input row 3) has 0 0 5 5 0 0 ... and the output has 0 0 4 2 0 0 ... So maybe the 5s are replaced by 4 and 2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output grid is a combination of certain patterns, such as replacing numbers with other numbers based on their positions in certain regions.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be implemented in code. For example, in all examples, the output has certain numbers replaced by others in specific rows and columns. So perhaps the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if it is in a certain row or column, it is replaced by a certain value.\n\nBut how to determine this? Maybe the following approach:\n\n- For each row in the input, if the row is in a certain range, then replace the values in certain columns with others.\n\nFor example:\n\n- In example 3, rows 1-3 (input rows 1-3) have their first three columns replaced by 8s and the last three columns by 9s.\n\n- In example 3, rows 4-7 (input rows 4-7) have their first three columns replaced by 7s and the last three columns by 6s.\n\nBut how to generalize this for other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if the cell is in a certain position, it is replaced by a certain value. For example:\n\n- If the cell is in the first column and the row is in the first three rows, replace with 8.\n\n- If the cell is in the seventh column and the row is in the first three rows, replace with 9.\n\n- If the cell is in the first column and the row is in rows 4-7, replace with 7.\n\n- If the cell is in the seventh column and the row is in rows 4-7, replace with 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on example 3.\n\nBut how to handle other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the input has 4 and 2 in row 2, columns 1 and 4. The output has 4 and 2 in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So maybe the transformation is that the values are shifted down one row and left one column.\n\nBut this is not consistent with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if it's a non-zero value, it's replaced by a certain value based on its row and column.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother idea: looking at example 3, the output has 8s and 9s in certain positions. The 8 and 9 in the input are in row 0, columns 0 and 7. In the output, they are in row 1, columns 1 and 7. So maybe the transformation is that the 8 and 9 are moved down one row and spread out in certain columns.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if it's non-zero, it's replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example:\n\n- If the cell is in row 0, column 0, replace with 8 in row 1, column 1.\n\n- If the cell is in row 0, column 7, replace with 9 in row 1, column 7.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced by others based on their positions in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the first row, it's replaced by 0. But that doesn't fit example 3.\n\nGiven the time I have, I think I need to make a hypothesis and code it based on the examples I can see.\n\nLooking at example 3 again, the output seems to replace certain numbers based on their row. For example, rows 1-3 have 8s and 9s, rows 4-7 have 7s and 6s.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that for each row in the input, if the row is in a certain range, then replace certain columns with other values.\n\nFor example:\n\n- For rows 0-2 (input rows 0-2), replace columns 1-3 with 8s and columns 6-7 with 9s.\n\n- For rows 3-6 (input rows 3-6), replace columns 1-3 with 7s and columns 6-7 with 6s.\n\n- For rows 7-9, replace with 0s.\n\nBut this is just for example 3. How to apply this to other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the input has 4 and 2 in row 2, columns 1 and 4. The output has 4 and 2 in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So maybe the transformation is that the 4 and 2 are moved down one row and left one column.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if it is part of a certain pattern, it is replaced by another value. For example, in example 1, the 4 and 2 are part of a pattern that is replaced by 4 and 2 in the output. But this doesn't help.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 3, the 8 and 9 are spread out in the output. Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are spread out in the output based on their original positions.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, it is replaced by a value based on its row and column. For example, if the value is 8 in row 0, column 0, it's replaced by 8 in row 1, column 1. If the value is 9 in row 0, column 7, it's replaced by 9 in row 1, column 7. Similarly, the 7 in row 7, column 0 is replaced by 7 in row 7, column 1 and 2, and 6 in row 7, column 6 is replaced by 6 in row 7, column 6 and 7.\n\nBut this is just for example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, it is replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, if a cell is in row r, column c, then in the output, it is replaced by a value based on r and c.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in a certain row, it is replaced by a certain value. For example, in example 3, rows 1-3 are replaced with 8s and 9s, and rows 4-7 with 7s and 6s.\n\nBut how to determine this for other examples?\n\nGiven the time I have, I think I need to proceed with a hypothesis that the transformation is that certain rows are replaced with certain values based on their row index, and certain columns are replaced with certain values based on their column index.\n\nSo, for example, in example 3, rows 1-3 are replaced with 8s and 9s in certain columns, and rows 4-7 are replaced with 7s and 6s in certain columns.\n\nSo, the code would need to check for each cell in the input grid, and based on its row and column, replace it with a certain value.\n\nBut how to determine the exact values?\n\nLooking at example 3:\n\n- For rows 1-3 (input rows 1-3), columns 1-3 are replaced with 8s, and columns 6-7 with 9s.\n\n- For rows 4-7 (input rows 4-7), columns 1-3 are replaced with 7s, and columns 6-7 with 6s.\n\n- For rows 0 and 7-9, replaced with 0s.\n\nBut how to generalize this for other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the output has 4 and 2 in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So perhaps for rows 3, columns 2-3 are replaced with 4 and 2. But this is just for that example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows and columns, the values are replaced by others. For example, in example 1, the 4 and 2 are in row 2, columns 1 and 4. In the output, they are in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So maybe the transformation is that the values are shifted down one row and left one column.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with a code that replaces certain rows and columns based on the examples I have.\n\nLet's try to write code that replaces certain rows and columns based on the examples.\n\nFor example, in example 3:\n\n- For rows 1-3 (input rows 1-3), columns 1-3 are replaced with 8s, and columns 6-7 with 9s.\n\n- For rows 4-7 (input rows 4-7), columns 1-3 are replaced with 7s, and columns 6-7 with 6s.\n\n- For rows 0 and 7-9, replaced with 0s.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each row in 0-9:\n    if row == 0 or row >=7:\n        set all cells to 0\n    elif 1 <= row <=3:\n        for col in 1-3:\n            set to 8\n        for col in 6-7:\n            set to 9\n    elif 4 <= row <=7:\n        for col in 1-3:\n            set to 7\n        for col in 6-7:\n            set to 6\n\nBut this is just for example 3. How to apply this to other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the input has 4 and 2 in row 2, columns 1 and 4. The output has 4 and 2 in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So perhaps this code would not handle that, but maybe it's a different pattern.\n\nBut given that this is the only pattern I can see, perhaps this is the way to go.\n\nBut how to handle other examples?\n\nIn example 2, the input has 3 in row 2, column 2. The output has 3 in row 3, column 3. So perhaps this code would replace it with 8 in row 3, column 3, which is not the case. So this approach may not work.\n\nBut maybe the code is different. Perhaps the transformation is that certain rows are replaced with certain values based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it is in a certain row, it is replaced by a certain value. For example, in example 3, the first three rows are replaced with 8s and 9s in certain columns.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time, I think I need to proceed with this approach and write the code that handles the examples I can see, even if it's not perfect.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- For each row in the input grid:\n\n   - If the row is 0 or >=7: set all cells to 0.\n\n   - Else if the row is between 1 and 3 (inclusive): replace columns 1-3 with 8, columns 6-7 with 9.\n\n   - Else if the row is between 4 and 7 (inclusive): replace columns 1-3 with 7, columns 6-7 with 6.\n\nBut this is for example 3. How to handle other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the output has 4 and 2 in row 3, columns 2 and 3. But according to this code, row 3 is in the 1-3 range, so columns 1-3 are set to 8. But in the output, those columns are 4 and 2. So this code would not work for example 1.\n\nSo this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it is in a certain column, it is replaced by a certain value. For example, in example 3, the first column is replaced by 8, the seventh column by 9, etc.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the output of example 1. The input has 4 and 2 in row 2, columns 1 and 4. The output has 4 and 2 in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So maybe the transformation is that the values are shifted down one row and left one column.\n\nSimilarly, in example 2, the input has 3 in row 2, column 2. The output has 3 in row 3, column 3. So this is the same pattern.\n\nIn example 3, the input has 8 in row 0, column 0. The output has 8 in row 1, column 1. So this is the same pattern.\n\nSo, the pattern might be that each non-zero value in the input is replaced by the same value in the output, but shifted down one row and left one column. But what about other values?\n\nFor example, in example 1, the 5s in row 3, columns 2-3 are replaced by 4 and 2. But according to the shift pattern, they would be shifted to row 4, columns 1-2. But in the output, they are replaced by 4 and 2 in row 3, columns 2-3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero value is replaced by the same value in the output, but in the next row and next column. But this would mean that in example 1, the 4 and 2 are shifted down and left, but the 5s are replaced by other values.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that the output is a combination of the input values, but with certain values replaced based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the first column, it's replaced by 8, and if it's in the seventh column, it's replaced by 9, etc.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with a code that replaces certain values based on their positions, even if it's not perfect.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if it is non-zero, it is replaced by the same value in the next row and next column. But if that's not possible, it is replaced by 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that the output is a grid where each non-zero value is replaced by the same value in the next row and next column. For example, in example 3, the 8 in row 0, column 0 is replaced by 8 in row 1, column 1. The 9 in row 0, column 7 is replaced by 9 in row 1, column 7. The 7 in row 7, column 0 is replaced by 7 in row 7, column 1 and 2. The 6 in row 7, column 6 is replaced by 6 in row 7, column 6 and 7.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThe code would need to iterate through each cell in the input grid, and for each non-zero value, set the cell in the output grid at (row+1, col+1) to the same value. But this would require that the output grid is filled with these values, and if there are multiple cells, they might overwrite each other.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's see.\n\nFor example, in example 3, the input has 8 in (0,0). In the output, this is replaced by 8 in (1,1). The 9 in (0,7) is replaced by 9 in (1,7). The 7 in (7,0) is replaced by 7 in (7,1) and (7,2). The 6 in (7,6) is replaced by 6 in (7,6) and (7,7).\n\nBut this would mean that the output is filled with these values. But how to handle other cells?\n\nThis seems plausible for example 3, but how about example 1?\n\nIn example 1, the input has 4 in (2,1). According to this pattern, it would be replaced by 4 in (3,2). The 2 in (2,4) would be replaced by 2 in (3,5). But in the output, the fourth row (row 3) has 0 0 4 2 0 0 ... which matches this. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn example 2, the input has 3 in (2,2). According to this pattern, it would be replaced by 3 in (3,3). The output has 3 in (3,3) and (3,4). So this fits.\n\nIn example 3, the input has 5s in rows 1-7, columns 1-6. According to this pattern, each 5 would be replaced by 5 in (row+1, col+1). But in the output, the 5s are replaced by 8s and 9s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that this pattern is not correct.\n\nBut in example 1 and 2, it fits. So maybe this is part of the pattern.\n\nBut how to handle the other examples?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, it is replaced by the same value in the output at (row+1, col+1), but if the cell is in the last row or column, it is replaced by 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nfor each row in 0-9:\n    for each col in 0-9:\n        if grid[row][col] != 0:\n            new_row = row + 1\n            new_col = col + 1\n            if new_row < 10 and new_col < 10:\n                transformed_grid[new_row][new_col] = grid[row][col]\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[new_row][new_col] = 0\n\nBut this would mean that each non-zero value is moved to the next row and column, and if it's out of bounds, it's set to 0.\n\nBut this would explain example 1 and 2, but not example 3.\n\nBut in example 3, the input has 8 in (0,0) which would be moved to (1,1), and 9 in (0,7) to (1,8). But in the output, the 9 is in (1,7), not (1,8). So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that this pattern is not correct.\n\nBut given the time, I think I need to proceed with this approach, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero value is replaced by the same value in the output at (row+1, col+1), but if the cell is in the first row or column, it's replaced by 0.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to write a code that implements this pattern, even if it's not perfect.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            val = grid[row][col]\n            if val != 0:\n                new_row = row + 1\n                new_col = col + 1\n                if new_row < 10 and new_col < 10:\n                    transformed[new_row][new_col] = val\n                else:\n                    # if out of bounds, set to 0\n                    pass\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not work for example 3, where the 7 in (7,0) is replaced by 7 in (7,1) and (7,2), but according to this code, it would be moved to (8,1) and (8,2). But in the output, it's in (7,1) and (7,2). So this code would not handle that.\n\nBut perhaps the code is different. Maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced in the same row and column, but this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero value is replaced by the same value in the same row and column, but this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible hypothesis based on the examples I can see, even if it's not perfect.\n\nThe code that shifts each non-zero value to the next row and column seems to fit examples 1 and 2, but not example 3. However, given that the test input has a complex pattern, maybe this is part of the solution.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed with this code and see.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the three training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has some numbers in specific positions. The output seems to have those numbers replaced or transformed in certain areas. For instance, in the input, the third row has a 4 and 2 in positions (2,1) and (2,4) (assuming rows and columns start at 0). In the output, those positions are replaced with 0s. Wait, no, looking at the output for example 1, the third row (row index 2) in the output is all zeros. But the input's third row had 0 4 0 0 2 0 ... So maybe the transformation is about spreading or replacing certain numbers?\n\nWait, looking at example 1's output. The output has some numbers in specific positions. For example, in the fourth row of the input (row 3), there's 0 0 5 5 0 0 ... and in the output, row 3 becomes 0 0 4 2 0 0 ... Hmm, maybe the 5s are being replaced by 4 and 2? But why? Also, in the fifth row of the input, it's the same as the fourth row. In the output, the fifth row is 0 0 7 1 0 0 ... So maybe there's some pattern where certain numbers are being replaced by others based on their positions?\n\nLooking at example 2. The input has a 3 in position (2,2), and in the output, that's replaced by 0s. But in the output, the fourth row has 0 0 0 3 3 4 4 ... So maybe the 3 and 4 are being spread out? Also, in the input, there's a 5 in positions (3,3) to (6,3), and in the output, those positions are replaced with 3s and 4s. But in example 2's output, the fourth row has 3 and 4 in positions (3,3) and (3,4), but maybe that's part of a spread?\n\nWait, example 2's input has a block of 5s in columns 3-7 (rows 3-6). The output for those rows has 3s and 4s in the same columns. But in the output, the fourth row (row 3) has 3 and 4 in columns 3 and 4. Then in row 4, same. But in the output, the 3 and 4 are spread across the columns. Maybe the 5s are being replaced by 3 and 4 in certain positions based on their positions?\n\nLooking at example 3. The input has a 8 in (0,0), 5s in rows 1-7, columns 1-6, and 7 in (7,0), 9 in (0,7). The output for example 3 has 0s except for certain rows. For example, the first row of the output is all 0s. But the second row has 8 and 9 in positions (1,1) and (1,7). Wait, the input's first row is 8 0 0 ... 9 0 0. The output's second row is 0 8 8 8 9 9 9 ... So maybe the 8 and 9 are spread out in certain positions?\n\nHmm, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in example 3, the 8 and 9 in the input are spread out in the output. Also, the 5s in the input are replaced by 8s and 9s in some rows, but in other rows, they are replaced by 7s and 6s. Wait, in example 3, the input has 5s in rows 1-7, columns 1-6. The output for those rows has 8s and 9s in the first few columns, then 7s and 6s in other rows. Maybe there's a pattern where numbers are spread out based on their positions and some kind of transformation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the 4 and 2 in the input are replaced by 0s in the output. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe the output is replacing numbers with others based on their positions in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain numbers are spread out in specific areas. For example, in example 2, the 5s in the input are replaced by 3s and 4s in the output. But how?\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the positions where numbers are present. For example, in example 1, the input has 4 and 2 in row 2, columns 1 and 4. The output for row 3 (third row) is all zeros. But in the output, row 3 (the fourth row in the input) has 4 and 2 in columns 2 and 3. Wait, maybe the 4 and 2 are being spread out to other positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing numbers with other numbers based on their positions. For example, in example 3, the input has 8 and 9 in certain positions. The output has those numbers spread out in certain rows. For example, the first row of the input has 8 and 9. The output's second row has 8s and 9s in the first and seventh columns. Maybe the 8 and 9 are being spread out in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers with other numbers based on their positions and the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell has a value, it's replaced by a certain value based on its row or column.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 3. The input has a 8 in (0,0) and 9 in (0,7). The output's second row (row 1) has 8s in columns 1-3 and 9s in columns 6-7. So maybe the 8 and 9 are spread out in the output. Also, in the input, there's a 7 in (7,0) and 6 in (7,6). The output for row 7 (original row 7) has 7s and 6s in columns 1-3 and 6-7. So maybe the numbers are spread out in certain regions.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced by other numbers in specific regions. For example, in example 3, the 5s in the input are replaced by 8s and 9s in the first few rows, and 7s and 6s in other rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers with other numbers based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced by a certain value. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1 again. The input's third row has 0 4 0 0 2 0 ... and the output's third row is all zeros. But in the output, the fourth row has 0 0 4 2 ... and the fifth row has 0 0 7 1 ... So maybe the numbers in the input are being spread out to other rows. For example, the 4 and 2 in row 2 are moved to row 3 and 4. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in example 1, the 4 and 2 are in row 2 (third row), and in the output, those numbers are spread to other rows. But how?\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the output is a transformation where certain numbers are replaced by others based on their positions. For example, in example 3, the 5s in the input are replaced by 8s and 9s in certain rows, and 7s and 6s in others. Maybe the rows are being transformed based on their position. Like, rows 1-3 (original rows 1-3) have 8s and 9s, and rows 4-7 have 7s and 6s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers in certain positions are replaced by others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in the first column, it's replaced by a certain value. But this seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output grid is a combination of certain patterns. For example, in example 2, the input has a block of 5s in rows 3-6 and columns 3-7. The output has 3s and 4s in those positions. But in example 2, the output for rows 3-6 have 3s and 4s in columns 3-4, and 8s and 6s in other rows. Maybe the numbers are being replaced based on their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced by others based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the first row, it's replaced by 0. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is about replacing numbers with other numbers based on their position in certain regions. For example, in example 3, the 5s in the input are replaced by 8s and 9s in the first few rows, and 7s and 6s in other rows. So maybe the transformation is that certain regions of the grid are replaced with certain numbers based on their row or column.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where numbers are present in the input and output. For example, in example 1, the input has a 4 in (2,1) and 2 in (2,4). The output has 4 and 2 in (3,2) and (3,3). So maybe those numbers are being moved to the next row. Similarly, the 7 and 1 in the input are moved to the next row. So perhaps the numbers are being shifted down one row. But in example 2, the 3 is in (2,2) and in the output, it's in (3,3) and (3,4). So maybe the numbers are being spread out in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced by others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in a certain column, it's replaced by a certain value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced by others based on their positions in certain patterns. For example, in example 3, the 8 and 9 in the input are spread out in the output. Maybe the 8 is spread to the first few columns of certain rows, and the 9 is spread to the last few columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that numbers are replaced by others based on their positions in certain regions. For example, in example 3, the input has 5s in rows 1-7, columns 1-6. The output for those rows has 8s and 9s in the first few columns and 7s and 6s in other columns. But how?\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to think of a general pattern that can explain all three examples.\n\nLooking at example 3's output. The input has 8 in (0,0), 9 in (0,7). The output has 8 in (1,1), 9 in (1,7). So maybe the 8 and 9 are being moved down one row and spread out. Also, the 7 in (7,0) is replaced by 7 in (7,1) and (7,2), and 6 in (7,6) is replaced by 6 in (7,6) and (7,7). Wait, the output for row 7 (original row 7) is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. But in the input, row 7 has 7 0 0 ... 0 6 0 0. The output for row 7 is all zeros. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced by others based on their positions. For example, if a cell is in the first column and has a value, it's replaced by a certain value. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother idea: Maybe the output is a transformation where certain numbers are replaced based on their positions. For example, in example 3, the input has 5s in rows 1-7, columns 1-6. The output for those rows has 8s and 9s in columns 1-3 and 6-7, and 7s and 6s in columns 4-5. Maybe the 5s are being replaced by 8s and 9s in the first part of the row and 7s and 6s in the latter part. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output is a combination of certain patterns. For example, in example 3, the first row's 8 and 9 are spread out in the second row. The 5s in the input are replaced by 8s and 9s in the first few rows and 7s and 6s in other rows. So perhaps the transformation is that certain numbers are spread out in certain regions based on their original positions.\n\nBut how to model this in code? Maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if it's part of a certain pattern, it's replaced by another value based on its position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced by a certain value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced by others based on their positions. For example, in example 3, the 5s are replaced by 8s and 9s in certain rows and 7s and 6s in others. So maybe the rows are being transformed based on their position. Like, rows 1-3 have 8s and 9s, rows 4-7 have 7s and 6s.\n\nBut how to determine this? Let's look at example 3's output. The output for rows 1-3 (original rows 1-3) have 8s and 9s in columns 1-3 and 6-7. The output for rows 4-7 have 7s and 6s in columns 1-3 and 6-7. So perhaps the rows are being transformed based on their original row number. For example, rows 1-3 are transformed to 8s and 9s, and rows 4-7 to 7s and 6s.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the values are replaced by other values based on their position in the row. For example, in rows 1-3, the first three columns are replaced by 8s, and the last three columns are replaced by 9s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced by other numbers based on their original positions. For example, if a cell is in the first column, it's replaced by 8, and if it's in the seventh column, it's replaced by 9. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAnother approach: think of the output as a combination of certain patterns. For example, in example 3, the output has 8s and 9s in certain positions, which are spread out in rows. Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are spread out in certain regions of the grid.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern. Maybe I should think of the examples in terms of the positions of the numbers. For example, in example 1, the 4 and 2 are in row 2, columns 1 and 4. In the output, they are in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So maybe the numbers are being shifted down one row and left one column. But in example 2, the 3 is in row 2, column 2. In the output, it's in row 3, column 3. So that's similar. The 5s in example 2 are in rows 3-6, columns 3-7. In the output, they are replaced by 3s and 4s in the same rows and columns. So maybe that's not shifting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced by other numbers based on their position. For example, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced by a certain value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced by other numbers based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the first column, it's replaced by 8, if in the second column by 8, etc. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain numbers are replaced by others based on their original positions. For example, in example 3, the 8 and 9 are spread out in the output, and the 5s are replaced by 8s and 9s in certain rows. Maybe the transformation is that for certain cells, their value is replaced by another value based on their row and column.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 3. The input has 8 in (0,0) and 9 in (0,7). The output has 8 in (1,1) and 9 in (1,7). So maybe the 8 and 9 are moved down one row and spread out. Similarly, the 7 in (7,0) is replaced by 7 in (7,1) and (7,2), and the 6 in (7,6) is replaced by 6 in (7,6) and (7,7). So maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are spread out in their rows.\n\nBut how to code this? Maybe for each cell in the input, if it's a non-zero value, it's replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, if the cell is in the first row, then it's replaced by 0. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers are replaced by others based on their positions in certain regions. For example, in example 3, the 5s are replaced by 8s and 9s in the first few rows and 7s and 6s in the latter rows. So perhaps the rows are being transformed based on their position.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the transformation is that for each row, if the row is in the first three rows, then certain values are replaced by 8 and 9, and for rows 4-7, replaced by 7 and 6. But how to determine which columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are replaced based on their position in the row. For example, in example 3, the first three rows have 8s and 9s in certain columns, and the latter rows have 7s and 6s.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing certain numbers with others based on their positions. For example, in example 3, the 5s are replaced by 8s and 9s in rows 1-3 and 7s and 6s in rows 4-7. So maybe the rows are being transformed based on their row index.\n\nBut how to implement this? Maybe for each row in the input, if it's in certain rows, then the values are replaced by certain numbers. For example, in example 3, the input has 5s in rows 1-7. The output for these rows has 8s and 9s in the first few columns and 7s and 6s in others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, the first three columns are replaced by 8s and the last three columns by 9s, but that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each row, certain columns are replaced by other values. For example, in example 3, the first three columns are replaced by 8s and the last three by 9s, but this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output grid is a combination of certain patterns. For example, in example 3, the output has 8s and 9s in the first few columns of rows 1-3 and 7s and 6s in rows 4-7. But how to determine this?\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for a pattern that can explain all three examples.\n\nLooking at example 1's output: the 4 and 2 are replaced by 4 and 2 in the output. But wait, in example 1, the input has 4 and 2 in row 2, columns 1 and 4. The output has 4 and 2 in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So maybe the transformation is that numbers are shifted down one row and left one column. But in example 2, the input has 3 in row 2, column 2. The output has 3 in row 3, column 3. So that's similar. The 5s in example 2 are in rows 3-6, columns 3-7. The output has 3s and 4s in those rows and columns. So maybe the transformation is that the numbers are replaced by other numbers based on their position. For example, if a cell is in row r, column c, then in the output, it's replaced by a value based on some function of r and c.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if it's a non-zero value, then in the output, it's replaced by a value based on its position. For example, if the cell is in row 2, column 1, it's replaced by 4. If it's in row 2, column 4, it's replaced by 2. But this seems too specific to example 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced by others based on their positions. For example, in example 3, the 8 and 9 are replaced by 8s and 9s in certain positions, and the 5s are replaced by 8s and 9s in certain rows.\n\nBut I'm not seeing a clear pattern. Maybe I should think of the output as a combination of certain patterns that are applied to the input. For example, in example 3, the output has 8s and 9s in certain positions, which are spread out in the rows.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it's part of a certain pattern in the input, it's replaced by a certain value. For example, in example 1, the 4 and 2 are part of a pattern that is replaced by 4 and 2 in the output. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation where certain numbers are replaced by others based on their position in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the first column, it's replaced by 8, if it's in the second column, it's replaced by 8, etc. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I have, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to find a pattern that can explain at least some of the examples.\n\nLooking at example 3, the output seems to replace certain numbers with others based on their row. For example, the first three rows (rows 0-2 in input) have 8s and 9s in certain columns, and the other rows have 7s and 6s. So maybe the transformation is that for each row, the values are replaced based on their row index.\n\nFor example, if the row is in the first three rows (rows 0-2), then certain columns are replaced by 8 and 9. For rows 3-6, replaced by 7 and 6. For rows 7-9, replaced by 0s.\n\nBut how to determine which columns?\n\nIn example 3, the input has 5s in rows 1-7 (original rows 1-7). The output for those rows has 8s and 9s in columns 1-3 and 6-7, and 7s and 6s in columns 4-5.\n\nSo perhaps for rows 1-3 (original rows 1-3), the first three columns are replaced by 8s and the last three columns by 9s. For rows 4-7, the first three columns are replaced by 7s and the last three by 6s.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the transformation is that for each row, based on its index, certain columns are replaced by certain values.\n\nBut how to code this? Maybe for each row in the input, if the row is in a certain range, then replace the values in certain columns with others.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's try to code this.\n\nFor example, in example 3:\n\n- For rows 0 (input row 0), the output is all zeros. But the input has 8 and 9 in row 0. So maybe this is an exception.\n\n- For rows 1-3 (input rows 1-3), replace the first three columns with 8s and the last three columns with 9s.\n\n- For rows 4-7 (input rows 4-7), replace the first three columns with 7s and the last three columns with 6s.\n\n- For rows 8-9, replace with zeros.\n\nBut this is just for example 3. How to apply this to other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the output has certain numbers in certain rows. For example, row 3 (input row 3) has 0 0 4 2 0 0 ... which could be the first three columns replaced by 4 and 2, but not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the values are replaced based on their position. For example, in example 1, the fourth row (input row 3) has 0 0 5 5 0 0 ... and the output has 0 0 4 2 0 0 ... So maybe the 5s are replaced by 4 and 2. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the output grid is a combination of certain patterns, such as replacing numbers with other numbers based on their positions in certain regions.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be implemented in code. For example, in all examples, the output has certain numbers replaced by others in specific rows and columns. So perhaps the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if it is in a certain row or column, it is replaced by a certain value.\n\nBut how to determine this? Maybe the following approach:\n\n- For each row in the input, if the row is in a certain range, then replace the values in certain columns with others.\n\nFor example:\n\n- In example 3, rows 1-3 (input rows 1-3) have their first three columns replaced by 8s and the last three columns by 9s.\n\n- In example 3, rows 4-7 (input rows 4-7) have their first three columns replaced by 7s and the last three columns by 6s.\n\nBut how to generalize this for other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if the cell is in a certain position, it is replaced by a certain value. For example:\n\n- If the cell is in the first column and the row is in the first three rows, replace with 8.\n\n- If the cell is in the seventh column and the row is in the first three rows, replace with 9.\n\n- If the cell is in the first column and the row is in rows 4-7, replace with 7.\n\n- If the cell is in the seventh column and the row is in rows 4-7, replace with 6.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on example 3.\n\nBut how to handle other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the input has 4 and 2 in row 2, columns 1 and 4. The output has 4 and 2 in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So maybe the transformation is that the values are shifted down one row and left one column.\n\nBut this is not consistent with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if it's a non-zero value, it's replaced by a certain value based on its row and column.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nAnother idea: looking at example 3, the output has 8s and 9s in certain positions. The 8 and 9 in the input are in row 0, columns 0 and 7. In the output, they are in row 1, columns 1 and 7. So maybe the transformation is that the 8 and 9 are moved down one row and spread out in certain columns.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if it's non-zero, it's replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example:\n\n- If the cell is in row 0, column 0, replace with 8 in row 1, column 1.\n\n- If the cell is in row 0, column 7, replace with 9 in row 1, column 7.\n\nBut this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced by others based on their positions in the grid. For example, if a cell is in the first row, it's replaced by 0. But that doesn't fit example 3.\n\nGiven the time I have, I think I need to make a hypothesis and code it based on the examples I can see.\n\nLooking at example 3 again, the output seems to replace certain numbers based on their row. For example, rows 1-3 have 8s and 9s, rows 4-7 have 7s and 6s.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that for each row in the input, if the row is in a certain range, then replace certain columns with other values.\n\nFor example:\n\n- For rows 0-2 (input rows 0-2), replace columns 1-3 with 8s and columns 6-7 with 9s.\n\n- For rows 3-6 (input rows 3-6), replace columns 1-3 with 7s and columns 6-7 with 6s.\n\n- For rows 7-9, replace with 0s.\n\nBut this is just for example 3. How to apply this to other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the input has 4 and 2 in row 2, columns 1 and 4. The output has 4 and 2 in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So maybe the transformation is that the 4 and 2 are moved down one row and left one column.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if it is part of a certain pattern, it is replaced by another value. For example, in example 1, the 4 and 2 are part of a pattern that is replaced by 4 and 2 in the output. But this doesn't help.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 3, the 8 and 9 are spread out in the output. Maybe the transformation is that certain numbers are spread out in the output based on their original positions.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, it is replaced by a value based on its row and column. For example, if the value is 8 in row 0, column 0, it's replaced by 8 in row 1, column 1. If the value is 9 in row 0, column 7, it's replaced by 9 in row 1, column 7. Similarly, the 7 in row 7, column 0 is replaced by 7 in row 7, column 1 and 2, and 6 in row 7, column 6 is replaced by 6 in row 7, column 6 and 7.\n\nBut this is just for example 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, it is replaced by a certain value based on its position. For example, if a cell is in row r, column c, then in the output, it is replaced by a value based on r and c.\n\nBut how?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it's in a certain row, it is replaced by a certain value. For example, in example 3, rows 1-3 are replaced with 8s and 9s, and rows 4-7 with 7s and 6s.\n\nBut how to determine this for other examples?\n\nGiven the time I have, I think I need to proceed with a hypothesis that the transformation is that certain rows are replaced with certain values based on their row index, and certain columns are replaced with certain values based on their column index.\n\nSo, for example, in example 3, rows 1-3 are replaced with 8s and 9s in certain columns, and rows 4-7 are replaced with 7s and 6s in certain columns.\n\nSo, the code would need to check for each cell in the input grid, and based on its row and column, replace it with a certain value.\n\nBut how to determine the exact values?\n\nLooking at example 3:\n\n- For rows 1-3 (input rows 1-3), columns 1-3 are replaced with 8s, and columns 6-7 with 9s.\n\n- For rows 4-7 (input rows 4-7), columns 1-3 are replaced with 7s, and columns 6-7 with 6s.\n\n- For rows 0 and 7-9, replaced with 0s.\n\nBut how to generalize this for other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the output has 4 and 2 in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So perhaps for rows 3, columns 2-3 are replaced with 4 and 2. But this is just for that example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows and columns, the values are replaced by others. For example, in example 1, the 4 and 2 are in row 2, columns 1 and 4. In the output, they are in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So maybe the transformation is that the values are shifted down one row and left one column.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with a code that replaces certain rows and columns based on the examples I have.\n\nLet's try to write code that replaces certain rows and columns based on the examples.\n\nFor example, in example 3:\n\n- For rows 1-3 (input rows 1-3), columns 1-3 are replaced with 8s, and columns 6-7 with 9s.\n\n- For rows 4-7 (input rows 4-7), columns 1-3 are replaced with 7s, and columns 6-7 with 6s.\n\n- For rows 0 and 7-9, replaced with 0s.\n\nSo, in code:\n\nfor each row in 0-9:\n    if row == 0 or row >=7:\n        set all cells to 0\n    elif 1 <= row <=3:\n        for col in 1-3:\n            set to 8\n        for col in 6-7:\n            set to 9\n    elif 4 <= row <=7:\n        for col in 1-3:\n            set to 7\n        for col in 6-7:\n            set to 6\n\nBut this is just for example 3. How to apply this to other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the input has 4 and 2 in row 2, columns 1 and 4. The output has 4 and 2 in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So perhaps this code would not handle that, but maybe it's a different pattern.\n\nBut given that this is the only pattern I can see, perhaps this is the way to go.\n\nBut how to handle other examples?\n\nIn example 2, the input has 3 in row 2, column 2. The output has 3 in row 3, column 3. So perhaps this code would replace it with 8 in row 3, column 3, which is not the case. So this approach may not work.\n\nBut maybe the code is different. Perhaps the transformation is that certain rows are replaced with certain values based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for each cell, if it is in a certain row, it is replaced by a certain value. For example, in example 3, the first three rows are replaced with 8s and 9s in certain columns.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time, I think I need to proceed with this approach and write the code that handles the examples I can see, even if it's not perfect.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- For each row in the input grid:\n\n   - If the row is 0 or >=7: set all cells to 0.\n\n   - Else if the row is between 1 and 3 (inclusive): replace columns 1-3 with 8, columns 6-7 with 9.\n\n   - Else if the row is between 4 and 7 (inclusive): replace columns 1-3 with 7, columns 6-7 with 6.\n\nBut this is for example 3. How to handle other examples?\n\nIn example 1, the output has 4 and 2 in row 3, columns 2 and 3. But according to this code, row 3 is in the 1-3 range, so columns 1-3 are set to 8. But in the output, those columns are 4 and 2. So this code would not work for example 1.\n\nSo this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for each cell, if it is in a certain column, it is replaced by a certain value. For example, in example 3, the first column is replaced by 8, the seventh column by 9, etc.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another pattern. Let's think about the output of example 1. The input has 4 and 2 in row 2, columns 1 and 4. The output has 4 and 2 in row 3, columns 2 and 3. So maybe the transformation is that the values are shifted down one row and left one column.\n\nSimilarly, in example 2, the input has 3 in row 2, column 2. The output has 3 in row 3, column 3. So this is the same pattern.\n\nIn example 3, the input has 8 in row 0, column 0. The output has 8 in row 1, column 1. So this is the same pattern.\n\nSo, the pattern might be that each non-zero value in the input is replaced by the same value in the output, but shifted down one row and left one column. But what about other values?\n\nFor example, in example 1, the 5s in row 3, columns 2-3 are replaced by 4 and 2. But according to the shift pattern, they would be shifted to row 4, columns 1-2. But in the output, they are replaced by 4 and 2 in row 3, columns 2-3. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero value is replaced by the same value in the output, but in the next row and next column. But this would mean that in example 1, the 4 and 2 are shifted down and left, but the 5s are replaced by other values.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that the output is a combination of the input values, but with certain values replaced based on their position. For example, if a cell is in the first column, it's replaced by 8, and if it's in the seventh column, it's replaced by 9, etc.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with a code that replaces certain values based on their positions, even if it's not perfect.\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each cell in the input, if it is non-zero, it is replaced by the same value in the next row and next column. But if that's not possible, it is replaced by 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that the output is a grid where each non-zero value is replaced by the same value in the next row and next column. For example, in example 3, the 8 in row 0, column 0 is replaced by 8 in row 1, column 1. The 9 in row 0, column 7 is replaced by 9 in row 1, column 7. The 7 in row 7, column 0 is replaced by 7 in row 7, column 1 and 2. The 6 in row 7, column 6 is replaced by 6 in row 7, column 6 and 7.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThe code would need to iterate through each cell in the input grid, and for each non-zero value, set the cell in the output grid at (row+1, col+1) to the same value. But this would require that the output grid is filled with these values, and if there are multiple cells, they might overwrite each other.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's see.\n\nFor example, in example 3, the input has 8 in (0,0). In the output, this is replaced by 8 in (1,1). The 9 in (0,7) is replaced by 9 in (1,7). The 7 in (7,0) is replaced by 7 in (7,1) and (7,2). The 6 in (7,6) is replaced by 6 in (7,6) and (7,7).\n\nBut this would mean that the output is filled with these values. But how to handle other cells?\n\nThis seems plausible for example 3, but how about example 1?\n\nIn example 1, the input has 4 in (2,1). According to this pattern, it would be replaced by 4 in (3,2). The 2 in (2,4) would be replaced by 2 in (3,5). But in the output, the fourth row (row 3) has 0 0 4 2 0 0 ... which matches this. So this seems to fit.\n\nIn example 2, the input has 3 in (2,2). According to this pattern, it would be replaced by 3 in (3,3). The output has 3 in (3,3) and (3,4). So this fits.\n\nIn example 3, the input has 5s in rows 1-7, columns 1-6. According to this pattern, each 5 would be replaced by 5 in (row+1, col+1). But in the output, the 5s are replaced by 8s and 9s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that this pattern is not correct.\n\nBut in example 1 and 2, it fits. So maybe this is part of the pattern.\n\nBut how to handle the other examples?\n\nMaybe the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, it is replaced by the same value in the output at (row+1, col+1), but if the cell is in the last row or column, it is replaced by 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nfor each row in 0-9:\n    for each col in 0-9:\n        if grid[row][col] != 0:\n            new_row = row + 1\n            new_col = col + 1\n            if new_row < 10 and new_col < 10:\n                transformed_grid[new_row][new_col] = grid[row][col]\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[new_row][new_col] = 0\n\nBut this would mean that each non-zero value is moved to the next row and column, and if it's out of bounds, it's set to 0.\n\nBut this would explain example 1 and 2, but not example 3.\n\nBut in example 3, the input has 8 in (0,0) which would be moved to (1,1), and 9 in (0,7) to (1,8). But in the output, the 9 is in (1,7), not (1,8). So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm, this suggests that this pattern is not correct.\n\nBut given the time, I think I need to proceed with this approach, even if it doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero value is replaced by the same value in the output at (row+1, col+1), but if the cell is in the first row or column, it's replaced by 0.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to write a code that implements this pattern, even if it's not perfect.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            val = grid[row][col]\n            if val != 0:\n                new_row = row + 1\n                new_col = col + 1\n                if new_row < 10 and new_col < 10:\n                    transformed[new_row][new_col] = val\n                else:\n                    # if out of bounds, set to 0\n                    pass\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not work for example 3, where the 7 in (7,0) is replaced by 7 in (7,1) and (7,2), but according to this code, it would be moved to (8,1) and (8,2). But in the output, it's in (7,1) and (7,2). So this code would not handle that.\n\nBut perhaps the code is different. Maybe the transformation is that the value is replaced in the same row and column, but this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero value is replaced by the same value in the same row and column, but this is not helpful.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the best possible hypothesis based on the examples I can see, even if it's not perfect.\n\nThe code that shifts each non-zero value to the next row and column seems to fit examples 1 and 2, but not example 3. However, given that the test input has a complex pattern, maybe this is part of the solution.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Given the time, I'll proceed with this code and see.\n"
