          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that the output grids have 4x4 dimensions, and the values in the output grids seem to be derived from the input grids in a way that involves:\n- Identifying certain patterns or shapes in the input\n- Transforming those patterns into specific values (like 4s and 0s)\n- Positioning these transformed values in specific locations\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that the output values (0 and 4) seem to be placed in specific positions based on the input values. It appears that the transformation involves identifying certain patterns in the input grid and then placing specific values in the output grid based on those patterns.\n\nHere's my hypothesis for the transformation:\n- The output grid is filled with 0s by default\n- Certain positions in the output grid are set to 4 based on specific patterns in the input grid\n- The patterns seem to be related to the positions of certain values in the input grid\n\nBased on this, I'll implement a transformation that looks for specific patterns in the input grid and sets corresponding positions in the output grid to 4.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize output grid with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(4)]\n    \n    # Check for patterns that should result in 4s in the output\n    # This is a simplified pattern matching approach\n    for row in range(4):\n        for col in range(4):\n            # Check if the current position in the input grid has a value that should trigger a 4 in the output\n            # This is a simple pattern matching approach\n            if grid[row][col] == 6 and (row + col) % 2 == 0:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 4\n            elif grid[row][col] == 5 and (row - col) % 2 == 0:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 4\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid appears to have 4s in positions that are related to the positions of 5s in the input grid.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n1. The output grid is always 4x4\n2. The output grid has 4s in positions that are related to the positions of 5s in the input grid\n3. The pattern seems to be that 4s are placed in positions that are diagonally adjacent to 5s in the input grid\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that places 4s in positions that are diagonally adjacent to 5s in the input grid.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(4)]\n    for i in range(4):\n        for j in range(4):\n            # Check if the corresponding position in the input grid has a 5\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Place a 4 in the transformed grid\n                transformed[i][j] = 4\n    return transformed\n```",
