The output grid always has a 10x14 size\n2. Values propagate from certain positions to others in a specific pattern\n3. There seems to be a \"spread\" or \"influence\" pattern where certain values spread out from their original positions\n4. The spread seems to be in a specific direction and pattern\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads values from their original positions in a specific pattern.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Iterate through each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(14):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            if value != 0:\n                # Spread the value in a specific pattern\n                # This is a simplified version of the observed pattern\n                # We spread the value to the right and down in a specific way\n                for r in range(row, 10):\n                    for c in range(col, 14):\n                        if r < 10 and c < 14:\n                            output[r][c] = value\n                            # Stop spreading once we reach the end of the grid\n                            if r == 9 or c == 13:\n                                break\n                    if r == 9:\n                        break\n    \n    return output\n```",
