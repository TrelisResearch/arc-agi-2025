In input, there are two nonzero colored blocks at the far left and far right of the active row. All other rows are zeros.\n3. In the output:\n    - The same row is transformed.\n    - Left block is extended (repeats in all cells from its original to just before column 5).\n    - Right block is extended similarly (all cells from column 6 to the end, except column 5).\n    - Middle column (5) in the output row is always a unique color: gray (visually, value=5 in examples).\n    - All other rows remain zero.\n\nHypothesis for transformation:\n- For each row in the input:\n    - If two nonzero (different colors) blocks are found at column L and R:\n        - Fill all cells from L up to (but not including) column 5 with color L's value.\n        - Place a '5' (gray) at column 5.\n        - Fill cells from column 6 to R with color R's value.\n        - (In output, the left color's block always ends at column 4, right color's block starts at column 6, gray at column 5.)\n- All other rows remain zeros.\n\nIf there are rows with more (or fewer) than two nonzero blocks, or not at edges, this code will ignore them (as in training).\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    out = np.zeros((5, 11), dtype=int)\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        nz = np.nonzero(row)[0]\n        if len(nz) == 2:\n            left_idx, right_idx = nz[0], nz[1]\n            left_val = row[left_idx]\n            right_val = row[right_idx]\n            # fill left side up to col 5 (exclusive)\n            out[i, left_idx:5] = left_val\n            # fill right side from col 6 (inclusive) to right_idx+1 (inclusive)\n            out[i, 6:(right_idx+1)] = right_val\n            # set gray (5) in the middle col\n            out[i, 5] = 5\n    return out.tolist()\n```"

              "Analysis:\n\nEach output grid is always 5x11.\n\nObservations from training:\n1. Only one row in each input contains nonzero blocks.\n2. In input, there are two nonzero colored blocks at the far left and far right of the active row. All other rows are zeros.\n3. In the output:\n    - The same row is transformed.\n    - Left block is extended (repeats in all cells from its original to just before column 5).\n    - Right block is extended similarly (all cells from column 6 to the end, except column 5).\n    - Middle column (5) in the output row is always a unique color: gray (visually, value=5 in examples).\n    - All other rows remain zero.\n\nHypothesis for transformation:\n- For each row in the input:\n    - If two nonzero (different colors) blocks are found at column L and R:\n        - Fill all cells from L up to (but not including) column 5 with color L's value.\n        - Place a '5' (gray) at column 5.\n        - Fill cells from column 6 to R with color R's value.\n        - (In output, the left color's block always ends at column 4, right color's block starts at column 6, gray at column 5.)\n- All other rows remain zeros.\n\nIf there are rows with more (or fewer) than two nonzero blocks, or not at edges, this code will ignore them (as in training).\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    out = np.zeros((5, 11), dtype=int)\n    for i, row in enumerate(grid):\n        nz = np.nonzero(row)[0]\n        if len(nz) == 2:\n            left_idx, right_idx = nz[0], nz[1]\n            left_val = row[left_idx]\n            right_val = row[right_idx]\n            # fill left side up to col 5 (exclusive)\n            out[i, left_idx:5] = left_val\n            # fill right side from col 6 (inclusive) to right_idx+1 (inclusive)\n            out[i, 6:(right_idx+1)] = right_val\n            # set gray (5) in the middle col\n            out[i, 5] = 5\n    return out.tolist()\n```"
