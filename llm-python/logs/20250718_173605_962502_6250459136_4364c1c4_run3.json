The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with others\n2. There's a pattern of \"blocks\" or \"regions\" that are being transformed\n3. The transformation appears to be more about replacing values in certain regions rather than simple transformations like rotations or reflections\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n- Values of 6 in Example 1 are transformed to 8 in the output\n- Values of 3 in Example 1 are transformed to 8 in the output\n- Values of 4 in Example 2 are transformed to 1 in the output\n- Values of 2 in Example 2 are transformed to 1 in the output\n- Values of 7 in Example 3 are transformed to 3 in the output\n- Values of 8 in Example 3 are transformed to 3 in the output\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with others in specific regions of the grid.
