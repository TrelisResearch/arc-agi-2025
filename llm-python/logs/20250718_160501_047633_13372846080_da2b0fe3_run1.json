In Example 3, certain positions with value 5 are replaced with 3s in specific patterns.\n3. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with 3s in specific positions, especially in the middle row and around certain patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain values with 3s in specific positions\n- The middle row (row 4) is always transformed to all 3s\n- Values that are part of a certain pattern (like 5s in Example 3) are replaced with 3s\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # The middle row (row 4) is always transformed to all 3s\n    for col in range(10):\n        transformed_grid[4][col] = 3\n    \n    # Check for patterns that might need transformation\n    # For example, in Example 3, certain positions with value 5 are replaced with 3s\n    # This is a simplified pattern that might not capture all cases\n    for row in range(10):\n        for col in range(10):\n            if grid[row][col] == 5 and (row != 4) and (row != 6) and (row != 7) and (row != 8) and (row != 9):\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
