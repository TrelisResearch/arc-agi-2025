          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some numbers in specific positions. The output seems to expand those numbers into a block. For instance, the input has an 8 in position (1,5). In the output, that row becomes all 8s from column 2 to 8. Similarly, the 4 in input (4,2) becomes a block of 4s in the output. Wait, but in the output, that row has 4s in columns 2 and 5, but also some 5s and 3s. Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me check again.\n\nWait in Example 1's output, the second row has 8s from column 2 to 8. The input had an 8 in (1,5). So maybe that 8 is expanding into a horizontal line. But the third row in the input has a 4 in (4,2). The output for that row has 4s in columns 2 and 5, but also 5s and 3s. Wait, maybe the 4 is expanding into a vertical block? Or maybe the numbers are being spread out in some way.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has a 4 in (2,6). The output for that row has 4s in columns 4 to 10. Wait, maybe the 4 is expanding into a horizontal block. Then in another part, there's a 7 in (5,10), which in the output becomes a vertical block. Wait, the output for that row has 7 in column 10. But in the output, the row has 7 in column 10 and others. Hmm, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a certain way based on their position.\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has a 3 in (3,4). The output for that row has 3s from column 4 to 13. So that's a horizontal expansion. Then there's a 2 in (6,7), which in the output becomes a vertical block. Wait, the output for that row has 2 in column 7, but also 5s and 6s. Maybe the 2 is part of a vertical block. Also, there's a 9 in (13,5) which becomes 9s in columns 5 to 13.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a non-zero number in the input, it's expanding into a block of that number in the output. But how?\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the 8 in the input is in row 1, column 5. The output row 1 has 8s from column 2 to 8. So that's a horizontal line. Similarly, the 4 in input row 4, column 2 becomes a block in the output row 4, columns 2 to 5? Wait, in the output, row 4 has 4 in column 2, then 0s, then 5s and 3s. Hmm, maybe not. Wait the output for example 1's row 4 is:\n\n0 0 4 0 0 5 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait that's not a block. Maybe the 4 is in the middle of a larger pattern. Maybe the numbers are being spread out in a certain way based on their position. Or perhaps the numbers are being replaced by a block that depends on their position and value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, in Example 3, the 3 in (3,4) becomes a horizontal line of 3s from column 4 to 13. Then the 1 in (9,3) becomes a vertical line of 1s from column 3 to 13. Wait, no. Looking at Example 3's output, row 9 has 1 in column 3, then 0s, then 5s, then 6s. Wait, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero numbers in the input are being expanded into a block that spans certain columns. For example, if a number is in a certain column, it's expanded to fill a range of columns. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in column 5, and the output row has 8s from column 2 to 8. That's a span of 7 columns. Maybe that's a pattern where the number is expanded into a horizontal line starting from column 2 to column 8. But why column 2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in row 1, column 5. The output for that row has 8s from column 2 to 8. So that's a span of 7 columns. Maybe the number is expanded into a horizontal line that starts at column 2 and ends at column 8. But why?\n\nLooking at Example 3, the 3 is in row 3, column 4. The output for that row has 3s from column 4 to 13. That's a span of 10 columns. So maybe the number is expanded into a horizontal line from column 4 to column 13. But that's 10 columns. Wait, the input is 14 columns. So maybe the expansion is from the column of the number to the end, but that doesn't fit. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in column 5, and the output has 8s from column 2 to 8. That's not the same as starting from column 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a block that covers certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in column 5, and the output has 8s in columns 2-8. That's a span of 7 columns. But how is that determined?\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the numbers in the input are being replaced by a block of the same number in the output, but the block's shape depends on their position. For example, if a number is in the middle of the grid, it's expanded into a horizontal line. If it's in a certain row or column, it's expanded into a vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their value. For example, 8 in Example 1 is expanded into a horizontal line, but 4 is expanded into a vertical line. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has a 4 in row 2, column 6. The output row 2 has 4s from column 4 to 10. So that's a horizontal line. Then there's a 7 in row 5, column 10. The output row 5 has 7 in column 10. But in the output, that row has 7 in column 10 and others. Maybe the 7 is expanded into a vertical line. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their position in the grid. For example, numbers in certain rows or columns are expanded into horizontal or vertical lines.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 3, the input has a 2 in row 6, column 7. The output for that row has 2 in column 7, but also 5s and 6s. But in the output, there's a 2 in column 7 and then 5s in columns 7 and beyond? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being replaced by a block that spans certain columns. For example, if a number is in column x, then in the output, the same number is spread across columns from x to x + some value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a cross shape. For example, if a number is in a certain position, it's expanded into a cross that covers columns and rows around it. But that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output of Example 1. The 8 is in row 1, column 5. The output row 1 has 8s from column 2 to 8. So that's a horizontal line. Then in row 2, the input has 0s except for column 5 (value 8). The output row 2 has 8s from column 2 to 8. Then in row 3, the input has 4 in column 2, and the output row 3 has 4 in column 2, then 0s, then 5s and 3s. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, but in the output for row 3 of Example 1, the values are 0 0 4 0 0 5 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is in column 2, but there's a 5 in column 6 and 3 in column 10. Maybe those are from other numbers in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the input are being spread out in a way that depends on their position. For example, numbers in the middle columns are expanded into horizontal lines, while numbers in certain rows are expanded into vertical lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being replaced by a block of the same value, but the block's shape is determined by the position of the number. For example, if the number is in a certain row, it's expanded into a horizontal line, and if in a certain column, into a vertical line.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 3 in column 4 of row 3. The output for that row has 3s from column 4 to 13. So that's a horizontal line. Then the 1 in row 9, column 3 is expanded into a vertical line. Wait, in the output for row 9 of Example 3, the values are 0 0 1 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0. So the 1 is in column 3, but there are 5s and 6s in columns 7 and 13. Maybe that's not a vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their value. For example, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 are expanded into horizontal lines, while 2, 3, 7 are expanded into vertical lines. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The 8 in the input is in row 1, column 5. The output for that row has 8s from column 2 to 8. So that's a horizontal line of 7 columns. Then in row 2, the input has 8 in column 5. The output for that row is all 8s from column 2 to 8. Similarly, in row 3, the input has 4 in column 2, and the output has 4 in column 2, but then 5s and 3s. Wait, maybe the 4 is part of a vertical block. But in the output, row 3 has 4 in column 2, row 4 also has 4 in column 2, row 5 also has 4, etc. So that's a vertical line of 4s in column 2. But then in row 3, column 6 is 5, which is from another input number?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their position. For example, if a number is in column 2, then in the output, that column is filled with that number. If it's in column 5, then it's spread across columns 2-8. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output of Example 1. The 8 in row 1, column 5 is expanded into a horizontal line of 8s. Then in row 2, the input has 8 in column 5, which is also expanded into a horizontal line. Then in row 3, the input has 4 in column 2. The output for that row has 4 in column 2, but also 5s and 3s. But in the output, row 3, column 6 is 5, which is from the input row 5, column 6. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by a block that spans certain columns. For example, if a number is in column x, then in the output, the same number is spread across columns from x to x + some value. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The 8 in row 1, column 5 becomes a horizontal line from column 2 to 8. The length of that line is 7 columns. The input's row 1 has 8 in column 5. Maybe that's because the 8 is in the middle of the grid, so it's expanded into a horizontal line that starts at column 2 and ends at column 8. Similarly, the 4 in row 4, column 2 is expanded into a vertical line of 4s in column 2. Then in the output, rows 4-8 have 4 in column 2, but also other numbers.\n\nBut how to determine that. Maybe the numbers in the input are being expanded into a block that spans certain columns based on their position. For example, if a number is in column 2, then in the output, that column is filled with that number. If it's in column 5, then it's expanded into a horizontal line from column 2 to 8. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their value. For example, 8 is expanded into a horizontal line, while 4 is expanded into a vertical line. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output of Example 3. The input has a 3 in column 4 of row 3. The output for that row has 3s from column 4 to 13. So that's a horizontal line. Then the input has a 2 in row 6, column 7. The output for that row has 2 in column 7, but also 5s and 6s. Maybe the 2 is part of a vertical line. But how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, the number in the input is expanded into a horizontal line and a vertical line. But how.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each non-zero value in the input is replaced by a block of the same value. The block's shape depends on the position. For example, numbers in the first few columns are expanded into vertical lines, while numbers in the middle are expanded into horizontal lines.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to look for a pattern that can be generalized.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the 8 in row 1, column 5 is expanded into a horizontal line. The 4 in row 4, column 2 is expanded into a vertical line. The 2 in row 7, column 7 is expanded into a horizontal line. The 6 in row 12, column 4 is expanded into a horizontal line. The 9 in row 13, column 5 is expanded into a horizontal line.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output for row 7 has 4 in column 2, and then 5s and 3s. But in row 7, the input is 0 0 4 0 0 5 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is in column 2, and the 5 is in column 6, and 3 in column 10. Maybe those are from other numbers in the input. For example, the 5 in column 6 is from row 5, column 6. The 3 in column 10 is from row 5, column 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the input are being spread out in a way that depends on their position. For example, if a number is in column 2, then in the output, that column is filled with that number. If a number is in column 5, then in the output, that column is filled with that number. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their position in the grid. For example, if a number is in the middle of the grid (like column 5), it's expanded into a horizontal line. If it's in the left side (column 2), it's expanded into a vertical line.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the output of Example 1. The 8 in row 1, column 5 becomes a horizontal line from column 2 to 8. The length of this line is 7 columns. The input's row 1 has 8 in column 5. So maybe the horizontal line starts at column 2 and ends at column 8. But why those columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a block that covers certain regions based on their position. For example, numbers in the first few rows are expanded into horizontal lines, while numbers in other rows are expanded into vertical lines. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their value. For example, 8 is expanded into a horizontal line, while 4 is expanded into a vertical line. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a block that spans certain columns. For example, if a number is in column x, then in the output, the same number is spread across columns from x to x + some value. For example, in Example 1, the 8 in column 5 is spread from column 2 to 8. That's a span of 7 columns. The 4 in column 2 is spread from column 2 to 5 (but in the output, row 3 has 4 in column 2, but then in row 4, column 2 is 4, etc. So that's a vertical line.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the output as a grid where each non-zero value in the input is replaced by a block that is either a horizontal line or vertical line, depending on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their position in the grid. For example, numbers in certain rows are expanded into horizontal lines, and others into vertical lines.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the numbers are being expanded into a block that covers certain columns based on their position. For example, if a number is in column 2, then in the output, that column is filled with the number. If it's in column 5, then it's expanded into a horizontal line from column 2 to 8. If it's in column 7, then it's expanded into a horizontal line from column 5 to 13. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a block that covers certain columns based on their position. For example, if a number is in column x, then in the output, the same number is spread across columns from x to x + some value. But what's the value?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each non-zero value is replaced by a block that is a cross. For example, if a number is in (i,j), then in the output, the same number is spread across (i, j) and all surrounding cells. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output of Example 3. The input has a 3 in row 3, column 4. The output has 3s from column 4 to 13. So that's a horizontal line. The input has a 1 in row 9, column 3. The output has 1 in column 3, but also 5s and 6s. Maybe that's not a horizontal line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a block that spans from their column to the end of the row. For example, if a number is in column x, then in the output, the same number is spread across columns x to 14 (since the grid is 14 columns). But in Example 1, the 8 in column 5 is expanded into columns 2-8, which is not from column 5 to 14. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's think of the output of Example 1. The input has an 8 in row 1, column 5. The output for that row has 8s from column 2 to 8. That's 7 columns. The input has a 4 in row 4, column 2. The output for that row has 4 in column 2. Then in row 5, column 2 is 4. So that's a vertical line. Then in row 6, column 2 is 4. So that's a vertical line of 4s in column 2.\n\nSo maybe the numbers in the input are being expanded into vertical lines if they are in the left part of the grid, and into horizontal lines if they are in the middle. For example, if a number is in column 2, it's expanded into a vertical line. If it's in column 5, it's expanded into a horizontal line.\n\nBut how to determine that. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 3 in column 4, which is expanded into a horizontal line. The input has a 1 in column 3, which is expanded into a vertical line. So that seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for each non-zero value in the input, if it's in column 2, expand into a vertical line (same column, all rows). If it's in column 5, expand into a horizontal line (same row, from column 2 to 8). If it's in column 7, expand into a horizontal line from column 5 to 13. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion depends on the column of the input number. For example:\n\n- If the input number is in column 2, expand into a vertical line (same column, all rows).\n- If the input number is in column 5, expand into a horizontal line from column 2 to 8.\n- If the input number is in column 7, expand into a horizontal line from column 5 to 13.\n- If the input number is in column 13, expand into a horizontal line from column 10 to 14.\n\nBut this is just a guess. How to verify?\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the 8 in column 5 is expanded into a horizontal line from column 2 to 8. The 4 in column 2 is expanded into a vertical line. The 2 in column 7 is expanded into a horizontal line from column 5 to 13? In the output of Example 1, row 7 has 4 in column 2, and in row 7, column 7 is 5. But the input for row 7, column 7 is 2. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is based on the row and column of the input number. For example, if the input number is in row i, column j, then in the output, the same number is expanded into a block that covers certain rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as having regions where certain numbers are spread out. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in row 1, column 5. The output for that row has 8s from column 2 to 8. Then in row 2, the same 8 is expanded into the same horizontal line. Then in row 3, the 4 is expanded into a vertical line. So maybe the numbers are being expanded into blocks that are either horizontal or vertical, depending on their position.\n\nBut how to determine which is which. Maybe the numbers in the middle of the grid (like column 5) are expanded into horizontal lines, while numbers in the left or right are expanded into vertical lines.\n\nBut this is still unclear. Another approach: Let's look at the output of Example 2. The input has a 4 in row 2, column 6. The output for that row has 4s from column 4 to 10. So that's a horizontal line. Then in row 5, the input has a 7 in column 10. The output for that row has 7 in column 10. But in the output, that row has 7 in column 10 and others. Maybe that's part of a vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a horizontal line if they are in the middle columns, and into a vertical line if they are in the left or right columns.\n\nBut how to determine this. Maybe the expansion is based on the column of the input number. For example, if the input number is in column 2, expand into a vertical line. If it's in column 5, expand into a horizontal line. If it's in column 7, expand into a horizontal line. If it's in column 13, expand into a horizontal line.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to code this.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each cell in the input grid, if the value is non-zero, then in the output grid, replace it with a block of the same value. The block's shape depends on the column of the input cell.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the input cell is in column 2, then in the output, that column is filled with the value.\n- If the input cell is in column 5, then in the output, the same value is spread across the entire row from column 2 to 8.\n- If the input cell is in column 7, then in the output, the same value is spread across the entire row from column 5 to 13.\n- If the input cell is in column 13, then in the output, the same value is spread across the entire row from column 10 to 14.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to expand. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in column 5, so it's expanded into a horizontal line from column 2 to 8. The 4 is in column 2, so it's expanded into a vertical line. The 2 is in column 7, so it's expanded into a horizontal line from column 5 to 13. But in the output, row 7 of Example 1 has 4 in column 2, which is part of a vertical line. Then in row 7, column 7 is 5, which is from another input number.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's try to code this.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j) in the input:\n\nif the value is non-zero:\n\n- if j is 2: then in the output, for all rows, column 2 is set to this value.\n- if j is 5: then in the output, for row i, columns 2-8 are set to this value.\n- if j is 7: then in the output, for row i, columns 5-13 are set to this value.\n- if j is 13: then in the output, for row i, columns 10-14 are set to this value.\n\nBut how to handle other columns. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 3 in column 4. The output for that row has 3s from column 4 to 13. So that's a horizontal line from column 4 to 13. So maybe for j=4, the expansion is from column 4 to 13.\n\nBut how to determine the range for each column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion depends on the column's position. For example, for columns 2, 5, 7, 13, etc., the expansion is a horizontal line, and for other columns, it's a vertical line.\n\nBut this is not clear. Another approach: look for the positions of the numbers in the output and see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 is in column 5, and the output for that row has 8s from column 2 to 8. The length is 7 columns. So from column 2 to 8, which is 7 columns (columns 2-8 inclusive is 7 columns: 8-2+1=7).\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3, the 3 is in column 4, and the output for that row has 3s from column 4 to 13. That's 10 columns (13-4+1=10).\n\nIn Example 2, the 4 is in column 6, and the output for that row has 4s from column 4 to 10. That's 7 columns (10-4+1=7).\n\nSo for columns 2, 5, 6, 7, 13, etc., the expansion is a horizontal line from a certain start column to end column.\n\nBut what determines the start and end columns?\n\nIn Example 1, column 5: start is 2, end is 8. 2 is column 2, 8 is column 8. The difference is 6 columns.\n\nIn Example 2, column 6: start is 4, end is 10. 4 is column 4, 10 is column 10. The difference is 6 columns.\n\nIn Example 3, column 4: start is 4, end is 13. Difference is 9 columns.\n\nHmm, this seems inconsistent. But maybe there's a pattern based on the column number.\n\nFor example, if the column is 2, then the expansion is a vertical line. If the column is 5, the expansion is a horizontal line from 2 to 8 (columns 2-8). If the column is 6, the expansion is a horizontal line from 4 to 10 (columns 4-10). If the column is 7, the expansion is a horizontal line from 5 to 13 (columns 5-13). If the column is 13, the expansion is a horizontal line from 10 to 14 (columns 10-14).\n\nBut how to determine this. It seems that for columns 5, 6, 7, the start is column 2, 4, 5, respectively. The end is column 8, 10, 13.\n\nBut why?\n\nMaybe the start is column 2, and the end is column 8 for column 5. For column 6, start is column 4, end is 10. For column 7, start is 5, end is 13.\n\nThis seems arbitrary. But perhaps the start is column 2 + (j-2), and the end is column 8 + (j-5). Or some other formula.\n\nAlternatively, for column j, the start is column 2, and the end is column 8 if j is 5, start is 4, end is 10 if j is 6, start is 5, end is 13 if j is 7, and so on.\n\nBut this is not clear. Another observation: in Example 1, the 8 is in column 5, and the expansion is from 2 to 8 (7 columns). In Example 2, the 4 is in column 6, expansion is 4 to 10 (7 columns). In Example 3, the 3 is in column 4, expansion is 4 to 13 (10 columns). So the length varies.\n\nThis suggests that the expansion is not consistent. Perhaps the expansion is based on the position of the number in the grid. For example, numbers in certain rows or columns are expanded into certain shapes.\n\nBut this is too vague. Another approach: perhaps the expansion is based on the value of the number. For example, 8 is expanded into a horizontal line, 4 into vertical, 2 into horizontal, etc. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a block that covers certain regions based on their value. For example, 8 is expanded into a horizontal line, 4 into a vertical line, 2 into a horizontal line, 6 into a horizontal line, 9 into a horizontal line.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given the time I have, I need to make a hypothesis and code it.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each non-zero value in the input, if it is in column 2, then in the output, that column is filled with the value. If it is in column 5, then in the output, the same value is spread across the entire row from column 2 to 8. If it is in column 7, then spread from column 5 to 13. If it is in column 13, spread from column 10 to 14. For other columns, perhaps it's expanded into a vertical line, or left as is.\n\nBut this is a guess. Let's try to code this.\n\nSo, for each cell in the input grid:\n\nif value is 0, leave as is.\n\nelse:\n\n   if column is 2: set all rows in column 2 to the value.\n\n   elif column is 5: set the current row's columns 2-8 to the value.\n\n   elif column is 7: set current row's columns 5-13 to the value.\n\n   elif column is 13: set current row's columns 10-14 to the value.\n\n   else: maybe set the current row's column to the value, or set it to 0?\n\nBut this may not cover all cases. For example, in Example 3, the 3 is in column 4. According to this, it would not be covered by any of the conditions. So, perhaps this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is based on the column's position in the grid. For example, if the column is 2, 5, 7, or 13, then expand into a horizontal line. Otherwise, expand into a vertical line.\n\nBut how to determine the start and end columns for the horizontal lines.\n\nAlternatively, think that the horizontal lines are for columns 2, 5, 7, 13, etc., and the start and end are determined by the column. For example, for column 2, the horizontal line is from column 2 to 14 (but this doesn't fit the examples).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal lines are for columns 5, 6, 7, and the start and end are determined by the column. For example:\n\n- column 5: start 2, end 8 (7 columns)\n- column 6: start 4, end 10 (7 columns)\n- column 7: start 5, end 13 (9 columns)\n- column 13: start 10, end 14 (5 columns)\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with this hypothesis.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\nif grid[i][j] != 0:\n\n   if j == 2:\n\n       for all rows k in 0-13:\n\n           output[k][2] = grid[i][j]\n\n   elif j == 5:\n\n       for all columns in 2-8:\n\n           output[i][col] = grid[i][j]\n\n   elif j == 7:\n\n       for all columns in 5-13:\n\n           output[i][col] = grid[i][j]\n\n   elif j == 13:\n\n       for all columns in 10-14:\n\n           output[i][col] = grid[i][j]\n\n   else:\n\n       # maybe expand into vertical line or something else\n\n       for all rows k in 0-13:\n\n           output[k][j] = grid[i][j]\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's see if it fits the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 is in column 5. So, in the output, for row 1, columns 2-8 are set to 8. This matches the output.\n\nThe 4 in column 2 is set for all rows, so in output, column 2 is 4 for all rows. This matches the output.\n\nThe 2 in column 7 is set for columns 5-13 in row 7. But in the output, row 7 has 4 in column 2, and 5 in column 6, etc. So this may not fit.\n\nBut perhaps this is not the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is for the current row only. For example, if the input cell is in column 5, then in the output, the same value is spread across the entire row from column 2 to 8. This would explain the first example.\n\nBut in Example 3, the 3 is in column 4. According to this, it would be expanded into columns 2-8, but in the output, it's from column 4 to 13. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the output as having certain regions where the numbers are spread out. For example, the output for Example 1 has a horizontal line for column 5, a vertical line for column 2, and a horizontal line for column 7.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for row 7 has 4 in column 2, and in the output, columns 5-13 are filled with 5s and 3s. But the input for row 7, column 7 is 2. So perhaps the 2 is expanded into a horizontal line from column 5 to 13. But in the output, row 7 has 5 in column 6 and 3 in column 10. This suggests that the 2 is not being expanded, but other numbers are.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each non-zero value in the input, if it's in column 2, expand into a vertical line. If it's in column 5, expand into a horizontal line from column 2 to 8. If it's in column 7, expand into a horizontal line from column 5 to 13. If it's in column 13, expand into a horizontal line from 10 to 14. For other columns, expand into a vertical line.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(15)]\n    for i in range(15):\n        for j in range(14):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            if val == 0:\n                continue\n            if j == 2:\n                for k in range(15):\n                    output[k][2] = val\n            elif j == 5:\n                for col in range(2, 9):  # columns 2 to 8 inclusive\n                    output[i][col] = val\n            elif j == 7:\n                for col in range(5, 14):  # columns 5 to 13 inclusive\n                    output[i][col] = val\n            elif j == 13:\n                for col in range(10, 15):  # columns 10 to 14 inclusive\n                    output[i][col] = val\n            else:\n                # expand into vertical line\n                for k in range(15):\n                    output[k][j] = val\n    return output\n\nBut this may not handle all cases. For example, in Example 3, the 3 is in column 4. According to this, it would expand into a vertical line. But in the output, it's expanded into a horizontal line from column 4 to 13. So this code would not handle that.\n\nBut given the time, this is the best I can do. Let's test this code against the examples.\n\nFor Example 1:\n\nInput has 8 in (1,5). So j=5, so expand row 1, columns 2-8 to 8. This matches the output.\n\nInput has 4 in (4,2). j=2, so expand all rows, column 2 to 4. This matches the output.\n\nInput has 2 in (7,7). j=7, so expand row 7, columns 5-13 to 2. But in the output, row 7 has 4 in column 2, 5 in column 6, 3 in column 10. So this code would set columns 5-13 to 2, which doesn't match the output. So this code would be incorrect.\n\nHmm. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the expansion is based on the row. For example, if the input number is in row 0, expand into a horizontal line, and for other rows, expand into a vertical line. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, if a number is in (i,j), then in the output, the same number is spread across the entire row and column.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that handles the examples I can see, even if it's not perfect. The code may not handle all cases, but it's the best I can do.\n"

I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some numbers in specific positions. The output seems to expand those numbers into a block. For instance, the input has an 8 in position (1,5). In the output, that row becomes all 8s from column 2 to 8. Similarly, the 4 in input (4,2) becomes a block of 4s in the output. Wait, but in the output, that row has 4s in columns 2 and 5, but also some 5s and 3s. Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me check again.\n\nWait in Example 1's output, the second row has 8s from column 2 to 8. The input had an 8 in (1,5). So maybe that 8 is expanding into a horizontal line. But the third row in the input has a 4 in (4,2). The output for that row has 4s in columns 2 and 5, but also 5s and 3s. Wait, maybe the 4 is expanding into a vertical block? Or maybe the numbers are being spread out in some way.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has a 4 in (2,6). The output for that row has 4s in columns 4 to 10. Wait, maybe the 4 is expanding into a horizontal block. Then in another part, there's a 7 in (5,10), which in the output becomes a vertical block. Wait, the output for that row has 7 in column 10. But in the output, the row has 7 in column 10 and others. Hmm, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a certain way based on their position.\n\nLooking at Example 3: The input has a 3 in (3,4). The output for that row has 3s from column 4 to 13. So that's a horizontal expansion. Then there's a 2 in (6,7), which in the output becomes a vertical block. Wait, the output for that row has 2 in column 7, but also 5s and 6s. Maybe the 2 is part of a vertical block. Also, there's a 9 in (13,5) which becomes 9s in columns 5 to 13.\n\nSo maybe the pattern is that whenever there's a non-zero number in the input, it's expanding into a block of that number in the output. But how?\n\nAnother observation: In Example 1, the 8 in the input is in row 1, column 5. The output row 1 has 8s from column 2 to 8. So that's a horizontal line. Similarly, the 4 in input row 4, column 2 becomes a block in the output row 4, columns 2 to 5? Wait, in the output, row 4 has 4 in column 2, then 0s, then 5s and 3s. Hmm, maybe not. Wait the output for example 1's row 4 is:\n\n0 0 4 0 0 5 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait that's not a block. Maybe the 4 is in the middle of a larger pattern. Maybe the numbers are being spread out in a certain way based on their position. Or perhaps the numbers are being replaced by a block that depends on their position and value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, in Example 3, the 3 in (3,4) becomes a horizontal line of 3s from column 4 to 13. Then the 1 in (9,3) becomes a vertical line of 1s from column 3 to 13. Wait, no. Looking at Example 3's output, row 9 has 1 in column 3, then 0s, then 5s, then 6s. Wait, maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero numbers in the input are being expanded into a block that spans certain columns. For example, if a number is in a certain column, it's expanded to fill a range of columns. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in column 5, and the output row has 8s from column 2 to 8. That's a span of 7 columns. Maybe that's a pattern where the number is expanded into a horizontal line starting from column 2 to column 8. But why column 2?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their position. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in row 1, column 5. The output for that row has 8s from column 2 to 8. So that's a span of 7 columns. Maybe the number is expanded into a horizontal line that starts at column 2 and ends at column 8. But why?\n\nLooking at Example 3, the 3 is in row 3, column 4. The output for that row has 3s from column 4 to 13. That's a span of 10 columns. So maybe the number is expanded into a horizontal line from column 4 to column 13. But that's 10 columns. Wait, the input is 14 columns. So maybe the expansion is from the column of the number to the end, but that doesn't fit. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in column 5, and the output has 8s from column 2 to 8. That's not the same as starting from column 5.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a block that covers certain regions. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in column 5, and the output has 8s in columns 2-8. That's a span of 7 columns. But how is that determined?\n\nAnother approach: Maybe the numbers in the input are being replaced by a block of the same number in the output, but the block's shape depends on their position. For example, if a number is in the middle of the grid, it's expanded into a horizontal line. If it's in a certain row or column, it's expanded into a vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their value. For example, 8 in Example 1 is expanded into a horizontal line, but 4 is expanded into a vertical line. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nLooking at Example 2: The input has a 4 in row 2, column 6. The output row 2 has 4s from column 4 to 10. So that's a horizontal line. Then there's a 7 in row 5, column 10. The output row 5 has 7 in column 10. But in the output, that row has 7 in column 10 and others. Maybe the 7 is expanded into a vertical line. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their position in the grid. For example, numbers in certain rows or columns are expanded into horizontal or vertical lines.\n\nAnother observation: In Example 3, the input has a 2 in row 6, column 7. The output for that row has 2 in column 7, but also 5s and 6s. But in the output, there's a 2 in column 7 and then 5s in columns 7 and beyond? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being replaced by a block that spans certain columns. For example, if a number is in column x, then in the output, the same number is spread across columns from x to x + some value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a cross shape. For example, if a number is in a certain position, it's expanded into a cross that covers columns and rows around it. But that's more complex.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output of Example 1. The 8 is in row 1, column 5. The output row 1 has 8s from column 2 to 8. So that's a horizontal line. Then in row 2, the input has 0s except for column 5 (value 8). The output row 2 has 8s from column 2 to 8. Then in row 3, the input has 4 in column 2, and the output row 3 has 4 in column 2, then 0s, then 5s and 3s. Hmm, that doesn't fit. Wait, but in the output for row 3 of Example 1, the values are 0 0 4 0 0 5 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is in column 2, but there's a 5 in column 6 and 3 in column 10. Maybe those are from other numbers in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the input are being spread out in a way that depends on their position. For example, numbers in the middle columns are expanded into horizontal lines, while numbers in certain rows are expanded into vertical lines.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being replaced by a block of the same value, but the block's shape is determined by the position of the number. For example, if the number is in a certain row, it's expanded into a horizontal line, and if in a certain column, into a vertical line.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 3 in column 4 of row 3. The output for that row has 3s from column 4 to 13. So that's a horizontal line. Then the 1 in row 9, column 3 is expanded into a vertical line. Wait, in the output for row 9 of Example 3, the values are 0 0 1 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0. So the 1 is in column 3, but there are 5s and 6s in columns 7 and 13. Maybe that's not a vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their value. For example, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 are expanded into horizontal lines, while 2, 3, 7 are expanded into vertical lines. But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAnother approach: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The 8 in the input is in row 1, column 5. The output for that row has 8s from column 2 to 8. So that's a horizontal line of 7 columns. Then in row 2, the input has 8 in column 5. The output for that row is all 8s from column 2 to 8. Similarly, in row 3, the input has 4 in column 2, and the output has 4 in column 2, but then 5s and 3s. Wait, maybe the 4 is part of a vertical block. But in the output, row 3 has 4 in column 2, row 4 also has 4 in column 2, row 5 also has 4, etc. So that's a vertical line of 4s in column 2. But then in row 3, column 6 is 5, which is from another input number?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their position. For example, if a number is in column 2, then in the output, that column is filled with that number. If it's in column 5, then it's spread across columns 2-8. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output of Example 1. The 8 in row 1, column 5 is expanded into a horizontal line of 8s. Then in row 2, the input has 8 in column 5, which is also expanded into a horizontal line. Then in row 3, the input has 4 in column 2. The output for that row has 4 in column 2, but also 5s and 3s. But in the output, row 3, column 6 is 5, which is from the input row 5, column 6. Hmm, this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by a block that spans certain columns. For example, if a number is in column x, then in the output, the same number is spread across columns from x to x + some value. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother idea: Let's look at the output of Example 1. The 8 in row 1, column 5 becomes a horizontal line from column 2 to 8. The length of that line is 7 columns. The input's row 1 has 8 in column 5. Maybe that's because the 8 is in the middle of the grid, so it's expanded into a horizontal line that starts at column 2 and ends at column 8. Similarly, the 4 in row 4, column 2 is expanded into a vertical line of 4s in column 2. Then in the output, rows 4-8 have 4 in column 2, but also other numbers.\n\nBut how to determine that. Maybe the numbers in the input are being expanded into a block that spans certain columns based on their position. For example, if a number is in column 2, then in the output, that column is filled with that number. If it's in column 5, then it's expanded into a horizontal line from column 2 to 8. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their value. For example, 8 is expanded into a horizontal line, while 4 is expanded into a vertical line. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output of Example 3. The input has a 3 in column 4 of row 3. The output for that row has 3s from column 4 to 13. So that's a horizontal line. Then the input has a 2 in row 6, column 7. The output for that row has 2 in column 7, but also 5s and 6s. Maybe the 2 is part of a vertical line. But how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, the number in the input is expanded into a horizontal line and a vertical line. But how.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each non-zero value in the input is replaced by a block of the same value. The block's shape depends on the position. For example, numbers in the first few columns are expanded into vertical lines, while numbers in the middle are expanded into horizontal lines.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to look for a pattern that can be generalized.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the 8 in row 1, column 5 is expanded into a horizontal line. The 4 in row 4, column 2 is expanded into a vertical line. The 2 in row 7, column 7 is expanded into a horizontal line. The 6 in row 12, column 4 is expanded into a horizontal line. The 9 in row 13, column 5 is expanded into a horizontal line.\n\nWait, in Example 1, the output for row 7 has 4 in column 2, and then 5s and 3s. But in row 7, the input is 0 0 4 0 0 5 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0. So the 4 is in column 2, and the 5 is in column 6, and 3 in column 10. Maybe those are from other numbers in the input. For example, the 5 in column 6 is from row 5, column 6. The 3 in column 10 is from row 5, column 10.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers in the input are being spread out in a way that depends on their position. For example, if a number is in column 2, then in the output, that column is filled with that number. If a number is in column 5, then in the output, that column is filled with that number. But that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their position in the grid. For example, if a number is in the middle of the grid (like column 5), it's expanded into a horizontal line. If it's in the left side (column 2), it's expanded into a vertical line.\n\nAnother approach: Let's think about the output of Example 1. The 8 in row 1, column 5 becomes a horizontal line from column 2 to 8. The length of this line is 7 columns. The input's row 1 has 8 in column 5. So maybe the horizontal line starts at column 2 and ends at column 8. But why those columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a block that covers certain regions based on their position. For example, numbers in the first few rows are expanded into horizontal lines, while numbers in other rows are expanded into vertical lines. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their value. For example, 8 is expanded into a horizontal line, while 4 is expanded into a vertical line. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a block that spans certain columns. For example, if a number is in column x, then in the output, the same number is spread across columns from x to x + some value. For example, in Example 1, the 8 in column 5 is spread from column 2 to 8. That's a span of 7 columns. The 4 in column 2 is spread from column 2 to 5 (but in the output, row 3 has 4 in column 2, but then in row 4, column 2 is 4, etc. So that's a vertical line.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the output as a grid where each non-zero value in the input is replaced by a block that is either a horizontal line or vertical line, depending on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a way that depends on their position in the grid. For example, numbers in certain rows are expanded into horizontal lines, and others into vertical lines.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's think of another approach. Maybe the numbers are being expanded into a block that covers certain columns based on their position. For example, if a number is in column 2, then in the output, that column is filled with the number. If it's in column 5, then it's expanded into a horizontal line from column 2 to 8. If it's in column 7, then it's expanded into a horizontal line from column 5 to 13. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a block that covers certain columns based on their position. For example, if a number is in column x, then in the output, the same number is spread across columns from x to x + some value. But what's the value?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each non-zero value is replaced by a block that is a cross. For example, if a number is in (i,j), then in the output, the same number is spread across (i, j) and all surrounding cells. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think about the output of Example 3. The input has a 3 in row 3, column 4. The output has 3s from column 4 to 13. So that's a horizontal line. The input has a 1 in row 9, column 3. The output has 1 in column 3, but also 5s and 6s. Maybe that's not a horizontal line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a block that spans from their column to the end of the row. For example, if a number is in column x, then in the output, the same number is spread across columns x to 14 (since the grid is 14 columns). But in Example 1, the 8 in column 5 is expanded into columns 2-8, which is not from column 5 to 14. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let's think of the output of Example 1. The input has an 8 in row 1, column 5. The output for that row has 8s from column 2 to 8. That's 7 columns. The input has a 4 in row 4, column 2. The output for that row has 4 in column 2. Then in row 5, column 2 is 4. So that's a vertical line. Then in row 6, column 2 is 4. So that's a vertical line of 4s in column 2.\n\nSo maybe the numbers in the input are being expanded into vertical lines if they are in the left part of the grid, and into horizontal lines if they are in the middle. For example, if a number is in column 2, it's expanded into a vertical line. If it's in column 5, it's expanded into a horizontal line.\n\nBut how to determine that. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 3 in column 4, which is expanded into a horizontal line. The input has a 1 in column 3, which is expanded into a vertical line. So that seems to fit.\n\nSo the pattern could be: for each non-zero value in the input, if it's in column 2, expand into a vertical line (same column, all rows). If it's in column 5, expand into a horizontal line (same row, from column 2 to 8). If it's in column 7, expand into a horizontal line from column 5 to 13. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion depends on the column of the input number. For example:\n\n- If the input number is in column 2, expand into a vertical line (same column, all rows).\n- If the input number is in column 5, expand into a horizontal line from column 2 to 8.\n- If the input number is in column 7, expand into a horizontal line from column 5 to 13.\n- If the input number is in column 13, expand into a horizontal line from column 10 to 14.\n\nBut this is just a guess. How to verify?\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the 8 in column 5 is expanded into a horizontal line from column 2 to 8. The 4 in column 2 is expanded into a vertical line. The 2 in column 7 is expanded into a horizontal line from column 5 to 13? In the output of Example 1, row 7 has 4 in column 2, and in row 7, column 7 is 5. But the input for row 7, column 7 is 2. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is based on the row and column of the input number. For example, if the input number is in row i, column j, then in the output, the same number is expanded into a block that covers certain rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as having regions where certain numbers are spread out. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in row 1, column 5. The output for that row has 8s from column 2 to 8. Then in row 2, the same 8 is expanded into the same horizontal line. Then in row 3, the 4 is expanded into a vertical line. So maybe the numbers are being expanded into blocks that are either horizontal or vertical, depending on their position.\n\nBut how to determine which is which. Maybe the numbers in the middle of the grid (like column 5) are expanded into horizontal lines, while numbers in the left or right are expanded into vertical lines.\n\nBut this is still unclear. Another approach: Let's look at the output of Example 2. The input has a 4 in row 2, column 6. The output for that row has 4s from column 4 to 10. So that's a horizontal line. Then in row 5, the input has a 7 in column 10. The output for that row has 7 in column 10. But in the output, that row has 7 in column 10 and others. Maybe that's part of a vertical line.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a horizontal line if they are in the middle columns, and into a vertical line if they are in the left or right columns.\n\nBut how to determine this. Maybe the expansion is based on the column of the input number. For example, if the input number is in column 2, expand into a vertical line. If it's in column 5, expand into a horizontal line. If it's in column 7, expand into a horizontal line. If it's in column 13, expand into a horizontal line.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's try to code this.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each cell in the input grid, if the value is non-zero, then in the output grid, replace it with a block of the same value. The block's shape depends on the column of the input cell.\n\nFor example:\n\n- If the input cell is in column 2, then in the output, that column is filled with the value.\n- If the input cell is in column 5, then in the output, the same value is spread across the entire row from column 2 to 8.\n- If the input cell is in column 7, then in the output, the same value is spread across the entire row from column 5 to 13.\n- If the input cell is in column 13, then in the output, the same value is spread across the entire row from column 10 to 14.\n\nBut how to determine which columns to expand. For example, in Example 1, the 8 is in column 5, so it's expanded into a horizontal line from column 2 to 8. The 4 is in column 2, so it's expanded into a vertical line. The 2 is in column 7, so it's expanded into a horizontal line from column 5 to 13. But in the output, row 7 of Example 1 has 4 in column 2, which is part of a vertical line. Then in row 7, column 7 is 5, which is from another input number.\n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. Let's try to code this.\n\nSo, for each cell (i,j) in the input:\n\nif the value is non-zero:\n\n- if j is 2: then in the output, for all rows, column 2 is set to this value.\n- if j is 5: then in the output, for row i, columns 2-8 are set to this value.\n- if j is 7: then in the output, for row i, columns 5-13 are set to this value.\n- if j is 13: then in the output, for row i, columns 10-14 are set to this value.\n\nBut how to handle other columns. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 3 in column 4. The output for that row has 3s from column 4 to 13. So that's a horizontal line from column 4 to 13. So maybe for j=4, the expansion is from column 4 to 13.\n\nBut how to determine the range for each column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion depends on the column's position. For example, for columns 2, 5, 7, 13, etc., the expansion is a horizontal line, and for other columns, it's a vertical line.\n\nBut this is not clear. Another approach: look for the positions of the numbers in the output and see if there's a pattern.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 is in column 5, and the output for that row has 8s from column 2 to 8. The length is 7 columns. So from column 2 to 8, which is 7 columns (columns 2-8 inclusive is 7 columns: 8-2+1=7).\n\nSimilarly, in Example 3, the 3 is in column 4, and the output for that row has 3s from column 4 to 13. That's 10 columns (13-4+1=10).\n\nIn Example 2, the 4 is in column 6, and the output for that row has 4s from column 4 to 10. That's 7 columns (10-4+1=7).\n\nSo for columns 2, 5, 6, 7, 13, etc., the expansion is a horizontal line from a certain start column to end column.\n\nBut what determines the start and end columns?\n\nIn Example 1, column 5: start is 2, end is 8. 2 is column 2, 8 is column 8. The difference is 6 columns.\n\nIn Example 2, column 6: start is 4, end is 10. 4 is column 4, 10 is column 10. The difference is 6 columns.\n\nIn Example 3, column 4: start is 4, end is 13. Difference is 9 columns.\n\nHmm, this seems inconsistent. But maybe there's a pattern based on the column number.\n\nFor example, if the column is 2, then the expansion is a vertical line. If the column is 5, the expansion is a horizontal line from 2 to 8 (columns 2-8). If the column is 6, the expansion is a horizontal line from 4 to 10 (columns 4-10). If the column is 7, the expansion is a horizontal line from 5 to 13 (columns 5-13). If the column is 13, the expansion is a horizontal line from 10 to 14 (columns 10-14).\n\nBut how to determine this. It seems that for columns 5, 6, 7, the start is column 2, 4, 5, respectively. The end is column 8, 10, 13.\n\nBut why?\n\nMaybe the start is column 2, and the end is column 8 for column 5. For column 6, start is column 4, end is 10. For column 7, start is 5, end is 13.\n\nThis seems arbitrary. But perhaps the start is column 2 + (j-2), and the end is column 8 + (j-5). Or some other formula.\n\nAlternatively, for column j, the start is column 2, and the end is column 8 if j is 5, start is 4, end is 10 if j is 6, start is 5, end is 13 if j is 7, and so on.\n\nBut this is not clear. Another observation: in Example 1, the 8 is in column 5, and the expansion is from 2 to 8 (7 columns). In Example 2, the 4 is in column 6, expansion is 4 to 10 (7 columns). In Example 3, the 3 is in column 4, expansion is 4 to 13 (10 columns). So the length varies.\n\nThis suggests that the expansion is not consistent. Perhaps the expansion is based on the position of the number in the grid. For example, numbers in certain rows or columns are expanded into certain shapes.\n\nBut this is too vague. Another approach: perhaps the expansion is based on the value of the number. For example, 8 is expanded into a horizontal line, 4 into vertical, 2 into horizontal, etc. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a block that covers certain regions based on their value. For example, 8 is expanded into a horizontal line, 4 into a vertical line, 2 into a horizontal line, 6 into a horizontal line, 9 into a horizontal line.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given the time I have, I need to make a hypothesis and code it.\n\nSo, the plan is: for each non-zero value in the input, if it is in column 2, then in the output, that column is filled with the value. If it is in column 5, then in the output, the same value is spread across the entire row from column 2 to 8. If it is in column 7, then spread from column 5 to 13. If it is in column 13, spread from column 10 to 14. For other columns, perhaps it's expanded into a vertical line, or left as is.\n\nBut this is a guess. Let's try to code this.\n\nSo, for each cell in the input grid:\n\nif value is 0, leave as is.\n\nelse:\n\n   if column is 2: set all rows in column 2 to the value.\n\n   elif column is 5: set the current row's columns 2-8 to the value.\n\n   elif column is 7: set current row's columns 5-13 to the value.\n\n   elif column is 13: set current row's columns 10-14 to the value.\n\n   else: maybe set the current row's column to the value, or set it to 0?\n\nBut this may not cover all cases. For example, in Example 3, the 3 is in column 4. According to this, it would not be covered by any of the conditions. So, perhaps this approach is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is based on the column's position in the grid. For example, if the column is 2, 5, 7, or 13, then expand into a horizontal line. Otherwise, expand into a vertical line.\n\nBut how to determine the start and end columns for the horizontal lines.\n\nAlternatively, think that the horizontal lines are for columns 2, 5, 7, 13, etc., and the start and end are determined by the column. For example, for column 2, the horizontal line is from column 2 to 14 (but this doesn't fit the examples).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the horizontal lines are for columns 5, 6, 7, and the start and end are determined by the column. For example:\n\n- column 5: start 2, end 8 (7 columns)\n- column 6: start 4, end 10 (7 columns)\n- column 7: start 5, end 13 (9 columns)\n- column 13: start 10, end 14 (5 columns)\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with this hypothesis.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n\nif grid[i][j] != 0:\n\n   if j == 2:\n\n       for all rows k in 0-13:\n\n           output[k][2] = grid[i][j]\n\n   elif j == 5:\n\n       for all columns in 2-8:\n\n           output[i][col] = grid[i][j]\n\n   elif j == 7:\n\n       for all columns in 5-13:\n\n           output[i][col] = grid[i][j]\n\n   elif j == 13:\n\n       for all columns in 10-14:\n\n           output[i][col] = grid[i][j]\n\n   else:\n\n       # maybe expand into vertical line or something else\n\n       for all rows k in 0-13:\n\n           output[k][j] = grid[i][j]\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's see if it fits the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the 8 is in column 5. So, in the output, for row 1, columns 2-8 are set to 8. This matches the output.\n\nThe 4 in column 2 is set for all rows, so in output, column 2 is 4 for all rows. This matches the output.\n\nThe 2 in column 7 is set for columns 5-13 in row 7. But in the output, row 7 has 4 in column 2, and 5 in column 6, etc. So this may not fit.\n\nBut perhaps this is not the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is for the current row only. For example, if the input cell is in column 5, then in the output, the same value is spread across the entire row from column 2 to 8. This would explain the first example.\n\nBut in Example 3, the 3 is in column 4. According to this, it would be expanded into columns 2-8, but in the output, it's from column 4 to 13. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should think of the output as having certain regions where the numbers are spread out. For example, the output for Example 1 has a horizontal line for column 5, a vertical line for column 2, and a horizontal line for column 7.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output for row 7 has 4 in column 2, and in the output, columns 5-13 are filled with 5s and 3s. But the input for row 7, column 7 is 2. So perhaps the 2 is expanded into a horizontal line from column 5 to 13. But in the output, row 7 has 5 in column 6 and 3 in column 10. This suggests that the 2 is not being expanded, but other numbers are.\n\nThis is really challenging. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that for each non-zero value in the input, if it's in column 2, expand into a vertical line. If it's in column 5, expand into a horizontal line from column 2 to 8. If it's in column 7, expand into a horizontal line from column 5 to 13. If it's in column 13, expand into a horizontal line from 10 to 14. For other columns, expand into a vertical line.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(15)]\n    for i in range(15):\n        for j in range(14):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            if val == 0:\n                continue\n            if j == 2:\n                for k in range(15):\n                    output[k][2] = val\n            elif j == 5:\n                for col in range(2, 9):  # columns 2 to 8 inclusive\n                    output[i][col] = val\n            elif j == 7:\n                for col in range(5, 14):  # columns 5 to 13 inclusive\n                    output[i][col] = val\n            elif j == 13:\n                for col in range(10, 15):  # columns 10 to 14 inclusive\n                    output[i][col] = val\n            else:\n                # expand into vertical line\n                for k in range(15):\n                    output[k][j] = val\n    return output\n\nBut this may not handle all cases. For example, in Example 3, the 3 is in column 4. According to this, it would expand into a vertical line. But in the output, it's expanded into a horizontal line from column 4 to 13. So this code would not handle that.\n\nBut given the time, this is the best I can do. Let's test this code against the examples.\n\nFor Example 1:\n\nInput has 8 in (1,5). So j=5, so expand row 1, columns 2-8 to 8. This matches the output.\n\nInput has 4 in (4,2). j=2, so expand all rows, column 2 to 4. This matches the output.\n\nInput has 2 in (7,7). j=7, so expand row 7, columns 5-13 to 2. But in the output, row 7 has 4 in column 2, 5 in column 6, 3 in column 10. So this code would set columns 5-13 to 2, which doesn't match the output. So this code would be incorrect.\n\nHmm. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the expansion is based on the row. For example, if the input number is in row 0, expand into a horizontal line, and for other rows, expand into a vertical line. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, if a number is in (i,j), then in the output, the same number is spread across the entire row and column.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the code that handles the examples I can see, even if it's not perfect. The code may not handle all cases, but it's the best I can do.\n"
