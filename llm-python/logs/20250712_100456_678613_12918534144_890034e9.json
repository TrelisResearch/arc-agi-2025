          "Based on the visual patterns in the training examples:\n\n- Each input contains a large colored square (with a border) in the upper-left.\n- In the output, this same square (with the same size and color structure) is duplicated to the lower-right (in a symmetric position).\n- All other cells are unchanged.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n1. Detect the largest \"bordered-square\" region (border and inner color) in the input.\n2. Copy it diagonally opposite in the grid (i.e., if the top-left corner of the square is at (r, c), copy it so its new top-left corner is at (20-h, 20-w), where h,w are the height and width of the square), such that it's mirrored over the grid center.\n3. Always return a 21x21 grid.\n\nTo do this, we must:\n- Detect the colored \"frame\" (border) and the square's inner color.\n- Determine its size and position (generally appears as a colored 5x5 border of one color with a 3x3 filled square of a different color inside, but by visual inspection here always 5x5 for the outer, 3x3 for inner).\n- Copy all values in that rectangle to the opposite region, taking into account the grid size.\n- Return the new grid.\n\nLet's code this logic.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    H, W = grid.shape\n    # Find all possible 5x5 squares whose border is a single color, inner 3x3 is a single color\n    found = False\n    for r in range(H-4):\n        for c in range(W-4):\n            border = []\n            # top and bottom rows\n            border.extend(grid[r, c:c+5])\n            border.extend(grid[r+4, c:c+5])\n            # left and right columns (without double-counting the corners)\n            border.extend(grid[r+1:r+4, c])\n            border.extend(grid[r+1:r+4, c+4])\n            border = np.array(border)\n            inner = grid[r+1:r+4, c+1:c+4].flatten()\n            # Border color should be single and not same as inner, inner color single\n            if np.all(border == border[0]) and np.all(inner == inner[0]) and border[0] != inner[0]:\n                sqr_info = (r, c, border[0], inner[0])\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found: break\n    # No square found?

              "Based on the visual patterns in the training examples:\n\n- Each input contains a large colored square (with a border) in the upper-left.\n- In the output, this same square (with the same size and color structure) is duplicated to the lower-right (in a symmetric position).\n- All other cells are unchanged.\n\nSo the pattern is:\n1. Detect the largest \"bordered-square\" region (border and inner color) in the input.\n2. Copy it diagonally opposite in the grid (i.e., if the top-left corner of the square is at (r, c), copy it so its new top-left corner is at (20-h, 20-w), where h,w are the height and width of the square), such that it's mirrored over the grid center.\n3. Always return a 21x21 grid.\n\nTo do this, we must:\n- Detect the colored \"frame\" (border) and the square's inner color.\n- Determine its size and position (generally appears as a colored 5x5 border of one color with a 3x3 filled square of a different color inside, but by visual inspection here always 5x5 for the outer, 3x3 for inner).\n- Copy all values in that rectangle to the opposite region, taking into account the grid size.\n- Return the new grid.\n\nLet's code this logic.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    H, W = grid.shape\n    # Find all possible 5x5 squares whose border is a single color, inner 3x3 is a single color\n    found = False\n    for r in range(H-4):\n        for c in range(W-4):\n            border = []\n            # top and bottom rows\n            border.extend(grid[r, c:c+5])\n            border.extend(grid[r+4, c:c+5])\n            # left and right columns (without double-counting the corners)\n            border.extend(grid[r+1:r+4, c])\n            border.extend(grid[r+1:r+4, c+4])\n            border = np.array(border)\n            inner = grid[r+1:r+4, c+1:c+4].flatten()\n            # Border color should be single and not same as inner, inner color single\n            if np.all(border == border[0]) and np.all(inner == inner[0]) and border[0] != inner[0]:\n                sqr_info = (r, c, border[0], inner[0])\n                found = True\n                break\n        if found: break\n    # No square found? Return unchanged (won't happen given training)\n    if not found:\n        return grid.tolist()\n    # Copy the square to the diagonally opposite corner\n    out = grid.copy()\n    sr, sc, border_col, inner_col = sqr_info\n    sz = 5\n    new_sr = H-1 - (sr+sz-1)\n    new_sc = W-1 - (sc+sz-1)\n    # Set border first\n    # top and bottom\n    out[new_sr, new_sc:new_sc+sz] = border_col\n    out[new_sr+sz-1, new_sc:new_sc+sz] = border_col\n    # left and right\n    out[new_sr+1:new_sr+sz-1, new_sc] = border_col\n    out[new_sr+1:new_sr+sz-1, new_sc+sz-1] = border_col\n    # center\n    out[new_sr+1:new_sr+sz-1, new_sc+1:new_sc+sz-1] = inner_col\n    return out.tolist()\n```"
