The output grid seems to be a transformation of the input grid where:\n   - The value 0 is replaced with a value from the input grid\n   - The value 2 is replaced with a value from the input grid\n   - The value 3 is replaced with a value from the input grid\n   - The value 1 is replaced with a value from the input grid\n   - The value 8 is replaced with a value from the input grid\n   - The value 4 is replaced with a value from the input grid\n   - The value 5 is replaced with a value from the input grid\n   - The value 6 is replaced with a value from the input grid\n   - The value 7 is replaced with a value from the input grid\n   - The value 9 is replaced with a value from the input grid\n\nFrom the examples, it seems like the transformation is to replace the value 0 with the value from the input grid that is closest to it in some way.\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that replaces the value 0 with the value from the input grid that is closest to it in some way.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace 0 with the value from the input grid that is closest to it\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Find the closest non-zero value in the same row\n                closest_value = None\n                min_distance = float('inf')\n                for k in range(14):\n                    if grid[i][k] != 0:\n                        distance = abs(grid[i][k] - 0)\n                        if distance < min_distance:\n                            min_distance = distance\n                            closest_value = grid[i][k]\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = closest_value\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid seems to be a transformation of the input grid where certain values are replaced or modified based on their position and value.\n2. Values like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 1 seem to be transformed in specific ways.\n3. There appears to be a pattern where certain values are expanded or replaced based on their position in the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Replaces 0 with 2 in certain positions\n- Replaces 2 with 2 in certain positions\n- Replaces 3 with 3 in certain positions\n- Replaces 4 with 4 in certain positions\n- Replaces 5 with 5 in certain positions\n- Replaces 6 with 6 in certain positions\n- Replaces 8 with 8 in certain positions\n- Replaces 1 with 1 in certain positions\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
