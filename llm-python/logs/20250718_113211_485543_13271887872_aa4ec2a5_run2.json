          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with new values based on their position and context.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain values (like 1s and 4s) are replaced with other values (like 2s, 8s, 6s, etc.) based on their position in the grid.\n3. The transformation seems to involve some kind of spatial pattern recognition, where values are replaced based on their neighbors or their position in the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with new values based on their position and context, with some kind of spatial pattern recognition.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex rules may be needed for perfect accuracy\n    for i in range(28):\n        for j in range(23):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 1:\n                # Replace 1s with 2s in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4s with 2s in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2s with 8s in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8s with 6s in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(28):\n        for j in range(23):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 1:\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 4:\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 2:\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",

The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with new values based on their position and context.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain values (like 1s and 4s) are replaced with other values (like 2s, 8s, 6s, etc.) based on their position in the grid.\n3. The transformation seems to involve some kind of spatial pattern recognition, where values are replaced based on their neighbors or their position in the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with new values based on their position and context, with some kind of spatial pattern recognition.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # More complex rules may be needed for perfect accuracy\n    for i in range(28):\n        for j in range(23):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 1:\n                # Replace 1s with 2s in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4s with 2s in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2s with 8s in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                # Replace 8s with 6s in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(28):\n        for j in range(23):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 1:\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 4:\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 2:\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid_np[i][j] == 8:\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n                elif i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```",
