The output grid is always 3 rows by 6 columns, built by horizontally repeating parts of the input.\n\nSpecifically:\n- The last column of the input is repeated twice at the right in the output.\n- The first two columns of the input are repeated on the far right, creating a symmetrical pattern.\n- In some examples, the pattern involves copying certain columns and extending horizontally, as the examples suggest.\n\nGiven the examples, I hypothesize:\n- The transformation takes the input grid and constructs a 3x6 output by:\n  1.
