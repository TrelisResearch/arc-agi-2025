          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some 5s and 4s, and the output has 2s and 5s. For instance, the first row of input is all zeros except for a 5 in the 7th column. The output's first row is the same as the input. But in the second row of the output, there are 2s in the third, fourth, fifth columns. Wait, maybe the 5s in the input are being replaced with 2s in some way? Or maybe there's a pattern based on the positions of the 5s and 4s.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has a 5 in the second row, third column. The output has a 5 there, but in the third row, there's a 2 in the third column. Wait, maybe the 5s are kept, but other numbers are replaced with 2s? But in Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the fourth row, third column. The output has a 4 there, but in the third row, the fourth column is 4. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother example: Example 2's input has a 5 in the fourth row, second column. The output for that row has a 5 in the same position, but other positions have 2s. Wait, in Example 2's output, the fourth row is 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Wait, the original input for that row was 0 5 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 5 2 2 4 2 2 0 0 0. So the 5 and 4 are kept, but the surrounding positions are filled with 2s. Maybe the 5s and 4s are kept, and the surrounding cells are filled with 2s?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, there's a 5 in the 7th column of the first row. The output for that row is the same. But in the second row, there's a 2 in the third, fourth, fifth columns. Maybe when there's a 5 in the input, the surrounding cells are filled with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s and 4s are acting as centers for some kind of pattern. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 5 in row 1 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), and the output has a 5 there. Then, in the third row, there's a 2 in the third column. Maybe the 5s are kept, and the 4s are kept, but other numbers are replaced with 2s. But in Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the fourth row, third column. The output for that row is 0 0 2 4 2 0 0 0. So the 4 is kept, and the surrounding cells are filled with 2s.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is that whenever there's a 5 or 4 in the input, the surrounding cells (in some area) are filled with 2s. But how to determine the area?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input: the fourth row has a 5 in column 5 (assuming 0-based?), and the output for that row is 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Wait, the input for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait no, the input for Example 2 is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0\n... \n\nSo the fourth row is 0 5 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 5 2 2 4 2 2 0 0 0. So the 5 and 4 are kept, and the cells adjacent to them are filled with 2s. So the 5 is in column 1 (if 0-based?), and the 4 is in column 4. The cells between them are filled with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s and 4s are acting as centers of a 3x3 square, and the surrounding cells are filled with 2s. But in Example 3, the input has a 5 in row 1, column 2 (assuming 0-based?), and the output for row 2 has 2s in columns 2 and 3. So maybe for each 5 or 4 in the input, the cells in the same row and column around it are filled with 2s.\n\nBut how to handle that in code. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, the output grid is always 12x10. The input grid is 12x10 as well? Wait, looking at the examples:\n\nExample 1's input is 12 rows, each with 10 elements. The output is 12 rows, each with 10 elements. So the input and output grids are same size. So the function needs to take a 12x10 grid and return a 12x10 grid.\n\nSo the transformation is to take the input grid and produce the output grid. The problem is to find the pattern that maps input to output.\n\nLooking at the examples, the output seems to replace certain cells with 2s, but leave 5s and 4s as they are. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 5 in row 0, column 6. The output for that row is same. But in row 1, the output has 2s in columns 2,3,4. Maybe that's because there's a 5 in row 0, column 6, and the 2s are in a certain area. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s and 4s are acting as centers of some kind of pattern. For example, in Example 2, the 5 is in row 3, column 1. The output for that row has 2s in columns 2,3,4,5,6. Wait, the output row is 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So columns 2-6 are 2s. That's a 5-cell span. Similarly, the 4 in row 3, column 4 (input) is kept, and in the output, column 4 is 4, and columns 3 and 5 are 2s. So maybe the 5 and 4 are centers of a 3x3 square, but the surrounding cells are filled with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine that. Let's think of the 5 as a center. For each 5 in the input, the cells in the same row and column, within a certain range, are replaced with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s and 4s are the only cells that are kept, and all other cells are replaced with 2s. But that's not the case. For example, in Example 3's input, the output has a 5 in the same position, but other cells are 2s. But in Example 1's input, the first row has a 5, and the output is same. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 2s appear in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the second row has 2s in columns 2,3,4. The third row has 2s in columns 2,4. The fourth row has 2s in columns 2,3,4. The seventh row has 2s in columns 2-6. The eighth row has 2s in columns 2-6. The ninth row has 2s in columns 2-5 and 7. Wait, maybe the 2s are in positions that are adjacent to 5s or 4s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in a certain distance from 5s or 4s. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 5 in row 0, column 6. The output in row 1 has 2s in columns 2-4. That's not directly adjacent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions where the original value is not 5 or 4. But that's not the case, because in Example 3's input, the output has 2s in some positions where the original was 0. But in Example 1's first row, the original is 5, and the output is same. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and within a certain range. For example, for each 5 or 4 in the input, the cells in the same row and column, within a certain distance, are filled with 2s. But how to determine that distance.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input, the fourth row has a 5 in column 1 and a 4 in column 4. The output for that row has 2s in columns 2-5, and the 5 and 4 are kept. So maybe the 5 and 4 are centers of a 3x3 square, but only in their row and column. Wait, the 5 is in column 1, so the cells in columns 0-2 (but column 0 is 0, which is not 2). Wait, the output for that row is 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So columns 2-6 are 2s. So for the 5 in column 1, the cells in columns 1-3 (but 1 is 5, so maybe the cells to the right of it are filled with 2s. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for each example and see if there's a pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s in a cross shape around the 5s and 4s. Like, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column are filled with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are adjacent to 5s or 4s. For example, in Example 1, the 5 in row 0, column 6. The output in row 1 has 2s in columns 2-4. Not sure. Maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain distance. For example, in Example 2, the 5 is in row 3, column 1. The output for that row has 2s in columns 2-5. So that's a distance of 1 to the right. But the 4 is in column 4, and the output has 2s in columns 3 and 5. So maybe the 5 and 4 are centers of a 3x3 square, but only in the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range. For example, for each 5 or 4 in the input, the cells in the same row and column, within a certain distance, are filled with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine that. Let's think of the following steps:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid, if the cell is 5 or 4, then in the output grid, the cells in the same row and column, within a certain range, are set to 2. But how to determine the range.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, there's a 5 in row 0, column 6. The output for row 1 has 2s in columns 2-4. That's not directly adjacent. Maybe the 5 is in column 6, and the 2s are in columns 2-4, which is not directly related. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are in a certain area. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column are filled with 2s, but only if they are not 5 or 4.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAnother example: in Example 3's input, the fourth row has a 4 in column 3. The output for that row is 0 0 2 4 2 0 0 0. So the 4 is kept, and the cells to the left and right are 2s. So perhaps for each 4, the cells in the same row, to the left and right, are filled with 2s. Similarly for 5s.\n\nBut then, in Example 2's input, the fourth row has a 5 in column 1. The output for that row is 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So columns 2-6 are 2s. That would suggest that the 5 is in column 1, and the cells from column 1 to column 5 are filled with 2s. But the 5 is in column 1, so the cells in columns 1-5 would be 2s, but the 5 is kept. Wait, but in the output, the 5 is in column 1, and the cells to the right are 2s. So maybe the 5 is a center, and the cells to the left and right are filled with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each 5 or 4 in the input, the output grid has 2s in the same row and column, but only in certain positions. For example, for a 5 in row r, column c, the output grid has 2s in the same row, columns c-1, c, c+1, and same column, rows r-1, r, r+1. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 and 4 are kept, and all other cells are replaced with 2s. But that's not the case in Example 1's first row, where the 5 is kept, and the rest are zeros. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s and 4s are the only cells that are not replaced, and others are replaced with 2s. But in Example 1, the first row has a 5 and others are zeros. The output for that row is the same as input. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's look for another pattern. In Example 3, the input has a 5 in row 1, column 2. The output for that row is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The third row has a 2 in column 2. So maybe the 5 is in row 1, column 2, and the cells in row 2, column 2 is 2. So perhaps for each 5, the cell directly below it is filled with 2. But that's not the case for all examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the fourth row has a 5 in column 1. The output for that row has 2s in columns 2-5. So that's not directly below.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s and 4s are centers of a cross, and the cells in the same row and column are filled with 2s. For example, in Example 2's input, the 5 is in row 3, column 1. The output for that row has 2s in columns 2-5. That could be a horizontal line of 2s from column 2 to 5. Similarly, the 4 is in column 4, and the output has 2s in columns 3 and 5. So maybe the 5 is in column 1, and the cells in columns 1-5 are filled with 2s, but the 5 is kept. But that doesn't fit the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain distance. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a certain range (like 2 cells away) are filled with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and the distance from the 5 or 4 is within 2 cells. For example, if a cell is in the same row as a 5 or 4, and is within 2 columns away, it is filled with 2. Similarly for the same column.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nLet me think of the steps. For each cell in the input grid, if it's a 5 or 4, then for the same row, we check the cells to the left and right within a certain range, and for the same column, check the cells above and below within a certain range. Then, those cells are set to 2. But how to determine the range.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input, the 5 is in row 3, column 1. The output for that row has 2s in columns 2-5. That's 4 columns. So the distance from column 1 to column 5 is 4, which is more than 2. So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range. For example, for a 5 in row r, column c, the cells in row r, columns c-2 to c+2 are filled with 2s, but not including the original 5. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain distance. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a 3-cell range are filled with 2s.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 2s appear in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the second row has 2s in columns 2-4. The third row has 2s in columns 2 and 4. The fourth row has 2s in columns 2-4. The seventh row has 2s in columns 2-6. The eighth row has 2s in columns 2-6. The ninth row has 2s in columns 2-5 and 7. \n\nIn Example 3's output, the third row has 2s in columns 2-3. The fourth row has 2s in columns 2-4. The fifth row has 2s in columns 2-3. \n\nIn Example 2's output, the fourth row has 2s in columns 2-5. \n\nThis suggests that the 2s are in positions that are adjacent to 5s or 4s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain distance. For example, for a 5 in column c, the cells in the same row, columns c-1, c, c+1 are filled with 2s. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range, but the exact range varies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain distance, but the exact distance depends on the position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a 3-cell range. For example, for a 5 in column c, the cells in the same row from c-2 to c+2 are filled with 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of the following steps for the code:\n\n1. Iterate through each cell in the input grid.\n2. For each cell that is 5 or 4, mark the positions in the same row and column within a certain range as needing to be filled with 2.\n3. For all cells that are not 5 or 4, set them to 2, unless they are in the marked positions (but that's not clear).\n\nAlternatively, for each cell in the output grid, if it's in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and within a certain distance, set it to 2. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nBut how to determine the distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a distance of 2 are filled with 2s.\n\nBut how to test this.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's input, there's a 5 in row 0, column 6. The output for row 1 has 2s in columns 2-4. That's not in the same column as the 5. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range. For example, for a 5 in row r, column c, the output for row r, columns c-2 to c+2 are filled with 2s, but the 5 itself is kept. Similarly for columns.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are not 5 or 4 themselves. So, for example, if a cell is in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and is not a 5 or 4, then it's set to 2.\n\nBut that would mean that all cells not 5 or 4 are set to 2. But in Example 1's first row, there's a 5, and the rest are zeros. The output for that row is the same as input, which contradicts this idea.\n\nSo that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range, but the 5 and 4 themselves are kept. So, for example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a certain range are filled with 2s, but the 5 or 4 is not filled.\n\nBut how to determine the range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain distance. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row, columns c-1, c+1, and same column, rows r-1, r+1 are filled with 2s.\n\nLet's test this with Example 2's input. The 5 is in row 3, column 1. The output for that row has 2s in columns 2-5. So, if the 5 is in column 1, then the cells in columns 0, 2 would be filled with 2s. But in the output, columns 2-5 are 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a range of 3 cells are filled with 2s.\n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain number of cells. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column are filled with 2s, but only if they are not 5 or 4.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is that for each cell in the output grid, if it is not in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, then it remains as is. Otherwise, it is set to 2. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row has a 5, and the output for that row is the same as input. So the other cells are 0, which would be set to 2 according to this idea, but they are not. So this is not correct.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let me think of the examples again.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 1, columns 2-4 are 2. In row 2, columns 2 and 4 are 2. In row 3, columns 2-4 are 2. In row 6, columns 2-6 are 2. In row 7, columns 2-6 are 2. In row 8, columns 2-5 and 7 are 2. In row 9, columns 2-5 and 7 are 2. In row 10, columns 2-5 and 7 are 2. In row 11, columns 2-6 are 2. \n\nLooking at these positions, it seems like the 2s form a cross shape around certain cells. For example, in row 6, columns 2-6 are 2. That's a horizontal line. In row 7, columns 2-6 are 2. That's also a horizontal line. In row 8, columns 2-5 and 7 are 2. So perhaps there's a vertical line of 2s in columns 2-6, and some other patterns.\n\nBut how to connect this with the input.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, the 5 is in row 0, column 6. The output for row 6 has 2s in columns 2-6. That's not directly related. But there's a 5 in row 5, column 1. The output for row 6 has 2s in columns 2-6. Maybe the 5 in row 5, column 1 is the center of a vertical line of 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range. For example, for a 5 in row r, column c, the output for row r, columns c-2 to c+2 are filled with 2s. But in Example 1's input, the 5 in row 0, column 6 would lead to columns 4-8, but the output for row 0 is the same as input, so that's not possible.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe I should think of the 2s as being in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range. For example, for each 5 or 4, the output for the same row and column is filled with 2s, except for the 5 or 4 itself.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nLet me try to code this. For each cell (r, c) in the input grid, if the value is 5 or 4, then in the output grid, for the same row, all cells from c-2 to c+2 are set to 2, and for the same column, all cells from r-2 to r+2 are set to 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to handle overlapping ranges.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell (r, c) in the input grid, if the value is 5 or 4, then in the output grid, for the same row, set all cells from c-2 to c+2 to 2, and for the same column, set all cells from r-2 to r+2 to 2. But this would overwrite other cells.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 2. The input has a 5 in row 3, column 1. So for the same row, columns 1-3 (c-2=1-2=-1, so start at 0) would be columns 0-3. But in the output, for that row, columns 2-5 are 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the range is 1 cell. For example, for each 5 or 4, in the same row, set c-1 and c+1 to 2, and in the same column, set r-1 and r+1 to 2.\n\nLet's test this for Example 2's input. The 5 is in row 3, column 1. So in the same row, columns 0 and 2 are set to 2. In the same column, rows 2 and 4 are set to 2. But in the output for that row, columns 2-5 are 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 3, which has a 5 in row 1, column 2. The output for that row is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The third row has 2 in column 2. So maybe the cell below the 5 is filled with 2. But in Example 1's input, there's a 5 in row 0, column 6. The output for row 1 has 2s in columns 2-4. Not directly below.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain distance. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a 3-cell range are filled with 2s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are not 5 or 4. So for example, if a cell is in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and is not 5 or 4, then it is set to 2. Otherwise, it remains as is.\n\nBut this would mean that in Example 1's first row, which has a 5, the other cells (0s) are set to 2. But the output for that row is the same as input. So this is not the case.\n\nHmm. This is very frustrating. Maybe I should look for the pattern in the output grid. For example, in Example 1's output, the 2s form a cross shape around certain cells. For example, in row 6, columns 2-6 are 2. In row 7, columns 2-6 are 2. This suggests that there is a vertical line of 2s in columns 2-6, starting from row 6 to row 7. But why?\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, there's a 5 in row 5, column 1. The output for row 6 has 2s in columns 2-6. So maybe the 5 in row 5, column 1 is the center of a vertical line of 2s in columns 2-6. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column are filled with 2s, but the 5 or 4 is not filled.\n\nBut how to determine the range.\n\nMaybe the range is 3 cells. For example, for a 5 in row r, column c, the cells in the same row from c-2 to c+2 are filled with 2s, and in the same column, from r-2 to r+2 are filled with 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet me try to code this. For each cell in the input grid, if it is 5 or 4, then for the same row, we set the cells from c-2 to c+2 to 2. For the same column, set r-2 to r+2 to 2. But we have to make sure that the indices are within the grid.\n\nBut how to handle this in code.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n- Create a new grid, initialized with the input values.\n- For each cell (r, c) in the input grid:\n   - if the value is 5 or 4:\n      - for the same row, iterate from max(0, c-2) to min(9, c+2), and set those cells to 2.\n      - for the same column, iterate from max(0, r-2) to min(11, r+2), and set those cells to 2.\n- Return the new grid.\n\nBut wait, this would overwrite the 5 and 4 with 2s. But in the examples, the 5 and 4 are kept. So this approach would be incorrect.\n\nSo this suggests that the 5 and 4 are not being overwritten. So perhaps the code should only set the cells to 2 if they are not 5 or 4.\n\nWait, but in the examples, the 5 and 4 are kept, so the code should not overwrite them. So the code would need to check if the cell is 5 or 4, and if not, set it to 2 if it's in the range of a 5 or 4.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nMaybe the code should first create a grid where all cells are 2, and then for each cell that is 5 or 4, set it to the original value. But this would not work for the examples, because in Example 1's first row, the 5 is kept, but other cells are 0. So this approach would set them to 2, but the output is the same as input.\n\nSo that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, the code could set all cells to 2, and then for each cell that is 5 or 4, set it to the original value. But this would work for examples where the 5 and 4 are kept, and other cells are set to 2. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nExample 1's input has a 5 in row 0, column 6. The output for that row is the same as input. So if we set all cells to 2, then set the 5 and 4 to their original values, the output would have 2s everywhere except for the 5 and 4. But in the example, the first row has 5 and other 0s, but the output is the same as input. So this suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the first row is the same as input. So the code would set all cells to 2, then set the 5 to 5, and the 0s to 2. But the output is not the same as input. So this approach is not correct.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not simply setting all non-5/4 cells to 2.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range, but the 5 and 4 are kept. So the code would iterate over all cells in the input grid, and for each cell that is 5 or 4, mark the cells in the same row and column within a certain range as to be set to 2. Then, for all cells that are not 5 or 4, and are in the marked range, set them to 2.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me try to code this. For each cell (r, c) in the input grid:\n\n- if the cell is 5 or 4, then for the same row, set cells from c-2 to c+2 to 2, but only if they are not 5 or 4. Similarly for the column.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, create a 2D array of booleans indicating whether a cell should be set to 2. Initially, all cells are False. Then, for each cell (r, c) in the input grid, if it is 5 or 4, then for the same row, set cells from c-2 to c+2 to True. For the same column, set cells from r-2 to r+2 to True. Then, for each cell (r, c) in the output grid, if the cell is marked True, set it to 2, else keep the original value.\n\nBut this would set the 5 and 4 to 2, but in the examples, they are kept. So this is not correct.\n\nWait, but in the examples, the 5 and 4 are kept. So the code should not set them to 2. So perhaps the code should mark the cells to be set to 2 only if they are not 5 or 4.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Create a grid of False, indicating whether a cell should be set to 2.\n2. For each cell (r, c) in the input grid:\n   a. If the cell is 5 or 4, then for the same row, mark cells from c-2 to c+2 as True, but only if they are not 5 or 4.\n   b. Similarly for the same column.\n3. For each cell (r, c) in the output grid:\n   a. If it is marked True, set to 2.\n   b. Else, keep the original value.\n\nBut this is getting complicated, and I'm not sure if it's correct.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1. The input has a 5 in row 0, column 6. For this cell, we mark cells in row 0, columns 4-8 (c-2=6-2=4, c+2=8). But since the row has 10 columns (indices 0-9), columns 4-8 are within range. For each of these columns, if the cell is not 5 or 4, set to 2. But in this case, the original cell is 5, so it's not marked. So the cells in row 0, columns 4-8 are marked as True. But in the output, the first row is the same as input, which has a 5 in column 6. So this suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the test input and see what the output might look like.\n\nThe test input has several 5s and 4s. For example, in row 12 (assuming 0-based), there's a 5 in column 14. The output for that row would have 2s in certain positions. But without knowing the correct output, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each 5 or 4 in the input, the output has a 2 in the same position, but that's not the case in the examples.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain distance. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a certain distance are filled with 2s, but the 5 or 4 itself is not filled.\n\nBut how to determine the distance.\n\nLet me try to code this. For each 5 or 4 in the input, for the same row, set cells from c-1 to c+1 to 2. For the same column, set cells from r-1 to r+1 to 2. Then, for the output, if the cell is in any of these ranges, it is set to 2. Otherwise, it is left as is.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1. The input has a 5 in row 0, column 6. So for this cell, in the same row, set columns 5-7 to 2. In the same column, set rows 1-3 to 2. So in row 1, columns 5-7 would be 2. But in the output, row 1 has 2s in columns 2-4. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each 5 or 4, the output has a 2 in the same row and column, but only if the cell is not 5 or 4. But this is not working.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output has 2s in positions that are in the same row or column as 5 or 4. For example, the 5 in row 0, column 6 is kept, but the 2s in row 1, columns 2-4 are not in the same column. So perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, but not directly adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range, but the exact range is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the examples, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: for each cell in the input grid that is 5 or 4, the output grid has 2s in the same row and column, but only for cells that are within a certain distance. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a 3-cell range are set to 2, but the 5 or 4 itself is kept.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- Iterate through each cell in the input grid.\n- For each cell (r, c) that is 5 or 4:\n   - For the same row, set cells from c-2 to c+2 to 2, but only if they are not 5 or 4.\n   - For the same column, set cells from r-2 to r+2 to 2, but only if they are not 5 or 4.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nHere's a possible code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for r in range(12):\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] in (5, 4):\n                # Mark cells in the same row\n                for dc in range(max(0, c-2), min(10, c+3)):\n                    if transformed[r][dc] not in (5, 4):\n                        transformed[r][dc] = 2\n                # Mark cells in the same column\n                for dr in range(max(0, r-2), min(12, r+3)):\n                    if transformed[dr][c] not in (5, 4):\n                        transformed[dr][c] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but this would set cells in the same row and column within 2 cells away to 2, but only if they are not 5 or 4. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 5 in row 0, column 6. For this cell, the code would mark cells in row 0, columns 4-8 (since c-2=4, c+2=8). For each of these columns, if the cell is not 5 or 4, set to 2. But in the input, the row 0 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So columns 4-8 are 0, 0, 5, 0, 0. So for column 4 (0), it is set to 2. Column 5 (0) is set to 2. Column 6 (5) is not set. Column 7 (0) is set to 2. Column 8 (0) is set to 2. So in row 0, columns 4-8 would be 2, 2, 5, 2, 2. But the output for row 0 is the same as input. So this is not correct.\n\nThis suggests that this approach is not working.\n\nBut in the example, the output for row 0 is the same as input, so the code is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different approach. Maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range, but the exact range is not clear. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following code that sets all cells to 2, except for the 5 and 4, and see if it passes some examples.\n\nBut this is not correct, but it's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range, but the code is to set all cells to 2, except for the 5 and 4.\n\nBut in Example 1, this would set the first row to all 2s except for the 5. But the output is the same as input. So this is not correct.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following code, which for each 5 or 4, sets the cells in the same row and column to 2, but leaves the 5 and 4 as is.\n\nBut this is not correct, but it's the best I can do.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should set all cells to 2, and then for each 5 or 4, set it to the original value. Let's try this.\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[2 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(12)]\n    for r in range(12):\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] in (5, 4):\n                transformed[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n    return transformed\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's input. The first row has a 5, and the rest are 0. The transformed grid would have 2s in all positions, except for the 5. So the first row would be 2 2 2 2 2 2 5 2 2 2. But the output for the first row is the same as input. So this is not correct.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the first row is the same as input. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Looking at Example 2, the output has 2s in positions that are in the same row and column as the 5 and 4. For example, the 5 is in row 3, column 1. The output for that row has 2s in columns 2-5. So maybe for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a certain range are set to 2. For example, for a 5 in row r, column c, the cells in row r, columns c-1 to c+1 are set to 2, and in column c, rows r-1 to r+1 are set to 2.\n\nLet's try this. For each 5 or 4, set the cells in the same row and column, one cell away, to 2.\n\nSo, for the 5 in Example 2's input, row 3, column 1:\n\n- In the same row, columns 0, 1, 2 are set to 2. But the original cell is 5, so it's kept.\n- In the same column, rows 2, 3, 4 are set to 2.\n\nBut in the output for that row, columns 2-5 are 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI think I'm out of ideas. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that sets all cells to 2, and then for each 5 or 4, set it to the original value. Even though it doesn't fit the examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nBut this is not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range, but the code is to set all cells to 2, except for the 5 and 4.\n\nBut this is not correct for the examples. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not be correct.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some 5s and 4s, and the output has 2s and 5s. For instance, the first row of input is all zeros except for a 5 in the 7th column. The output's first row is the same as the input. But in the second row of the output, there are 2s in the third, fourth, fifth columns. Wait, maybe the 5s in the input are being replaced with 2s in some way? Or maybe there's a pattern based on the positions of the 5s and 4s.\n\nLooking at Example 3's input and output. The input has a 5 in the second row, third column. The output has a 5 there, but in the third row, there's a 2 in the third column. Wait, maybe the 5s are kept, but other numbers are replaced with 2s? But in Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the fourth row, third column. The output has a 4 there, but in the third row, the fourth column is 4. Hmm, not sure.\n\nAnother example: Example 2's input has a 5 in the fourth row, second column. The output for that row has a 5 in the same position, but other positions have 2s. Wait, in Example 2's output, the fourth row is 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Wait, the original input for that row was 0 5 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 5 2 2 4 2 2 0 0 0. So the 5 and 4 are kept, but the surrounding positions are filled with 2s. Maybe the 5s and 4s are kept, and the surrounding cells are filled with 2s?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, there's a 5 in the 7th column of the first row. The output for that row is the same. But in the second row, there's a 2 in the third, fourth, fifth columns. Maybe when there's a 5 in the input, the surrounding cells are filled with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s and 4s are acting as centers for some kind of pattern. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 5 in row 1 (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), and the output has a 5 there. Then, in the third row, there's a 2 in the third column. Maybe the 5s are kept, and the 4s are kept, but other numbers are replaced with 2s. But in Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the fourth row, third column. The output for that row is 0 0 2 4 2 0 0 0. So the 4 is kept, and the surrounding cells are filled with 2s.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is that whenever there's a 5 or 4 in the input, the surrounding cells (in some area) are filled with 2s. But how to determine the area?\n\nLooking at Example 2's input: the fourth row has a 5 in column 5 (assuming 0-based?), and the output for that row is 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. Wait, the input for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait no, the input for Example 2 is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0\n... \n\nSo the fourth row is 0 5 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 5 2 2 4 2 2 0 0 0. So the 5 and 4 are kept, and the cells adjacent to them are filled with 2s. So the 5 is in column 1 (if 0-based?), and the 4 is in column 4. The cells between them are filled with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s and 4s are acting as centers of a 3x3 square, and the surrounding cells are filled with 2s. But in Example 3, the input has a 5 in row 1, column 2 (assuming 0-based?), and the output for row 2 has 2s in columns 2 and 3. So maybe for each 5 or 4 in the input, the cells in the same row and column around it are filled with 2s.\n\nBut how to handle that in code. Let's think about the steps.\n\nFirst, the output grid is always 12x10. The input grid is 12x10 as well? Wait, looking at the examples:\n\nExample 1's input is 12 rows, each with 10 elements. The output is 12 rows, each with 10 elements. So the input and output grids are same size. So the function needs to take a 12x10 grid and return a 12x10 grid.\n\nSo the transformation is to take the input grid and produce the output grid. The problem is to find the pattern that maps input to output.\n\nLooking at the examples, the output seems to replace certain cells with 2s, but leave 5s and 4s as they are. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 5 in row 0, column 6. The output for that row is same. But in row 1, the output has 2s in columns 2,3,4. Maybe that's because there's a 5 in row 0, column 6, and the 2s are in a certain area. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s and 4s are acting as centers of some kind of pattern. For example, in Example 2, the 5 is in row 3, column 1. The output for that row has 2s in columns 2,3,4,5,6. Wait, the output row is 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So columns 2-6 are 2s. That's a 5-cell span. Similarly, the 4 in row 3, column 4 (input) is kept, and in the output, column 4 is 4, and columns 3 and 5 are 2s. So maybe the 5 and 4 are centers of a 3x3 square, but the surrounding cells are filled with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine that. Let's think of the 5 as a center. For each 5 in the input, the cells in the same row and column, within a certain range, are replaced with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s and 4s are the only cells that are kept, and all other cells are replaced with 2s. But that's not the case. For example, in Example 3's input, the output has a 5 in the same position, but other cells are 2s. But in Example 1's input, the first row has a 5, and the output is same. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 2s appear in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the second row has 2s in columns 2,3,4. The third row has 2s in columns 2,4. The fourth row has 2s in columns 2,3,4. The seventh row has 2s in columns 2-6. The eighth row has 2s in columns 2-6. The ninth row has 2s in columns 2-5 and 7. Wait, maybe the 2s are in positions that are adjacent to 5s or 4s.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in a certain distance from 5s or 4s. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 5 in row 0, column 6. The output in row 1 has 2s in columns 2-4. That's not directly adjacent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions where the original value is not 5 or 4. But that's not the case, because in Example 3's input, the output has 2s in some positions where the original was 0. But in Example 1's first row, the original is 5, and the output is same. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and within a certain range. For example, for each 5 or 4 in the input, the cells in the same row and column, within a certain distance, are filled with 2s. But how to determine that distance.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input, the fourth row has a 5 in column 1 and a 4 in column 4. The output for that row has 2s in columns 2-5, and the 5 and 4 are kept. So maybe the 5 and 4 are centers of a 3x3 square, but only in their row and column. Wait, the 5 is in column 1, so the cells in columns 0-2 (but column 0 is 0, which is not 2). Wait, the output for that row is 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So columns 2-6 are 2s. So for the 5 in column 1, the cells in columns 1-3 (but 1 is 5, so maybe the cells to the right of it are filled with 2s. Not sure.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for each example and see if there's a pattern. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s in a cross shape around the 5s and 4s. Like, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column are filled with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are adjacent to 5s or 4s. For example, in Example 1, the 5 in row 0, column 6. The output in row 1 has 2s in columns 2-4. Not sure. Maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain distance. For example, in Example 2, the 5 is in row 3, column 1. The output for that row has 2s in columns 2-5. So that's a distance of 1 to the right. But the 4 is in column 4, and the output has 2s in columns 3 and 5. So maybe the 5 and 4 are centers of a 3x3 square, but only in the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range. For example, for each 5 or 4 in the input, the cells in the same row and column, within a certain distance, are filled with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine that. Let's think of the following steps:\n\nFor each cell in the input grid, if the cell is 5 or 4, then in the output grid, the cells in the same row and column, within a certain range, are set to 2. But how to determine the range.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, there's a 5 in row 0, column 6. The output for row 1 has 2s in columns 2-4. That's not directly adjacent. Maybe the 5 is in column 6, and the 2s are in columns 2-4, which is not directly related. So maybe that's not the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are in a certain area. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column are filled with 2s, but only if they are not 5 or 4.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nAnother example: in Example 3's input, the fourth row has a 4 in column 3. The output for that row is 0 0 2 4 2 0 0 0. So the 4 is kept, and the cells to the left and right are 2s. So perhaps for each 4, the cells in the same row, to the left and right, are filled with 2s. Similarly for 5s.\n\nBut then, in Example 2's input, the fourth row has a 5 in column 1. The output for that row is 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So columns 2-6 are 2s. That would suggest that the 5 is in column 1, and the cells from column 1 to column 5 are filled with 2s. But the 5 is in column 1, so the cells in columns 1-5 would be 2s, but the 5 is kept. Wait, but in the output, the 5 is in column 1, and the cells to the right are 2s. So maybe the 5 is a center, and the cells to the left and right are filled with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe for each 5 or 4 in the input, the output grid has 2s in the same row and column, but only in certain positions. For example, for a 5 in row r, column c, the output grid has 2s in the same row, columns c-1, c, c+1, and same column, rows r-1, r, r+1. But that might not fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 and 4 are kept, and all other cells are replaced with 2s. But that's not the case in Example 1's first row, where the 5 is kept, and the rest are zeros. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s and 4s are the only cells that are not replaced, and others are replaced with 2s. But in Example 1, the first row has a 5 and others are zeros. The output for that row is the same as input. So that's not the case.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. Let's look for another pattern. In Example 3, the input has a 5 in row 1, column 2. The output for that row is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The third row has a 2 in column 2. So maybe the 5 is in row 1, column 2, and the cells in row 2, column 2 is 2. So perhaps for each 5, the cell directly below it is filled with 2. But that's not the case for all examples.\n\nIn Example 2, the fourth row has a 5 in column 1. The output for that row has 2s in columns 2-5. So that's not directly below.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s and 4s are centers of a cross, and the cells in the same row and column are filled with 2s. For example, in Example 2's input, the 5 is in row 3, column 1. The output for that row has 2s in columns 2-5. That could be a horizontal line of 2s from column 2 to 5. Similarly, the 4 is in column 4, and the output has 2s in columns 3 and 5. So maybe the 5 is in column 1, and the cells in columns 1-5 are filled with 2s, but the 5 is kept. But that doesn't fit the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain distance. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a certain range (like 2 cells away) are filled with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine the range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and the distance from the 5 or 4 is within 2 cells. For example, if a cell is in the same row as a 5 or 4, and is within 2 columns away, it is filled with 2. Similarly for the same column.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nLet me think of the steps. For each cell in the input grid, if it's a 5 or 4, then for the same row, we check the cells to the left and right within a certain range, and for the same column, check the cells above and below within a certain range. Then, those cells are set to 2. But how to determine the range.\n\nLooking at Example 2's input, the 5 is in row 3, column 1. The output for that row has 2s in columns 2-5. That's 4 columns. So the distance from column 1 to column 5 is 4, which is more than 2. So that might not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range. For example, for a 5 in row r, column c, the cells in row r, columns c-2 to c+2 are filled with 2s, but not including the original 5. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain distance. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a 3-cell range are filled with 2s.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that works for all examples.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 2s appear in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the second row has 2s in columns 2-4. The third row has 2s in columns 2 and 4. The fourth row has 2s in columns 2-4. The seventh row has 2s in columns 2-6. The eighth row has 2s in columns 2-6. The ninth row has 2s in columns 2-5 and 7. \n\nIn Example 3's output, the third row has 2s in columns 2-3. The fourth row has 2s in columns 2-4. The fifth row has 2s in columns 2-3. \n\nIn Example 2's output, the fourth row has 2s in columns 2-5. \n\nThis suggests that the 2s are in positions that are adjacent to 5s or 4s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain distance. For example, for a 5 in column c, the cells in the same row, columns c-1, c, c+1 are filled with 2s. But that doesn't fit all examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range, but the exact range varies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain distance, but the exact distance depends on the position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a 3-cell range. For example, for a 5 in column c, the cells in the same row from c-2 to c+2 are filled with 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me think of the following steps for the code:\n\n1. Iterate through each cell in the input grid.\n2. For each cell that is 5 or 4, mark the positions in the same row and column within a certain range as needing to be filled with 2.\n3. For all cells that are not 5 or 4, set them to 2, unless they are in the marked positions (but that's not clear).\n\nAlternatively, for each cell in the output grid, if it's in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and within a certain distance, set it to 2. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nBut how to determine the distance.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a distance of 2 are filled with 2s.\n\nBut how to test this.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's input, there's a 5 in row 0, column 6. The output for row 1 has 2s in columns 2-4. That's not in the same column as the 5. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range. For example, for a 5 in row r, column c, the output for row r, columns c-2 to c+2 are filled with 2s, but the 5 itself is kept. Similarly for columns.\n\nBut how to handle that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are not 5 or 4 themselves. So, for example, if a cell is in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and is not a 5 or 4, then it's set to 2.\n\nBut that would mean that all cells not 5 or 4 are set to 2. But in Example 1's first row, there's a 5, and the rest are zeros. The output for that row is the same as input, which contradicts this idea.\n\nSo that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range, but the 5 and 4 themselves are kept. So, for example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a certain range are filled with 2s, but the 5 or 4 is not filled.\n\nBut how to determine the range.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain distance. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row, columns c-1, c+1, and same column, rows r-1, r+1 are filled with 2s.\n\nLet's test this with Example 2's input. The 5 is in row 3, column 1. The output for that row has 2s in columns 2-5. So, if the 5 is in column 1, then the cells in columns 0, 2 would be filled with 2s. But in the output, columns 2-5 are 2s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a range of 3 cells are filled with 2s.\n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain number of cells. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column are filled with 2s, but only if they are not 5 or 4.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is that for each cell in the output grid, if it is not in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, then it remains as is. Otherwise, it is set to 2. But this doesn't fit the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the first row has a 5, and the output for that row is the same as input. So the other cells are 0, which would be set to 2 according to this idea, but they are not. So this is not correct.\n\nHmm. This is really challenging. Let me think of the examples again.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 1, columns 2-4 are 2. In row 2, columns 2 and 4 are 2. In row 3, columns 2-4 are 2. In row 6, columns 2-6 are 2. In row 7, columns 2-6 are 2. In row 8, columns 2-5 and 7 are 2. In row 9, columns 2-5 and 7 are 2. In row 10, columns 2-5 and 7 are 2. In row 11, columns 2-6 are 2. \n\nLooking at these positions, it seems like the 2s form a cross shape around certain cells. For example, in row 6, columns 2-6 are 2. That's a horizontal line. In row 7, columns 2-6 are 2. That's also a horizontal line. In row 8, columns 2-5 and 7 are 2. So perhaps there's a vertical line of 2s in columns 2-6, and some other patterns.\n\nBut how to connect this with the input.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input, the 5 is in row 0, column 6. The output for row 6 has 2s in columns 2-6. That's not directly related. But there's a 5 in row 5, column 1. The output for row 6 has 2s in columns 2-6. Maybe the 5 in row 5, column 1 is the center of a vertical line of 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range. For example, for a 5 in row r, column c, the output for row r, columns c-2 to c+2 are filled with 2s. But in Example 1's input, the 5 in row 0, column 6 would lead to columns 4-8, but the output for row 0 is the same as input, so that's not possible.\n\nThis is really tough. Maybe I should think of the 2s as being in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range. For example, for each 5 or 4, the output for the same row and column is filled with 2s, except for the 5 or 4 itself.\n\nBut how to implement that.\n\nLet me try to code this. For each cell (r, c) in the input grid, if the value is 5 or 4, then in the output grid, for the same row, all cells from c-2 to c+2 are set to 2, and for the same column, all cells from r-2 to r+2 are set to 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to handle overlapping ranges.\n\nAlternatively, for each cell (r, c) in the input grid, if the value is 5 or 4, then in the output grid, for the same row, set all cells from c-2 to c+2 to 2, and for the same column, set all cells from r-2 to r+2 to 2. But this would overwrite other cells.\n\nBut let's test this with Example 2. The input has a 5 in row 3, column 1. So for the same row, columns 1-3 (c-2=1-2=-1, so start at 0) would be columns 0-3. But in the output, for that row, columns 2-5 are 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the range is 1 cell. For example, for each 5 or 4, in the same row, set c-1 and c+1 to 2, and in the same column, set r-1 and r+1 to 2.\n\nLet's test this for Example 2's input. The 5 is in row 3, column 1. So in the same row, columns 0 and 2 are set to 2. In the same column, rows 2 and 4 are set to 2. But in the output for that row, columns 2-5 are 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at the output for Example 3, which has a 5 in row 1, column 2. The output for that row is 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The third row has 2 in column 2. So maybe the cell below the 5 is filled with 2. But in Example 1's input, there's a 5 in row 0, column 6. The output for row 1 has 2s in columns 2-4. Not directly below.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain distance. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a 3-cell range are filled with 2s.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are not 5 or 4. So for example, if a cell is in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and is not 5 or 4, then it is set to 2. Otherwise, it remains as is.\n\nBut this would mean that in Example 1's first row, which has a 5, the other cells (0s) are set to 2. But the output for that row is the same as input. So this is not the case.\n\nHmm. This is very frustrating. Maybe I should look for the pattern in the output grid. For example, in Example 1's output, the 2s form a cross shape around certain cells. For example, in row 6, columns 2-6 are 2. In row 7, columns 2-6 are 2. This suggests that there is a vertical line of 2s in columns 2-6, starting from row 6 to row 7. But why?\n\nLooking at the input for Example 1, there's a 5 in row 5, column 1. The output for row 6 has 2s in columns 2-6. So maybe the 5 in row 5, column 1 is the center of a vertical line of 2s in columns 2-6. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column are filled with 2s, but the 5 or 4 is not filled.\n\nBut how to determine the range.\n\nMaybe the range is 3 cells. For example, for a 5 in row r, column c, the cells in the same row from c-2 to c+2 are filled with 2s, and in the same column, from r-2 to r+2 are filled with 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nLet me try to code this. For each cell in the input grid, if it is 5 or 4, then for the same row, we set the cells from c-2 to c+2 to 2. For the same column, set r-2 to r+2 to 2. But we have to make sure that the indices are within the grid.\n\nBut how to handle this in code.\n\nHere's a possible approach:\n\n- Create a new grid, initialized with the input values.\n- For each cell (r, c) in the input grid:\n   - if the value is 5 or 4:\n      - for the same row, iterate from max(0, c-2) to min(9, c+2), and set those cells to 2.\n      - for the same column, iterate from max(0, r-2) to min(11, r+2), and set those cells to 2.\n- Return the new grid.\n\nBut wait, this would overwrite the 5 and 4 with 2s. But in the examples, the 5 and 4 are kept. So this approach would be incorrect.\n\nSo this suggests that the 5 and 4 are not being overwritten. So perhaps the code should only set the cells to 2 if they are not 5 or 4.\n\nWait, but in the examples, the 5 and 4 are kept, so the code should not overwrite them. So the code would need to check if the cell is 5 or 4, and if not, set it to 2 if it's in the range of a 5 or 4.\n\nBut how to do this.\n\nMaybe the code should first create a grid where all cells are 2, and then for each cell that is 5 or 4, set it to the original value. But this would not work for the examples, because in Example 1's first row, the 5 is kept, but other cells are 0. So this approach would set them to 2, but the output is the same as input.\n\nSo that's not correct.\n\nAlternatively, the code could set all cells to 2, and then for each cell that is 5 or 4, set it to the original value. But this would work for examples where the 5 and 4 are kept, and other cells are set to 2. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nExample 1's input has a 5 in row 0, column 6. The output for that row is the same as input. So if we set all cells to 2, then set the 5 and 4 to their original values, the output would have 2s everywhere except for the 5 and 4. But in the example, the first row has 5 and other 0s, but the output is the same as input. So this suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the first row is the same as input. So the code would set all cells to 2, then set the 5 to 5, and the 0s to 2. But the output is not the same as input. So this approach is not correct.\n\nThis suggests that the pattern is not simply setting all non-5/4 cells to 2.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range, but the 5 and 4 are kept. So the code would iterate over all cells in the input grid, and for each cell that is 5 or 4, mark the cells in the same row and column within a certain range as to be set to 2. Then, for all cells that are not 5 or 4, and are in the marked range, set them to 2.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nLet me try to code this. For each cell (r, c) in the input grid:\n\n- if the cell is 5 or 4, then for the same row, set cells from c-2 to c+2 to 2, but only if they are not 5 or 4. Similarly for the column.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, create a 2D array of booleans indicating whether a cell should be set to 2. Initially, all cells are False. Then, for each cell (r, c) in the input grid, if it is 5 or 4, then for the same row, set cells from c-2 to c+2 to True. For the same column, set cells from r-2 to r+2 to True. Then, for each cell (r, c) in the output grid, if the cell is marked True, set it to 2, else keep the original value.\n\nBut this would set the 5 and 4 to 2, but in the examples, they are kept. So this is not correct.\n\nWait, but in the examples, the 5 and 4 are kept. So the code should not set them to 2. So perhaps the code should mark the cells to be set to 2 only if they are not 5 or 4.\n\nSo, the steps would be:\n\n1. Create a grid of False, indicating whether a cell should be set to 2.\n2. For each cell (r, c) in the input grid:\n   a. If the cell is 5 or 4, then for the same row, mark cells from c-2 to c+2 as True, but only if they are not 5 or 4.\n   b. Similarly for the same column.\n3. For each cell (r, c) in the output grid:\n   a. If it is marked True, set to 2.\n   b. Else, keep the original value.\n\nBut this is getting complicated, and I'm not sure if it's correct.\n\nLet me test this with Example 1. The input has a 5 in row 0, column 6. For this cell, we mark cells in row 0, columns 4-8 (c-2=6-2=4, c+2=8). But since the row has 10 columns (indices 0-9), columns 4-8 are within range. For each of these columns, if the cell is not 5 or 4, set to 2. But in this case, the original cell is 5, so it's not marked. So the cells in row 0, columns 4-8 are marked as True. But in the output, the first row is the same as input, which has a 5 in column 6. So this suggests that this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the test input and see what the output might look like.\n\nThe test input has several 5s and 4s. For example, in row 12 (assuming 0-based), there's a 5 in column 14. The output for that row would have 2s in certain positions. But without knowing the correct output, it's hard to say.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that for each 5 or 4 in the input, the output has a 2 in the same position, but that's not the case in the examples.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain distance. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a certain distance are filled with 2s, but the 5 or 4 itself is not filled.\n\nBut how to determine the distance.\n\nLet me try to code this. For each 5 or 4 in the input, for the same row, set cells from c-1 to c+1 to 2. For the same column, set cells from r-1 to r+1 to 2. Then, for the output, if the cell is in any of these ranges, it is set to 2. Otherwise, it is left as is.\n\nLet's test this with Example 1. The input has a 5 in row 0, column 6. So for this cell, in the same row, set columns 5-7 to 2. In the same column, set rows 1-3 to 2. So in row 1, columns 5-7 would be 2. But in the output, row 1 has 2s in columns 2-4. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each 5 or 4, the output has a 2 in the same row and column, but only if the cell is not 5 or 4. But this is not working.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of Example 1. The output has 2s in positions that are in the same row or column as 5 or 4. For example, the 5 in row 0, column 6 is kept, but the 2s in row 1, columns 2-4 are not in the same column. So perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, but not directly adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range, but the exact range is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the examples, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: for each cell in the input grid that is 5 or 4, the output grid has 2s in the same row and column, but only for cells that are within a certain distance. For example, for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a 3-cell range are set to 2, but the 5 or 4 itself is kept.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- Iterate through each cell in the input grid.\n- For each cell (r, c) that is 5 or 4:\n   - For the same row, set cells from c-2 to c+2 to 2, but only if they are not 5 or 4.\n   - For the same column, set cells from r-2 to r+2 to 2, but only if they are not 5 or 4.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nHere's a possible code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for r in range(12):\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] in (5, 4):\n                # Mark cells in the same row\n                for dc in range(max(0, c-2), min(10, c+3)):\n                    if transformed[r][dc] not in (5, 4):\n                        transformed[r][dc] = 2\n                # Mark cells in the same column\n                for dr in range(max(0, r-2), min(12, r+3)):\n                    if transformed[dr][c] not in (5, 4):\n                        transformed[dr][c] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nWait, but this would set cells in the same row and column within 2 cells away to 2, but only if they are not 5 or 4. Let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 5 in row 0, column 6. For this cell, the code would mark cells in row 0, columns 4-8 (since c-2=4, c+2=8). For each of these columns, if the cell is not 5 or 4, set to 2. But in the input, the row 0 is 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So columns 4-8 are 0, 0, 5, 0, 0. So for column 4 (0), it is set to 2. Column 5 (0) is set to 2. Column 6 (5) is not set. Column 7 (0) is set to 2. Column 8 (0) is set to 2. So in row 0, columns 4-8 would be 2, 2, 5, 2, 2. But the output for row 0 is the same as input. So this is not correct.\n\nThis suggests that this approach is not working.\n\nBut in the example, the output for row 0 is the same as input, so the code is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different approach. Maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range, but the exact range is not clear. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following code that sets all cells to 2, except for the 5 and 4, and see if it passes some examples.\n\nBut this is not correct, but it's the best I can do.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range, but the code is to set all cells to 2, except for the 5 and 4.\n\nBut in Example 1, this would set the first row to all 2s except for the 5. But the output is the same as input. So this is not correct.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Given the time, I'll proceed with the following code, which for each 5 or 4, sets the cells in the same row and column to 2, but leaves the 5 and 4 as is.\n\nBut this is not correct, but it's the best I can do.\n\nWait, perhaps the code should set all cells to 2, and then for each 5 or 4, set it to the original value. Let's try this.\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[2 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(12)]\n    for r in range(12):\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] in (5, 4):\n                transformed[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n    return transformed\n\nLet's test this with Example 1's input. The first row has a 5, and the rest are 0. The transformed grid would have 2s in all positions, except for the 5. So the first row would be 2 2 2 2 2 2 5 2 2 2. But the output for the first row is the same as input. So this is not correct.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the first row is the same as input. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Looking at Example 2, the output has 2s in positions that are in the same row and column as the 5 and 4. For example, the 5 is in row 3, column 1. The output for that row has 2s in columns 2-5. So maybe for each 5 or 4, the cells in the same row and column within a certain range are set to 2. For example, for a 5 in row r, column c, the cells in row r, columns c-1 to c+1 are set to 2, and in column c, rows r-1 to r+1 are set to 2.\n\nLet's try this. For each 5 or 4, set the cells in the same row and column, one cell away, to 2.\n\nSo, for the 5 in Example 2's input, row 3, column 1:\n\n- In the same row, columns 0, 1, 2 are set to 2. But the original cell is 5, so it's kept.\n- In the same column, rows 2, 3, 4 are set to 2.\n\nBut in the output for that row, columns 2-5 are 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nI think I'm out of ideas. Given the time, I'll proceed with the code that sets all cells to 2, and then for each 5 or 4, set it to the original value. Even though it doesn't fit the examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nBut this is not correct. Alternatively, perhaps the 2s are in positions that are in the same row or column as a 5 or 4, and are within a certain range, but the code is to set all cells to 2, except for the 5 and 4.\n\nBut this is not correct for the examples. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not be correct.\n"
