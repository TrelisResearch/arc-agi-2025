          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has some numbers and zeros. The output seems to have some numbers moved or transformed. Let me look at the first example's input and output.\n\nInput for Example 1 has a 13x13 grid. The output is also 13x13. Let me check the first few rows. \n\nIn the input, row 1 (second row) has a 2 in positions 4-8. In the output, row 1 has 2s in positions 5-7. Wait, maybe there's some shifting or expansion? Or maybe the numbers are being spread out?\n\nLooking at the third row of input: 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0. Wait, that's the same as the input? But in the output, the third row is different. Wait no, looking back at the example:\n\nWait the output for example 1 is:\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 13: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHmm, comparing input and output. Let's take the input row 1: all zeros except for positions 4-8 (values 2). The output row 1 has 2s in positions 5-7. Wait, maybe the numbers are being spread out? Or maybe they are being expanded in some way. \n\nLooking at the input row 2: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. The output row 2 has 2s in positions 5-7. Wait, that's not matching. Wait the output row 2 is 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2s are in positions 5 and 7? Maybe the numbers are being moved to the center? Or perhaps there's some kind of expansion where the numbers are spread out in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored or rotated. For example, in the input row 2, the 2s are in positions 3-8 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let me check. The input row is 13 elements. Let me think of the first row as row 0. Let me check the input for example 1:\n\nOriginal input row 1 (assuming rows are 0-based) is:\n\nRow 1 (input) is 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So positions 3-8 (indices 3 to 8, 0-based) are 2s. The output row 1 (row 1) is 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2s are in positions 5 and 7 (indices 5 and 7). So maybe the 2s are being expanded in some way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed based on their positions. For example, in the input, the 2s are in a horizontal line, and in the output, they are spread out in a way that they form a cross or something. \n\nLooking at example 2. The input has a 11x11 grid. The output is also 11x11. Let me check the input and output for example 2.\n\nInput row 1: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. The output row 1 is 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0. So the 1s are in positions 2-7 (input) and in the output they are in positions 3-4 and 6-7. So maybe the 1s are being moved to the center? Or maybe they are being mirrored or expanded. \n\nAnother example: in example 3, the input is 7x7. The output is also 7x7. The input has a 9 in the middle, and the output has the 9s spread out. For example, the input row 1 (second row) is 0 0 9 9 9 0 0. The output row 1 is 0 9 0 9 0 9 0. So the 9s are spread out in a diagonal pattern. \n\nHmm. So maybe the pattern is that certain numbers are being expanded or mirrored in some way. For example, in example 3, the 9s are in a line in the input, and in the output they are spread out in a cross shape. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed based on their positions. For example, numbers in certain positions are being mirrored or rotated. \n\nLooking at example 1 again. The input has a 3 in row 4 (input row 4?), and the output has the 3s in positions that form a cross. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each number is being replaced by a pattern based on its value. For example, 2s are expanded into a cross, 3s into another cross, etc. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where numbers are present in the input and output. For example, in example 1, the input has a 2 in positions (1,3) to (1,8) (assuming rows and columns start at 0). The output has 2s in positions (1,5) and (1,7). Maybe the numbers are being moved to the center? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a certain shape. For example, in example 3, the 9s are in a line, and in the output they form a cross. \n\nWait, in example 3, the input has a 9 in the middle of the row, and the output has the 9s in a cross shape. So maybe the transformation is that numbers are being expanded into a cross pattern. \n\nBut how does that work for other numbers? For example, in example 1, the 2s in the input are in a horizontal line. The output has 2s in positions that form a vertical line? Or maybe a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is replaced by a cross of that number. For example, if a cell has a 2, then in the output, it's replaced by a cross (like a plus sign) of 2s. But that seems too vague. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored. For example, in example 2, the input has a line of 1s, and the output has them spread out in a way that they are mirrored. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being mirrored horizontally or vertically. For example, in example 3, the input has 9s in a horizontal line, and the output has them in a vertical line. \n\nWait, example 3's input is:\n\nRow 1 (input): 0 0 9 9 9 0 0\nRow 2: 0 9 0 9 0 9 0\nRow 3: 0 0 4 4 4 0 0\nRow 4: 0 3 3 3 3 3 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 1: 0 9 0 9 0 9 0\nRow 2: 0 0 9 9 9 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 4 4 4 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 3 3 3 3 3 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 9s in the input are in row 1, and in the output they are in row 2. Also, the 9s in row 2 of the input are in positions 1, 3, 5. In the output, row 1 has 9s in positions 1, 3, 5. So it seems that the 9s are being mirrored. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that numbers are being mirrored in some way. For example, in example 3, the 9s are mirrored vertically. \n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input has a line of 1s in row 1. The output has them in row 1 as 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0. So the 1s are in positions 3-4 and 6-7. Which is a mirrored pattern. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that each number is being mirrored in some way. For example, numbers are being mirrored horizontally or vertically. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, in example 3, the 9s are in a line and become a cross. \n\nBut how to determine this? Let's think about the examples again. \n\nIn example 1, the input has a 2 in positions 3-8 (row 1). The output has 2s in positions 5 and 7. That seems like a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by their positions in a certain way. For example, numbers are being spread out in a cross pattern. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nAnother idea: the output seems to have the same numbers as the input, but in a different position. For example, in example 3, the 9s are moved to the center. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is being replaced by a cross of the same number. For example, if a cell has a 2, then in the output, the cross around it is filled with 2s. \n\nBut how to determine the cross shape? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in some way. For example, the input has a horizontal line of 2s, and the output has a vertical line of 2s. \n\nLooking at example 1, the input row 1 has 2s from column 3 to 8. The output row 1 has 2s in column 5 and 7. That's a vertical line? Or maybe the 2s are spread out in a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is being replaced by a cross pattern. For example, if a cell has a number, then in the output, it's replaced by a cross of that number. \n\nBut how to code that. For example, for each cell with value v, we need to set the cross around it. \n\nBut how to determine the cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in a certain way. For example, in example 3, the 9s are mirrored vertically. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the numbers in the output and see if they are mirrored or rotated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a certain shape. For example, the 2 in example 1 is expanded into a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in the grid. \n\nBut how to code this. \n\nAnother idea: the output seems to have the same numbers as the input, but in a different position. For example, in example 1, the 2s are in a horizontal line in the input, and in the output, they are in a vertical line. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being mirrored in some way. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being rotated. For example, the 2s in the input are rotated 90 degrees. \n\nBut that's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in the grid. For example, in example 3, the 9s are mirrored vertically. \n\nLet me think of the example 3 again. The input has 9s in row 1 (input row 1), and the output has them in row 2. So maybe the numbers are being mirrored vertically. \n\nBut how does that work for other examples. \n\nIn example 1, the 2s in row 1 (input) are in positions 3-8. The output has 2s in positions 5 and 7. That's not a vertical mirror. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in a certain way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed based on their position. For example, for each cell (i,j), if the value is v, then in the output, the cell (i,j) is set to v, and also some other cells around it. \n\nBut how to determine which cells. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in a way that their positions are mirrored across the center of the grid. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is being replaced by a cross pattern. For example, a cell with value v is replaced by a cross of v's. \n\nBut how to determine the cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a certain pattern. For example, in example 3, the 9s are in a line in the input, and in the output they are spread out in a cross. \n\nBut how to code this. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the numbers in the input and output. For example, in example 3, the input has a 9 in the middle of the row, and the output has a 9 in the middle of the column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is being mirrored in the grid. \n\nBut I need to find a pattern that works for all examples. \n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input has a line of 1s in row 1 (positions 2-7). The output has them in positions 3-4 and 6-7. So maybe the 1s are being mirrored. \n\nWait, the input row 1 is 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. The output row 1 is 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0. So the 1s are in positions 3-4 and 6-7. Which is a mirrored pattern. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that each number is mirrored in the grid. \n\nBut how to code this. \n\nAlternatively, the numbers are being mirrored across the vertical axis. \n\nFor example, in example 3, the input row 1 has 9s in positions 2,3,4. The output row 1 has them in positions 1,3,5. Which is a mirrored pattern. \n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that for each cell (i,j) with value v, the mirrored cell (i, 12-j) is also set to v. \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nLet me think for example 3. The input has a 9 in position (1,2) (assuming 0-based). The output has a 9 in position (1,1). Which is mirrored across the vertical axis. \n\nSo if the grid is 7x7 (example 3), the vertical mirror would be j \u2192 5-j. \n\nBut in example 3, the input row 1 is 0 0 9 9 9 0 0. The output row 1 is 0 9 0 9 0 9 0. So the 9s are at positions 1,3,5. Which is the mirrored positions of the original 9s (positions 2,3,4). \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j) with value v, the mirrored cell (i, 12-j) (for 13x13 grid) is also set to v. \n\nBut how to handle this for the test input. \n\nBut how does this fit with example 1. Let's check. \n\nIn example 1's input row 1: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So for j=3 to 8 (positions 3-8), the value is 2. The mirrored positions would be j=12-3=9, 12-4=8, etc. Wait for a 13x13 grid, the mirror of j is 12-j. \n\nFor example, j=3 \u2192 12-3=9. So the mirrored position of j=3 is 9. \n\nIn the output row 1 of example 1, the 2s are in positions 5 and 7. Hmm, that doesn't match the mirrored positions. \n\nSo maybe that's not the right approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being mirrored in a different way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in the horizontal or vertical direction. \n\nAnother idea: in example 3, the 9s are moved to the center. For example, the original 9s are in a line, and the output has them in a cross shape. \n\nBut how to code that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a cross pattern. For example, if a cell has a number, then in the output, the cross around it is filled with that number. \n\nBut how to determine the cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is replaced by a cross of that number. For example, for a cell (i,j) with value v, the output cell (i,j) is v, and also the cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) are also v. \n\nBut in example 3, the input has a 9 in position (1,2), and the output has a 9 in (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), etc. \n\nBut this seems to be the case for example 3. \n\nWait, in example 3's input, the row 1 is 0 0 9 9 9 0 0. The output row 1 is 0 9 0 9 0 9 0. So the 9s are in positions 1,3,5. Which is the original positions 2,3,4 (input) mirrored. \n\nBut if the transformation is that each number is mirrored in the grid, then for example 3, the 9s in the input are mirrored. \n\nBut how to handle this for the other examples. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that each number is mirrored across the vertical axis. \n\nSo for each cell (i,j), if the value is v, then the mirrored cell (i, 12-j) is also set to v. \n\nBut in example 1, the input row 1 has 2s in positions 3-8. The mirrored positions would be 12-3=9, 12-4=8, 12-5=7, 12-6=6, 12-7=5, 12-8=4. So the mirrored positions are 9,8,7,6,5,4. \n\nBut in the output, the 2s are in positions 5,7. So this doesn't match. \n\nHmm. Maybe that's not the right approach. \n\nAnother idea: the output seems to have the same numbers as the input, but in a different position. For example, in example 3, the 9s are moved to the center. \n\nAlternatively, the numbers are being expanded into a cross pattern. For example, in example 3, the 9s are in a line in the input, and in the output they are spread out in a cross. \n\nBut how to determine the cross pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is replaced by a cross of that number. For example, the number is expanded into a cross. \n\nBut how to determine the cross. \n\nAlternatively, the numbers are being mirrored in the grid. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAnother approach: look for the output grid's structure. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s in positions that form a vertical line. \n\nLooking at the output of example 1, row 1 has 2s in positions 5 and 7. Row 2 has 2 in position 5. Row 3 has 2 in position 4 and 6. Row 4 has 2s in positions 3-8. \n\nHmm, this seems like the 2s are being spread out in a certain way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in a way that they form a cross. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each number is replaced by a cross of that number. For example, for each cell with value v, we set the cross around it. \n\nBut how to code that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is mirrored in the grid. For example, for each cell (i,j), if the value is v, then the mirrored cell (i, 12-j) is also v. \n\nBut how does that fit with example 1. \n\nIn example 1, the input row 1 has 2s from j=3 to j=8. The mirrored positions would be j=9 to j=4. So for each of those positions, the mirrored cell would be set to 2. \n\nBut in the output row 1, the 2s are in positions 5 and 7. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in the vertical direction, but only for certain cells. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. \n\nMaybe I should look for another pattern. \n\nLooking at example 3, the output has the same numbers as the input, but the 9s are moved to the center. \n\nIn example 3's input, the 9s are in row 1, and in the output, they are in row 2. \n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that numbers are being moved to the center of the grid. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that the numbers are being moved to the center of the grid. \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nAnother idea: the output is the input with certain numbers being mirrored or rotated. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in the vertical and horizontal directions. \n\nBut I'm stuck. \n\nMaybe I should try to code a function that for each cell, if the value is non-zero, it's mirrored in the grid. \n\nFor example, for each cell (i,j), if the value is v, then the mirrored cell (i, 12-j) is also set to v. \n\nBut in example 3, this would work. \n\nLet's see for example 3's input. \n\nThe input row 1 is 0 0 9 9 9 0 0. The mirrored positions for j=2 is 12-2=10, but the grid is 7x7. So for a 7x7 grid, the mirrored j is 5-j. \n\nWait, for a 7x7 grid, the middle is at j=3. So for j=0, mirror is 6; j=1 \u21925; j=2\u21924; j=3\u21923; j=4\u21922; j=5\u21921; j=6\u21920. \n\nSo for example 3's input row 1, the 9s are at j=2,3,4. Their mirrored positions are j=4,3,2. So the mirrored positions are the same as the original positions. So this would not change anything. But in the output, the 9s are in positions 1,3,5. \n\nSo this approach doesn't work. \n\nHmm. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that the numbers are being mirrored in the vertical direction, but only for certain rows. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in the horizontal direction. \n\nBut I'm not seeing it. \n\nAnother approach: look for the output grid's structure. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s in positions that form a cross. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that each number is replaced by a cross of that number. \n\nFor example, if a cell has a 2, then in the output, the cross around it is filled with 2s. \n\nBut how to determine the cross. \n\nAlternatively, the cross is formed by the cell and its adjacent cells. \n\nBut in example 3, the input has a 9 in the middle of the row, and the output has it in the center of the column. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being moved to the center of the grid. \n\nBut how to code that. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that each number is replaced by a cross of that number, and the cross is centered on the original cell. \n\nBut how to determine the size of the cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a cross pattern. For example, each number is replaced by a cross of the same number, and the cross is centered on the original cell. \n\nBut without knowing the size, this is hard. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that each number is replaced by a cross of the same number, and the cross is formed by the original cell and its adjacent cells. \n\nBut this would mean that for a cell with value v, the output cell (i,j) is v, and also (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) are also v. \n\nLet's test this with example 3. \n\nIn example 3's input, row 1 has 9s in positions 2,3,4. \n\nFor each of these cells, their neighbors are set to 9. \n\nFor example, cell (1,2) would have neighbors (0,2), (2,2), (1,1), (1,3). \n\nBut in the output, row 1 has 9 in positions 1,3,5. \n\nThis doesn't seem to fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being mirrored in the grid. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time I have, I need to make an educated guess. \n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that numbers are being mirrored in the grid. For example, in example 3, the 9s are mirrored in the vertical direction. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if the value is v, then the mirrored cell (i, 12-j) is also set to v. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nLet me try to code this. \n\nFor a 13x13 grid, the mirrored column for j is 12-j. \n\nSo for each cell (i,j) in the input, if the value is non-zero, then in the output, the mirrored cell (i, 12-j) is also set to the same value. \n\nBut what about overlapping cells? For example, if a cell is mirrored to itself (like the center column), then it's set to the same value. \n\nLet me test this with example 3. \n\nExample 3's input is a 7x7 grid. So for each cell (i,j), the mirrored column is 5-j. \n\nIn the input row 1, j=2 is mirrored to 5-2=3. So the cell (1,2) is mirrored to (1,3). So both are set to 9. \n\nBut in the output, the row 1 has 9 in positions 1,3,5. \n\nSo this approach doesn't explain that. \n\nBut perhaps the transformation is that each cell is mirrored in both vertical and horizontal directions. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that each cell is mirrored in the vertical direction. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother idea: the output is the input with each non-zero cell mirrored in the vertical direction. \n\nBut for example 3, the input has 9 in positions (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). The mirrored positions would be (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). So the output would have the same positions, but in the example 3's output, the 9s are in positions (1,1), (1,3), (1,5). \n\nSo this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each non-zero cell is mirrored in the horizontal direction. \n\nBut again, not sure. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. \n\nLooking at example 3, the input has a 9 in the middle of the row, and the output has it in the middle of the column. So maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being mirrored in the grid. \n\nBut how to implement that. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that each non-zero cell is mirrored in the vertical direction. \n\nSo for each cell (i,j), if it is non-zero, then the mirrored cell (i, 12-j) is also non-zero. \n\nBut how to handle this in code. \n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new grid\n    new_grid = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                new_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n                mirrored_j = 12 - j\n                new_grid[i][mirrored_j] = grid[i][j]\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this would mirror each cell in the vertical direction. \n\nLet's test this with example 3. \n\nExample 3's input is a 7x7 grid. But the code is for 13x13. So this is not applicable. But for the purpose of the hypothesis, let's assume that the code is for 13x13. \n\nBut let's take example 3's input and see. \n\nIn example 3, the input has a 9 in position (1,2). The mirrored position is 12-2=10. But for a 7x7 grid, it would be 5-2=3. \n\nBut in example 3's output, the 9s are in positions (1,1), (1,3), (1,5). \n\nThis doesn't fit with the mirroring idea. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each non-zero cell is mirrored in the horizontal direction. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is that each non-zero cell is mirrored in the vertical direction. \n\nBut how to handle the test input. \n\nLet me look at the test input. \n\nThe test input is a 13x13 grid. \n\nFor example, the first row of the test input is all zeros except for positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. \n\nIf the transformation is to mirror each non-zero cell in the vertical direction, then for each of these positions, their mirrored positions would also be set to the same value. \n\nBut this might not match the output. \n\nBut since the test input is not provided with the output, I can't verify. \n\nBut given the examples, I'll proceed with this hypothesis. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                new_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n                mirrored_j = 12 - j\n                new_grid[i][mirrored_j] = grid[i][j]\n    return new_grid\n\nBut wait, this would set the mirrored cell to the same value. But in example 3, this would not produce the correct output. \n\nBut perhaps this is the best guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero cell is mirrored in the horizontal direction. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother idea: the transformation is that each non-zero cell is mirrored in both directions. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the code that mirrors each non-zero cell in the vertical direction. \n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct, but it's the best I can do based on the examples.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nStarting with Example 1. The input has some numbers and zeros. The output seems to have some numbers moved or transformed. Let me look at the first example's input and output.\n\nInput for Example 1 has a 13x13 grid. The output is also 13x13. Let me check the first few rows. \n\nIn the input, row 1 (second row) has a 2 in positions 4-8. In the output, row 1 has 2s in positions 5-7. Wait, maybe there's some shifting or expansion? Or maybe the numbers are being spread out?\n\nLooking at the third row of input: 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0. Wait, that's the same as the input? But in the output, the third row is different. Wait no, looking back at the example:\n\nWait the output for example 1 is:\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 8: 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 11: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 13: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nHmm, comparing input and output. Let's take the input row 1: all zeros except for positions 4-8 (values 2). The output row 1 has 2s in positions 5-7. Wait, maybe the numbers are being spread out? Or maybe they are being expanded in some way. \n\nLooking at the input row 2: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. The output row 2 has 2s in positions 5-7. Wait, that's not matching. Wait the output row 2 is 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2s are in positions 5 and 7? Maybe the numbers are being moved to the center? Or perhaps there's some kind of expansion where the numbers are spread out in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored or rotated. For example, in the input row 2, the 2s are in positions 3-8 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let me check. The input row is 13 elements. Let me think of the first row as row 0. Let me check the input for example 1:\n\nOriginal input row 1 (assuming rows are 0-based) is:\n\nRow 1 (input) is 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So positions 3-8 (indices 3 to 8, 0-based) are 2s. The output row 1 (row 1) is 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 2 0 0 0 0 0. So the 2s are in positions 5 and 7 (indices 5 and 7). So maybe the 2s are being expanded in some way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed based on their positions. For example, in the input, the 2s are in a horizontal line, and in the output, they are spread out in a way that they form a cross or something. \n\nLooking at example 2. The input has a 11x11 grid. The output is also 11x11. Let me check the input and output for example 2.\n\nInput row 1: 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. The output row 1 is 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0. So the 1s are in positions 2-7 (input) and in the output they are in positions 3-4 and 6-7. So maybe the 1s are being moved to the center? Or maybe they are being mirrored or expanded. \n\nAnother example: in example 3, the input is 7x7. The output is also 7x7. The input has a 9 in the middle, and the output has the 9s spread out. For example, the input row 1 (second row) is 0 0 9 9 9 0 0. The output row 1 is 0 9 0 9 0 9 0. So the 9s are spread out in a diagonal pattern. \n\nHmm. So maybe the pattern is that certain numbers are being expanded or mirrored in some way. For example, in example 3, the 9s are in a line in the input, and in the output they are spread out in a cross shape. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed based on their positions. For example, numbers in certain positions are being mirrored or rotated. \n\nLooking at example 1 again. The input has a 3 in row 4 (input row 4?), and the output has the 3s in positions that form a cross. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each number is being replaced by a pattern based on its value. For example, 2s are expanded into a cross, 3s into another cross, etc. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where numbers are present in the input and output. For example, in example 1, the input has a 2 in positions (1,3) to (1,8) (assuming rows and columns start at 0). The output has 2s in positions (1,5) and (1,7). Maybe the numbers are being moved to the center? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed into a certain shape. For example, in example 3, the 9s are in a line, and in the output they form a cross. \n\nWait, in example 3, the input has a 9 in the middle of the row, and the output has the 9s in a cross shape. So maybe the transformation is that numbers are being expanded into a cross pattern. \n\nBut how does that work for other numbers? For example, in example 1, the 2s in the input are in a horizontal line. The output has 2s in positions that form a vertical line? Or maybe a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is replaced by a cross of that number. For example, if a cell has a 2, then in the output, it's replaced by a cross (like a plus sign) of 2s. But that seems too vague. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored. For example, in example 2, the input has a line of 1s, and the output has them spread out in a way that they are mirrored. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being mirrored horizontally or vertically. For example, in example 3, the input has 9s in a horizontal line, and the output has them in a vertical line. \n\nWait, example 3's input is:\n\nRow 1 (input): 0 0 9 9 9 0 0\nRow 2: 0 9 0 9 0 9 0\nRow 3: 0 0 4 4 4 0 0\nRow 4: 0 3 3 3 3 3 0\nRow 5: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output is:\n\nRow 1: 0 9 0 9 0 9 0\nRow 2: 0 0 9 9 9 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 4 4 4 0 0\nRow 4: 0 0 0 3 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 3 3 3 3 3 0\nRow 6: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the 9s in the input are in row 1, and in the output they are in row 2. Also, the 9s in row 2 of the input are in positions 1, 3, 5. In the output, row 1 has 9s in positions 1, 3, 5. So it seems that the 9s are being mirrored. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that numbers are being mirrored in some way. For example, in example 3, the 9s are mirrored vertically. \n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input has a line of 1s in row 1. The output has them in row 1 as 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0. So the 1s are in positions 3-4 and 6-7. Which is a mirrored pattern. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that each number is being mirrored in some way. For example, numbers are being mirrored horizontally or vertically. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a cross shape. For example, in example 3, the 9s are in a line and become a cross. \n\nBut how to determine this? Let's think about the examples again. \n\nIn example 1, the input has a 2 in positions 3-8 (row 1). The output has 2s in positions 5 and 7. That seems like a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being replaced by their positions in a certain way. For example, numbers are being spread out in a cross pattern. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nAnother idea: the output seems to have the same numbers as the input, but in a different position. For example, in example 3, the 9s are moved to the center. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is being replaced by a cross of the same number. For example, if a cell has a 2, then in the output, the cross around it is filled with 2s. \n\nBut how to determine the cross shape? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in some way. For example, the input has a horizontal line of 2s, and the output has a vertical line of 2s. \n\nLooking at example 1, the input row 1 has 2s from column 3 to 8. The output row 1 has 2s in column 5 and 7. That's a vertical line? Or maybe the 2s are spread out in a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is being replaced by a cross pattern. For example, if a cell has a number, then in the output, it's replaced by a cross of that number. \n\nBut how to code that. For example, for each cell with value v, we need to set the cross around it. \n\nBut how to determine the cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in a certain way. For example, in example 3, the 9s are mirrored vertically. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the numbers in the output and see if they are mirrored or rotated. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a certain shape. For example, the 2 in example 1 is expanded into a cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in the grid. \n\nBut how to code this. \n\nAnother idea: the output seems to have the same numbers as the input, but in a different position. For example, in example 1, the 2s are in a horizontal line in the input, and in the output, they are in a vertical line. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being mirrored in some way. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being rotated. For example, the 2s in the input are rotated 90 degrees. \n\nBut that's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in the grid. For example, in example 3, the 9s are mirrored vertically. \n\nLet me think of the example 3 again. The input has 9s in row 1 (input row 1), and the output has them in row 2. So maybe the numbers are being mirrored vertically. \n\nBut how does that work for other examples. \n\nIn example 1, the 2s in row 1 (input) are in positions 3-8. The output has 2s in positions 5 and 7. That's not a vertical mirror. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in a certain way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being transformed based on their position. For example, for each cell (i,j), if the value is v, then in the output, the cell (i,j) is set to v, and also some other cells around it. \n\nBut how to determine which cells. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in a way that their positions are mirrored across the center of the grid. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is being replaced by a cross pattern. For example, a cell with value v is replaced by a cross of v's. \n\nBut how to determine the cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being spread out in a certain pattern. For example, in example 3, the 9s are in a line in the input, and in the output they are spread out in a cross. \n\nBut how to code this. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions of the numbers in the input and output. For example, in example 3, the input has a 9 in the middle of the row, and the output has a 9 in the middle of the column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is being mirrored in the grid. \n\nBut I need to find a pattern that works for all examples. \n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. The input has a line of 1s in row 1 (positions 2-7). The output has them in positions 3-4 and 6-7. So maybe the 1s are being mirrored. \n\nWait, the input row 1 is 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. The output row 1 is 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0. So the 1s are in positions 3-4 and 6-7. Which is a mirrored pattern. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that each number is mirrored in the grid. \n\nBut how to code this. \n\nAlternatively, the numbers are being mirrored across the vertical axis. \n\nFor example, in example 3, the input row 1 has 9s in positions 2,3,4. The output row 1 has them in positions 1,3,5. Which is a mirrored pattern. \n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that for each cell (i,j) with value v, the mirrored cell (i, 12-j) is also set to v. \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nLet me think for example 3. The input has a 9 in position (1,2) (assuming 0-based). The output has a 9 in position (1,1). Which is mirrored across the vertical axis. \n\nSo if the grid is 7x7 (example 3), the vertical mirror would be j \u2192 5-j. \n\nBut in example 3, the input row 1 is 0 0 9 9 9 0 0. The output row 1 is 0 9 0 9 0 9 0. So the 9s are at positions 1,3,5. Which is the mirrored positions of the original 9s (positions 2,3,4). \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j) with value v, the mirrored cell (i, 12-j) (for 13x13 grid) is also set to v. \n\nBut how to handle this for the test input. \n\nBut how does this fit with example 1. Let's check. \n\nIn example 1's input row 1: 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0. So for j=3 to 8 (positions 3-8), the value is 2. The mirrored positions would be j=12-3=9, 12-4=8, etc. Wait for a 13x13 grid, the mirror of j is 12-j. \n\nFor example, j=3 \u2192 12-3=9. So the mirrored position of j=3 is 9. \n\nIn the output row 1 of example 1, the 2s are in positions 5 and 7. Hmm, that doesn't match the mirrored positions. \n\nSo maybe that's not the right approach. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the numbers are being mirrored in a different way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in the horizontal or vertical direction. \n\nAnother idea: in example 3, the 9s are moved to the center. For example, the original 9s are in a line, and the output has them in a cross shape. \n\nBut how to code that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a cross pattern. For example, if a cell has a number, then in the output, the cross around it is filled with that number. \n\nBut how to determine the cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is replaced by a cross of that number. For example, for a cell (i,j) with value v, the output cell (i,j) is v, and also the cells (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) are also v. \n\nBut in example 3, the input has a 9 in position (1,2), and the output has a 9 in (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), etc. \n\nBut this seems to be the case for example 3. \n\nWait, in example 3's input, the row 1 is 0 0 9 9 9 0 0. The output row 1 is 0 9 0 9 0 9 0. So the 9s are in positions 1,3,5. Which is the original positions 2,3,4 (input) mirrored. \n\nBut if the transformation is that each number is mirrored in the grid, then for example 3, the 9s in the input are mirrored. \n\nBut how to handle this for the other examples. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that each number is mirrored across the vertical axis. \n\nSo for each cell (i,j), if the value is v, then the mirrored cell (i, 12-j) is also set to v. \n\nBut in example 1, the input row 1 has 2s in positions 3-8. The mirrored positions would be 12-3=9, 12-4=8, 12-5=7, 12-6=6, 12-7=5, 12-8=4. So the mirrored positions are 9,8,7,6,5,4. \n\nBut in the output, the 2s are in positions 5,7. So this doesn't match. \n\nHmm. Maybe that's not the right approach. \n\nAnother idea: the output seems to have the same numbers as the input, but in a different position. For example, in example 3, the 9s are moved to the center. \n\nAlternatively, the numbers are being expanded into a cross pattern. For example, in example 3, the 9s are in a line in the input, and in the output they are spread out in a cross. \n\nBut how to determine the cross pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is replaced by a cross of that number. For example, the number is expanded into a cross. \n\nBut how to determine the cross. \n\nAlternatively, the numbers are being mirrored in the grid. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAnother approach: look for the output grid's structure. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s in positions that form a vertical line. \n\nLooking at the output of example 1, row 1 has 2s in positions 5 and 7. Row 2 has 2 in position 5. Row 3 has 2 in position 4 and 6. Row 4 has 2s in positions 3-8. \n\nHmm, this seems like the 2s are being spread out in a certain way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in a way that they form a cross. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each number is replaced by a cross of that number. For example, for each cell with value v, we set the cross around it. \n\nBut how to code that. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each number is mirrored in the grid. For example, for each cell (i,j), if the value is v, then the mirrored cell (i, 12-j) is also v. \n\nBut how does that fit with example 1. \n\nIn example 1, the input row 1 has 2s from j=3 to j=8. The mirrored positions would be j=9 to j=4. So for each of those positions, the mirrored cell would be set to 2. \n\nBut in the output row 1, the 2s are in positions 5 and 7. So this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in the vertical direction, but only for certain cells. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. \n\nMaybe I should look for another pattern. \n\nLooking at example 3, the output has the same numbers as the input, but the 9s are moved to the center. \n\nIn example 3's input, the 9s are in row 1, and in the output, they are in row 2. \n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that numbers are being moved to the center of the grid. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that the numbers are being moved to the center of the grid. \n\nBut how to determine that. \n\nAnother idea: the output is the input with certain numbers being mirrored or rotated. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in the vertical and horizontal directions. \n\nBut I'm stuck. \n\nMaybe I should try to code a function that for each cell, if the value is non-zero, it's mirrored in the grid. \n\nFor example, for each cell (i,j), if the value is v, then the mirrored cell (i, 12-j) is also set to v. \n\nBut in example 3, this would work. \n\nLet's see for example 3's input. \n\nThe input row 1 is 0 0 9 9 9 0 0. The mirrored positions for j=2 is 12-2=10, but the grid is 7x7. So for a 7x7 grid, the mirrored j is 5-j. \n\nWait, for a 7x7 grid, the middle is at j=3. So for j=0, mirror is 6; j=1 \u21925; j=2\u21924; j=3\u21923; j=4\u21922; j=5\u21921; j=6\u21920. \n\nSo for example 3's input row 1, the 9s are at j=2,3,4. Their mirrored positions are j=4,3,2. So the mirrored positions are the same as the original positions. So this would not change anything. But in the output, the 9s are in positions 1,3,5. \n\nSo this approach doesn't work. \n\nHmm. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that the numbers are being mirrored in the vertical direction, but only for certain rows. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being mirrored in the horizontal direction. \n\nBut I'm not seeing it. \n\nAnother approach: look for the output grid's structure. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s in positions that form a cross. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that each number is replaced by a cross of that number. \n\nFor example, if a cell has a 2, then in the output, the cross around it is filled with 2s. \n\nBut how to determine the cross. \n\nAlternatively, the cross is formed by the cell and its adjacent cells. \n\nBut in example 3, the input has a 9 in the middle of the row, and the output has it in the center of the column. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being moved to the center of the grid. \n\nBut how to code that. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that each number is replaced by a cross of that number, and the cross is centered on the original cell. \n\nBut how to determine the size of the cross. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the numbers are being expanded into a cross pattern. For example, each number is replaced by a cross of the same number, and the cross is centered on the original cell. \n\nBut without knowing the size, this is hard. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that each number is replaced by a cross of the same number, and the cross is formed by the original cell and its adjacent cells. \n\nBut this would mean that for a cell with value v, the output cell (i,j) is v, and also (i-1,j), (i+1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1) are also v. \n\nLet's test this with example 3. \n\nIn example 3's input, row 1 has 9s in positions 2,3,4. \n\nFor each of these cells, their neighbors are set to 9. \n\nFor example, cell (1,2) would have neighbors (0,2), (2,2), (1,1), (1,3). \n\nBut in the output, row 1 has 9 in positions 1,3,5. \n\nThis doesn't seem to fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being mirrored in the grid. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time I have, I need to make an educated guess. \n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that numbers are being mirrored in the grid. For example, in example 3, the 9s are mirrored in the vertical direction. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is that for each cell (i,j), if the value is v, then the mirrored cell (i, 12-j) is also set to v. \n\nBut how to implement this. \n\nLet me try to code this. \n\nFor a 13x13 grid, the mirrored column for j is 12-j. \n\nSo for each cell (i,j) in the input, if the value is non-zero, then in the output, the mirrored cell (i, 12-j) is also set to the same value. \n\nBut what about overlapping cells? For example, if a cell is mirrored to itself (like the center column), then it's set to the same value. \n\nLet me test this with example 3. \n\nExample 3's input is a 7x7 grid. So for each cell (i,j), the mirrored column is 5-j. \n\nIn the input row 1, j=2 is mirrored to 5-2=3. So the cell (1,2) is mirrored to (1,3). So both are set to 9. \n\nBut in the output, the row 1 has 9 in positions 1,3,5. \n\nSo this approach doesn't explain that. \n\nBut perhaps the transformation is that each cell is mirrored in both vertical and horizontal directions. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is that each cell is mirrored in the vertical direction. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say. \n\nAnother idea: the output is the input with each non-zero cell mirrored in the vertical direction. \n\nBut for example 3, the input has 9 in positions (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). The mirrored positions would be (1,4), (1,3), (1,2). So the output would have the same positions, but in the example 3's output, the 9s are in positions (1,1), (1,3), (1,5). \n\nSo this doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each non-zero cell is mirrored in the horizontal direction. \n\nBut again, not sure. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples. \n\nLooking at example 3, the input has a 9 in the middle of the row, and the output has it in the middle of the column. So maybe the transformation is that the numbers are being mirrored in the grid. \n\nBut how to implement that. \n\nMaybe the transformation is that each non-zero cell is mirrored in the vertical direction. \n\nSo for each cell (i,j), if it is non-zero, then the mirrored cell (i, 12-j) is also non-zero. \n\nBut how to handle this in code. \n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new grid\n    new_grid = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                new_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n                mirrored_j = 12 - j\n                new_grid[i][mirrored_j] = grid[i][j]\n    return new_grid\n\nBut this would mirror each cell in the vertical direction. \n\nLet's test this with example 3. \n\nExample 3's input is a 7x7 grid. But the code is for 13x13. So this is not applicable. But for the purpose of the hypothesis, let's assume that the code is for 13x13. \n\nBut let's take example 3's input and see. \n\nIn example 3, the input has a 9 in position (1,2). The mirrored position is 12-2=10. But for a 7x7 grid, it would be 5-2=3. \n\nBut in example 3's output, the 9s are in positions (1,1), (1,3), (1,5). \n\nThis doesn't fit with the mirroring idea. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that each non-zero cell is mirrored in the horizontal direction. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nGiven the time I have, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is that each non-zero cell is mirrored in the vertical direction. \n\nBut how to handle the test input. \n\nLet me look at the test input. \n\nThe test input is a 13x13 grid. \n\nFor example, the first row of the test input is all zeros except for positions 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. \n\nIf the transformation is to mirror each non-zero cell in the vertical direction, then for each of these positions, their mirrored positions would also be set to the same value. \n\nBut this might not match the output. \n\nBut since the test input is not provided with the output, I can't verify. \n\nBut given the examples, I'll proceed with this hypothesis. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    new_grid = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                new_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n                mirrored_j = 12 - j\n                new_grid[i][mirrored_j] = grid[i][j]\n    return new_grid\n\nBut wait, this would set the mirrored cell to the same value. But in example 3, this would not produce the correct output. \n\nBut perhaps this is the best guess. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that each non-zero cell is mirrored in the horizontal direction. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAnother idea: the transformation is that each non-zero cell is mirrored in both directions. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven that, I'll proceed with the code that mirrors each non-zero cell in the vertical direction. \n\nBut I'm not sure if this is correct, but it's the best I can do based on the examples.\n"
