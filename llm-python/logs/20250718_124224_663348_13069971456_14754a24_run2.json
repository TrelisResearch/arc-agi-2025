          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from input to output. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 18x19. The input has some numbers, and the output seems to have some changes. For instance, looking at the first row of the input and output, they are the same. But in the second row of the input, the output has some changes. Wait, in the input, the second row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0. Wait, no, that's the same. Wait, but looking at the output for Example 1, the seventh row of input is 5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 4 4 5 0, and the output is 5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 2 4 4 5 0. Oh, so the 15th element in that row changes from 5 to 2. Similarly, in the output of Example 1, there's a 2 in some positions. \n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has some numbers, and the output has some changes. For example, in the second row of input, the output changes the 13th element from 5 to 2. Also, in the third row of input, the output changes some elements. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on some rule. \n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has some 5s and 0s, and the output has some 2s. For instance, the first row of input is 0 5 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5, and the output is 0 2 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5. So the second and third elements (positions 1 and 2) are changed from 5 to 2. Similarly, in the third row of input, the output has some 2s. \n\nIn Example 4, the input has some numbers and the output has 2s in certain positions. For example, in the third row of input, the output changes the third element from 5 to 2. \n\nSo, it seems like there's a pattern where certain positions in the grid are being replaced with 2s. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output has 2s in positions where the original value was 5, but maybe not always. Wait, in Example 1, the output has a 2 in the seventh row, 15th column (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but in the input, that position was 5. But in Example 3, the first row's second and third elements are 5s in input, and in the output they become 2s. So maybe the rule is that certain positions are being replaced with 2s based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with 2s. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s where the original input had 5s in certain positions. But that's not always the case. For example, in Example 3, the first row's second and third elements are 5s in input, but in output they are 2s. However, in the input of Example 1, the first row is the same as output. So maybe the rule is that certain positions are being replaced with 2s when they are part of a certain pattern.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where the output has 2s. Let's take Example 1's output. The seventh row (assuming rows are 0-based or 1-based? Let's check the input and output for Example 1. The input has 18 rows. Let's look at the output for Example 1. The seventh row (assuming 0-based index) is:\n\n5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 2 4 4 5 0\n\nSo in that row, the 14th element (assuming 0-based) is 2. The original input for that row was:\n\n5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 4 4 5 0\n\nSo the 14th element was 5, now it's 2. Similarly, in Example 2, the output has 2s in certain positions. For example, the second row of output is 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 2 5 0 0. The original input for that row was 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0. So the 12th element (0-based) is 5 in input, and 2 in output.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that in certain positions, the value is replaced with 2. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at the positions where 2s appear in the outputs:\n\nIn Example 1, the seventh row (row 6 if 0-based) has a 2 at column 14 (assuming columns are 0-based). In Example 2, the second row (row 1) has a 2 at column 12. In Example 3, the third row (row 2) has 2s at column 2 and 3. In Example 4, the third row (row 2) has a 2 at column 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in certain positions that are part of a specific pattern. For example, in Example 3, the first row's second and third elements are 5s, and they are replaced with 2s. But in other rows, like the third row of Example 3, the output has 2s in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in certain positions that are part of a diagonal or a specific shape. \n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is replacing certain numbers with 2s based on their position. For example, in some positions, if the value is 5, it's replaced with 2. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are in certain rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is in row 6 (assuming 0-based) and column 14. But that's just one example. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 5s in certain positions with 2s. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, looking for the positions where the input has 5s and the output has 2s. Let's check Example 1:\n\nIn the seventh row of input, the 14th element is 5, and in the output it's 2. In the third row of input, the output has 2s at positions 2 and 3. In the input, those positions were 5s. So perhaps the rule is that any 5 in certain positions is replaced with 2. But what's the pattern of these positions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the positions that are being replaced are those that are in certain rows and columns. For example, in Example 3, the first row has 2s in columns 1 and 2. In the third row, columns 2 and 3. In the fourth row, column 2. Maybe it's positions where the row and column indices have some relation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions that are being replaced are those that are part of a certain pattern, like the middle of the grid. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the seventh row (row 6) has a 2 at column 14. The input for that row had a 5 there. So maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in certain positions. But how to find those positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in certain positions. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the output is the same as input. So maybe the 2s are only in certain parts of the grid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the sum of the row and column indices is a certain value. For example, in Example 1, row 6 (0-based) and column 14: 6 + 14 = 20. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are in the middle of the grid. But again, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output, the first row's second and third elements are 2s. The input for that row was 0 5 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5. So the second and third elements (columns 1 and 2) are 5s. In the output, they are 2s. So maybe the rule is that in certain rows, the 5s in certain columns are replaced with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions where the input has 5s and the output has 2s are those that are in certain positions relative to the grid. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the 5s are in columns 1 and 2, and they are replaced with 2s. In the third row of Example 3, the 5s are in columns 2 and 3, and they are replaced with 2s. So maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in the first few columns are replaced with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions that are being replaced are those that are in the same row and column as certain other positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the value is 5 and the position is in a certain shape. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the 5s are in positions that are part of a horizontal line. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in certain positions. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the second and third elements are 5s and become 2s. In the third row of Example 3, the second and third elements are 5s and become 2s. In the fourth row of Example 3, the second element is 5 and becomes 2. So maybe the rule is that in certain rows, the 5s in certain columns are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the rows where the row index is even or odd? Or maybe certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the positions where 2s are introduced in the outputs:\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 is in row 6 (0-based), column 14.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2 is in row 1 (0-based), column 12.\n\nIn Example 3, the 2s are in row 0 (columns 1 and 2), row 2 (columns 2 and 3), row 3 (column 2), etc.\n\nIn Example 4, the 2 is in row 2 (column 2), row 4 (column 2), etc.\n\nHmm, it's not clear. Maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in certain positions that are part of a specific pattern. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the 5s are in columns 1 and 2, and in the output they are replaced with 2s. In the third row of Example 3, the 5s are in columns 2 and 3, replaced with 2s. So maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in the first few columns are replaced with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are in the same row and column as certain other positions. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the 5s are in columns 1 and 2. In the output, they are replaced with 2s. So perhaps the rule is that in certain rows, the 5s in columns 1 and 2 are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which rows? Maybe the rows where the row index is even? For example, in Example 3, row 0 is even, and columns 1 and 2 are replaced. Row 2 is even, columns 2 and 3 are replaced. Row 3 is odd, column 2 is replaced. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are in the first two columns of certain rows. But in Example 4, row 2 (third row) has a 2 in column 2. In Example 3, row 2 has 2s in columns 2 and 3. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at the outputs of the examples. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the seventh row (row 6) has a 2 in column 14. The input for that row had a 5 in that position. So perhaps the 2 is replacing a 5 in that specific position. But how to find that position?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is replacing a 5 in positions where the row and column indices are both even or odd. For example, in row 6 (even), column 14 (even). But that's just one example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is replacing a 5 in positions that are part of a diagonal. For example, row 6 and column 14: 6 + 14 = 20. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is replacing a 5 in positions where the row and column indices are both in certain ranges. For example, in the middle of the grid. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, in certain rows, the 5s in certain columns are replaced with 2s. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are part of a specific shape, like a cross or a line. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the 5s are in a horizontal line. But this is not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the sum of the row and column is a certain value. For example, in Example 1's seventh row (row 6), column 14: 6 + 14 = 20. In Example 2's second row (row 1), column 12: 1 + 12 = 13. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the 5s are in columns 1 and 2, and in the output they are replaced with 2s. In the third row of Example 3, the 5s are in columns 2 and 3. So maybe the rule is that in certain rows, the 5s in columns 1 to 3 are replaced with 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are in the same row as certain other positions. For example, in Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2, and they are replaced with 2s. In the third row, the 5s are in columns 2 and 3. So maybe the pattern is that in rows 0, 2, 3, etc., the 5s in the first few columns are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to generalize this? It's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the value is 5 and the row and column indices are both even. For example, in Example 1's seventh row (row 6 is even?), no, 6 is even. Column 14 is even. So that position would be replaced. But in Example 3, row 0 (even), column 1 (odd) is replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too ambiguous. Maybe I should think of other possible patterns. \n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, there are some 2s in positions that are not part of the input's 5s. For example, in Example 1's output, the seventh row has a 2 in column 14. The input for that position was 5, so it's replaced. But in other cases, like in Example 3, the first row's third element is 4 in the input, but in the output it's 4. So that's not replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with 2s based on their position. For example, in certain rows, the 5s are replaced with 2s. But how to determine which rows.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where the output has 2s and the input has 5s. Let's collect these positions across all examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nRow 6 (0-based?), column 14: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nRow 1, column 12: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nExample 3:\n\nRow 0, columns 1 and 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 2, columns 2 and 3: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 3, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nExample 4:\n\nRow 2, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 4, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 6, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 7, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 8, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 9, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 10, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 11, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 12, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 13, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nHmm, this seems like a lot of positions where column 2 is being replaced with 2. For example, in Example 3, row 0, 2, 3, etc. have 5 in column 2 replaced with 2. In Example 4, multiple rows have column 2 replaced with 2.\n\nSo maybe the rule is that in certain rows, column 2 is replaced with 2 if the original value is 5. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in certain columns, like column 2, the 5s are replaced with 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut looking at Example 1, the 2 is in column 14. That's not column 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are in the same row as certain other positions. For example, in Example 3, the first row's columns 1 and 2 are replaced. In the third row, columns 2 and 3 are replaced. So maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in the first few columns are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, in Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2, which are near the start of the row. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are part of a specific shape, like a cross or a diagonal. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row and column indices are both even. For example, in Example 1, row 6 is even, column 14 is even. So that position is replaced. In Example 2, row 1 is odd, column 12 is even. So that doesn't fit. So this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the row index is even and the column index is even. But in Example 3, row 0 is even, column 1 is odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, there's a 2 in row 6, column 14. The input for that position was 5. In the same row, the 14th column is 14th position (assuming 0-based). Maybe the position is in the middle of the row. But the row has 19 columns. So 14 is near the end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is replacing 5s in positions where the row is 6 and the column is 14. But this is just one example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row and column indices are both in certain ranges. For example, rows 6 and columns 14. But without more examples, it's hard to find a pattern.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to replace certain numbers with 2s based on their position in the grid. For example, in certain rows, the 5s in certain columns are replaced with 2s. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are part of a specific pattern, like a diagonal. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is in row 6, column 14. The sum of row and column is 20. In Example 2, row 1, column 12: sum is 13. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the row and column indices are both greater than a certain value. But again, not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 5s with 2s in certain positions, but how to determine those positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row and column indices are both even. For example, in Example 1, row 6 is even, column 14 is even. So that's replaced. In Example 3, row 0 is even, column 1 is odd. So that's not replaced. But in Example 3, the first row's columns 1 and 2 are replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the row is even and the column is odd. For example, in Example 3, row 0 (even), column 1 (odd) is replaced. Row 0, column 2 (even) is replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2, and those are replaced with 2s. In the third row, the 5s are in columns 2 and 3. So maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in the first few columns are replaced with 2s. But how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the row is less than a certain value. For example, rows 0-3, columns 1-3 are replaced. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in certain positions based on their row and column indices. For example, in rows where the row index is even, replace 5s in columns 1 and 2 with 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row is even and the column is even, or something like that.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. Given that, I need to make an educated guess. \n\nLooking at the outputs, it seems that in some rows, certain columns are being replaced. For example, in Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2 replaced with 2s. In the third row, columns 2 and 3 are replaced. In the fourth row, column 2 is replaced. In Example 4, multiple rows have column 2 replaced. \n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in column 2 are replaced with 2s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, the seventh row (row 6) has a 5 in column 14, which is replaced with 2. But that's not column 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in column 2 are replaced with 2s. For example, in Example 3, row 0, column 2 is replaced. Row 2, column 2 is replaced. Row 3, column 2 is replaced. In Example 4, multiple rows have column 2 replaced.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for every row, if the column is 2 and the value is 5, replace it with 2. But why would that be the case? Let's check the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the seventh row has a 5 in column 14, which is replaced with 2. That doesn't fit. So this can't be the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the column is 2 or 14. But that's not generalizable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the row and column indices are both even. For example, in row 6 (even), column 14 (even) \u2192 replaced. In Example 3, row 0 (even), column 1 (odd) is replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to make a hypothesis based on the examples where 2s are replacing 5s in certain positions. For example, in the first row of Example 3, columns 1 and 2 are replaced. In the third row of Example 3, columns 2 and 3 are replaced. In the fourth row of Example 3, column 2 is replaced. In Example 4, multiple rows have column 2 replaced.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that in certain rows, the 5s in column 2 are replaced with 2s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 3, row 0, column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. Row 2, column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced. Row 3, column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced. In Example 4, row 2, column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced. Row 4, column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced. So this seems to fit. But why would that be the case?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in column 2 for certain rows. But how to determine which rows.\n\nLooking at the examples, in Example 3, rows 0, 2, 3, etc., have column 2 replaced. In Example 4, rows 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 have column 2 replaced. So this seems like a pattern where column 2 is being replaced with 2s in certain rows.\n\nBut why? Maybe the transformation is to replace 5s in column 2 with 2s for all rows except certain ones. But how to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s in column 2 with 2s for all rows. Let's check the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the seventh row (row 6) has a 5 in column 14, not column 2. So that's not replaced. So this can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s in column 2 with 2s, but also other columns in certain rows.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to know. Given the time constraints, I think I need to make a hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in certain positions based on their row and column indices. For example, in certain rows, the 5s in column 2 are replaced with 2s.\n\nSo, let's write a function that replaces 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 3, the first row of input is 0 5 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5. Column 2 is 5. So replaced with 2. The output is 0 2 2 4 ... which matches. Similarly, in row 2 of Example 3, column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. In row 3, column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. This fits.\n\nIn Example 4, the third row (row 2) has column 2 as 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. The output for that row is 5 0 2 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0. So that matches.\n\nIn Example 2, the second row (row 1) has column 12 as 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. The output for that row is 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 2 5 0 0. So that matches.\n\nIn Example 1, the seventh row (row 6) has column 14 as 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. But in this case, column 14 is not column 2. So this hypothesis doesn't fit. So this suggests that there are other positions where 2s are replaced.\n\nBut maybe there are other patterns. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is in column 14, which is the 15th column (0-based). Maybe this is part of a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows, and also in column 14 for certain rows.\n\nBut this is too arbitrary. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows. Let's see.\n\nBut in Example 1, the seventh row has a 2 in column 14, which is not column 2. So this suggests that there's another pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows, and in other columns for certain rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row is even and the column is 2. Let's check Example 3, row 0 (even) column 2 \u2192 replaced. Row 2 (even) column 2 \u2192 replaced. Row 3 (odd) column 2 \u2192 replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for the most common pattern in the examples, which seems to be that in column 2, 5s are replaced with 2s. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo the code would iterate through each row and column, and if the column is 2 and the value is 5, replace it with 2.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the seventh row (row 6) has a 2 in column 14. So this would not be covered by this code. But maybe the code is not complete, and there are other patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows, and also in column 14 for certain rows. But this is not generalizable.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows. Let's write the code for that.\n\nSo, the function would loop through each row and column, and if the column is 2 and the value is 5, replace it with 2.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2. So in this case, column 1 is not 2, but it is replaced. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row is even and the column is 1 or 2. For example, in Example 3, row 0 (even), columns 1 and 2 are replaced. Row 2 (even), columns 2 and 3 are replaced. Row 3 (odd), column 2 is replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the column is 1 or 2, but only for certain rows.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to say.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for the pattern where the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are in the same row as certain other positions. For example, in Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2 replaced with 2s. In the third row, columns 2 and 3 replaced. In the fourth row, column 2 replaced. So maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in columns 1-3 are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row is less than 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row and column are both less than a certain value. For example, rows 0-3, columns 0-3.\n\nBut again, without more data, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll make a guess based on the examples where 2s are replacing 5s in certain columns. For example, in Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2 replaced with 2s. In the third row, columns 2 and 3 replaced. So perhaps the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in columns 1-3 are replaced with 2s. \n\nSo the code would check for rows where the row index is less than 4, and replace 5s in columns 1-3 with 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the code could replace 5s with 2s in columns 1 and 2 for all rows. Let's try that.\n\nIn Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2 replaced with 2s. The third row has 5s in columns 2 and 3 replaced with 2s. So this would not fit. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision based on the most common pattern observed. The most common pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in column 2 are replaced with 2s. So I'll proceed with that, even though it doesn't explain all examples.\n\nSo, the code would replace 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows.\n\nLet's test this against the examples:\n\nExample 1: In the seventh row (row 6), column 2 is 0 (input row is 5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 4 4 5 0). So column 2 is 0, so no change. But in the output, the 14th column is replaced with 2. So this doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row is even and the column is 14. But this is not generalizable.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples where 2s are replacing 5s in certain positions. For example, in Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2 replaced with 2s. In the third row, columns 2 and 3 replaced. In the fourth row, column 2 replaced. So perhaps the pattern is that in rows 0, 2, 3, etc., the 5s in columns 1-3 are replaced with 2s.\n\nSo, the code would iterate through each row and column, and for rows where the row index is 0, 2, 3, etc., replace 5s in columns 1-3 with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code replaces 5s with 2s in columns 1 and 2 for all rows. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2 replaced with 2s. The third row has 5s in columns 2 and 3 replaced with 2s. So this would not fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in certain positions, and write code that replaces 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows. Even though this doesn't explain all examples, it might be the best guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(18):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if j == 2 and grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace 5s in column 2 with 2s. Let's check against the examples.\n\nIn Example 3, the first row's column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. The third row's column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. The fourth row's column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. This fits. In Example 2, the second row's column 12 is 5 \u2192 but column 12 is not 2, so this would not be replaced. But in the output of Example 2, there is a 2 in column 12. So this code would not replace it. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in certain positions, but the pattern is not clear. Given the time, I'll have to proceed with a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: in the outputs of the examples, the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is in row 6, column 14. This is the 15th column (0-based). In Example 2, the 2 is in row 1, column 12. In Example 3, the 2s are in rows 0, 2, 3, etc., columns 1-3. In Example 4, the 2s are in column 2 for various rows.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in columns 1-3 are replaced with 2s. For example, in Example 3, row 0 has columns 1-2 replaced, row 2 has columns 2-3 replaced, row 3 has column 2 replaced. This suggests that the code replaces 5s in columns 1-3 for certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows. Perhaps rows where the row index is less than 4.\n\nSo, the code would replace 5s in columns 1-3 for rows 0-3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(4):  # rows 0-3\n        for j in range(1, 4):  # columns 1-3\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would only replace 5s in rows 0-3, columns 1-3. This would explain some examples, but not others.\n\nIn Example 3, the third row (row 2) is within 0-3, so columns 1-3 would be replaced. In the third row of Example 3, the input is 5 0 5 0 0 0 4 4 5 0 5 5 5 0 5. So columns 1-3 are 0, 5, 0. So column 2 is 5, replaced with 2. This fits. \n\nIn Example 4, the third row (row 2) is within 0-3, so columns 1-3 would be replaced. In the input for row 2, the third row is 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 5. Columns 1-3 are 5, 5, 5. So replaced with 2s. But in the output of Example 4, the third row is 5 0 2 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 5. So columns 1-3 are 5, 0, 2. So this suggests that this code would replace columns 1-3 with 2s, but the output shows that column 1 is 0. So this is not correct.\n\nThus, this approach is also incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different approach. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row is even and the column is even, or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the row and column are both even. Let's check Example 1's seventh row (row 6, even), column 14 (even). So replaced. In Example 3, row 0 (even), column 1 (odd) is replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that the 2s are replacing 5s in certain positions, and the code replaces 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows, even though it doesn't explain all examples. This is the best I can do given the time.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(18):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if j == 2 and grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not explain the 2 in Example 1's seventh row, column 14. But perhaps there are other patterns. For example, in Example 1, the seventh row has a 2 in column 14, which is part of a different rule.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code, even though it might not capture all cases.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from input to output. Let's start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 18x19. The input has some numbers, and the output seems to have some changes. For instance, looking at the first row of the input and output, they are the same. But in the second row of the input, the output has some changes. Wait, in the input, the second row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0, and the output is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0. Wait, no, that's the same. Wait, but looking at the output for Example 1, the seventh row of input is 5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 4 4 5 0, and the output is 5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 2 4 4 5 0. Oh, so the 15th element in that row changes from 5 to 2. Similarly, in the output of Example 1, there's a 2 in some positions. \n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has some numbers, and the output has some changes. For example, in the second row of input, the output changes the 13th element from 5 to 2. Also, in the third row of input, the output changes some elements. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being modified based on some rule. \n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has some 5s and 0s, and the output has some 2s. For instance, the first row of input is 0 5 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5, and the output is 0 2 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5. So the second and third elements (positions 1 and 2) are changed from 5 to 2. Similarly, in the third row of input, the output has some 2s. \n\nIn Example 4, the input has some numbers and the output has 2s in certain positions. For example, in the third row of input, the output changes the third element from 5 to 2. \n\nSo, it seems like there's a pattern where certain positions in the grid are being replaced with 2s. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at Example 1, the output has 2s in positions where the original value was 5, but maybe not always. Wait, in Example 1, the output has a 2 in the seventh row, 15th column (assuming 0-based or 1-based?), but in the input, that position was 5. But in Example 3, the first row's second and third elements are 5s in input, and in the output they become 2s. So maybe the rule is that certain positions are being replaced with 2s based on some condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing certain numbers with 2s. For example, in Example 1, the output has 2s where the original input had 5s in certain positions. But that's not always the case. For example, in Example 3, the first row's second and third elements are 5s in input, but in output they are 2s. However, in the input of Example 1, the first row is the same as output. So maybe the rule is that certain positions are being replaced with 2s when they are part of a certain pattern.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where the output has 2s. Let's take Example 1's output. The seventh row (assuming rows are 0-based or 1-based? Let's check the input and output for Example 1. The input has 18 rows. Let's look at the output for Example 1. The seventh row (assuming 0-based index) is:\n\n5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 2 4 4 5 0\n\nSo in that row, the 14th element (assuming 0-based) is 2. The original input for that row was:\n\n5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 4 4 5 0\n\nSo the 14th element was 5, now it's 2. Similarly, in Example 2, the output has 2s in certain positions. For example, the second row of output is 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 2 5 0 0. The original input for that row was 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 5 5 0 0. So the 12th element (0-based) is 5 in input, and 2 in output.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that in certain positions, the value is replaced with 2. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at the positions where 2s appear in the outputs:\n\nIn Example 1, the seventh row (row 6 if 0-based) has a 2 at column 14 (assuming columns are 0-based). In Example 2, the second row (row 1) has a 2 at column 12. In Example 3, the third row (row 2) has 2s at column 2 and 3. In Example 4, the third row (row 2) has a 2 at column 2. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in certain positions that are part of a specific pattern. For example, in Example 3, the first row's second and third elements are 5s, and they are replaced with 2s. But in other rows, like the third row of Example 3, the output has 2s in certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in certain positions that are part of a diagonal or a specific shape. \n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is replacing certain numbers with 2s based on their position. For example, in some positions, if the value is 5, it's replaced with 2. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are in certain rows or columns. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is in row 6 (assuming 0-based) and column 14. But that's just one example. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all 5s in certain positions with 2s. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAlternatively, looking for the positions where the input has 5s and the output has 2s. Let's check Example 1:\n\nIn the seventh row of input, the 14th element is 5, and in the output it's 2. In the third row of input, the output has 2s at positions 2 and 3. In the input, those positions were 5s. So perhaps the rule is that any 5 in certain positions is replaced with 2. But what's the pattern of these positions?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the positions that are being replaced are those that are in certain rows and columns. For example, in Example 3, the first row has 2s in columns 1 and 2. In the third row, columns 2 and 3. In the fourth row, column 2. Maybe it's positions where the row and column indices have some relation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions that are being replaced are those that are part of a certain pattern, like the middle of the grid. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of Example 1, the seventh row (row 6) has a 2 at column 14. The input for that row had a 5 there. So maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in certain positions. But how to find those positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in certain positions. For example, in the first row of Example 1, the output is the same as input. So maybe the 2s are only in certain parts of the grid. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the sum of the row and column indices is a certain value. For example, in Example 1, row 6 (0-based) and column 14: 6 + 14 = 20. Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are in the middle of the grid. But again, not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 3's output, the first row's second and third elements are 2s. The input for that row was 0 5 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5. So the second and third elements (columns 1 and 2) are 5s. In the output, they are 2s. So maybe the rule is that in certain rows, the 5s in certain columns are replaced with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions where the input has 5s and the output has 2s are those that are in certain positions relative to the grid. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the 5s are in columns 1 and 2, and they are replaced with 2s. In the third row of Example 3, the 5s are in columns 2 and 3, and they are replaced with 2s. So maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in the first few columns are replaced with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the positions that are being replaced are those that are in the same row and column as certain other positions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the value is 5 and the position is in a certain shape. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the 5s are in positions that are part of a horizontal line. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in certain positions. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the second and third elements are 5s and become 2s. In the third row of Example 3, the second and third elements are 5s and become 2s. In the fourth row of Example 3, the second element is 5 and becomes 2. So maybe the rule is that in certain rows, the 5s in certain columns are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Maybe the rows where the row index is even or odd? Or maybe certain columns.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the positions where 2s are introduced in the outputs:\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 is in row 6 (0-based), column 14.\n\nIn Example 2, the 2 is in row 1 (0-based), column 12.\n\nIn Example 3, the 2s are in row 0 (columns 1 and 2), row 2 (columns 2 and 3), row 3 (column 2), etc.\n\nIn Example 4, the 2 is in row 2 (column 2), row 4 (column 2), etc.\n\nHmm, it's not clear. Maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in certain positions that are part of a specific pattern. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the 5s are in columns 1 and 2, and in the output they are replaced with 2s. In the third row of Example 3, the 5s are in columns 2 and 3, replaced with 2s. So maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in the first few columns are replaced with 2s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are in the same row and column as certain other positions. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the 5s are in columns 1 and 2. In the output, they are replaced with 2s. So perhaps the rule is that in certain rows, the 5s in columns 1 and 2 are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which rows? Maybe the rows where the row index is even? For example, in Example 3, row 0 is even, and columns 1 and 2 are replaced. Row 2 is even, columns 2 and 3 are replaced. Row 3 is odd, column 2 is replaced. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are in the first two columns of certain rows. But in Example 4, row 2 (third row) has a 2 in column 2. In Example 3, row 2 has 2s in columns 2 and 3. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at the outputs of the examples. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the seventh row (row 6) has a 2 in column 14. The input for that row had a 5 in that position. So perhaps the 2 is replacing a 5 in that specific position. But how to find that position?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is replacing a 5 in positions where the row and column indices are both even or odd. For example, in row 6 (even), column 14 (even). But that's just one example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is replacing a 5 in positions that are part of a diagonal. For example, row 6 and column 14: 6 + 14 = 20. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is replacing a 5 in positions where the row and column indices are both in certain ranges. For example, in the middle of the grid. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, in certain rows, the 5s in certain columns are replaced with 2s. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are part of a specific shape, like a cross or a line. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the 5s are in a horizontal line. But this is not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the sum of the row and column is a certain value. For example, in Example 1's seventh row (row 6), column 14: 6 + 14 = 20. In Example 2's second row (row 1), column 12: 1 + 12 = 13. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in the first row of Example 3, the 5s are in columns 1 and 2, and in the output they are replaced with 2s. In the third row of Example 3, the 5s are in columns 2 and 3. So maybe the rule is that in certain rows, the 5s in columns 1 to 3 are replaced with 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are in the same row as certain other positions. For example, in Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2, and they are replaced with 2s. In the third row, the 5s are in columns 2 and 3. So maybe the pattern is that in rows 0, 2, 3, etc., the 5s in the first few columns are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to generalize this? It's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the value is 5 and the row and column indices are both even. For example, in Example 1's seventh row (row 6 is even?), no, 6 is even. Column 14 is even. So that position would be replaced. But in Example 3, row 0 (even), column 1 (odd) is replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too ambiguous. Maybe I should think of other possible patterns. \n\nLooking at the outputs of the examples, there are some 2s in positions that are not part of the input's 5s. For example, in Example 1's output, the seventh row has a 2 in column 14. The input for that position was 5, so it's replaced. But in other cases, like in Example 3, the first row's third element is 4 in the input, but in the output it's 4. So that's not replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain numbers with 2s based on their position. For example, in certain rows, the 5s are replaced with 2s. But how to determine which rows.\n\nAnother approach: looking for the positions where the output has 2s and the input has 5s. Let's collect these positions across all examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nRow 6 (0-based?), column 14: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nRow 1, column 12: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nExample 3:\n\nRow 0, columns 1 and 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 2, columns 2 and 3: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 3, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nExample 4:\n\nRow 2, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 4, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 6, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 7, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 8, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 9, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 10, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 11, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 12, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nRow 13, column 2: 5 \u2192 2.\n\nHmm, this seems like a lot of positions where column 2 is being replaced with 2. For example, in Example 3, row 0, 2, 3, etc. have 5 in column 2 replaced with 2. In Example 4, multiple rows have column 2 replaced with 2.\n\nSo maybe the rule is that in certain rows, column 2 is replaced with 2 if the original value is 5. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in certain columns, like column 2, the 5s are replaced with 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut looking at Example 1, the 2 is in column 14. That's not column 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are in the same row as certain other positions. For example, in Example 3, the first row's columns 1 and 2 are replaced. In the third row, columns 2 and 3 are replaced. So maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in the first few columns are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, in Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2, which are near the start of the row. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are part of a specific shape, like a cross or a diagonal. But without more examples, it's hard to tell.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row and column indices are both even. For example, in Example 1, row 6 is even, column 14 is even. So that position is replaced. In Example 2, row 1 is odd, column 12 is even. So that doesn't fit. So this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the row index is even and the column index is even. But in Example 3, row 0 is even, column 1 is odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for other patterns.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, there's a 2 in row 6, column 14. The input for that position was 5. In the same row, the 14th column is 14th position (assuming 0-based). Maybe the position is in the middle of the row. But the row has 19 columns. So 14 is near the end.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2 is replacing 5s in positions where the row is 6 and the column is 14. But this is just one example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row and column indices are both in certain ranges. For example, rows 6 and columns 14. But without more examples, it's hard to find a pattern.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the transformation is to replace certain numbers with 2s based on their position in the grid. For example, in certain rows, the 5s in certain columns are replaced with 2s. But how to determine which rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are part of a specific pattern, like a diagonal. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is in row 6, column 14. The sum of row and column is 20. In Example 2, row 1, column 12: sum is 13. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the row and column indices are both greater than a certain value. But again, not sure.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think of the transformation as replacing 5s with 2s in certain positions, but how to determine those positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row and column indices are both even. For example, in Example 1, row 6 is even, column 14 is even. So that's replaced. In Example 3, row 0 is even, column 1 is odd. So that's not replaced. But in Example 3, the first row's columns 1 and 2 are replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the row is even and the column is odd. For example, in Example 3, row 0 (even), column 1 (odd) is replaced. Row 0, column 2 (even) is replaced. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2, and those are replaced with 2s. In the third row, the 5s are in columns 2 and 3. So maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in the first few columns are replaced with 2s. But how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the row is less than a certain value. For example, rows 0-3, columns 1-3 are replaced. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in certain positions based on their row and column indices. For example, in rows where the row index is even, replace 5s in columns 1 and 2 with 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row is even and the column is even, or something like that.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. Given that, I need to make an educated guess. \n\nLooking at the outputs, it seems that in some rows, certain columns are being replaced. For example, in Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2 replaced with 2s. In the third row, columns 2 and 3 are replaced. In the fourth row, column 2 is replaced. In Example 4, multiple rows have column 2 replaced. \n\nSo perhaps the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in column 2 are replaced with 2s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 1, the seventh row (row 6) has a 5 in column 14, which is replaced with 2. But that's not column 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in column 2 are replaced with 2s. For example, in Example 3, row 0, column 2 is replaced. Row 2, column 2 is replaced. Row 3, column 2 is replaced. In Example 4, multiple rows have column 2 replaced.\n\nSo maybe the rule is: for every row, if the column is 2 and the value is 5, replace it with 2. But why would that be the case? Let's check the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the seventh row has a 5 in column 14, which is replaced with 2. That doesn't fit. So this can't be the rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the column is 2 or 14. But that's not generalizable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the row and column indices are both even. For example, in row 6 (even), column 14 (even) \u2192 replaced. In Example 3, row 0 (even), column 1 (odd) is replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to make a hypothesis based on the examples where 2s are replacing 5s in certain positions. For example, in the first row of Example 3, columns 1 and 2 are replaced. In the third row of Example 3, columns 2 and 3 are replaced. In the fourth row of Example 3, column 2 is replaced. In Example 4, multiple rows have column 2 replaced.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is that in certain rows, the 5s in column 2 are replaced with 2s. Let's check:\n\nIn Example 3, row 0, column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. Row 2, column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced. Row 3, column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced. In Example 4, row 2, column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced. Row 4, column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced. So this seems to fit. But why would that be the case?\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in column 2 for certain rows. But how to determine which rows.\n\nLooking at the examples, in Example 3, rows 0, 2, 3, etc., have column 2 replaced. In Example 4, rows 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 have column 2 replaced. So this seems like a pattern where column 2 is being replaced with 2s in certain rows.\n\nBut why? Maybe the transformation is to replace 5s in column 2 with 2s for all rows except certain ones. But how to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s in column 2 with 2s for all rows. Let's check the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the seventh row (row 6) has a 5 in column 14, not column 2. So that's not replaced. So this can't be the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s in column 2 with 2s, but also other columns in certain rows.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to know. Given the time constraints, I think I need to make a hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in certain positions based on their row and column indices. For example, in certain rows, the 5s in column 2 are replaced with 2s.\n\nSo, let's write a function that replaces 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows. Let's test this against the examples.\n\nIn Example 3, the first row of input is 0 5 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 5 5. Column 2 is 5. So replaced with 2. The output is 0 2 2 4 ... which matches. Similarly, in row 2 of Example 3, column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. In row 3, column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. This fits.\n\nIn Example 4, the third row (row 2) has column 2 as 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. The output for that row is 5 0 2 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 5 0 0. So that matches.\n\nIn Example 2, the second row (row 1) has column 12 as 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. The output for that row is 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 5 0 0 5 2 5 0 0. So that matches.\n\nIn Example 1, the seventh row (row 6) has column 14 as 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. But in this case, column 14 is not column 2. So this hypothesis doesn't fit. So this suggests that there are other positions where 2s are replaced.\n\nBut maybe there are other patterns. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is in column 14, which is the 15th column (0-based). Maybe this is part of a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows, and also in column 14 for certain rows.\n\nBut this is too arbitrary. Given the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows. Let's see.\n\nBut in Example 1, the seventh row has a 2 in column 14, which is not column 2. So this suggests that there's another pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows, and in other columns for certain rows. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row is even and the column is 2. Let's check Example 3, row 0 (even) column 2 \u2192 replaced. Row 2 (even) column 2 \u2192 replaced. Row 3 (odd) column 2 \u2192 replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for the most common pattern in the examples, which seems to be that in column 2, 5s are replaced with 2s. So I'll proceed with that.\n\nSo the code would iterate through each row and column, and if the column is 2 and the value is 5, replace it with 2.\n\nBut wait, in Example 1, the seventh row (row 6) has a 2 in column 14. So this would not be covered by this code. But maybe the code is not complete, and there are other patterns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows, and also in column 14 for certain rows. But this is not generalizable.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows. Let's write the code for that.\n\nSo, the function would loop through each row and column, and if the column is 2 and the value is 5, replace it with 2.\n\nBut wait, in Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2. So in this case, column 1 is not 2, but it is replaced. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row is even and the column is 1 or 2. For example, in Example 3, row 0 (even), columns 1 and 2 are replaced. Row 2 (even), columns 2 and 3 are replaced. Row 3 (odd), column 2 is replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the column is 1 or 2, but only for certain rows.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to say.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for the pattern where the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are in the same row as certain other positions. For example, in Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2 replaced with 2s. In the third row, columns 2 and 3 replaced. In the fourth row, column 2 replaced. So maybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in columns 1-3 are replaced with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row is less than 5. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row and column are both less than a certain value. For example, rows 0-3, columns 0-3.\n\nBut again, without more data, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll make a guess based on the examples where 2s are replacing 5s in certain columns. For example, in Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2 replaced with 2s. In the third row, columns 2 and 3 replaced. So perhaps the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in columns 1-3 are replaced with 2s. \n\nSo the code would check for rows where the row index is less than 4, and replace 5s in columns 1-3 with 2s. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the code could replace 5s with 2s in columns 1 and 2 for all rows. Let's try that.\n\nIn Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2 replaced with 2s. The third row has 5s in columns 2 and 3 replaced with 2s. So this would not fit. So this approach is not correct.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision based on the most common pattern observed. The most common pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in column 2 are replaced with 2s. So I'll proceed with that, even though it doesn't explain all examples.\n\nSo, the code would replace 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows.\n\nLet's test this against the examples:\n\nExample 1: In the seventh row (row 6), column 2 is 0 (input row is 5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 4 4 5 0). So column 2 is 0, so no change. But in the output, the 14th column is replaced with 2. So this doesn't fit. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row is even and the column is 14. But this is not generalizable.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples where 2s are replacing 5s in certain positions. For example, in Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2 replaced with 2s. In the third row, columns 2 and 3 replaced. In the fourth row, column 2 replaced. So perhaps the pattern is that in rows 0, 2, 3, etc., the 5s in columns 1-3 are replaced with 2s.\n\nSo, the code would iterate through each row and column, and for rows where the row index is 0, 2, 3, etc., replace 5s in columns 1-3 with 2s.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code replaces 5s with 2s in columns 1 and 2 for all rows. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 3, the first row has 5s in columns 1 and 2 replaced with 2s. The third row has 5s in columns 2 and 3 replaced with 2s. So this would not fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the hypothesis that the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in certain positions, and write code that replaces 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows. Even though this doesn't explain all examples, it might be the best guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(18):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if j == 2 and grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would replace 5s in column 2 with 2s. Let's check against the examples.\n\nIn Example 3, the first row's column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. The third row's column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. The fourth row's column 2 is 5 \u2192 replaced with 2. This fits. In Example 2, the second row's column 12 is 5 \u2192 but column 12 is not 2, so this would not be replaced. But in the output of Example 2, there is a 2 in column 12. So this code would not replace it. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nThus, this suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in certain positions, but the pattern is not clear. Given the time, I'll have to proceed with a different approach.\n\nAnother observation: in the outputs of the examples, the 2s are replacing 5s in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 2 is in row 6, column 14. This is the 15th column (0-based). In Example 2, the 2 is in row 1, column 12. In Example 3, the 2s are in rows 0, 2, 3, etc., columns 1-3. In Example 4, the 2s are in column 2 for various rows.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that in certain rows, the 5s in columns 1-3 are replaced with 2s. For example, in Example 3, row 0 has columns 1-2 replaced, row 2 has columns 2-3 replaced, row 3 has column 2 replaced. This suggests that the code replaces 5s in columns 1-3 for certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows. Perhaps rows where the row index is less than 4.\n\nSo, the code would replace 5s in columns 1-3 for rows 0-3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(4):  # rows 0-3\n        for j in range(1, 4):  # columns 1-3\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would only replace 5s in rows 0-3, columns 1-3. This would explain some examples, but not others.\n\nIn Example 3, the third row (row 2) is within 0-3, so columns 1-3 would be replaced. In the third row of Example 3, the input is 5 0 5 0 0 0 4 4 5 0 5 5 5 0 5. So columns 1-3 are 0, 5, 0. So column 2 is 5, replaced with 2. This fits. \n\nIn Example 4, the third row (row 2) is within 0-3, so columns 1-3 would be replaced. In the input for row 2, the third row is 5 5 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 5. Columns 1-3 are 5, 5, 5. So replaced with 2s. But in the output of Example 4, the third row is 5 0 2 0 0 5 5 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0 5. So columns 1-3 are 5, 0, 2. So this suggests that this code would replace columns 1-3 with 2s, but the output shows that column 1 is 0. So this is not correct.\n\nThus, this approach is also incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different approach. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 5s with 2s in positions where the row is even and the column is even, or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 2s are replacing 5s in positions where the row and column are both even. Let's check Example 1's seventh row (row 6, even), column 14 (even). So replaced. In Example 3, row 0 (even), column 1 (odd) is replaced. So this doesn't fit.\n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis that the 2s are replacing 5s in certain positions, and the code replaces 5s with 2s in column 2 for all rows, even though it doesn't explain all examples. This is the best I can do given the time.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(18):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if j == 2 and grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not explain the 2 in Example 1's seventh row, column 14. But perhaps there are other patterns. For example, in Example 1, the seventh row has a 2 in column 14, which is part of a different rule.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code, even though it might not capture all cases.\n"
