          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe that the transformation involves spreading out the 3s in a specific pattern, creating a kind of wave or ripple effect that expands from the initial positions of 3s. The pattern seems to involve propagating the 3s outward in a way that forms a kind of spiral or wave pattern, with the 3s spreading out from their initial positions in a structured way.\n\nHere's my best hypothesis for the transformation:\n\n1. Identify all positions with value 3 in the input grid.\n2. For each such position, propagate the 3s outward in a wave-like pattern, expanding in all directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonally), but with some constraints to ensure the pattern doesn't spread too much.\n3. The propagation is limited to a certain distance from the original 3s, and the pattern seems to form a kind of wave that expands outward in a structured way.\n\nBased on this observation, here's the Python function that implements this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Find all positions with value 3\n    three_positions = np.argwhere(grid_np == 3)\n    \n    # Create a result grid filled with 0s\n    result = np.zeros((29, 29), dtype=int)\n    \n    # For each position with value 3, propagate the 3s outward\n    for (r, c) in three_positions:\n        # Use a BFS-like approach to propagate the 3s\n        queue = [(r, c)]\n        visited = set()\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        \n        while queue:\n            x, y = queue.pop(0)\n            \n            # Check if we are within bounds\n            if 0 <= x < 29 and 0 <= y < 29:\n                # If the current cell is not 3, we can propagate\n                if result[x][y] == 0:\n                    result[x][y] = 3\n                    # Add neighboring cells to the queue\n                    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                                continue\n                            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                            if (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                                queue.append((nx, ny))\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return result.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    three_positions = np.argwhere(grid_np == 3)\n    \n    result = np.zeros((29, 29), dtype=int)\n    \n    for (r, c) in three_positions:\n        queue = [(r, c)]\n        visited = set()\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        \n        while queue:\n            x, y = queue.pop(0)\n            \n            if 0 <= x < 29 and 0 <= y < 29:\n                if result[x][y] == 0:\n                    result[x][y] = 3\n                    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                                continue\n                            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                            if (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                                queue.append((nx, ny))\n    \n    return result.tolist()\n```",

              "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe that the transformation involves spreading out the 3s in a specific pattern, creating a kind of wave or ripple effect that expands from the initial positions of 3s. The pattern seems to involve propagating the 3s outward in a way that forms a kind of spiral or wave pattern, with the 3s spreading out from their initial positions in a structured way.\n\nHere's my best hypothesis for the transformation:\n\n1. Identify all positions with value 3 in the input grid.\n2. For each such position, propagate the 3s outward in a wave-like pattern, expanding in all directions (up, down, left, right, and diagonally), but with some constraints to ensure the pattern doesn't spread too much.\n3. The propagation is limited to a certain distance from the original 3s, and the pattern seems to form a kind of wave that expands outward in a structured way.\n\nBased on this observation, here's the Python function that implements this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Find all positions with value 3\n    three_positions = np.argwhere(grid_np == 3)\n    \n    # Create a result grid filled with 0s\n    result = np.zeros((29, 29), dtype=int)\n    \n    # For each position with value 3, propagate the 3s outward\n    for (r, c) in three_positions:\n        # Use a BFS-like approach to propagate the 3s\n        queue = [(r, c)]\n        visited = set()\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        \n        while queue:\n            x, y = queue.pop(0)\n            \n            # Check if we are within bounds\n            if 0 <= x < 29 and 0 <= y < 29:\n                # If the current cell is not 3, we can propagate\n                if result[x][y] == 0:\n                    result[x][y] = 3\n                    # Add neighboring cells to the queue\n                    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                                continue\n                            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                            if (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                                queue.append((nx, ny))\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return result.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    three_positions = np.argwhere(grid_np == 3)\n    \n    result = np.zeros((29, 29), dtype=int)\n    \n    for (r, c) in three_positions:\n        queue = [(r, c)]\n        visited = set()\n        visited.add((r, c))\n        \n        while queue:\n            x, y = queue.pop(0)\n            \n            if 0 <= x < 29 and 0 <= y < 29:\n                if result[x][y] == 0:\n                    result[x][y] = 3\n                    for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                            if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                                continue\n                            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n                            if (nx, ny) not in visited:\n                                visited.add((nx, ny))\n                                queue.append((nx, ny))\n    \n    return result.tolist()\n```",
