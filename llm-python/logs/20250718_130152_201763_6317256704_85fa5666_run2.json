          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let me look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 9x9 grid with a lot of zeros except for some numbers. The output has some numbers in specific positions. Let me compare the input and output.\n\nIn the input, the third row has 0 0 3 0 0 6 0 0 0. The output for that row is 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0. So the 3 in the input is moved to the 8th column (index 7?), and there's an 8 in the first column. Hmm, maybe there's some kind of symmetry or pattern based on positions.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row has 8 0 0 ... and the second row starts with 0 8 0. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their original positions. For instance, maybe the numbers are mirrored or rotated.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the third row's 3 is in column 2 (0-based index 2). In the output, that 3 is in column 7. Wait, 2 and 7 are symmetric around 4.5? Like, 2 + 7 = 9. Maybe that's a clue. Similarly, the 6 in the input's third row is at column 5. In the output, that 6 is in column 3? Or wait, the third row of output is 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0. Wait, the original input's third row has 3 in column 2 and 6 in column 5. In the output, the third row has 8 in column 2 and 3 in column 5. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me check again.\n\nWait the input for example 1's third row is 0 0 3 0 0 6 0 0 0. The output third row is 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0. So the 3 is moved from column 5 (original) to column 5? Wait, original input third row has 6 at column 5 (index 5?), and in the output third row, the 6 is at column 5? No, the output third row is 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0. So the 3 is at column 5 (original input's column 5 is 6, but in the output, the third row's column 5 is 3. Wait, maybe the 6 is moved to another position. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1's fifth row: input is 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0. The output fifth row is 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0. So that row remains the same. But the sixth row input is 0 0 8 0 0 7 0 0 0, and output is 0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0 0. So the 8 is moved to column 5 (original 8 was in column 2, now 7 in column 2?), and 7 is moved to column 5? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled based on their original positions. For example, in the first row of the output, the first element is 8, which was not present in the input. So maybe the transformation is not just moving existing numbers but adding new ones based on some rules.\n\nLooking at example 2. The input has some numbers and the output has more. For example, the first row of input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0. Wait, but that's a 12-column grid? Wait, no, the examples might have different structures. Wait, the first example's input is 9x9. Wait, example 2's input is written as 12 columns? Wait, the input for example 2 is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 8\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, but that's 12 columns. But the output is 12 columns as well. Wait, but the problem statement says that the input and output are 9x9 grids. Oh, maybe there's a mistake in the way I'm reading the examples. Wait, the first example's input is 9 rows, each with 9 elements. The second example's input is 12 rows? That can't be. Wait, perhaps the examples are written in a different way. Maybe the input is 9x9, but the examples are written with some formatting that's not correct. For example, maybe the second example is a 9x9 grid, but the input is written as 12 elements per row. That's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the examples are written with some formatting issues. Let me check again. The first example's input is 9 rows, each with 9 elements. The output is also 9x9. The second example's input is written as 12 rows, each with 12 elements. That can't be. Wait, maybe the second example is a 12x12 grid? But the problem says that the test input is 9x9. That's conflicting. Wait, the problem says that the test input is 9x9, but the examples may have different sizes. But the problem says that the function must take a 9x9 grid. So perhaps the examples are written with some formatting errors. Maybe the second example is a 9x9 grid, but the input is written with some lines that have 12 elements. That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are written with some formatting that's not correct. For example, the second example's input is written as:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n...\n\nBut that's 12 elements per row. So perhaps the examples are not 9x9. But the problem says that the test input is 9x9, and that the function must return a 9x9 grid. Therefore, perhaps the examples are written with some formatting errors, but the actual input is 9x9. For example, maybe in example 2, the input is 9 rows, each with 9 elements. But the way it's written here is with some extra elements. Maybe the user made a mistake in formatting. For example, the first example's input is 9x9, and the second example's input is also 9x9, but the way it's written has some formatting issues. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are not 9x9, but the problem says that the test input is 9x9. Therefore, I need to focus on the test input, which is 9x9. Let me check the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0\n7 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n8 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n\nBut that's 8 rows, each with 8 elements. Wait, that's not 9x9. Wait, perhaps the test input is written with 8 rows, but the actual input is 9x9. Maybe the user made a mistake in formatting. But the problem says that the test input is 9x9. So maybe the test input is written as 8 rows, but the actual input is 9x9. This is confusing. But given that the problem says that the test input is 9x9, perhaps the examples are also 9x9 grids. Therefore, maybe the examples are written in a way that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are written with some formatting issues, but the actual input is 9x9. For example, the first example's input is 9 rows of 9 elements. The second example's input may have some lines that are written with 12 elements, but that's a mistake. \n\nBut given that the problem says that the test input is 9x9, I need to focus on that. Let me try to think of the transformation based on the examples. \n\nLooking at example 1 again. The input has some numbers, and the output has some numbers in different positions. For instance, the third row of input has a 3 in column 2 (0-based index 2). In the output, that row has an 8 in column 2. Also, the 6 in column 5 of the input is now in column 5 of the output? Or maybe not. Wait, the third row of input is [0,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,0]. The output third row is [0,0,8,0,0,3,0,0,0]. So the 3 is moved to column 5 (original input's column 5 is 6, but in the output, column 5 is 3. So maybe the 6 is moved to another position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of reflection or rotation. For example, in the first row of the input, all are zeros except the 7th column (index 6) is 8. In the output, the first row is [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]. So the 8 is at column 0, and the 3 is at column 7. So maybe there's a reflection across the vertical axis. For example, column 0 and 8 are swapped, column 1 and 7, etc. But in the input, the 8 is in column 6 (index 6), and in the output, it's in column 0. So that would be a reflection across the vertical axis. But that's not possible unless the grid is mirrored. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is moved to the first column, and the 3 is moved to the eighth column. So perhaps there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their position. \n\nLooking at the first row of the output, the first element is 8. In the input, the first row is all zeros. So how is that 8 generated? Maybe the transformation is not based on existing numbers but some other rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd. \n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 8 in the first column and 3 in the eighth. The second row has 8 in the second column and 3 in the eighth. Wait, the second row of output is [0,8,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]. So the 8 is in column 1, and the 3 is in column 6. \n\nHmm. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their row and column. For example, in the first row, the first column is 8, which is the same as the 8 in the input's seventh column (index 6). But how does that relate? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of symmetry. For instance, in the first row of the input, the 8 is at column 6 (index 6). In the output, it's moved to column 0. That's a reflection across the vertical axis. If we reflect the grid horizontally, then column 6 becomes column 2 (since 9-6-1=2?), but that doesn't fit. Wait, for a 9x9 grid, the reflection across the vertical axis would map column i to column 8-i. For example, column 0 becomes 8, column 1 becomes 7, ..., column 4 becomes 4, column 5 becomes 3, column 6 becomes 2, column 7 becomes 1, column 8 becomes 0. \n\nBut in the first row of the input, the 8 is at column 6. After reflection, that would be column 2. But in the output, the first row has 8 at column 0. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is a rotation. For example, rotating the grid 90 degrees clockwise. But that would change the positions in a different way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where numbers are placed in certain positions based on their original positions. For example, if a cell (i,j) has a value, then after transformation, it's placed in a different position. \n\nBut given that the examples are not clear, perhaps the transformation is more complex. Let me look for other patterns. \n\nIn example 1, the output for the third row is [0,0,8,0,0,3,0,0,0]. The input third row is [0,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,0]. So the 3 is moved to column 5 (original column 2?), and the 6 is moved to column 5 (original column 5). Wait, no. The original third row's 3 is at column 2 (index 2), and in the output it's at column 2 (index 2)? No, the output third row is [0,0,8,0,0,3,0,0,0]. So the 8 is at column 2 (index 2), and the 3 is at column 5 (index 5). So the original 3 was at column 2, and now it's at column 5. The original 6 was at column 5, and now it's at column 5. Wait, that's not possible. So maybe there's a mistake in my analysis. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3 is moved to column 5 (original column 2) and the 6 is moved to column 5. But that would mean that the 3 is moved to column 5 and the 6 is moved to column 5. That doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves swapping certain positions. For example, in the third row, the 3 and 6 are swapped. But in the input third row, the third row is [0,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,0], and in the output it's [0,0,8,0,0,3,0,0,0]. So the 8 is new. So that's not a swap. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation involves filling in certain positions based on the original positions. For example, in the first row of the output, the first column is 8. In the input, the seventh column (index 6) is 8. So maybe the 8 is moved to the first column. Similarly, the third row's output has an 8 in the third column. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd. \n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row has 8 in column 0 and 3 in column 7. The second row has 8 in column 1 and 3 in column 6. The third row has 8 in column 2 and 3 in column 5. This seems like a pattern where for each row i, the value 8 is placed at column i, and the value 3 is placed at column 8 - i. For example, row 0: 8 at 0, 3 at 7 (8-0=8, but 8-0-1=7? Maybe). \n\nIn the first row of output, the 8 is at column 0, and 3 at column 7 (which is 8 - 0 - 1 = 7). For row 1, 8 is at column 1, 3 at column 6 (8 - 1 -1 = 6). For row 2, 8 is at column 2, 3 at column 5 (8-2-1=5). So this seems to fit. \n\nIf this is the case, then for each row i, the 8 is placed at column i, and the 3 is placed at column 8 - i -1 = 7 - i. \n\nBut how does this fit with the input? In the input, the third row has a 3 in column 2 (i=2) and a 6 in column 5. But in the output, the third row has an 8 at column 2 and 3 at column 5. So the 3 is moved from column 2 to column 5. That would fit with the pattern where for row i, the 3 is at column 7 - i. For i=2, 7-2=5. So yes. \n\nSo this suggests that for each row i, the 8 is placed at column i, and the 3 is placed at column 7 - i. \n\nBut how do we get the 8 and 3 from the input? In the input, the third row has a 3 in column 2. But in the output, the 3 is placed at column 5. So maybe the 3 is moved to column 7 - i. \n\nBut what about the 8? In the input, the 8 is in column 6 (row 0, column 6). In the output, the 8 is placed at column 0. So that would be row 0, column 0. Which fits with the pattern of placing 8 at column i for row i. \n\nSo this suggests that the transformation involves placing 8s and 3s in certain positions based on their row. \n\nBut how do we determine which numbers to place? For example, in the first row of the input, there's an 8 in column 6. In the output, the first row has 8 in column 0. So the 8 is moved to column i. \n\nSimilarly, for the third row, the 3 is moved to column 5. \n\nBut how do we know which numbers to place? Perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with specific numbers based on their row and column. \n\nAnother example: in example 1's sixth row of input, the row is [0,0,8,0,0,7,0,0,0]. The output for that row is [0,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0]. So the 8 is moved to column 5 (original column 2), and the 7 is moved to column 2. The 6 is moved to column 5. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with numbers based on their row and column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap certain positions. For example, in the first row, the 8 is moved to column 0, and the 3 is moved to column 7. In the second row, the 8 is moved to column 1, and the 3 is moved to column 6. \n\nBut how do we know which numbers to place in those positions? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original positions of certain numbers. For example, if a cell (i,j) has a value, then after transformation, it's placed in (i, j) or some other position. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for other patterns. \n\nLooking at example 3. The input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n8 0 0 7 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBut again, this seems to be a 12x12 grid, which is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are not 9x9, but the problem says that the test input is 9x9. Therefore, perhaps the examples are written in a way that's not clear. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should focus on the test input. The test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0\n7 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n8 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n\nBut that's 8 rows, each with 8 elements. So perhaps this is a 8x8 grid, but the problem says that the function must process 9x9 grids. This is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test input is written with 8 rows, but it's actually a 9x9 grid, with the ninth row missing. But that's not clear. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the examples are not correctly formatted, and I should focus on the patterns that are visible. \n\nAnother approach: looking for the transformation between the input and output of example 1. The input has a 3 in row 2 (third row), column 2. In the output, it's at row 2, column 5. The 6 in the input is at column 5, and in the output, it's at column 5. So that's not a swap. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled based on their row. For example, in the first row of the output, the first column is 8, and the eighth column is 3. In the second row, the second column is 8, and the seventh is 3. In the third row, third column is 8, sixth is 3. \n\nSo for row i, the 8 is at column i, and the 3 is at column 8 - i - 1 = 7 - i. \n\nIf this is the case, then for each row i, the 8 is placed at column i, and the 3 is placed at column 7 - i. \n\nSo, for example, in row 0, column 0 is 8, column 7 is 3. \n\nIn the input, the first row has a 8 at column 6. So in the output, that 8 is moved to column 0. \n\nSimilarly, the third row has a 3 at column 2, which is moved to column 5 (7 - 2 = 5). \n\nSo this seems to be a pattern. \n\nBut how do we determine which numbers to place in these positions? For example, in the first row of the output, the 8 is placed at column 0, and the 3 is placed at column 7. \n\nBut in the input, there is no 8 in the first row. So where does the 8 come from? \n\nMaybe the transformation involves placing 8s and 3s in certain positions regardless of the input. For example, for each row i, the 8 is placed at column i, and the 3 is placed at column 7 - i. \n\nBut then, in the input, there may be other numbers that are moved or replaced. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to fill certain positions with specific numbers based on their row and column. \n\nBut how does this work with the other examples? \n\nIn example 2, the input has some 2s and 3s, and the output has more numbers. For example, the first row of the input has 8 in column 6, and in the output, the first row has 3 in column 0 and 8 in column 0. Wait, the output for example 2's first row is [0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,8,0,8]. Wait, but this is a 12-column row. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the transformation is based on the following:\n\nFor each row i, the 8 is placed at column i, and the 3 is placed at column 8 - i - 1. \n\nBut how to determine the values to place in those positions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with specific numbers. For example, in the first row, the first column is 8, and the eighth column is 3. In the second row, the second column is 8, and the seventh column is 3. \n\nThis seems to be a pattern. \n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation for each row i is to set grid[i][i] = 8 and grid[i][8 - i - 1] = 3. \n\nBut how does this fit with the other examples? \n\nFor example, in example 1's third row (i=2), the output has 8 at column 2 and 3 at column 5. Which fits with 8 at i=2 and 3 at 8 - 2 - 1 = 5. \n\nSo this seems to be a possible pattern. \n\nBut what about other numbers? For example, in example 1's sixth row (i=5), the output has 7 at column 2 and 6 at column 5. \n\nWait, the sixth row of example 1's input is [0,0,8,0,0,7,0,0,0]. The output is [0,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0]. So the 8 is at column 2 (i=2), and the 7 is at column 2. The 7 is moved to column 2, and the 6 is moved to column 5. \n\nThis doesn't fit the previous pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves swapping certain positions. For example, in the sixth row, the 8 is moved to column 2, and the 7 is moved to column 2. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with specific values based on their row and column. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAnother idea: the transformation might involve swapping certain values in the grid. For example, in example 1, the 3 and 6 in the third row are swapped, but with the addition of an 8. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to fill in certain positions with specific numbers, regardless of the input. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the pattern observed in example 1, where for each row i, the 8 is placed at column i and the 3 is placed at column 8 - i - 1. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row i in 0..8:\n    set grid[i][i] = 8\n    set grid[i][8 - i - 1] = 3\n\nBut what about other numbers? For example, in example 1, the third row of input has a 3 at column 2, but in the output, it's replaced with 8. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation is to overwrite certain positions with 8 and 3. \n\nBut this would mean that the output has 8s and 3s in specific positions, regardless of the input. \n\nBut in example 1's sixth row, the output has 7 at column 2 and 6 at column 5. \n\nThis doesn't fit the pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to fill the diagonal with 8s and the anti-diagonal with 3s. \n\nSo, for each row i, the diagonal element (i,i) is 8, and the anti-diagonal element (i, 8 - i) is 3. \n\nBut in example 1's third row, the anti-diagonal element would be column 8 - 2 = 6. So for row 2, the 3 is at column 6. But in the output, it's at column 5. \n\nThis doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the anti-diagonal is column 8 - i - 1. \n\nFor example, for row i, the anti-diagonal position is 8 - i - 1 = 7 - i. \n\nSo for i=0, it's 7. \n\nFor i=2, it's 5. \n\nWhich matches example 1's third row. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nSo, the code would be to set for each row i:\n\ngrid[i][i] = 8\ngrid[i][7 - i] = 3\n\nBut what about other cells? \n\nIn example 1's sixth row (i=5), the code would set grid[5][5] = 8 and grid[5][7-5=2] = 3. \n\nBut in the input, the sixth row is [0,0,8,0,0,7,0,0,0]. So the 8 is at column 2, and in the output, it's at column 5. \n\nSo this suggests that the code is replacing the value at (i, i) with 8 and (i, 7 - i) with 3. \n\nBut in the input, the sixth row's column 2 is 8, which is now replaced with 3 in the output. \n\nThis would mean that the transformation is to overwrite those positions with 8 and 3, regardless of the input. \n\nBut then, in the test input, which is 9x9, how would this work? \n\nLet me try to apply this to the test input. \n\nThe test input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 3 0 0 8 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 4: 7 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 8 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n\nBut this is 8 rows, which is not 9x9. Assuming that the test input is a 9x9 grid, but the provided input is missing the ninth row. \n\nAssuming that the ninth row is all zeros, then for each row i from 0 to 8:\n\nSet grid[i][i] = 8\nSet grid[i][7 - i] = 3\n\nBut this would overwrite certain positions. \n\nFor example, in row 0, column 0 is set to 8, and column 7 is set to 3. \n\nIn row 1, column 1 is 8, column 6 is 3. \n\nRow 2: column 2 is 8, column 5 is 3. \n\nRow 3: column 3 is 8, column 4 is 3. \n\nRow 4: column 4 is 8, column 3 is 3. \n\nRow 5: column 5 is 8, column 2 is 3. \n\nRow 6: column 6 is 8, column 1 is 3. \n\nRow 7: column 7 is 8, column 0 is 3. \n\nRow 8: column 8 is 8, column 7 is 3. \n\nThis would create a grid with 8s on the diagonal and 3s on the anti-diagonal. \n\nBut this seems to be the pattern observed in example 1. \n\nSo, the code would be to set those positions. \n\nBut what about other values in the grid? Are they left as is, or are they modified? \n\nIn example 1's output, there are other numbers like 7, 6, etc. So the transformation may involve setting those positions and leaving others as is. \n\nSo the code would be to create a new grid, and for each row i, set grid[i][i] = 8 and grid[i][7 - i] = 3. \n\nBut this would overwrite the existing values in those positions. \n\nBut in example 1's input, the third row (i=2) has a 3 in column 2. In the output, that position is set to 8. So the code would overwrite that. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nBut what about other cells? For example, in example 1's sixth row (i=5), the input has 8 in column 2. In the output, that cell is set to 3 (since for row 5, column 7 - 5 = 2). So that cell is overwritten. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation is to set those positions regardless of their original values. \n\nSo, the code would be to create a new grid, and for each cell (i,j) where j == i or j == 7 - i, set the value to 8 or 3 accordingly. \n\nBut how to handle this in code. \n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    for i in range(9):\n        transformed[i][i] = 8\n        transformed[i][7 - i] = 3\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would create a grid with 8s on the diagonal and 3s on the anti-diagonal. \n\nBut this seems to fit example 1's output. \n\nLet me check example 1's output. \n\nFor row 0, the transformed grid would have 8 at (0,0) and 3 at (0,7). \n\nIn the example 1's output, row 0 is [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]. Which matches this. \n\nRow 1: 0,8,0,0,0,0,3,0,0. Which matches the example's output. \n\nRow 2: 0,0,8,0,0,3,0,0,0. Which matches the example's output. \n\nRow 3: 0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,3. Wait, in example 1's output, row 3 is [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't match. \n\nWait, this suggests that the code is not correct. Because in the example 1's output, row 3 is unchanged. But according to the code, row 3 would have 8 at column 3 and 3 at column 4. \n\nBut in the example 1's output, row 3 is [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. So the code's transformation would overwrite those positions. \n\nThis indicates that the code is not correct. \n\nSo there must be another pattern. \n\nThis suggests that the previous hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the pattern is more complex. \n\nLooking at example 1's output, the fifth row is [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0], which is the same as the input. So for row 4 (assuming 0-based), the code's transformation would set grid[4][4] = 8 and grid[4][3] = 3. But in the input, row 4 is [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. So the code would set grid[4][4] to 8 and grid[4][3] to 3. But in the output, row 4 is [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. So the code's transformation would change the values at positions (4,3) and (4,4) to 3 and 8. But in the output, those positions are 2 and 2. \n\nThis indicates that the previous hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nSo, there must be another pattern. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to fill certain positions with 8 and 3 based on the original positions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to swap certain values. \n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the third row has 8 at column 2 and 3 at column 5. The original third row has 3 at column 2 and 6 at column 5. So the 3 is moved to column 5 and the 6 is moved to column 2. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves swapping values in certain positions. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should try to find another pattern. \n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row has 8 and 3 in positions (0,0) and (0,7). The second row has 8 and 3 in (1,1) and (1,6). The third row has 8 in (2,2) and 3 in (2,5). The fourth row has 2 and 2 in the middle, but the code's previous hypothesis would set 8 and 3 there. \n\nBut in the example's output, the fourth row is unchanged. So perhaps the transformation is not to set those positions, but to leave them as is. \n\nThis suggests that the previous hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to fill certain positions based on the original values. For example, if a cell (i,j) has a value, then in the transformed grid, it's placed in a certain position. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, in the first row, the 8 is moved to the first column, and the 3 is moved to the eighth column. \n\nBut how to determine which values to move. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be to replace each cell (i,j) with a value based on some formula. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. \n\nGiven the time, perhaps the best approach is to look for the pattern in the first example and see if there's a way to code it. \n\nIn example 1's output, the first row has 8 and 3 in positions (0,0) and (0,7). The second row has 8 and 3 in (1,1) and (1,6). The third row has 8 and 3 in (2,2) and (2,5). The fourth row has 2 and 2 in (3,3) and (3,4). Wait, but in the output, the fourth row is [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. So the 2 and 2 are in columns 3 and 4. \n\nThis suggests that for row i, if i is even, then certain positions are filled with 2 and 2. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAnother idea: the transformation involves filling certain positions with values based on their row. For example, in even rows, certain values are placed, and in odd rows, others. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with the initial hypothesis, even if it doesn't fit all examples. \n\nThe code would be to set the diagonal and anti-diagonal to 8 and 3. \n\nBut this would not fit example 1's output for rows 3 and 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to fill the diagonal with 8 and the anti-diagonal with 3, but only for certain rows. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to fill the diagonal with 8 and the anti-diagonal with 3, but only for rows 0-2. \n\nBut this is just guessing. \n\nGiven the time, I think I'll proceed with the code that sets the diagonal and anti-diagonal to 8 and 3, and see if it passes the examples. \n\nBut in example 1's output, the fourth row has 2 and 2 in the middle, which would not be set by this code. \n\nSo this suggests that the code is incorrect. \n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the fifth row is unchanged. So perhaps the transformation is to leave certain rows as is. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to fill certain positions with 8 and 3 based on the original positions. For example, if a cell (i,j) has a value, then in the transformed grid, it is placed in (i, j) if j is even, or some other condition. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven the time, I think I need to make a guess and proceed. \n\nThe code that sets the diagonal and anti-diagonal to 8 and 3 may be part of the solution, but it's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace each cell (i,j) with 8 if i == j, and 3 if i + j == 8. \n\nThis would mean:\n\nfor each cell (i,j):\n    if i == j:\n        value = 8\n    elif i + j == 8:\n        value = 3\n    else:\n        value = original value\n\nBut this would overwrite the original values in those positions. \n\nIn example 1's third row, the cell (2,2) is set to 8, and (2,5) is set to 3. \n\nIn the input, the third row has 3 at (2,2), which is overwritten to 8. \n\nIn the input, the third row has 6 at (2,5), which is overwritten to 3. \n\nThis would explain the example 1's output. \n\nFor the fourth row (i=3), the cell (3,3) is set to 8, and (3,5) is set to 3 (since 3+5=8). But in the input, the fourth row is [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. So the cell (3,3) is 2, which is overwritten to 8. The cell (3,5) is 0, overwritten to 3. \n\nBut in the example 1's output, the fourth row is [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. This suggests that the code is not correct. \n\nSo this indicates that the code is not correct. \n\nBut why is the fourth row unchanged in example 1's output? \n\nMaybe the transformation is to set certain positions based on the original values. \n\nFor example, if a cell (i,j) has a value, then in the transformed grid, it is placed in (i, j) if j is even, or some other condition. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with the code that sets the diagonal and anti-diagonal to 8 and 3, even if it doesn't fit all examples. \n\nSo the final code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    for i in range(9):\n        transformed[i][i] = 8\n        transformed[i][7 - i] = 3\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit example 1's fourth row. \n\nBut perhaps the examples are not correctly formatted, or there's a different pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set the diagonal to 8 and the anti-diagonal to 3, but only for certain rows. \n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say. \n\nGiven that the user provided the test input, perhaps I should focus on that. \n\nThe test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0\n7 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n8 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n\nAssuming this is 8 rows of 8 columns, but the function must return a 9x9 grid. This is confusing, but perhaps the test input is a 9x9 grid with the ninth row being all zeros. \n\nIf I apply the code to the test input, the transformed grid would have 8 on the diagonal and 3 on the anti-diagonal. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not fit all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let me look at the examples carefully.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input is a 9x9 grid with a lot of zeros except for some numbers. The output has some numbers in specific positions. Let me compare the input and output.\n\nIn the input, the third row has 0 0 3 0 0 6 0 0 0. The output for that row is 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0. So the 3 in the input is moved to the 8th column (index 7?), and there's an 8 in the first column. Hmm, maybe there's some kind of symmetry or pattern based on positions.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the first row has 8 0 0 ... and the second row starts with 0 8 0. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their original positions. For instance, maybe the numbers are mirrored or rotated.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the third row's 3 is in column 2 (0-based index 2). In the output, that 3 is in column 7. Wait, 2 and 7 are symmetric around 4.5? Like, 2 + 7 = 9. Maybe that's a clue. Similarly, the 6 in the input's third row is at column 5. In the output, that 6 is in column 3? Or wait, the third row of output is 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0. Wait, the original input's third row has 3 in column 2 and 6 in column 5. In the output, the third row has 8 in column 2 and 3 in column 5. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me check again.\n\nWait the input for example 1's third row is 0 0 3 0 0 6 0 0 0. The output third row is 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0. So the 3 is moved from column 5 (original) to column 5? Wait, original input third row has 6 at column 5 (index 5?), and in the output third row, the 6 is at column 5? No, the output third row is 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0. So the 3 is at column 5 (original input's column 5 is 6, but in the output, the third row's column 5 is 3. Wait, maybe the 6 is moved to another position. Hmm, not sure.\n\nLooking at the output for example 1's fifth row: input is 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0. The output fifth row is 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0. So that row remains the same. But the sixth row input is 0 0 8 0 0 7 0 0 0, and output is 0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0 0. So the 8 is moved to column 5 (original 8 was in column 2, now 7 in column 2?), and 7 is moved to column 5? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled based on their original positions. For example, in the first row of the output, the first element is 8, which was not present in the input. So maybe the transformation is not just moving existing numbers but adding new ones based on some rules.\n\nLooking at example 2. The input has some numbers and the output has more. For example, the first row of input is 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0. Wait, but that's a 12-column grid? Wait, no, the examples might have different structures. Wait, the first example's input is 9x9. Wait, example 2's input is written as 12 columns? Wait, the input for example 2 is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 7\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0\n0 8 0 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 8\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 7 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, but that's 12 columns. But the output is 12 columns as well. Wait, but the problem statement says that the input and output are 9x9 grids. Oh, maybe there's a mistake in the way I'm reading the examples. Wait, the first example's input is 9 rows, each with 9 elements. The second example's input is 12 rows? That can't be. Wait, perhaps the examples are written in a different way. Maybe the input is 9x9, but the examples are written with some formatting that's not correct. For example, maybe the second example is a 9x9 grid, but the input is written as 12 elements per row. That's confusing.\n\nWait, maybe the examples are written with some formatting issues. Let me check again. The first example's input is 9 rows, each with 9 elements. The output is also 9x9. The second example's input is written as 12 rows, each with 12 elements. That can't be. Wait, maybe the second example is a 12x12 grid? But the problem says that the test input is 9x9. That's conflicting. Wait, the problem says that the test input is 9x9, but the examples may have different sizes. But the problem says that the function must take a 9x9 grid. So perhaps the examples are written with some formatting errors. Maybe the second example is a 9x9 grid, but the input is written with some lines that have 12 elements. That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are written with some formatting that's not correct. For example, the second example's input is written as:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 6 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n...\n\nBut that's 12 elements per row. So perhaps the examples are not 9x9. But the problem says that the test input is 9x9, and that the function must return a 9x9 grid. Therefore, perhaps the examples are written with some formatting errors, but the actual input is 9x9. For example, maybe in example 2, the input is 9 rows, each with 9 elements. But the way it's written here is with some extra elements. Maybe the user made a mistake in formatting. For example, the first example's input is 9x9, and the second example's input is also 9x9, but the way it's written has some formatting issues. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are not 9x9, but the problem says that the test input is 9x9. Therefore, I need to focus on the test input, which is 9x9. Let me check the test input:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0\n7 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n8 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n\nBut that's 8 rows, each with 8 elements. Wait, that's not 9x9. Wait, perhaps the test input is written with 8 rows, but the actual input is 9x9. Maybe the user made a mistake in formatting. But the problem says that the test input is 9x9. So maybe the test input is written as 8 rows, but the actual input is 9x9. This is confusing. But given that the problem says that the test input is 9x9, perhaps the examples are also 9x9 grids. Therefore, maybe the examples are written in a way that's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are written with some formatting issues, but the actual input is 9x9. For example, the first example's input is 9 rows of 9 elements. The second example's input may have some lines that are written with 12 elements, but that's a mistake. \n\nBut given that the problem says that the test input is 9x9, I need to focus on that. Let me try to think of the transformation based on the examples. \n\nLooking at example 1 again. The input has some numbers, and the output has some numbers in different positions. For instance, the third row of input has a 3 in column 2 (0-based index 2). In the output, that row has an 8 in column 2. Also, the 6 in column 5 of the input is now in column 5 of the output? Or maybe not. Wait, the third row of input is [0,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,0]. The output third row is [0,0,8,0,0,3,0,0,0]. So the 3 is moved to column 5 (original input's column 5 is 6, but in the output, column 5 is 3. So maybe the 6 is moved to another position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of reflection or rotation. For example, in the first row of the input, all are zeros except the 7th column (index 6) is 8. In the output, the first row is [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]. So the 8 is at column 0, and the 3 is at column 7. So maybe there's a reflection across the vertical axis. For example, column 0 and 8 are swapped, column 1 and 7, etc. But in the input, the 8 is in column 6 (index 6), and in the output, it's in column 0. So that would be a reflection across the vertical axis. But that's not possible unless the grid is mirrored. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 8 is moved to the first column, and the 3 is moved to the eighth column. So perhaps there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their position. \n\nLooking at the first row of the output, the first element is 8. In the input, the first row is all zeros. So how is that 8 generated? Maybe the transformation is not based on existing numbers but some other rule. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd. \n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1's output, the first row has 8 in the first column and 3 in the eighth. The second row has 8 in the second column and 3 in the eighth. Wait, the second row of output is [0,8,0,0,0,0,3,0,0]. So the 8 is in column 1, and the 3 is in column 6. \n\nHmm. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their row and column. For example, in the first row, the first column is 8, which is the same as the 8 in the input's seventh column (index 6). But how does that relate? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of symmetry. For instance, in the first row of the input, the 8 is at column 6 (index 6). In the output, it's moved to column 0. That's a reflection across the vertical axis. If we reflect the grid horizontally, then column 6 becomes column 2 (since 9-6-1=2?), but that doesn't fit. Wait, for a 9x9 grid, the reflection across the vertical axis would map column i to column 8-i. For example, column 0 becomes 8, column 1 becomes 7, ..., column 4 becomes 4, column 5 becomes 3, column 6 becomes 2, column 7 becomes 1, column 8 becomes 0. \n\nBut in the first row of the input, the 8 is at column 6. After reflection, that would be column 2. But in the output, the first row has 8 at column 0. So that doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is a rotation. For example, rotating the grid 90 degrees clockwise. But that would change the positions in a different way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where numbers are placed in certain positions based on their original positions. For example, if a cell (i,j) has a value, then after transformation, it's placed in a different position. \n\nBut given that the examples are not clear, perhaps the transformation is more complex. Let me look for other patterns. \n\nIn example 1, the output for the third row is [0,0,8,0,0,3,0,0,0]. The input third row is [0,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,0]. So the 3 is moved to column 5 (original column 2?), and the 6 is moved to column 5 (original column 5). Wait, no. The original third row's 3 is at column 2 (index 2), and in the output it's at column 2 (index 2)? No, the output third row is [0,0,8,0,0,3,0,0,0]. So the 8 is at column 2 (index 2), and the 3 is at column 5 (index 5). So the original 3 was at column 2, and now it's at column 5. The original 6 was at column 5, and now it's at column 5. Wait, that's not possible. So maybe there's a mistake in my analysis. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 3 is moved to column 5 (original column 2) and the 6 is moved to column 5. But that would mean that the 3 is moved to column 5 and the 6 is moved to column 5. That doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves swapping certain positions. For example, in the third row, the 3 and 6 are swapped. But in the input third row, the third row is [0,0,3,0,0,6,0,0,0], and in the output it's [0,0,8,0,0,3,0,0,0]. So the 8 is new. So that's not a swap. \n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation involves filling in certain positions based on the original positions. For example, in the first row of the output, the first column is 8. In the input, the seventh column (index 6) is 8. So maybe the 8 is moved to the first column. Similarly, the third row's output has an 8 in the third column. But how does that fit?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled with numbers based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even or odd, or if the column is even or odd. \n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row has 8 in column 0 and 3 in column 7. The second row has 8 in column 1 and 3 in column 6. The third row has 8 in column 2 and 3 in column 5. This seems like a pattern where for each row i, the value 8 is placed at column i, and the value 3 is placed at column 8 - i. For example, row 0: 8 at 0, 3 at 7 (8-0=8, but 8-0-1=7? Maybe). \n\nIn the first row of output, the 8 is at column 0, and 3 at column 7 (which is 8 - 0 - 1 = 7). For row 1, 8 is at column 1, 3 at column 6 (8 - 1 -1 = 6). For row 2, 8 is at column 2, 3 at column 5 (8-2-1=5). So this seems to fit. \n\nIf this is the case, then for each row i, the 8 is placed at column i, and the 3 is placed at column 8 - i -1 = 7 - i. \n\nBut how does this fit with the input? In the input, the third row has a 3 in column 2 (i=2) and a 6 in column 5. But in the output, the third row has an 8 at column 2 and 3 at column 5. So the 3 is moved from column 2 to column 5. That would fit with the pattern where for row i, the 3 is at column 7 - i. For i=2, 7-2=5. So yes. \n\nSo this suggests that for each row i, the 8 is placed at column i, and the 3 is placed at column 7 - i. \n\nBut how do we get the 8 and 3 from the input? In the input, the third row has a 3 in column 2. But in the output, the 3 is placed at column 5. So maybe the 3 is moved to column 7 - i. \n\nBut what about the 8? In the input, the 8 is in column 6 (row 0, column 6). In the output, the 8 is placed at column 0. So that would be row 0, column 0. Which fits with the pattern of placing 8 at column i for row i. \n\nSo this suggests that the transformation involves placing 8s and 3s in certain positions based on their row. \n\nBut how do we determine which numbers to place? For example, in the first row of the input, there's an 8 in column 6. In the output, the first row has 8 in column 0. So the 8 is moved to column i. \n\nSimilarly, for the third row, the 3 is moved to column 5. \n\nBut how do we know which numbers to place? Perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with specific numbers based on their row and column. \n\nAnother example: in example 1's sixth row of input, the row is [0,0,8,0,0,7,0,0,0]. The output for that row is [0,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0]. So the 8 is moved to column 5 (original column 2), and the 7 is moved to column 2. The 6 is moved to column 5. \n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the transformation is to replace certain positions with numbers based on their row and column. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to swap certain positions. For example, in the first row, the 8 is moved to column 0, and the 3 is moved to column 7. In the second row, the 8 is moved to column 1, and the 3 is moved to column 6. \n\nBut how do we know which numbers to place in those positions? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original positions of certain numbers. For example, if a cell (i,j) has a value, then after transformation, it's placed in (i, j) or some other position. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should look for other patterns. \n\nLooking at example 3. The input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n8 0 0 7 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n6 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 7 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nBut again, this seems to be a 12x12 grid, which is confusing. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the examples are not 9x9, but the problem says that the test input is 9x9. Therefore, perhaps the examples are written in a way that's not clear. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps I should focus on the test input. The test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0\n7 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n8 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n\nBut that's 8 rows, each with 8 elements. So perhaps this is a 8x8 grid, but the problem says that the function must process 9x9 grids. This is conflicting. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the test input is written with 8 rows, but it's actually a 9x9 grid, with the ninth row missing. But that's not clear. \n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the examples are not correctly formatted, and I should focus on the patterns that are visible. \n\nAnother approach: looking for the transformation between the input and output of example 1. The input has a 3 in row 2 (third row), column 2. In the output, it's at row 2, column 5. The 6 in the input is at column 5, and in the output, it's at column 5. So that's not a swap. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves some kind of pattern where certain positions are filled based on their row. For example, in the first row of the output, the first column is 8, and the eighth column is 3. In the second row, the second column is 8, and the seventh is 3. In the third row, third column is 8, sixth is 3. \n\nSo for row i, the 8 is at column i, and the 3 is at column 8 - i - 1 = 7 - i. \n\nIf this is the case, then for each row i, the 8 is placed at column i, and the 3 is placed at column 7 - i. \n\nSo, for example, in row 0, column 0 is 8, column 7 is 3. \n\nIn the input, the first row has a 8 at column 6. So in the output, that 8 is moved to column 0. \n\nSimilarly, the third row has a 3 at column 2, which is moved to column 5 (7 - 2 = 5). \n\nSo this seems to be a pattern. \n\nBut how do we determine which numbers to place in these positions? For example, in the first row of the output, the 8 is placed at column 0, and the 3 is placed at column 7. \n\nBut in the input, there is no 8 in the first row. So where does the 8 come from? \n\nMaybe the transformation involves placing 8s and 3s in certain positions regardless of the input. For example, for each row i, the 8 is placed at column i, and the 3 is placed at column 7 - i. \n\nBut then, in the input, there may be other numbers that are moved or replaced. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to fill certain positions with specific numbers based on their row and column. \n\nBut how does this work with the other examples? \n\nIn example 2, the input has some 2s and 3s, and the output has more numbers. For example, the first row of the input has 8 in column 6, and in the output, the first row has 3 in column 0 and 8 in column 0. Wait, the output for example 2's first row is [0,0,0,0,3,0,3,0,0,8,0,8]. Wait, but this is a 12-column row. \n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the transformation is based on the following:\n\nFor each row i, the 8 is placed at column i, and the 3 is placed at column 8 - i - 1. \n\nBut how to determine the values to place in those positions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with specific numbers. For example, in the first row, the first column is 8, and the eighth column is 3. In the second row, the second column is 8, and the seventh column is 3. \n\nThis seems to be a pattern. \n\nIf this is the case, then the transformation for each row i is to set grid[i][i] = 8 and grid[i][8 - i - 1] = 3. \n\nBut how does this fit with the other examples? \n\nFor example, in example 1's third row (i=2), the output has 8 at column 2 and 3 at column 5. Which fits with 8 at i=2 and 3 at 8 - 2 - 1 = 5. \n\nSo this seems to be a possible pattern. \n\nBut what about other numbers? For example, in example 1's sixth row (i=5), the output has 7 at column 2 and 6 at column 5. \n\nWait, the sixth row of example 1's input is [0,0,8,0,0,7,0,0,0]. The output is [0,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,0]. So the 8 is at column 2 (i=2), and the 7 is at column 2. The 7 is moved to column 2, and the 6 is moved to column 5. \n\nThis doesn't fit the previous pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves swapping certain positions. For example, in the sixth row, the 8 is moved to column 2, and the 7 is moved to column 2. But that doesn't make sense. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace certain positions with specific values based on their row and column. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAnother idea: the transformation might involve swapping certain values in the grid. For example, in example 1, the 3 and 6 in the third row are swapped, but with the addition of an 8. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to fill in certain positions with specific numbers, regardless of the input. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should proceed with the pattern observed in example 1, where for each row i, the 8 is placed at column i and the 3 is placed at column 8 - i - 1. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row i in 0..8:\n    set grid[i][i] = 8\n    set grid[i][8 - i - 1] = 3\n\nBut what about other numbers? For example, in example 1, the third row of input has a 3 at column 2, but in the output, it's replaced with 8. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation is to overwrite certain positions with 8 and 3. \n\nBut this would mean that the output has 8s and 3s in specific positions, regardless of the input. \n\nBut in example 1's sixth row, the output has 7 at column 2 and 6 at column 5. \n\nThis doesn't fit the pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to fill the diagonal with 8s and the anti-diagonal with 3s. \n\nSo, for each row i, the diagonal element (i,i) is 8, and the anti-diagonal element (i, 8 - i) is 3. \n\nBut in example 1's third row, the anti-diagonal element would be column 8 - 2 = 6. So for row 2, the 3 is at column 6. But in the output, it's at column 5. \n\nThis doesn't fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the anti-diagonal is column 8 - i - 1. \n\nFor example, for row i, the anti-diagonal position is 8 - i - 1 = 7 - i. \n\nSo for i=0, it's 7. \n\nFor i=2, it's 5. \n\nWhich matches example 1's third row. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nSo, the code would be to set for each row i:\n\ngrid[i][i] = 8\ngrid[i][7 - i] = 3\n\nBut what about other cells? \n\nIn example 1's sixth row (i=5), the code would set grid[5][5] = 8 and grid[5][7-5=2] = 3. \n\nBut in the input, the sixth row is [0,0,8,0,0,7,0,0,0]. So the 8 is at column 2, and in the output, it's at column 5. \n\nSo this suggests that the code is replacing the value at (i, i) with 8 and (i, 7 - i) with 3. \n\nBut in the input, the sixth row's column 2 is 8, which is now replaced with 3 in the output. \n\nThis would mean that the transformation is to overwrite those positions with 8 and 3, regardless of the input. \n\nBut then, in the test input, which is 9x9, how would this work? \n\nLet me try to apply this to the test input. \n\nThe test input is:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 3 0 0 8 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 2: 0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\nRow 3: 0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0\nRow 4: 7 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\nRow 5: 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 6: 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\nRow 7: 8 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n\nBut this is 8 rows, which is not 9x9. Assuming that the test input is a 9x9 grid, but the provided input is missing the ninth row. \n\nAssuming that the ninth row is all zeros, then for each row i from 0 to 8:\n\nSet grid[i][i] = 8\nSet grid[i][7 - i] = 3\n\nBut this would overwrite certain positions. \n\nFor example, in row 0, column 0 is set to 8, and column 7 is set to 3. \n\nIn row 1, column 1 is 8, column 6 is 3. \n\nRow 2: column 2 is 8, column 5 is 3. \n\nRow 3: column 3 is 8, column 4 is 3. \n\nRow 4: column 4 is 8, column 3 is 3. \n\nRow 5: column 5 is 8, column 2 is 3. \n\nRow 6: column 6 is 8, column 1 is 3. \n\nRow 7: column 7 is 8, column 0 is 3. \n\nRow 8: column 8 is 8, column 7 is 3. \n\nThis would create a grid with 8s on the diagonal and 3s on the anti-diagonal. \n\nBut this seems to be the pattern observed in example 1. \n\nSo, the code would be to set those positions. \n\nBut what about other values in the grid? Are they left as is, or are they modified? \n\nIn example 1's output, there are other numbers like 7, 6, etc. So the transformation may involve setting those positions and leaving others as is. \n\nSo the code would be to create a new grid, and for each row i, set grid[i][i] = 8 and grid[i][7 - i] = 3. \n\nBut this would overwrite the existing values in those positions. \n\nBut in example 1's input, the third row (i=2) has a 3 in column 2. In the output, that position is set to 8. So the code would overwrite that. \n\nThis seems to fit. \n\nBut what about other cells? For example, in example 1's sixth row (i=5), the input has 8 in column 2. In the output, that cell is set to 3 (since for row 5, column 7 - 5 = 2). So that cell is overwritten. \n\nThis suggests that the transformation is to set those positions regardless of their original values. \n\nSo, the code would be to create a new grid, and for each cell (i,j) where j == i or j == 7 - i, set the value to 8 or 3 accordingly. \n\nBut how to handle this in code. \n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    for i in range(9):\n        transformed[i][i] = 8\n        transformed[i][7 - i] = 3\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would create a grid with 8s on the diagonal and 3s on the anti-diagonal. \n\nBut this seems to fit example 1's output. \n\nLet me check example 1's output. \n\nFor row 0, the transformed grid would have 8 at (0,0) and 3 at (0,7). \n\nIn the example 1's output, row 0 is [8,0,0,0,0,0,0,3,0]. Which matches this. \n\nRow 1: 0,8,0,0,0,0,3,0,0. Which matches the example's output. \n\nRow 2: 0,0,8,0,0,3,0,0,0. Which matches the example's output. \n\nRow 3: 0,0,0,8,0,0,0,0,3. Wait, in example 1's output, row 3 is [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't match. \n\nWait, this suggests that the code is not correct. Because in the example 1's output, row 3 is unchanged. But according to the code, row 3 would have 8 at column 3 and 3 at column 4. \n\nBut in the example 1's output, row 3 is [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. So the code's transformation would overwrite those positions. \n\nThis indicates that the code is not correct. \n\nSo there must be another pattern. \n\nThis suggests that the previous hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nPerhaps the pattern is more complex. \n\nLooking at example 1's output, the fifth row is [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0], which is the same as the input. So for row 4 (assuming 0-based), the code's transformation would set grid[4][4] = 8 and grid[4][3] = 3. But in the input, row 4 is [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. So the code would set grid[4][4] to 8 and grid[4][3] to 3. But in the output, row 4 is [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. So the code's transformation would change the values at positions (4,3) and (4,4) to 3 and 8. But in the output, those positions are 2 and 2. \n\nThis indicates that the previous hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nSo, there must be another pattern. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to fill certain positions with 8 and 3 based on the original positions. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to swap certain values. \n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the third row has 8 at column 2 and 3 at column 5. The original third row has 3 at column 2 and 6 at column 5. So the 3 is moved to column 5 and the 6 is moved to column 2. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves swapping values in certain positions. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. \n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should try to find another pattern. \n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first row has 8 and 3 in positions (0,0) and (0,7). The second row has 8 and 3 in (1,1) and (1,6). The third row has 8 in (2,2) and 3 in (2,5). The fourth row has 2 and 2 in the middle, but the code's previous hypothesis would set 8 and 3 there. \n\nBut in the example's output, the fourth row is unchanged. So perhaps the transformation is not to set those positions, but to leave them as is. \n\nThis suggests that the previous hypothesis is incorrect. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to fill certain positions based on the original values. For example, if a cell (i,j) has a value, then in the transformed grid, it's placed in a certain position. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, in the first row, the 8 is moved to the first column, and the 3 is moved to the eighth column. \n\nBut how to determine which values to move. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation could be to replace each cell (i,j) with a value based on some formula. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to determine. \n\nGiven the time, perhaps the best approach is to look for the pattern in the first example and see if there's a way to code it. \n\nIn example 1's output, the first row has 8 and 3 in positions (0,0) and (0,7). The second row has 8 and 3 in (1,1) and (1,6). The third row has 8 and 3 in (2,2) and (2,5). The fourth row has 2 and 2 in (3,3) and (3,4). Wait, but in the output, the fourth row is [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. So the 2 and 2 are in columns 3 and 4. \n\nThis suggests that for row i, if i is even, then certain positions are filled with 2 and 2. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAnother idea: the transformation involves filling certain positions with values based on their row. For example, in even rows, certain values are placed, and in odd rows, others. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with the initial hypothesis, even if it doesn't fit all examples. \n\nThe code would be to set the diagonal and anti-diagonal to 8 and 3. \n\nBut this would not fit example 1's output for rows 3 and 4. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to fill the diagonal with 8 and the anti-diagonal with 3, but only for certain rows. \n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to fill the diagonal with 8 and the anti-diagonal with 3, but only for rows 0-2. \n\nBut this is just guessing. \n\nGiven the time, I think I'll proceed with the code that sets the diagonal and anti-diagonal to 8 and 3, and see if it passes the examples. \n\nBut in example 1's output, the fourth row has 2 and 2 in the middle, which would not be set by this code. \n\nSo this suggests that the code is incorrect. \n\nAnother observation: in example 1's output, the fifth row is unchanged. So perhaps the transformation is to leave certain rows as is. \n\nBut this is not helpful. \n\nMaybe the transformation is to fill certain positions with 8 and 3 based on the original positions. For example, if a cell (i,j) has a value, then in the transformed grid, it is placed in (i, j) if j is even, or some other condition. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven the time, I think I need to make a guess and proceed. \n\nThe code that sets the diagonal and anti-diagonal to 8 and 3 may be part of the solution, but it's not clear. \n\nAlternatively, the transformation is to replace each cell (i,j) with 8 if i == j, and 3 if i + j == 8. \n\nThis would mean:\n\nfor each cell (i,j):\n    if i == j:\n        value = 8\n    elif i + j == 8:\n        value = 3\n    else:\n        value = original value\n\nBut this would overwrite the original values in those positions. \n\nIn example 1's third row, the cell (2,2) is set to 8, and (2,5) is set to 3. \n\nIn the input, the third row has 3 at (2,2), which is overwritten to 8. \n\nIn the input, the third row has 6 at (2,5), which is overwritten to 3. \n\nThis would explain the example 1's output. \n\nFor the fourth row (i=3), the cell (3,3) is set to 8, and (3,5) is set to 3 (since 3+5=8). But in the input, the fourth row is [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. So the cell (3,3) is 2, which is overwritten to 8. The cell (3,5) is 0, overwritten to 3. \n\nBut in the example 1's output, the fourth row is [0,0,0,2,2,0,0,0,0]. This suggests that the code is not correct. \n\nSo this indicates that the code is not correct. \n\nBut why is the fourth row unchanged in example 1's output? \n\nMaybe the transformation is to set certain positions based on the original values. \n\nFor example, if a cell (i,j) has a value, then in the transformed grid, it is placed in (i, j) if j is even, or some other condition. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with the code that sets the diagonal and anti-diagonal to 8 and 3, even if it doesn't fit all examples. \n\nSo the final code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    for i in range(9):\n        transformed[i][i] = 8\n        transformed[i][7 - i] = 3\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not fit example 1's fourth row. \n\nBut perhaps the examples are not correctly formatted, or there's a different pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to set the diagonal to 8 and the anti-diagonal to 3, but only for certain rows. \n\nBut without more information, it's hard to say. \n\nGiven that the user provided the test input, perhaps I should focus on that. \n\nThe test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 7 0 0 6 0 0\n7 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n8 0 0 3 0 0 0 0\n\nAssuming this is 8 rows of 8 columns, but the function must return a 9x9 grid. This is confusing, but perhaps the test input is a 9x9 grid with the ninth row being all zeros. \n\nIf I apply the code to the test input, the transformed grid would have 8 on the diagonal and 3 on the anti-diagonal. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not fit all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n"
