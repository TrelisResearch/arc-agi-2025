          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid seems to be influenced by the positions of the 5s in the input grid.\n2. In Example 1, the 5s are in the third column of the input grid, and the output grid has 1s in the third column for most rows, except the last two rows which have 2s.\n3. In Example 2, the 5s are in the fifth column of the input grid, and the output grid has 1s in the fifth column for most rows, except the last two rows which have 2s.\n4. The transformation seems to be: for each row, if there is a 5 in a certain column (position), then in the output grid, that column gets a 1 for most rows, but the last two rows get a 2.\n\nBased on this pattern, I hypothesize that the transformation is:\n- For each row, if there is a 5 in column 2 (third column), then in the output grid, that column gets a 1 for most rows, but the last two rows get a 2.\n- For each row, if there is a 5 in column 4 (fifth column), then in the output grid, that column gets a 1 for most rows, but the last two rows get a 2.\n\nI'll implement this pattern in the transformation function.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for col in range(9):\n            if col == 2:  # Third column\n                # Check if there's a 5 in this column for the current row\n                if row[col] == 5:\n                    # For most rows, set to 1, but last two rows set to 2\n                    if len(transformed) < 7:\n                        new_row.append(1)\n                    else:\n                        new_row.append(2)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n            elif col == 4:  # Fifth column\n                # Check if there's a 5 in this column for the current row\n                if row[col] == 5:\n                    # For most rows, set to 1, but last two rows set to 2\n                    if len(transformed) < 7:\n                        new_row.append(1)\n                    else:\n                        new_row.append(2)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(0)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n```",

In Example 1, the 5s are in the third column of the input grid, and the output grid has 1s in the third column for most rows, except the last two rows which have 2s.\n3. In Example 2, the 5s are in the fifth column of the input grid, and the output grid has 1s in the fifth column for most rows, except the last two rows which have 2s.\n4. The transformation seems to be: for each row, if there is a 5 in a certain column (position), then in the output grid, that column gets a 1 for most rows, but the last two rows get a 2.\n\nBased on this pattern, I hypothesize that the transformation is:\n- For each row, if there is a 5 in column 2 (third column), then in the output grid, that column gets a 1 for most rows, but the last two rows get a 2.\n- For each row, if there is a 5 in column 4 (fifth column), then in the output grid, that column gets a 1 for most rows, but the last two rows get a 2.\n\nI'll implement this pattern in the transformation function.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for col in range(9):\n            if col == 2:  # Third column\n                # Check if there's a 5 in this column for the current row\n                if row[col] == 5:\n                    # For most rows, set to 1, but last two rows set to 2\n                    if len(transformed) < 7:\n                        new_row.append(1)\n                    else:\n                        new_row.append(2)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n            elif col == 4:  # Fifth column\n                # Check if there's a 5 in this column for the current row\n                if row[col] == 5:\n                    # For most rows, set to 1, but last two rows set to 2\n                    if len(transformed) < 7:\n                        new_row.append(1)\n                    else:\n                        new_row.append(2)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(0)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n```",
