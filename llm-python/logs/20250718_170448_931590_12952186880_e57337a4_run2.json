          "content": "Looking at the training examples, I observe the following pattern:\n\n1. In each example, there is a single \"0\" in the input grid.\n2. The output grid is a 3x3 grid where the \"0\" from the input is placed in a specific position.\n3. The position of the \"0\" in the output grid seems to be determined by the position of the \"0\" in the input grid.\n\nFrom the examples:\n- In Example 1, the \"0\" is at position (12, 13) in the input grid (0-based), and it appears at position (0, 2) in the output grid.\n- In Example 2, the \"0\" is at position (2, 7) in the input grid, and it appears at position (1, 0) in the output grid.\n- In Example 3, the \"0\" is at position (10, 2) in the input grid, and it appears at position (0, 0) in the output grid.\n\nI notice that the \"0\" in the output grid is always at the top-left corner of the 3x3 grid, but this doesn't consistently match the position of the \"0\" in the input grid. However, there seems to be a pattern where the \"0\" in the output grid is placed at the top-left corner of the 3x3 grid, and the rest of the cells are filled with \"9\".\n\nBased on this observation, I will implement a transformation that:\n1. Finds the position of the \"0\" in the input grid.\n2. Places a \"0\" at the top-left corner of the 3x3 output grid.\n3. Fills the rest of the output grid with \"9\".\n\nHere is the Python function that implements this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find the position of the '0' in the input grid\n    zero_pos = None\n    for i in range(15):\n        for j in range(15):\n            if grid[i][j] == 0:\n                zero_pos = (i, j)\n                break\n        if zero_pos:\n            break\n    \n    # Create a 3x3 output grid filled with 9s\n    transformed_grid = [[9 for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    # Place the '0' at the top-left corner of the output grid\n    if zero_pos:\n        transformed_grid[0][0] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
