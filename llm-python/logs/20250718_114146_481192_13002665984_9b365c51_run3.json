The output grid appears to be derived from the input grid by:\n   - Replacing certain values with others (e.g., 4 \u2192 0, 3 \u2192 0, 2 \u2192 0, 8 \u2192 2, 7 \u2192 3, etc.)\n   - Creating new patterns based on the positions of certain values\n   - Filling in new values based on the surrounding values\n\n2. There seems to be a pattern where:\n   - The value 4 in the input grid is replaced with 0 in the output grid\n   - The value 3 in the input grid is replaced with 0 in the output grid\n   - The value 2 in the input grid is replaced with 0 in the output grid\n   - The value 8 in the input grid is replaced with 2 in the output grid\n   - The value 7 in the input grid is replaced with 3 in the output grid\n   - The value 6 in the input grid is replaced with 0 in the output grid\n   - The value 1 in the input grid is replaced with 0 in the output grid\n   - The value 0 in the input grid is replaced with 0 in the output grid\n\n3. There seems to be a pattern where:\n   - Values that are in certain positions (like the first column) are replaced with 0\n   - Values that are in certain positions (like the last column) are replaced with 0\n   - Values that are in certain positions (like the middle columns) are replaced with other values\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with others and fills in new values based on the surrounding values.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a new 8x20 grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(20)] for _ in range(8)]\n    \n    # Replace values based on observed patterns\n    for row in range(8):\n        for col in range(20):\n            if grid[row][col] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row][col] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row][col] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row][col] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n            elif grid[row][col] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 3\n            elif grid[row][col] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row][col] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            elif grid[row][col] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n    \n    # Additional pattern: fill in values based on surrounding values\n    for row in range(8):\n        for col in range(20):\n            if transformed_grid[row][col] == 0:\n                # Check if the value is in the first column\n                if col == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # Check if the value is in the last column\n                elif col == 19:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                # Check if the value is in the middle columns\n                else:\n                    # Check the value to the left\n                    if transformed_grid[row][col-1] == 4:\n                        transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                    # Check the value to the right\n                    elif transformed_grid[row][col+1] == 4:\n                        transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                    # Check the value above\n                    elif row > 0 and transformed_grid[row-1][col] == 4:\n                        transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                    # Check the value below\n                    elif row < 7 and transformed_grid[row+1][col] == 4:\n                        transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
