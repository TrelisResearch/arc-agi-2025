The patterns seem to involve:\n\n1. 8s spreading from certain positions in a specific pattern\n2. 8s forming diagonal or cross-like shapes\n3. 8s being transformed in a way that seems to involve symmetry and propagation\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads 8s from certain positions in a specific pattern.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 22x22 grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(22)] for _ in range(22)]\n    \n    # Get the input grid dimensions\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Spread 8s from the positions where the input grid has 8s\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Spread 8s in a specific pattern\n                for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                        if 0 <= ni < 22 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 22x22 grid filled with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(22)] for _ in range(22)]\n    \n    # Get the input grid dimensions\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0]) if rows > 0 else 0\n    \n    # Spread 8s from the positions where the input grid has 8s\n    for i in range(rows):\n        for j in range(cols):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Spread 8s in a specific pattern\n                for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                        if 0 <= ni < 22 and 0 <= nj < 22:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
