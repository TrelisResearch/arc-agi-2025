There are patterns where certain values (like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8) are being replaced or modified in specific regions.\n3. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"spreading\" or \"filling\" of values from the edges inward, with some values being replaced or modified based on their position.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Preserves the outermost row and column\n- Fills in the inner grid based on some pattern that seems to propagate values from the edges inward\n- Replaces certain values based on their position and value\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Get the size of the grid\n    size = len(grid)\n    \n    # Propagate values from the edges inward\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size):\n            # If we're on the edge, keep the value\n            if i == 0 or i == size -

The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with new values based on their position and value.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain values (like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) are replaced with other values in a structured way.\n3. The transformation seems to involve some form of spatial pattern recognition and replacement based on the position of the value in the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with others based on their position and value.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # You can modify this to better match the training examples\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            if value == 1:\n                # Replace 1 with 2 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif value == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif value == 3:\n                # Replace 3 with 4 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif value == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 5 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif value == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with 6 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif value == 6:\n                # Replace 6 with 7 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif value == 7:\n                # Replace 7 with 8 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif value == 8:\n                # Replace 8 with 9 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            elif value == 9:\n                # Replace 9 with 1 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # You can modify this to better match the training examples\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            value = grid[i][j]\n            if value == 1:\n                # Replace 1 with 2 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif value == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif value == 3:\n                # Replace 3 with 4 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 4\n            elif value == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 5 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif value == 5:\n                # Replace 5 with 6 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif value == 6:\n                # Replace 6 with 7 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif value == 7:\n                # Replace 7 with 8 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif value == 8:\n                # Replace 8 with 9 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 1 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            elif value == 9:\n                # Replace 9 with 1 in certain positions\n                if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
