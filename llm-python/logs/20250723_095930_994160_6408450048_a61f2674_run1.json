          "content": "Looking at the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. In Example 1, the output has 1s in the third column (index 2) for the first 6 rows, and 2s in the third column for the last 3 rows.\n2. In Example 2, the output has 1s in the fifth column (index 4) for the first 7 rows, and 2s in the fifth column for the last 2 rows.\n3. The transformation seems to be based on the position of the value 5 in the input grid. Specifically, it looks like the value 5 is used to determine where to place the numbers 1 and 2 in the output grid.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Finding the positions of 5s in the input grid\n- Placing 1s in the output grid at positions that are in the same column as the 5s, but in the first 6 rows\n- Placing 2s in the output grid at positions that are in the same column as the 5s, but in the last 3 rows\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Find positions of 5s in the input grid\n    five_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(9) for j in range(9) if grid[i][j] == 5]\n    \n    # Place 1s in the output grid at positions that are in the same column as the 5s, but in the first 6 rows\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        if i < 6:\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    # Place 2s in the output grid at positions that are in the same column as the 5s, but in the last 3 rows\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        if i >= 6:\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Find positions of 5s in the input grid\n    five_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(9) for j in range(9) if grid[i][j] == 5]\n    \n    # Place 1s in the output grid at positions that are in the same column as the 5s, but in the first 6 rows\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        if i < 6:\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    # Place 2s in the output grid at positions that are in the same column as the 5s, but in the last 3 rows\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        if i >= 6:\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 2, the output has 1s in the fifth column (index 4) for the first 7 rows, and 2s in the fifth column for the last 2 rows.\n3. The transformation seems to be based on the position of the value 5 in the input grid. Specifically, it looks like the value 5 is used to determine where to place the numbers 1 and 2 in the output grid.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Finding the positions of 5s in the input grid\n- Placing 1s in the output grid at positions that are in the same column as the 5s, but in the first 6 rows\n- Placing 2s in the output grid at positions that are in the same column as the 5s, but in the last 3 rows\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Find positions of 5s in the input grid\n    five_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(9) for j in range(9) if grid[i][j] == 5]\n    \n    # Place 1s in the output grid at positions that are in the same column as the 5s, but in the first 6 rows\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        if i < 6:\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    # Place 2s in the output grid at positions that are in the same column as the 5s, but in the last 3 rows\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        if i >= 6:\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(9)] for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Find positions of 5s in the input grid\n    five_positions = [(i, j) for i in range(9) for j in range(9) if grid[i][j] == 5]\n    \n    # Place 1s in the output grid at positions that are in the same column as the 5s, but in the first 6 rows\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        if i < 6:\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    # Place 2s in the output grid at positions that are in the same column as the 5s, but in the last 3 rows\n    for i, j in five_positions:\n        if i >= 6:\n            transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
