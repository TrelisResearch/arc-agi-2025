          "Let's break down the transformation as observed:\n\n**Observations from the training examples:**\n- There are black (0), red (2), yellow (4), and gray (5) cells.\n- Only black, yellow, and gray occur in the input. Red only appears in the output.\n- The yellow cell (4) in the input is always at the center of a red (2) region in the output.\n- The red area forms a block around the yellow cell:\n  - In Example 1: For each yellow cell, the block is a 3x3 square centered on the yellow cell (red=2 on all positions except the yellow cell itself).\n  - In Example 2, 3, 4: The red block is larger \u2014 5x5 or 7x7, centered on the yellow cell.\n  - Examining more, the red \"block\" agglomerates to the largest possible square (bounded by the input grid size) and fills that area centered on the yellow cell.\n    - In the smallest (8x8) grid, Example 3, the block is 3x3 around the yellow.\n    - In larger grids, it's always as big as possible without going outside the grid.\n\nOn even closer look:\n- The yellow (4) cell is left untouched and stays yellow in the output at its position.\n- Red (2) fills as a square centered on the yellow (excluding the yellow cell itself), to the maximum possible size such that the block stays within the grid.\n- Gray (5) cells in the input are copied in place to the output.\n\n**So, the rule is**:  \nFor each yellow (4) cell:  \n- Center a red (2) block at the same location, filling out as far as possible on all sides until you hit the edge of the grid.\n- The block should be the largest possible square centered at the yellow cell but within the grid.\n- All non-yellow, non-gray cells (i.e., black 0's) within this block become red (2), except the yellow (4) itself stays yellow.\n\nGray (5) cells are copied as-is (remain gray).  \nAll other positions remain unchanged unless changed to red by a yellow cell's block.\n\n**Implementation plan:**  \n1. Make a deep copy of the input grid.\n2. Find all yellow (4) cell positions.\n3. For each yellow cell:\n   - Determine its maximum centered square size (without going out of grid bounds).\n   - Fill red (2) in all those positions (except for gray (5) and the yellow (4) cell).\n4. Ensure gray cells (5) are always left unchanged.\n\n**But the training grids are smaller than the required output (12x10)**  \n**We must always produce a 12x10 output**.\n\n- If the input is smaller, output is padded with zeros.\n- If input is larger, output is cropped to 12x10.\n- However, in the test input, the input grid is already 30x20. So we should \"center crop\" or take the top-left 12x10 as output? That needs to be determined.\n- Looking at outputs, the pattern is to fit the original grid into the 12x10 output, copying content directly for the overlapping region. The processing should happen on this 12x10 part.\n\n**Our approach**:  \n- If input < 12x10, output is zero-padded to 12x10.\n- If input > 12x10, output is the top-left 12x10 region after processing.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Always produce a 12x10 grid (rows x cols)\n    out_rows, out_cols = 12, 10\n    in_rows, in_cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    # Convert to numpy for easier slicing\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    # The output - start as 0s\n    out = np.zeros((out_rows, out_cols), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Determine the region to process: what part of input corresponds to output\n    # If input is bigger, use the top-left 12x10\n    process_rows = min(in_rows, out_rows)\n    process_cols = min(in_cols, out_cols)\n    \n    # Copy corresponding input region to output\n    out[:process_rows,:process_cols] = arr[:process_rows,:process_cols]\n    \n    # Now process only in the overlapping region\n    for r in range(process_rows):\n        for c in range(process_cols):\n            if arr[r, c] == 4:  # Yellow (center of red block)\n                # Find max square radius without going out of bounds\n                max_up = r\n                max_down = process_rows - r - 1\n                max_left = c\n                max_right = process_cols - c - 1\n                # The maximal radius is min of those\n                radius = min(max_up, max_down, max_left, max_right)\n                # We want the largest possible square (radius from 1 up to max)\n                # For the samples, seems always using the maximal possible\n                # The block is (r-radius to r+radius), both inclusive\n                for dr in range(-radius, radius+1):\n                    for dc in range(-radius, radius+1):\n                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                        # Stay in bounds, do not overwrite gray (5) or yellow (4)\n                        if 0 <= nr < process_rows and 0 <= nc < process_cols:\n                            if arr[nr, nc] != 4 and arr[nr, nc] != 5:\n                                out[nr, nc] = 2\n                # Center (r,c) stays 4\n                out[r, c] = 4\n    \n    # Ensure all gray (5) in the source stay as 5 in output, in the overlap region\n    for r in range(process_rows):\n        for c in range(process_cols):\n            if arr[r, c] == 5:\n                out[r, c] = 5\n    \n    # Return as a nested list\n    return out.tolist()\n```\n"

            "text": "You are solving an ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) task. \nI will show you training examples with input and output grids, plus a test input grid. Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 12\u00d710 output grid.**\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 4 2 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0 5 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0\n5 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 2 2 4 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0\n0 5 0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5\n\nExample 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 5 2 2 4 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 3:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 4 2 0 0 0\n0 0 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nExample 4:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\nOutput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 4 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nAnalyze the patterns in the training examples and write a Python function that performs this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

          "Let's break down the transformation as observed:\n\n**Observations from the training examples:**\n- There are black (0), red (2), yellow (4), and gray (5) cells.\n- Only black, yellow, and gray occur in the input. Red only appears in the output.\n- The yellow cell (4) in the input is always at the center of a red (2) region in the output.\n- The red area forms a block around the yellow cell:\n  - In Example 1: For each yellow cell, the block is a 3x3 square centered on the yellow cell (red=2 on all positions except the yellow cell itself).\n  - In Example 2, 3, 4: The red block is larger \u2014 5x5 or 7x7, centered on the yellow cell.\n  - Examining more, the red \"block\" agglomerates to the largest possible square (bounded by the input grid size) and fills that area centered on the yellow cell.\n    - In the smallest (8x8) grid, Example 3, the block is 3x3 around the yellow.\n    - In larger grids, it's always as big as possible without going outside the grid.\n\nOn even closer look:\n- The yellow (4) cell is left untouched and stays yellow in the output at its position.\n- Red (2) fills as a square centered on the yellow (excluding the yellow cell itself), to the maximum possible size such that the block stays within the grid.\n- Gray (5) cells in the input are copied in place to the output.\n\n**So, the rule is**:  \nFor each yellow (4) cell:  \n- Center a red (2) block at the same location, filling out as far as possible on all sides until you hit the edge of the grid.\n- The block should be the largest possible square centered at the yellow cell but within the grid.\n- All non-yellow, non-gray cells (i.e., black 0's) within this block become red (2), except the yellow (4) itself stays yellow.\n\nGray (5) cells are copied as-is (remain gray).  \nAll other positions remain unchanged unless changed to red by a yellow cell's block.\n\n**Implementation plan:**  \n1. Make a deep copy of the input grid.\n2. Find all yellow (4) cell positions.\n3. For each yellow cell:\n   - Determine its maximum centered square size (without going out of grid bounds).\n   - Fill red (2) in all those positions (except for gray (5) and the yellow (4) cell).\n4. Ensure gray cells (5) are always left unchanged.\n\n**But the training grids are smaller than the required output (12x10)**  \n**We must always produce a 12x10 output**.\n\n- If the input is smaller, output is padded with zeros.\n- If input is larger, output is cropped to 12x10.\n- However, in the test input, the input grid is already 30x20. So we should \"center crop\" or take the top-left 12x10 as output? That needs to be determined.\n- Looking at outputs, the pattern is to fit the original grid into the 12x10 output, copying content directly for the overlapping region. The processing should happen on this 12x10 part.\n\n**Our approach**:  \n- If input < 12x10, output is zero-padded to 12x10.\n- If input > 12x10, output is the top-left 12x10 region after processing.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Always produce a 12x10 grid (rows x cols)\n    out_rows, out_cols = 12, 10\n    in_rows, in_cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    # Convert to numpy for easier slicing\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    # The output - start as 0s\n    out = np.zeros((out_rows, out_cols), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Determine the region to process: what part of input corresponds to output\n    # If input is bigger, use the top-left 12x10\n    process_rows = min(in_rows, out_rows)\n    process_cols = min(in_cols, out_cols)\n    \n    # Copy corresponding input region to output\n    out[:process_rows,:process_cols] = arr[:process_rows,:process_cols]\n    \n    # Now process only in the overlapping region\n    for r in range(process_rows):\n        for c in range(process_cols):\n            if arr[r, c] == 4:  # Yellow (center of red block)\n                # Find max square radius without going out of bounds\n                max_up = r\n                max_down = process_rows - r - 1\n                max_left = c\n                max_right = process_cols - c - 1\n                # The maximal radius is min of those\n                radius = min(max_up, max_down, max_left, max_right)\n                # We want the largest possible square (radius from 1 up to max)\n                # For the samples, seems always using the maximal possible\n                # The block is (r-radius to r+radius), both inclusive\n                for dr in range(-radius, radius+1):\n                    for dc in range(-radius, radius+1):\n                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                        # Stay in bounds, do not overwrite gray (5) or yellow (4)\n                        if 0 <= nr < process_rows and 0 <= nc < process_cols:\n                            if arr[nr, nc] != 4 and arr[nr, nc] != 5:\n                                out[nr, nc] = 2\n                # Center (r,c) stays 4\n                out[r, c] = 4\n    \n    # Ensure all gray (5) in the source stay as 5 in output, in the overlap region\n    for r in range(process_rows):\n        for c in range(process_cols):\n            if arr[r, c] == 5:\n                out[r, c] = 5\n    \n    # Return as a nested list\n    return out.tolist()\n```\n"

Red only appears in the output.\n- The yellow cell (4) in the input is always at the center of a red (2) region in the output.\n- The red area forms a block around the yellow cell:\n  - In Example 1: For each yellow cell, the block is a 3x3 square centered on the yellow cell (red=2 on all positions except the yellow cell itself).\n  - In Example 2, 3, 4: The red block is larger \u2014 5x5 or 7x7, centered on the yellow cell.\n  - Examining more, the red \"block\" agglomerates to the largest possible square (bounded by the input grid size) and fills that area centered on the yellow cell.\n    - In the smallest (8x8) grid, Example 3, the block is 3x3 around the yellow.\n    - In larger grids, it's always as big as possible without going outside the grid.\n\nOn even closer look:\n- The yellow (4) cell is left untouched and stays yellow in the output at its position.\n- Red (2) fills as a square centered on the yellow (excluding the yellow cell itself), to the maximum possible size such that the block stays within the grid.\n- Gray (5) cells in the input are copied in place to the output.\n\n**So, the rule is**:  \nFor each yellow (4) cell:  \n- Center a red (2) block at the same location, filling out as far as possible on all sides until you hit the edge of the grid.\n- The block should be the largest possible square centered at the yellow cell but within the grid.\n- All non-yellow, non-gray cells (i.e., black 0's) within this block become red (2), except the yellow (4) itself stays yellow.\n\nGray (5) cells are copied as-is (remain gray).  \nAll other positions remain unchanged unless changed to red by a yellow cell's block.\n\n**Implementation plan:**  \n1. Make a deep copy of the input grid.\n2. Find all yellow (4) cell positions.\n3. For each yellow cell:\n   - Determine its maximum centered square size (without going out of grid bounds).\n   - Fill red (2) in all those positions (except for gray (5) and the yellow (4) cell).\n4. Ensure gray cells (5) are always left unchanged.\n\n**But the training grids are smaller than the required output (12x10)**  \n**We must always produce a 12x10 output**.\n\n- If the input is smaller, output is padded with zeros.\n- If input is larger, output is cropped to 12x10.\n- However, in the test input, the input grid is already 30x20. So we should \"center crop\" or take the top-left 12x10 as output? That needs to be determined.\n- Looking at outputs, the pattern is to fit the original grid into the 12x10 output, copying content directly for the overlapping region. The processing should happen on this 12x10 part.\n\n**Our approach**:  \n- If input < 12x10, output is zero-padded to 12x10.\n- If input > 12x10, output is the top-left 12x10 region after processing.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Always produce a 12x10 grid (rows x cols)\n    out_rows, out_cols = 12, 10\n    in_rows, in_cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    # Convert to numpy for easier slicing\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    # The output - start as 0s\n    out = np.zeros((out_rows, out_cols), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Determine the region to process: what part of input corresponds to output\n    # If input is bigger, use the top-left 12x10\n    process_rows = min(in_rows, out_rows)\n    process_cols = min(in_cols, out_cols)\n    \n    # Copy corresponding input region to output\n    out[:process_rows,:process_cols] = arr[:process_rows,:process_cols]\n    \n    # Now process only in the overlapping region\n    for r in range(process_rows):\n        for c in range(process_cols):\n            if arr[r, c] == 4:  # Yellow (center of red block)\n                # Find max square radius without going out of bounds\n                max_up = r\n                max_down = process_rows - r - 1\n                max_left = c\n                max_right = process_cols - c - 1\n                # The maximal radius is min of those\n                radius = min(max_up, max_down, max_left, max_right)\n                # We want the largest possible square (radius from 1 up to max)\n                # For the samples, seems always using the maximal possible\n                # The block is (r-radius to r+radius), both inclusive\n                for dr in range(-radius, radius+1):\n                    for dc in range(-radius, radius+1):\n                        nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc\n                        # Stay in bounds, do not overwrite gray (5) or yellow (4)\n                        if 0 <= nr < process_rows and 0 <= nc < process_cols:\n                            if arr[nr, nc] != 4 and arr[nr, nc] != 5:\n                                out[nr, nc] = 2\n                # Center (r,c) stays 4\n                out[r, c] = 4\n    \n    # Ensure all gray (5) in the source stay as 5 in output, in the overlap region\n    for r in range(process_rows):\n        for c in range(process_cols):\n            if arr[r, c] == 5:\n                out[r, c] = 5\n    \n    # Return as a nested list\n    return out.tolist()\n```\n"
