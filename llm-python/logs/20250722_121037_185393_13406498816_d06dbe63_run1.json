          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output grid always has a 13x13 size\n2. The transformation seems to involve creating a \"spiral\" or \"wave\" pattern of 5s and 8s\n3. The 8 in the input appears to be transformed into a 5 in the output\n4. The 5s seem to spread out from the 8 in a spiral pattern\n5. The 5s form a wave-like pattern that expands outward from the 8\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Creates a spiral pattern of 5s starting from the position of the 8\n- The 8 is replaced with a 5\n- The 5s spread out in a spiral pattern\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Find the position of the 8\n    pos = np.where(grid_np == 8)\n    if pos[0].size == 0:\n        return grid  # No 8 found, return original grid\n    \n    # Extract coordinates\n    x, y = pos[0][0], pos[1][0]\n    \n    # Create a 13x13 output grid filled with 0s\n    output = np.zeros((13, 13), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a spiral pattern of 5s starting from the position of the 8\n    # This is a simplified spiral pattern that expands outward\n    for i in range(1, 13):\n        # Top row\n        for j in range(y - i, y + i + 1):\n            if 0 <= j < 13:\n                output[0][j] = 5\n        # Right column\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            if 0 <= x + j < 13:\n                output[j][12] = 5\n        # Bottom row\n        for j in range(12 - i, 12 + 1):\n            if 0 <= j < 13:\n                output[12][j] = 5\n        # Left column\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            if 0 <= x - j < 13:\n                output[12 - j][0] = 5\n    \n    # Replace the 8 with a 5\n    output[x][y] = 5\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return output.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    pos = np.where(grid_np == 8)\n    if pos[0].size == 0:\n        return grid\n    \n    x, y = pos[0][0], pos[1][0]\n    \n    output = np.zeros((13, 13), dtype=int)\n    \n    for i in range(1, 13):\n        for j in range(y - i, y + i + 1):\n            if 0 <= j < 13:\n                output[0][j] = 5\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            if 0 <= x + j < 13:\n                output[j][12] = 5\n        for j in range(12 - i, 12 + 1):\n            if 0 <= j < 13:\n                output[12][j] = 5\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            if 0 <= x - j < 13:\n                output[12 - j][0] = 5\n    \n    output[x][y] = 5\n    \n    return output.tolist()\n```",

The 8 in the input appears to be transformed into a 5 in the output\n4. The 5s seem to spread out from the 8 in a spiral pattern\n5. The 5s form a wave-like pattern that expands outward from the 8\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Creates a spiral pattern of 5s starting from the position of the 8\n- The 8 is replaced with a 5\n- The 5s spread out in a spiral pattern\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Find the position of the 8\n    pos = np.where(grid_np == 8)\n    if pos[0].size == 0:\n        return grid  # No 8 found, return original grid\n    \n    # Extract coordinates\n    x, y = pos[0][0], pos[1][0]\n    \n    # Create a 13x13 output grid filled with 0s\n    output = np.zeros((13, 13), dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a spiral pattern of 5s starting from the position of the 8\n    # This is a simplified spiral pattern that expands outward\n    for i in range(1, 13):\n        # Top row\n        for j in range(y - i, y + i + 1):\n            if 0 <= j < 13:\n                output[0][j] = 5\n        # Right column\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            if 0 <= x + j < 13:\n                output[j][12] = 5\n        # Bottom row\n        for j in range(12 - i, 12 + 1):\n            if 0 <= j < 13:\n                output[12][j] = 5\n        # Left column\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            if 0 <= x - j < 13:\n                output[12 - j][0] = 5\n    \n    # Replace the 8 with a 5\n    output[x][y] = 5\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return output.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    pos = np.where(grid_np == 8)\n    if pos[0].size == 0:\n        return grid\n    \n    x, y = pos[0][0], pos[1][0]\n    \n    output = np.zeros((13, 13), dtype=int)\n    \n    for i in range(1, 13):\n        for j in range(y - i, y + i + 1):\n            if 0 <= j < 13:\n                output[0][j] = 5\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            if 0 <= x + j < 13:\n                output[j][12] = 5\n        for j in range(12 - i, 12 + 1):\n            if 0 <= j < 13:\n                output[12][j] = 5\n        for j in range(1, i + 1):\n            if 0 <= x - j < 13:\n                output[12 - j][0] = 5\n    \n    output[x][y] = 5\n    \n    return output.tolist()\n```",
