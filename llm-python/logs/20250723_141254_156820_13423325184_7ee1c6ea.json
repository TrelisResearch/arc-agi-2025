This suggests that the transformation might be an identity transformation or no transformation at all.\n\n### Example 2:\n- The input and output grids are also identical. This reinforces the idea that the transformation is likely an identity transformation.\n\n### Example 3:\n- The input and output grids are identical. This further confirms that the transformation is an identity transformation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the analysis, it appears that the transformation is simply copying the input grid to the output grid without any modifications.\n\nGiven this conclusion, here is the Python function that implements this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Since the transformation is an identity transformation, we simply return the input grid\n    return grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Since the transformation is an identity transformation, we simply return the input grid\n    return grid\n```",

For example, 5 is swapped with 1, and 7 is swapped with 0.\n\nThis approach should capture some of the observed patterns in the training examples.

We'll focus on creating a symmetric transformation and replacing numbers in a way that maintains the overall structure.\n\nHere's a possible transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    # Convert the grid to a numpy array for easier manipulation\n    grid_np = np.array(grid)\n    \n    # Create a symmetric transformation\n    # Reflect the grid along the vertical axis\n    grid_np_reflected = np.fliplr(grid_np)\n    \n    # Replace numbers in a way that maintains the overall structure\n    # For example, replace 4 with 4, 9 with 9, and 5 with 5\n    grid_np_transformed = np.where(grid_np == 4, 4, \n                                   np.where(grid_np == 9, 9, \n                                            np.where(grid_np == 5, 5, grid_np_reflected)))\n    \n    # Convert the transformed numpy array back to a list\n    transformed_grid = grid_np_transformed.tolist()\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis transformation reflects the grid along the vertical axis and replaces numbers in a way that maintains the overall structure.
