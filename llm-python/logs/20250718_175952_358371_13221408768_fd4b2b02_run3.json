          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. **6s and 3s appear in specific patterns** - in Example 1, 6s appear in the middle of the grid, while 3s appear in a horizontal strip near the bottom. In Example 3, 3s appear in the middle of the grid and 6s appear in a vertical strip on the right.\n\n2. **Transformation seems to involve replacing certain patterns with others** - in Example 1, the 6s in the middle of the grid are replaced with 3s in a horizontal strip near the bottom. In Example 3, the 3s in the middle are replaced with 6s in a vertical strip on the right.\n\n3. **The transformation appears to be symmetrical** - in Example 1, the 6s in the middle are mirrored in the bottom. In Example 3, the 3s in the middle are mirrored in the right.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing 6s in the middle of the grid with 3s in a horizontal strip near the bottom\n- Replacing 3s in the middle of the grid with 6s in a vertical strip on the right\n- Keeping other 0s as is\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the size of the grid\n    size = 23\n    \n    # Replace 6s in the middle with 3s in a horizontal strip near the bottom\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size):\n            if grid[i][j] == 6 and (i >= size//2 - 2 and i <= size//2 + 2) and (j >= size//2 - 2 and j <= size//2 + 2):\n                transformed[i][j] = 3\n    \n    # Replace 3s in the middle with 6s in a vertical strip on the right\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3 and (i >= size//2 - 2 and i <= size//2 + 2) and (j >= size//2 - 2 and j <= size//2 + 2):\n                transformed[i][j] = 6\n    \n    return transformed\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the size of the grid\n    size = 23\n    \n    # Replace 6s in the middle with 3s in a horizontal strip near the bottom\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size):\n            if grid[i][j] == 6 and (i >= size//2 - 2 and i <= size//2 + 2) and (j >= size//2 - 2 and j <= size//2 + 2):\n                transformed[i][j] = 3\n    \n    # Replace 3s in the middle with 6s in a vertical strip on the right\n    for i in range(size):\n        for j in range(size):\n            if grid[i][j] == 3 and (i >= size//2 - 2 and i <= size//2 + 2) and (j >= size//2 - 2 and j <= size//2 + 2):\n                transformed[i][j] = 6\n    \n    return transformed\n```",
