The pattern seems to be a grid with alternating rows of numbers and zeros.\n2. **Transformation**: The output grids appear to be a transformation of the input grids. Specifically, the pattern in the input grids is shifted or modified in the output grids.\n\nGiven the examples, let's observe the transformation:\n\n- **Example 1**: The input grid has a repeating pattern of `6 0 0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 0 0 6 0` repeated multiple times. The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid, where the pattern is shifted or altered.\n- **Example 2**: The input grid has a repeating pattern of `7 7 0 7 0 0 7 7 0 7 0 0 7 7` repeated multiple times. The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid, where the pattern is shifted or altered.\n- **Example 3**: The input grid has a repeating pattern of `1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1` repeated multiple times. The output grid appears to be a modified version of the input grid, where the pattern is shifted or altered.\n- **Example 4**: The input grid has a repeating pattern of `1 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0` repeated multiple times.
