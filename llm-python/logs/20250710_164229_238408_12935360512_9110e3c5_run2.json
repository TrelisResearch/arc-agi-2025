          "Let's analyze the given training examples:\n\n1. The output is always a 3x3 grid.\n2. The output values are mostly 0 and 8, sometimes arranged in cross or horizontal line shapes of 8s.\n3. From example 2,6,7 the output is a horizontal line of 8s in the middle row.\n4. From example 3,4,5 the output is a vertical line or cross shape of 8s.\n5. Example 1 and 4 outputs are cross shapes.\n6. There seems to be two distinct patterns for output:\n   - Horizontal line of 8s in center row (patterns like 2,6,7)\n   - Vertical or cross pattern of 8s (patterns like 1,3,4,5)\n\nBy looking carefully at the inputs:\n- When the number 8 appears more in the input grid near the center, the output tends toward a cross pattern (many 8's in cross shape).\n- When 8s are few or spread more horizontally, the output is a horizontal line of 8s.\n\nAlso, the position of the most frequent nonzero number and distribution seem to hint which pattern to select.\n\nGeneral approach:\n- Identify the dominant color in the input grid that is neither 0 nor 8. Sometimes 8 is secondary.\n- Count how many 8s are inside the input to guide if the horizontal or cross pattern is used.\n- Return a 3x3 grid with either:\n   - horizontal 8s on the middle row if many 8s are present or dominant color is low\n   - cross pattern of 8s if 8s are few or dominant color is higher\n\nBecause we don't have a fully certain logic, I'll combine these ideas:\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n- Count how many 8s are in the input\n- If count_8 >= 3: output horizontal 8 line in center row\n- Else output cross shape\n\nCross shape: middle row and middle column are 8 except middle cell can be 0 (or just 8s forming a cross)\nFrom the examples, cross shape places 8s with zeros top-left and bottom-right corners.\n\nFinally, the \"cross\" pattern from the examples is:\n\n```\n0 0 8\n8 8 0\n0 8 0\n```\nor similar variations with 8s at cross like positions.\n\nFor simplicity:\n- Horizontal line (middle row is 8s, else 0s)\n- Else cross pattern: 8 in middle row, middle column and bottom-mid.\n\nImplementing the output based on the threshold of 8s count.\n\nThis is a heuristic based on given samples.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Count how many 8s are in the input\n    count_8 = sum(row.count(8) for row in grid)\n    \n    # Initialize a 3x3 grid of zeros\n    out = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    \n    if count_8 >= 3:\n        # Horizontal line of 8s in the middle row\n        out[1] = [8,8,8]\n    else:\n        # Cross pattern of 8s like in examples 1,3,4,5\n        # Construct approx cross pattern:\n        # 0 0 8\n        # 8 8 0\n        # 0 8 0\n        \n        out[0][2] = 8\n        out[1][0] = 8\n        out[1][1] = 8\n        out[2][1] = 8\n        \n    return out\n```"
