          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from input to output. Let's take a look at Example 1 first.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some 5s and 0s. The output has some 5s and 1s. For instance, in the fourth row of the input, there are five 5s in a row. The output for that row has 0s on the ends and 1s in the middle. Wait, the input row is 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0. The output is 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. So the 5s in the middle are turned into 1s. But why? Maybe the 5s are being replaced by 1s in certain positions. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the fourth row's 5s are converted to 1s. But in the fifth row of the input, there's a 5 in the fourth position. The output for that row has a 5 in the fourth position. Hmm, maybe not. Let me check again. The fifth row of the input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. So that row remains the same. So maybe the 5s in certain positions are kept, and others are converted?\n\nWait, looking at the first example's output, the fourth row has 1s in the middle. The input's fourth row has 5s in positions 2-6 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Well, the input is given as 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0. So maybe the 5s are in positions 2-6 (if 0-based, that's columns 2 to 6, but maybe it's 1-based? Well, the input is 10 columns, so the fourth row is 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0. So positions 2-6 (if 0-based) are 5s. But the output for that row is 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. So the middle six positions are converted to 1s. So maybe the 5s in a certain area are being replaced by 1s. But why?\n\nLooking at the third example. Let's check the input and output. The input for example 3 has a row that starts with 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0. So that row remains the same. But another row in example 3's input is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. So the 5 in position 1 (second column) is replaced by 1, and the 5s at the end are kept. Hmm. So maybe the 5s in certain positions are being replaced by 1s, but not all.\n\nAnother thing to look for is the positions of the 5s. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has a block of 5s in the middle. The output converts those to 1s. Similarly, in example 2, the input has a row with 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. So again, the middle 5s are converted to 1s. So maybe the 5s that are in a certain pattern (like a horizontal line) are being replaced by 1s. But how?\n\nLooking at example 2's input, there's a row that's 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So again, the middle 5s are converted to 1s. So maybe the rule is that any 5 that is part of a contiguous block of 5s in a certain position is replaced by 1. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother thing to note: in example 1, the fourth row's 5s are in the middle. The output converts them to 1s. But in example 2, the fourth row's 5s are also in the middle. So maybe the 5s in certain positions (like the middle of the grid) are being replaced by 1s. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in a certain shape (like a horizontal line) are being replaced by 1s. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output converts them to 1s. Similarly, in example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. But in example 3, some rows have 5s that are not in a horizontal line. For example, the input row 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 has a 5 in the second position and two 5s at the end. The output converts the 5 in the second position to 1, but leaves the others. So maybe the 5s that are in a certain position (like in the middle of the grid) are replaced by 1s.\n\nWait, maybe the 5s that are in positions where their row and column indices are even? Or maybe the 5s that are in certain positions relative to the center of the grid. Let me think about the grid's structure. The grid is 10x10. So the center is around positions (4,4) to (5,5) perhaps.\n\nLooking at example 1's fourth row (row index 3, assuming 0-based), the 5s are in columns 2-6. The output for that row has 1s in columns 2-6. So maybe the 5s that are in the middle part of the grid (like columns 2-6 in row 3) are converted to 1s. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (like in positions where their row and column are between 2 and 7) are converted to 1s. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output has 1s. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has 1s in positions 2-6. In example 2, the fourth row has 1s in positions 4-6 (but wait, the input row is 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So the 5s in positions 3-6 (assuming 0-based) are converted to 1s. So maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (like in columns 3-6) are converted to 1s.\n\nBut how to determine the exact positions. Maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (like in the middle 4 columns) are converted to 1s. For example, in a 10x10 grid, the middle columns would be 3-6 (if 0-based, columns 3,4,5,6). But in example 1's fourth row, the 5s are in columns 2-6 (assuming 0-based). Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (like in rows 2-7 and columns 2-7) are converted to 1s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s that are in the middle of a horizontal line are converted to 1s. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output converts those to 1s. In example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. But in example 3, the input has a row with 5s in positions that are not in a horizontal line. For example, in the input of example 3, the second row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output for that row is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. So the 5 in the second position is converted to 1, and the two 5s at the end are kept. So maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the row are converted to 1s, but the ones at the end are not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s that are in positions where their column index is between 2 and 7 (inclusive) are converted to 1s. But how to confirm.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the fourth row is converted to 1s in the middle. But the fifth row of the input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is the same. So that row has 5s in positions 3 and 7. Those positions are not in the middle of the row. So maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the row (like in columns 3-6) are converted to 1s. But in this case, the 5 in column 3 is kept. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in positions where their row and column are both between 2 and 7 are converted to 1s. Let's check example 1's fourth row (row 3, 0-based). The 5s are in columns 2-6. So row 3 is between 2-7? Well, row 3 is in the middle. So maybe that's the case. But then, in example 2's fourth row, which is row 3 (0-based), the 5s are in columns 3-6. So that's also in the middle. So that would fit.\n\nBut then, in example 3's input, the second row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. So the 5 in column 1 (second position) is converted to 1. But column 1 is outside the middle columns (assuming middle is 2-7). So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's think about the output for example 1. The fourth row's 5s are converted to 1s. But in the fifth row of the input, the 5s are in positions 3 and 7. The output for that row is the same. So why is that? Maybe the 5s that are in certain positions (like in the middle of the grid) are converted to 1s, but if they are in certain positions, they are not. Maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (like in the middle 4 columns of the middle 4 rows) are converted to 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are part of a certain shape. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output converts them to 1s. But in example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, which is converted to 1s. In example 3, the second row has a 5 in the middle of the row. But that 5 is converted to 1. So maybe any 5 that is in the middle of the row is converted to 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (like in the middle 4 rows and columns) are converted to 1s. For example, in example 1, the fourth row is in the middle of the grid. The 5s in that row are converted to 1s. But in example 3, the second row (row index 1) has a 5 in the middle of the row, which is converted to 1. So perhaps the 5s in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s.\n\nBut how to test this. Let's look at example 2's input. The second row is 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. So the 5s in columns 4-5 (assuming 0-based) are converted to 1s. Those columns are in the middle of the row. So that fits.\n\nIn example 3's input, the second row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output for that row is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. So the 5 in column 1 (second position) is converted to 1. But column 1 is outside the middle columns (columns 2-7). So that doesn't fit. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s. But in example 3's second row, the 5 is in column 1, which is outside that range. So why is it converted to 1? That suggests that maybe the pattern is more complex.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 3's input. The output for the second row is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. The original input for that row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. So the 5 in column 1 is converted to 1, and the two 5s in columns 8 and 9 are kept. So why is that? Maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the row (columns 4-5?) are converted to 1s, but others are not. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in positions where their row and column are both between 2 and 7 are converted to 1s. Let's check example 3's second row. The 5 in column 1 is in row 1 (0-based), which is outside the 2-7 range. So that doesn't fit. But the 5 in column 8 is in row 1, column 8. That's outside the 2-7 range. So why is that kept?\n\nHmm, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s. But in example 3's second row, the 5 in column 1 is not in that range. So that's not converted. But in the output, it is. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s, but other 5s are not. So in example 3's second row, the 5 in column 1 is not in that range, so it's not converted. But in the output, it is. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's think about the output in example 1. The fourth row (row 3) has 1s in the middle. The fifth row (row 4) has 5s in positions 3 and 7. Those positions are not in the middle of the row. So why are they kept?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s, but if they are in certain positions (like the middle of a group), they are converted. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s, but if they are part of a larger group, they are not. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has a group of 5s that are in the middle. So they are converted to 1s. But in example 3's second row, the 5 is isolated, so it's converted to 1. But the 5s in the end are kept. So maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are converted to 1s, regardless of their position.\n\nBut how to implement that. Maybe the rule is: for each cell, if it's a 5 and it's in the middle 4 rows (rows 2-7) and middle 4 columns (columns 2-7), then it's converted to 1. Otherwise, it remains as 0 or 5.\n\nBut let's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1: the fourth row (row 3) is in the middle rows (2-7). The 5s in columns 2-6 (columns 2-7) are in the middle columns. So they are converted to 1s. That matches the output.\n\nExample 2: the fourth row (row 3) is in the middle rows. The 5s in columns 3-6 are in the middle columns. So they are converted to 1s. That matches.\n\nExample 3: the second row (row 1) is outside the middle rows (rows 2-7). So the 5 in column 1 is not converted. But in the output, it is. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in example 3's output, the second row has 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. The 5 in column 1 is in row 1, which is not in the middle rows. So according to the hypothesis, it should not be converted. But it is. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 5 that is in the middle 4 rows (rows 2-7) and middle 4 columns (columns 2-7) is converted to 1. But if the 5 is in the middle of the grid, but not in the middle columns, it's not converted. But in example 3's second row, the 5 in column 1 is not in the middle columns. So why is it converted?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s. But for example 3's second row, the 5 is in column 1, which is not in the middle columns. But in the output, it's converted to 1. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 3's second row. The 5 in column 1 is converted to 1. The 5s in columns 8 and 9 are kept. So why is that? Maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the row (columns 4-5?) are converted to 1s, but others are not. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in positions where their row and column are both even or both odd. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced by 1s, but the 5s that are in certain positions (like corners) are not. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s, but if they are part of a larger group, they are not. For example, in example 1's fourth row, the 5s are in a group, so they are converted. But in example 3's second row, the 5 is isolated, so it's converted. But in example 3's input, there are other 5s that are not converted. For example, the input row 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 has 5s in columns 1, 8, and 9. The output converts column 1 to 1, but leaves 8 and 9 as 5. So maybe the rule is that any 5 that is in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) is converted to 1, but if it's in the middle of the row, it's converted. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s, and the 5s in other positions are not. So in example 3's second row, the 5 in column 1 is not in the middle columns, so it's not converted. But in the output, it is. So that's a contradiction.\n\nHmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the outputs of the examples.\n\nIn example 1, the fourth row is converted to 1s in the middle. The fifth row has 5s in positions that are not in the middle. So maybe the 5s in the middle of the grid are converted to 1s. But how to determine which positions are in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are converted to 1s, but only if they are part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output converts those to 1s. In example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. In example 3's input, there are rows with 5s in horizontal lines. For example, the fourth row in example 3's input is 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. So the 5s are converted to 1s. So maybe the rule is that any 5 that is part of a horizontal line in the middle of the grid is converted to 1.\n\nBut how to define the middle of the grid. Maybe the middle of the grid is rows 2-7 and columns 2-7. So for example, in the fourth row (row 3), which is in the middle rows, the 5s in columns 2-6 (middle columns) are converted to 1s.\n\nSo the transformation could be: for each cell in the grid, if the cell is a 5 and it's in the middle 4 rows (rows 2-7) and middle 4 columns (columns 2-7), then replace it with 1. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nLet's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput row 3 (fourth row) is in rows 2-7. Columns 2-6 are in columns 2-7. So all 5s in this row are converted to 1s. That matches the output.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput row 3 (fourth row) has 5s in columns 3-6. Those are in columns 2-7. So they are converted to 1s. That matches.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput row 1 (second row) is outside the middle rows (rows 2-7). So the 5 in column 1 is not converted. But in the output, it is converted to 1. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm, but in example 3's output, the second row has 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. The 5 in column 1 is in row 1, which is outside the middle rows. So according to the hypothesis, it should not be converted. But in the output, it is. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe the middle rows are rows 1-9? No, that's the whole grid. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle rows are rows 2-7 (rows 2 to 7, inclusive) and columns 2-7. So for example, in example 3's second row (row 1), the 5 is not in the middle rows, so it's not converted. But the output shows it is. So this is conflicting.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s, and the 5s that are in the middle of the row (columns 2-7) are also converted to 1s, regardless of the row. But that would mean that even if the row is outside the middle rows, but the column is in the middle, the 5 is converted. But that doesn't fit with example 1's fifth row, where the 5 is in column 3 (middle column), but the row is outside the middle rows. But in that case, the 5 is kept.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output:\n\nInput row 1 (second row): 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 \u2192 output 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5.\n\nThe 5 in column 1 is converted to 1. The 5s in columns 8 and 9 are kept. So why is that?\n\nMaybe the 5s that are in the middle of the row (columns 4-5) are converted to 1s. But in this case, the 5 in column 1 is not in the middle of the row. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s, and the 5s that are in the middle of the row (columns 2-7) are also converted to 1s, regardless of the row. But in example 1's fifth row (row 4), the 5 is in column 3 (middle column), but the row is in the middle rows. So it's converted to 1? No, in example 1's fifth row, the output is the same as input. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are converted to 1s, but if they are in certain positions (like in the middle of the grid), they are converted. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced by 1s, but the 5s that are in the corners or edges are not. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs of the examples and see what's common. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has 1s in the middle. In example 2, the fourth row has 1s in the middle. In example 3, the fourth row has 1s in the middle. In example 3's input, the fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. So the 5s in columns 4-5 are converted to 1s. So that fits the pattern of middle columns.\n\nSo maybe the rule is that any 5 in the middle 4 rows (rows 2-7) and middle 4 columns (columns 2-7) is replaced by 1.\n\nBut in example 3's second row, the 5 is in column 1, which is outside the middle columns. So why is it converted to 1?\n\nWait, in example 3's input, the second row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. So the 5 in column 1 is converted to 1, but the 5s in columns 8 and 9 are kept. So why is that?\n\nMaybe the 5s in the middle of the row are converted to 1, regardless of their position in the grid. For example, in this row, the 5 in column 1 is in the middle of the row? No, it's the second column. But the row has 10 columns, so the middle is columns 4-5. So the 5 in column 1 is not in the middle of the row. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are converted to 1s, and the 5s that are in the middle of the row are also converted to 1s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are converted to 1s, and the 5s that are in the middle of the row are also converted to 1s, but this is not consistent with the examples.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to code a function that replaces 5s in the middle 4 rows and columns with 1s, and see if it works for the examples.\n\nLet's try that. The middle 4 rows would be rows 2-7 (0-based), and columns 2-7. So for any cell (i,j) where i is between 2 and 7 (inclusive), and j is between 2 and 7 (inclusive), if the cell is 5, replace it with 1.\n\nLet's test this with example 1:\n\nExample 1's input has a row 3 (fourth row) with 5s in columns 2-6. So those are in the middle rows and columns. So they are converted to 1s. That matches the output.\n\nExample 2's input row 3 (fourth row) has 5s in columns 3-6. Those are in the middle rows and columns. So they are converted to 1s. That matches the output.\n\nExample 3's input row 1 (second row) is outside the middle rows (rows 2-7). So the 5 in column 1 is not converted. But the output shows it is. So this would be a problem. But maybe there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, example 3's input is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 5 5 5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 5 0\n5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5\n\nThe second row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. According to the hypothesis, this row is row 1 (0-based), which is outside the middle rows (2-7). So the 5 in column 1 is not in the middle rows. So according to the hypothesis, it should not be converted. But in the output, it is converted to 1. So this would be a problem. But maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nBut according to the example 3's output, the second row is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. So the 5 in column 1 is converted to 1. But according to the hypothesis, this should not happen. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. What's the alternative?\n\nMaybe the middle rows are rows 1-8, and columns 1-8? Or maybe the middle rows are rows 3-6 and columns 3-6? Or some other range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle rows are rows 2-7 and columns 2-7, but also including some other positions. For example, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid, but not necessarily in the middle rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced by 1s, but the middle of the grid is defined as the area where the row and column are between 2 and 7, but also including some other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced by 1s, but the middle of the grid is defined as the area where the row is between 2 and 7, or the column is between 2 and 7. But that would include more cells.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Perhaps I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the outputs of the examples.\n\nIn example 1, the fourth row's 5s are converted to 1s. In example 2, the fourth row's 5s are converted to 1s. In example 3, the fourth row's 5s are converted to 1s. So maybe the fourth row is part of the pattern.\n\nBut why? Maybe the fourth row is in the middle of the grid. But how to generalize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced by 1s, and the middle of the grid is defined as the rows 2-7 and columns 2-7. So even if the row is outside this range, but the column is in the range, it's converted. But that would mean that in example 3's second row, the 5 in column 1 is not in the range, but the 5 in column 8 is in the range. Wait, column 8 is outside the middle columns (2-7). So that would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced by 1s, and the middle of the grid is defined as the area where the row and column are between 2 and 7. But in example 3's second row, the 5 is not in this area, so it should not be converted. But it is. So this suggests that the pattern is not this.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to write code that replaces 5s in the middle 4 rows and columns with 1s, and see if it passes the examples, even if it fails some.\n\nLet's proceed with this hypothesis and see.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if 2 <= i <= 7 and 2 <= j <= 7:\n                if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nNow, let's test this against the examples.\n\nExample 1: the fourth row (i=3) is in 2-7. Columns 2-6 are in 2-7. So the 5s are replaced with 1s. That matches the output.\n\nExample 2: the fourth row (i=3) is in 2-7. The 5s in columns 3-6 are in 2-7. So they are replaced with 1s. That matches the output.\n\nExample 3: the second row (i=1) is outside 2-7. So the 5 in column 1 is not replaced. But in the output, it is. So this would be a problem.\n\nBut according to the example 3's output, it is replaced. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at example 3's input and output again.\n\nExample 3's input:\n\nRow 1 (second row): 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 \u2192 output is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5.\n\nSo the 5 in column 1 is replaced with 1. But according to the hypothesis, this should not happen. So the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut why is this happening? Maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the row are replaced, regardless of their position in the grid.\n\nFor example, in row 1, the 5 is in column 1, which is the second column. The middle of the row is columns 4-5. So this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced, but the middle of the grid is defined as rows 1-9 and columns 1-9. But that's the entire grid, so all 5s would be replaced, which is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced, and the middle of the grid is defined as rows 2-7 and columns 2-7, but also including some other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced, but the middle of the grid is defined as rows 2-7 and columns 2-7, and also rows 2-7 and columns 2-7. But that's the same as before.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the correct pattern is to replace 5s in the middle 4 rows and columns with 1s, and the example 3's output is an exception. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that any 5 that is in a row where the row is between 2 and 7, or in a column between 2 and 7, is replaced with 1. So if the row is in 2-7, or the column is in 2-7, then it's replaced.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nFor example 3's second row (row 1), which is outside 2-7, but the column 1 is outside 2-7. So the 5 in column 1 is not replaced. But in the output, it is. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7 and columns 2-7) are replaced, and also the 5s that are in the middle of the row (columns 2-7) are replaced, even if the row is outside 2-7.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the outputs of example 3's input. The output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in the second row, the 5 in column 1 is replaced with 1. The 5s in columns 8 and 9 are kept. So maybe the 5 in column 1 is in a position where it is part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced, and the middle of the grid is defined as rows 2-7 and columns 2-7. But in example 3's second row, the 5 is not in that area, so it's not replaced. But in the output, it is. So this suggests that the pattern is not this.\n\nAt this point, I think I have to proceed with the hypothesis that the 5s in the middle 4 rows and columns are replaced with 1s, even if it doesn't fit all examples. Maybe the example 3's output is an exception, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 1s, and the middle of the grid is defined as rows 2-7 and columns 2-7, but also including rows 1 and 9, columns 1 and 9. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 1s, and the middle of the grid is defined as rows 2-7 and columns 2-7, and also rows 1 and 9, columns 2-7, and rows 2-7, columns 1 and 9.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis, even if it doesn't fit all examples, and see what happens.\n\nSo the code would replace 5s in the middle 4 rows and columns with 1s.\n\nNow, let's look at example 3's input. The second row is row 1, which is outside the middle rows. But the output shows that the 5 in column 1 is replaced with 1. So this would not fit. But perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nMaybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 1s, and the middle of the grid is defined as rows 2-7 and columns 2-7, but also rows 1 and 9, columns 2-7, and rows 2-7, columns 1 and 9.\n\nIn this case, the 5 in column 1 of row 1 is in column 1, which is outside the middle columns, but row 1 is outside the middle rows. So it would not be replaced.\n\nBut the output shows it is replaced. So this is not helping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 1s, and the middle of the grid is defined as rows 2-7 and columns 2-7, but also rows 1-9 and columns 2-7. But that would include all rows and columns 2-7. So any 5 in columns 2-7 would be replaced, regardless of the row.\n\nLet's test this with example 3's second row. The 5 in column 1 is not in columns 2-7, so it's not replaced. But in the output, it is. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the correct pattern is to replace 5s in the middle 4 rows and columns with 1s, and the example 3's output is an exception, but I have to proceed with this.\n\nSo, the code would be as described earlier. Let's proceed with that.\n\nNow, let's check the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\n\nAccording to the hypothesis, any 5 in rows 2-7 (0-based rows 2-7) and columns 2-7 (0-based columns 2-7) are replaced with 1.\n\nLet's look at the test input's rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 \u2192 columns 1 and 8 are 5. Columns 1 is outside 2-7, column 8 is outside. So no replacement.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 column 4 is 5, which is in columns 2-7. So replaced with 1.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 column 4 is 5, replaced with 1.\n\nRow 3: 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 \u2192 columns 1 and 7 are 5. Column 1 is outside 2-7, column 7 is in 2-7. So column 7 is replaced.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 4-5 are 5, replaced.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 \u2192 column 5 is 5, replaced.\n\nRow 6: 0 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 \u2192 columns 1, 3-6, 8 are 5. Columns 1 is outside, 3-6 are in 2-7, 8 is outside. So columns 3-6 are replaced.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 4-5 are 5, replaced.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 \u2192 columns 3-7 are 5, replaced.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 2-6 are 5, replaced.\n\nSo the transformed grid would have 1s in those positions. But the test output is not given, so I can't check. But according to the hypothesis, this is the transformation.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples, and it may not be correct. However, given the time constraints, this is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, I need to look at the training examples and see what's changing from input to output. Let's take a look at Example 1 first.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has some 5s and 0s. The output has some 5s and 1s. For instance, in the fourth row of the input, there are five 5s in a row. The output for that row has 0s on the ends and 1s in the middle. Wait, the input row is 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0. The output is 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. So the 5s in the middle are turned into 1s. But why? Maybe the 5s are being replaced by 1s in certain positions. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example's output, the fourth row's 5s are converted to 1s. But in the fifth row of the input, there's a 5 in the fourth position. The output for that row has a 5 in the fourth position. Hmm, maybe not. Let me check again. The fifth row of the input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. So that row remains the same. So maybe the 5s in certain positions are kept, and others are converted?\n\nWait, looking at the first example's output, the fourth row has 1s in the middle. The input's fourth row has 5s in positions 2-6 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Well, the input is given as 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0. So maybe the 5s are in positions 2-6 (if 0-based, that's columns 2 to 6, but maybe it's 1-based? Well, the input is 10 columns, so the fourth row is 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 5 0 0. So positions 2-6 (if 0-based) are 5s. But the output for that row is 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0. So the middle six positions are converted to 1s. So maybe the 5s in a certain area are being replaced by 1s. But why?\n\nLooking at the third example. Let's check the input and output. The input for example 3 has a row that starts with 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0. So that row remains the same. But another row in example 3's input is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. So the 5 in position 1 (second column) is replaced by 1, and the 5s at the end are kept. Hmm. So maybe the 5s in certain positions are being replaced by 1s, but not all.\n\nAnother thing to look for is the positions of the 5s. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has a block of 5s in the middle. The output converts those to 1s. Similarly, in example 2, the input has a row with 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. So again, the middle 5s are converted to 1s. So maybe the 5s that are in a certain pattern (like a horizontal line) are being replaced by 1s. But how?\n\nLooking at example 2's input, there's a row that's 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So again, the middle 5s are converted to 1s. So maybe the rule is that any 5 that is part of a contiguous block of 5s in a certain position is replaced by 1. But how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother thing to note: in example 1, the fourth row's 5s are in the middle. The output converts them to 1s. But in example 2, the fourth row's 5s are also in the middle. So maybe the 5s in certain positions (like the middle of the grid) are being replaced by 1s. But how to determine that?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in a certain shape (like a horizontal line) are being replaced by 1s. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output converts them to 1s. Similarly, in example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. But in example 3, some rows have 5s that are not in a horizontal line. For example, the input row 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 has a 5 in the second position and two 5s at the end. The output converts the 5 in the second position to 1, but leaves the others. So maybe the 5s that are in a certain position (like in the middle of the grid) are replaced by 1s.\n\nWait, maybe the 5s that are in positions where their row and column indices are even? Or maybe the 5s that are in certain positions relative to the center of the grid. Let me think about the grid's structure. The grid is 10x10. So the center is around positions (4,4) to (5,5) perhaps.\n\nLooking at example 1's fourth row (row index 3, assuming 0-based), the 5s are in columns 2-6. The output for that row has 1s in columns 2-6. So maybe the 5s that are in the middle part of the grid (like columns 2-6 in row 3) are converted to 1s. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (like in positions where their row and column are between 2 and 7) are converted to 1s. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output has 1s. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has 1s in positions 2-6. In example 2, the fourth row has 1s in positions 4-6 (but wait, the input row is 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 0. So the 5s in positions 3-6 (assuming 0-based) are converted to 1s. So maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (like in columns 3-6) are converted to 1s.\n\nBut how to determine the exact positions. Maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (like in the middle 4 columns) are converted to 1s. For example, in a 10x10 grid, the middle columns would be 3-6 (if 0-based, columns 3,4,5,6). But in example 1's fourth row, the 5s are in columns 2-6 (assuming 0-based). Hmm, maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (like in rows 2-7 and columns 2-7) are converted to 1s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s that are in the middle of a horizontal line are converted to 1s. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output converts those to 1s. In example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. But in example 3, the input has a row with 5s in positions that are not in a horizontal line. For example, in the input of example 3, the second row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output for that row is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. So the 5 in the second position is converted to 1, and the two 5s at the end are kept. So maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the row are converted to 1s, but the ones at the end are not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 5s that are in positions where their column index is between 2 and 7 (inclusive) are converted to 1s. But how to confirm.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the fourth row is converted to 1s in the middle. But the fifth row of the input is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 5 0 0. The output is the same. So that row has 5s in positions 3 and 7. Those positions are not in the middle of the row. So maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the row (like in columns 3-6) are converted to 1s. But in this case, the 5 in column 3 is kept. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in positions where their row and column are both between 2 and 7 are converted to 1s. Let's check example 1's fourth row (row 3, 0-based). The 5s are in columns 2-6. So row 3 is between 2-7? Well, row 3 is in the middle. So maybe that's the case. But then, in example 2's fourth row, which is row 3 (0-based), the 5s are in columns 3-6. So that's also in the middle. So that would fit.\n\nBut then, in example 3's input, the second row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. So the 5 in column 1 (second position) is converted to 1. But column 1 is outside the middle columns (assuming middle is 2-7). So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's think about the output for example 1. The fourth row's 5s are converted to 1s. But in the fifth row of the input, the 5s are in positions 3 and 7. The output for that row is the same. So why is that? Maybe the 5s that are in certain positions (like in the middle of the grid) are converted to 1s, but if they are in certain positions, they are not. Maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (like in the middle 4 columns of the middle 4 rows) are converted to 1s.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are part of a certain shape. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output converts them to 1s. But in example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s, which is converted to 1s. In example 3, the second row has a 5 in the middle of the row. But that 5 is converted to 1. So maybe any 5 that is in the middle of the row is converted to 1. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (like in the middle 4 rows and columns) are converted to 1s. For example, in example 1, the fourth row is in the middle of the grid. The 5s in that row are converted to 1s. But in example 3, the second row (row index 1) has a 5 in the middle of the row, which is converted to 1. So perhaps the 5s in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s.\n\nBut how to test this. Let's look at example 2's input. The second row is 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. So the 5s in columns 4-5 (assuming 0-based) are converted to 1s. Those columns are in the middle of the row. So that fits.\n\nIn example 3's input, the second row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output for that row is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. So the 5 in column 1 (second position) is converted to 1. But column 1 is outside the middle columns (columns 2-7). So that doesn't fit. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s. But in example 3's second row, the 5 is in column 1, which is outside that range. So why is it converted to 1? That suggests that maybe the pattern is more complex.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 3's input. The output for the second row is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. The original input for that row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. So the 5 in column 1 is converted to 1, and the two 5s in columns 8 and 9 are kept. So why is that? Maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the row (columns 4-5?) are converted to 1s, but others are not. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in positions where their row and column are both between 2 and 7 are converted to 1s. Let's check example 3's second row. The 5 in column 1 is in row 1 (0-based), which is outside the 2-7 range. So that doesn't fit. But the 5 in column 8 is in row 1, column 8. That's outside the 2-7 range. So why is that kept?\n\nHmm, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s. But in example 3's second row, the 5 in column 1 is not in that range. So that's not converted. But in the output, it is. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s, but other 5s are not. So in example 3's second row, the 5 in column 1 is not in that range, so it's not converted. But in the output, it is. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's think about the output in example 1. The fourth row (row 3) has 1s in the middle. The fifth row (row 4) has 5s in positions 3 and 7. Those positions are not in the middle of the row. So why are they kept?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s, but if they are in certain positions (like the middle of a group), they are converted. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s, but if they are part of a larger group, they are not. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has a group of 5s that are in the middle. So they are converted to 1s. But in example 3's second row, the 5 is isolated, so it's converted to 1. But the 5s in the end are kept. So maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are converted to 1s, regardless of their position.\n\nBut how to implement that. Maybe the rule is: for each cell, if it's a 5 and it's in the middle 4 rows (rows 2-7) and middle 4 columns (columns 2-7), then it's converted to 1. Otherwise, it remains as 0 or 5.\n\nBut let's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1: the fourth row (row 3) is in the middle rows (2-7). The 5s in columns 2-6 (columns 2-7) are in the middle columns. So they are converted to 1s. That matches the output.\n\nExample 2: the fourth row (row 3) is in the middle rows. The 5s in columns 3-6 are in the middle columns. So they are converted to 1s. That matches.\n\nExample 3: the second row (row 1) is outside the middle rows (rows 2-7). So the 5 in column 1 is not converted. But in the output, it is. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nWait, but in example 3's output, the second row has 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. The 5 in column 1 is in row 1, which is not in the middle rows. So according to the hypothesis, it should not be converted. But it is. So that's a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the rule is that any 5 that is in the middle 4 rows (rows 2-7) and middle 4 columns (columns 2-7) is converted to 1. But if the 5 is in the middle of the grid, but not in the middle columns, it's not converted. But in example 3's second row, the 5 in column 1 is not in the middle columns. So why is it converted?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s. But for example 3's second row, the 5 is in column 1, which is not in the middle columns. But in the output, it's converted to 1. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 3's second row. The 5 in column 1 is converted to 1. The 5s in columns 8 and 9 are kept. So why is that? Maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the row (columns 4-5?) are converted to 1s, but others are not. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in positions where their row and column are both even or both odd. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the outputs, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced by 1s, but the 5s that are in certain positions (like corners) are not. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s, but if they are part of a larger group, they are not. For example, in example 1's fourth row, the 5s are in a group, so they are converted. But in example 3's second row, the 5 is isolated, so it's converted. But in example 3's input, there are other 5s that are not converted. For example, the input row 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 has 5s in columns 1, 8, and 9. The output converts column 1 to 1, but leaves 8 and 9 as 5. So maybe the rule is that any 5 that is in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) is converted to 1, but if it's in the middle of the row, it's converted. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s, and the 5s in other positions are not. So in example 3's second row, the 5 in column 1 is not in the middle columns, so it's not converted. But in the output, it is. So that's a contradiction.\n\nHmm, this is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the outputs of the examples.\n\nIn example 1, the fourth row is converted to 1s in the middle. The fifth row has 5s in positions that are not in the middle. So maybe the 5s in the middle of the grid are converted to 1s. But how to determine which positions are in the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are converted to 1s, but only if they are part of a certain pattern. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. The output converts those to 1s. In example 2, the fourth row has a horizontal line of 5s. In example 3's input, there are rows with 5s in horizontal lines. For example, the fourth row in example 3's input is 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. So the 5s are converted to 1s. So maybe the rule is that any 5 that is part of a horizontal line in the middle of the grid is converted to 1.\n\nBut how to define the middle of the grid. Maybe the middle of the grid is rows 2-7 and columns 2-7. So for example, in the fourth row (row 3), which is in the middle rows, the 5s in columns 2-6 (middle columns) are converted to 1s.\n\nSo the transformation could be: for each cell in the grid, if the cell is a 5 and it's in the middle 4 rows (rows 2-7) and middle 4 columns (columns 2-7), then replace it with 1. Otherwise, leave it as is.\n\nLet's test this with the examples.\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput row 3 (fourth row) is in rows 2-7. Columns 2-6 are in columns 2-7. So all 5s in this row are converted to 1s. That matches the output.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput row 3 (fourth row) has 5s in columns 3-6. Those are in columns 2-7. So they are converted to 1s. That matches.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput row 1 (second row) is outside the middle rows (rows 2-7). So the 5 in column 1 is not converted. But in the output, it is converted to 1. So this contradicts the hypothesis.\n\nHmm, but in example 3's output, the second row has 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. The 5 in column 1 is in row 1, which is outside the middle rows. So according to the hypothesis, it should not be converted. But in the output, it is. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe the middle rows are rows 1-9? No, that's the whole grid. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle rows are rows 2-7 (rows 2 to 7, inclusive) and columns 2-7. So for example, in example 3's second row (row 1), the 5 is not in the middle rows, so it's not converted. But the output shows it is. So this is conflicting.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s, and the 5s that are in the middle of the row (columns 2-7) are also converted to 1s, regardless of the row. But that would mean that even if the row is outside the middle rows, but the column is in the middle, the 5 is converted. But that doesn't fit with example 1's fifth row, where the 5 is in column 3 (middle column), but the row is outside the middle rows. But in that case, the 5 is kept.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe there's another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output:\n\nInput row 1 (second row): 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 \u2192 output 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5.\n\nThe 5 in column 1 is converted to 1. The 5s in columns 8 and 9 are kept. So why is that?\n\nMaybe the 5s that are in the middle of the row (columns 4-5) are converted to 1s. But in this case, the 5 in column 1 is not in the middle of the row. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7, columns 2-7) are converted to 1s, and the 5s that are in the middle of the row (columns 2-7) are also converted to 1s, regardless of the row. But in example 1's fifth row (row 4), the 5 is in column 3 (middle column), but the row is in the middle rows. So it's converted to 1? No, in example 1's fifth row, the output is the same as input. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are converted to 1s, but if they are in certain positions (like in the middle of the grid), they are converted. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced by 1s, but the 5s that are in the corners or edges are not. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother approach: look at the outputs of the examples and see what's common. For example, in example 1, the fourth row has 1s in the middle. In example 2, the fourth row has 1s in the middle. In example 3, the fourth row has 1s in the middle. In example 3's input, the fourth row is 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0. So the 5s in columns 4-5 are converted to 1s. So that fits the pattern of middle columns.\n\nSo maybe the rule is that any 5 in the middle 4 rows (rows 2-7) and middle 4 columns (columns 2-7) is replaced by 1.\n\nBut in example 3's second row, the 5 is in column 1, which is outside the middle columns. So why is it converted to 1?\n\nWait, in example 3's input, the second row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. The output is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. So the 5 in column 1 is converted to 1, but the 5s in columns 8 and 9 are kept. So why is that?\n\nMaybe the 5s in the middle of the row are converted to 1, regardless of their position in the grid. For example, in this row, the 5 in column 1 is in the middle of the row? No, it's the second column. But the row has 10 columns, so the middle is columns 4-5. So the 5 in column 1 is not in the middle of the row. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are converted to 1s, and the 5s that are in the middle of the row are also converted to 1s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are converted to 1s, and the 5s that are in the middle of the row are also converted to 1s, but this is not consistent with the examples.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should try to code a function that replaces 5s in the middle 4 rows and columns with 1s, and see if it works for the examples.\n\nLet's try that. The middle 4 rows would be rows 2-7 (0-based), and columns 2-7. So for any cell (i,j) where i is between 2 and 7 (inclusive), and j is between 2 and 7 (inclusive), if the cell is 5, replace it with 1.\n\nLet's test this with example 1:\n\nExample 1's input has a row 3 (fourth row) with 5s in columns 2-6. So those are in the middle rows and columns. So they are converted to 1s. That matches the output.\n\nExample 2's input row 3 (fourth row) has 5s in columns 3-6. Those are in the middle rows and columns. So they are converted to 1s. That matches the output.\n\nExample 3's input row 1 (second row) is outside the middle rows (rows 2-7). So the 5 in column 1 is not converted. But the output shows it is. So this would be a problem. But maybe there's a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, example 3's input is:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 0 5 5 5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 5 5 0 0 5 0\n5 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 5\n\nThe second row is 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5. According to the hypothesis, this row is row 1 (0-based), which is outside the middle rows (2-7). So the 5 in column 1 is not in the middle rows. So according to the hypothesis, it should not be converted. But in the output, it is converted to 1. So this would be a problem. But maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nBut according to the example 3's output, the second row is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5. So the 5 in column 1 is converted to 1. But according to the hypothesis, this should not happen. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm. What's the alternative?\n\nMaybe the middle rows are rows 1-8, and columns 1-8? Or maybe the middle rows are rows 3-6 and columns 3-6? Or some other range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the middle rows are rows 2-7 and columns 2-7, but also including some other positions. For example, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid, but not necessarily in the middle rows and columns.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced by 1s, but the middle of the grid is defined as the area where the row and column are between 2 and 7, but also including some other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced by 1s, but the middle of the grid is defined as the area where the row is between 2 and 7, or the column is between 2 and 7. But that would include more cells.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Perhaps I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the outputs of the examples.\n\nIn example 1, the fourth row's 5s are converted to 1s. In example 2, the fourth row's 5s are converted to 1s. In example 3, the fourth row's 5s are converted to 1s. So maybe the fourth row is part of the pattern.\n\nBut why? Maybe the fourth row is in the middle of the grid. But how to generalize.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced by 1s, and the middle of the grid is defined as the rows 2-7 and columns 2-7. So even if the row is outside this range, but the column is in the range, it's converted. But that would mean that in example 3's second row, the 5 in column 1 is not in the range, but the 5 in column 8 is in the range. Wait, column 8 is outside the middle columns (2-7). So that would not fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced by 1s, and the middle of the grid is defined as the area where the row and column are between 2 and 7. But in example 3's second row, the 5 is not in this area, so it should not be converted. But it is. So this suggests that the pattern is not this.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to write code that replaces 5s in the middle 4 rows and columns with 1s, and see if it passes the examples, even if it fails some.\n\nLet's proceed with this hypothesis and see.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*10 for _ in range(10)]\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if 2 <= i <= 7 and 2 <= j <= 7:\n                if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n            else:\n                transformed[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    return transformed\n\nNow, let's test this against the examples.\n\nExample 1: the fourth row (i=3) is in 2-7. Columns 2-6 are in 2-7. So the 5s are replaced with 1s. That matches the output.\n\nExample 2: the fourth row (i=3) is in 2-7. The 5s in columns 3-6 are in 2-7. So they are replaced with 1s. That matches the output.\n\nExample 3: the second row (i=1) is outside 2-7. So the 5 in column 1 is not replaced. But in the output, it is. So this would be a problem.\n\nBut according to the example 3's output, it is replaced. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe I'm missing something. Let's look at example 3's input and output again.\n\nExample 3's input:\n\nRow 1 (second row): 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 5 \u2192 output is 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 5.\n\nSo the 5 in column 1 is replaced with 1. But according to the hypothesis, this should not happen. So the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut why is this happening? Maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the row are replaced, regardless of their position in the grid.\n\nFor example, in row 1, the 5 is in column 1, which is the second column. The middle of the row is columns 4-5. So this is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced, but the middle of the grid is defined as rows 1-9 and columns 1-9. But that's the entire grid, so all 5s would be replaced, which is not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced, and the middle of the grid is defined as rows 2-7 and columns 2-7, but also including some other positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced, but the middle of the grid is defined as rows 2-7 and columns 2-7, and also rows 2-7 and columns 2-7. But that's the same as before.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the correct pattern is to replace 5s in the middle 4 rows and columns with 1s, and the example 3's output is an exception. But that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is that any 5 that is in a row where the row is between 2 and 7, or in a column between 2 and 7, is replaced with 1. So if the row is in 2-7, or the column is in 2-7, then it's replaced.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nFor example 3's second row (row 1), which is outside 2-7, but the column 1 is outside 2-7. So the 5 in column 1 is not replaced. But in the output, it is. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid (rows 2-7 and columns 2-7) are replaced, and also the 5s that are in the middle of the row (columns 2-7) are replaced, even if the row is outside 2-7.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the outputs of example 3's input. The output has 1s in certain positions. For example, in the second row, the 5 in column 1 is replaced with 1. The 5s in columns 8 and 9 are kept. So maybe the 5 in column 1 is in a position where it is part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced, and the middle of the grid is defined as rows 2-7 and columns 2-7. But in example 3's second row, the 5 is not in that area, so it's not replaced. But in the output, it is. So this suggests that the pattern is not this.\n\nAt this point, I think I have to proceed with the hypothesis that the 5s in the middle 4 rows and columns are replaced with 1s, even if it doesn't fit all examples. Maybe the example 3's output is an exception, or maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 1s, and the middle of the grid is defined as rows 2-7 and columns 2-7, but also including rows 1 and 9, columns 1 and 9. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 1s, and the middle of the grid is defined as rows 2-7 and columns 2-7, and also rows 1 and 9, columns 2-7, and rows 2-7, columns 1 and 9.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the initial hypothesis, even if it doesn't fit all examples, and see what happens.\n\nSo the code would replace 5s in the middle 4 rows and columns with 1s.\n\nNow, let's look at example 3's input. The second row is row 1, which is outside the middle rows. But the output shows that the 5 in column 1 is replaced with 1. So this would not fit. But perhaps there's another pattern.\n\nMaybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 1s, and the middle of the grid is defined as rows 2-7 and columns 2-7, but also rows 1 and 9, columns 2-7, and rows 2-7, columns 1 and 9.\n\nIn this case, the 5 in column 1 of row 1 is in column 1, which is outside the middle columns, but row 1 is outside the middle rows. So it would not be replaced.\n\nBut the output shows it is replaced. So this is not helping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5s that are in the middle of the grid are replaced with 1s, and the middle of the grid is defined as rows 2-7 and columns 2-7, but also rows 1-9 and columns 2-7. But that would include all rows and columns 2-7. So any 5 in columns 2-7 would be replaced, regardless of the row.\n\nLet's test this with example 3's second row. The 5 in column 1 is not in columns 2-7, so it's not replaced. But in the output, it is. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the correct pattern is to replace 5s in the middle 4 rows and columns with 1s, and the example 3's output is an exception, but I have to proceed with this.\n\nSo, the code would be as described earlier. Let's proceed with that.\n\nNow, let's check the test input.\n\nTest input:\n\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0\n0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0\n0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0\n\nAccording to the hypothesis, any 5 in rows 2-7 (0-based rows 2-7) and columns 2-7 (0-based columns 2-7) are replaced with 1.\n\nLet's look at the test input's rows:\n\nRow 0: 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 \u2192 columns 1 and 8 are 5. Columns 1 is outside 2-7, column 8 is outside. So no replacement.\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 column 4 is 5, which is in columns 2-7. So replaced with 1.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 column 4 is 5, replaced with 1.\n\nRow 3: 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 \u2192 columns 1 and 7 are 5. Column 1 is outside 2-7, column 7 is in 2-7. So column 7 is replaced.\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 4-5 are 5, replaced.\n\nRow 5: 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 \u2192 column 5 is 5, replaced.\n\nRow 6: 0 5 0 5 5 5 5 0 5 0 \u2192 columns 1, 3-6, 8 are 5. Columns 1 is outside, 3-6 are in 2-7, 8 is outside. So columns 3-6 are replaced.\n\nRow 7: 0 0 0 0 5 5 0 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 4-5 are 5, replaced.\n\nRow 8: 0 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 \u2192 columns 3-7 are 5, replaced.\n\nRow 9: 0 0 5 5 5 5 5 0 0 0 \u2192 columns 2-6 are 5, replaced.\n\nSo the transformed grid would have 1s in those positions. But the test output is not given, so I can't check. But according to the hypothesis, this is the transformation.\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples, and it may not be correct. However, given the time constraints, this is the best I can do.\n"
