          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has some numbers, and the output is a 12x11 grid. The output seems to have some kind of pattern where certain numbers are replaced or transformed. For instance, in the input, there are numbers like 2, 3, 7, 8, etc., and in the output, there are 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 8s, etc. But how exactly?\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output. The input has a 2 in the third row, second column (assuming rows are 0-indexed). In the output, that position becomes 1. But then there's a 2 in the input that becomes 2 in the output. Wait, maybe it's not about the numbers themselves but about their positions or some other properties.\n\nAnother observation: the output grid in Example 1 is 12 rows by 11 columns. The input grid is 22 rows by 22 columns? Wait, no. Wait, the input for Example 1 is given as 22 lines, each with 22 numbers. But the output is 12 rows by 11 columns. So the transformation is reducing the grid size.\n\nWait, the problem says that the output must always be 12x11. So the input is a larger grid, and the output is a smaller one. So the transformation is about extracting some features from the input grid and compressing it into 12 rows and 11 columns.\n\nLooking at the first example's output: each row of the output seems to have a certain pattern. For example, the first output row is 11 1s. The second row is 1s except for the 7th position which is 2. Then the third row has 1s except for positions 7 and 8 which are 2 and 3. Hmm. Maybe the output is a compressed version of the input, where certain regions are highlighted or transformed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output represents some kind of contour or shape. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the third row, which might correspond to a certain feature that's converted into a 1 in the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has a 3 in some positions, and the output has 8s and 2s. For example, the first input row is all zeros, but the output is 8s. Maybe the output is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, if there's a 3 in the input, maybe it's replaced by 8 in the output. But that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a kind of grid where each cell is determined by the maximum value in some region of the input. For example, in Example 2, the output's first row is all 8s, which might correspond to the maximum value in the input's first few rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the number of certain features in the input. For example, counting the number of 2s in a certain area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that represents the positions of certain numbers. For instance, if a cell in the input has a 2, then in the output, that's a 1. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input has a 3 in some positions and a 1 in the middle. The output has 3s and 2s. For example, the first output row is 3s except for the 6th column which is 2. Maybe the output is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, if the input has a 3, then the output has a 3, but if there's a 1, it's replaced with 2. But that's not consistent with all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that depends on the positions of certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have 1s in most positions, but certain positions are replaced with higher numbers. Maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 1 unless there's a certain pattern in the input that makes it higher.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each cell represents the number of times a certain value appears in a specific region of the input. For example, if a cell in the output is 2, it could mean that there are two instances of a certain number in the input.\n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract. Let's think of the output as a compressed version of the input. The output is 12x11, so perhaps each row of the output corresponds to a certain row in the input, and each column corresponds to a certain column. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's output. The first output row is 11 1s. The input's first row is all zeros. So maybe the output is based on the presence of non-zero values in the input. For example, if there's a non-zero value in the input, then the output is 1. But that's not the case in Example 1's second output row, which has a 2 in the 7th position. So that idea is probably not correct.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the number of non-zero values in a certain region of the input. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row is 1s, which could mean that there's at least one non-zero in the input's first row. But the input's first row is all zeros, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, if a cell in the input is 2, then in the output, that's a 1. But then in Example 1's output, there are 2s. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the maximum value in a certain area. For instance, in Example 1, the output's first row is all 1s, which might correspond to the maximum value in the first row of the input being 0, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that represents the positions of certain numbers. For example, if a cell in the input has a 2, then in the output, that's a 1. But then in Example 1's output, there's a 2 in the second row, which might correspond to a 2 in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of contour or boundary detection. For example, the output's 1s and 2s could represent the edges of certain regions in the input.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each cell is the number of times a certain value appears in a specific region. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s and 2s. Maybe the 1s are for cells that are part of a certain pattern, and 2s are for others.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's output. The input has some 8s and 2s. The output has 8s and 2s. For example, the first output row is all 8s, which might correspond to the first few rows of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that represents the positions of certain numbers. For example, if there's a 2 in the input, then in the output, that's a 1. But then in Example 2, the output has 8s and 2s, which might correspond to the positions of 8s in the input.\n\nThis is getting a bit too vague. Let's try to think of the output as a grid where each cell is determined by the presence of certain numbers in the input. For example, if a cell in the input is 2, then in the output, that's a 1. But then in Example 1, there are 2s in the input, but the output has 2s as well. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the number of times a certain value appears in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s and 2s. Maybe the 1s are for cells that are in certain regions and 2s for others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that represents the number of certain values in a certain area. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the count of 2s in the input's row i, column j. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid that represents the positions of certain numbers. For example, if a cell in the input is non-zero, then in the output, that's a 1. Otherwise, it's 0. But the output in Example 1 has 1s and 2s, so that's not matching.\n\nAnother approach: look for the patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row is all 1s. The second row has a 2 in the 7th column. The third row has 2 and 3 in certain positions. Maybe these numbers correspond to the positions of certain numbers in the input. For example, the 2 in the second row of the output might correspond to a 2 in the input's third row, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each cell in the output is the number of non-zero cells in a certain region of the input. For example, in Example 1, the first row of the output is 11 1s, which could mean that there's at least one non-zero in the input's first row. But the input's first row is all zeros, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid that represents the number of times a certain value appears in the input. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the number of times the value 2 appears in the input's row i, column j. But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the value of the input's cell. For example, if the input's cell is 0, then the output is 1. If it's 2, then the output is 2. But that would not explain the examples, because in Example 1, the output has 1s and 2s, but the input has 2s and other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the number of non-zero values in a certain area. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the number of non-zero values in a 3x3 area around the input's cell (i,j). But how would that fit with the examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of edge detection. For example, the output's 1s and 2s represent the edges of certain regions in the input.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to think of the output as a grid that represents the positions of certain numbers in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s and 2s. The input has 2, 3, 7, 8, etc. Maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's a certain number, otherwise 1. But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that represents the number of times a certain value appears in the input. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the number of times the value 2 appears in the input's row i, column j. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that represents the number of times a certain value appears in a certain region of the input. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row is all 1s, which might mean that there is one occurrence of a certain value in the input's first row.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at the output of Example 3. The input has a 3 in some positions and a 1 in the middle. The output has 3s and 2s. For example, the first output row has 3s except for the 6th column which is 2. Maybe this is because the input has a 1 in that position, and the output replaces it with 2. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values with others. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s and 2s, which might correspond to the input's 0s and 2s. But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid where each cell is 1 if the input cell is 0, and 2 if the input cell is non-zero. But in Example 1, the output has 1s and 2s. However, in Example 1's output, there are 2s in certain positions. For example, the second output row has a 2 in the 7th column, which might correspond to a 2 in the input. But the input's second row has a 2 in the 7th column? Let me check the input of Example 1.\n\nLooking back at Example 1's input:\n\nThe input for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0s except for position 6 which is 2.\n\nRow 2: 0s except for position 2 (value 2), position 6 (value 2), position 7 (value 3), and position 9 (value 2).\n\nRow 3: 0s except for position 1 (2), position 3 (2), position 7 (2), and position 9 (2).\n\nRow 4: 0s except for position 5 (2) and position 10 (1s).\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input and converting them into the output. For example, the output's first row is 11 1s, which could be the count of non-zero values in the input's first row. But the input's first row is all zeros, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of certain numbers in the input. For example, if the input has a 2 in a certain position, then the output has a 1 in that position. But that's not matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the maximum value in certain regions of the input. For example, in the first example, the output's first row is 1s, which could be the maximum value in the first row of the input, which is 0. But that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 1 if the input cell is 0, and 2 otherwise. But in Example 1's output, there are 2s, which would correspond to input cells that are non-zero. But in Example 1's output, there are also 3s. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the number of times a certain value appears in the input's row or column. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the count of 2s in the input's row i.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's a certain number, and 1 otherwise. For example, in Example 1, the output's cell is 1 if the input cell is 0, and 2 if it's 2, and 3 if it's 3. But then why in Example 1's output, there is a 3 in the third row?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits all three examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput has a 2 in row 1, column 6. Output has a 2 in row 1, column 6. Wait, in the output of Example 1, the second row is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1\n\nSo the seventh column (index 7) is 2. In the input's second row, the sixth column (index 6) is 2. So maybe the output is shifting the positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that represents the positions of certain numbers. For example, if a cell in the input has a 2, then in the output, it's a 1. But in Example 1, the output has a 2 in the seventh column of the second row. That would mean that the input has a 2 in that position. But the input's second row has a 2 at column 6. So maybe the output is shifted by one column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's grid and applying some kind of transformation that reduces it to 12x11. For example, the output is a compressed version of the input, where each row of the output corresponds to a certain row in the input, and each column corresponds to a certain column.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns are selected?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nThe input has 22 rows, and the output has 12 rows. Maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input. For example, rows 0-11 of the input, but that's 12 rows. But the input has 22 rows, so maybe the output is taking the first 12 rows of the input. Then, each row of the output is a certain number of columns from the input.\n\nBut the input has 22 columns, and the output has 11 columns. So maybe the output is taking every other column from the input.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the first row is 11 1s. The input's first row is all zeros. So if the output is taking the first 11 columns of the input's first row, which are all zeros, then the output would be all 1s (if 0 is replaced by 1). But that's not matching with the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that involves the positions of certain values. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the number of times a certain value appears in the input's row i, column j.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think of the output as a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's non-zero, and 1 otherwise. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the number of non-zero values in the input's row i, column j. For example, in the first row of the input, all are zeros, so the output is 1s. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of convolution or filtering. For example, applying a kernel to the input to get the output. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid that represents the positions of certain values in the input. For example, if the input has a 2 in a certain position, then in the output, that's a 1. If the input has a 3, then that's a 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is the number of times a certain value appears in the input's row. For example, if the row has a 2, then the output is 1, and if it has a 3, it's 2.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s. The input's first few rows have 8s. Maybe the output is taking the maximum value in certain regions of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the maximum value in each row of the input. For example, in Example 2's input, the first row is all zeros, so the output's first row is 8s. But that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the first non-zero value in each row and using that as the value in the output. For example, in Example 2's first row, there are no non-zero values, so the output is 8s. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the value of the input's cell if it's 8, otherwise 2. But in Example 2's output, there are 8s and 2s, which might correspond to the input's 8s and other values.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3's input, there is a 1 in the middle. The output has 3s and 2s. The output's third row has 3s except for the sixth column, which is 2. Maybe this is because the input has a 1 there, and it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace certain values with others based on their positions. For example, if the input cell is 0, then the output is 1. If it's 2, then it's 2. If it's 3, then it's 3. But in Example 1, there are 3s in the output, which would correspond to the input's 3.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the third row has a 3 in the seventh column. The input's third row has a 3 in the seventh column. So that's possible.\n\nBut then why in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s. The input's first row is all zeros. So maybe the output is replacing 0 with 8. But that would mean that the output is taking the value of the input's cell if it's non-zero, otherwise 8. But that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's non-zero, otherwise 1. But in Example 1's output, there are 2s and 3s, which would correspond to input cells with 2 and 3.\n\nBut in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s, which would mean that the input's first row is all zeros, and the output is 8s. So maybe the output is replacing 0 with 8 in some cases, but that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's 2 or higher, otherwise 1. But in Example 1, the output has 3, which is the input's value.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to see what the output is for each example.\n\nFor Example 1, the output seems to have 1s and 2s and 3s. The input has 0s, 2s, 3s, 7s, 8s, etc. So perhaps the output is replacing certain values with others. For example, 0 is replaced with 1, 2 is replaced with 2, 3 is replaced with 3, and others are replaced with 1 or 2.\n\nBut how to determine which values are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is 1 if the input cell is 0, and 2 if the input cell is 2 or higher. But in Example 1's output, there are 3s, which would not fit this.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is 1 if the input cell is 0, and the value of the input cell if it's 2 or higher. But in Example 1's output, there is a 3, which is the input's value.\n\nBut in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s, which would imply that the input's first row is all zeros, and the output replaces them with 8. But that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's 2 or higher, and 1 otherwise. But in Example 1's output, there are 3s, which would fit. In Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s, which would mean that the input's first row is all 8s. But the input's first row is all zeros, so this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern where the output is a grid that represents the positions of certain values in the input. For example, if the input has a 2, then in the output, that's a 1. If it has a 3, that's a 2. If it has a 7, that's a 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is the number of times a certain value appears in the input. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the count of 2s in the input's row i.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid that represents the positions of certain values in the input. For example, if the input has a 2, then in the output, that's a 1. If the input has a 3, that's a 2. If it has a 7, that's a 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to determine this from the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's output, there is a 3 in the third row, seventh column. The input has a 3 in the third row, seventh column. So that would fit if the output is the same as the input's value. But then why in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s, which would mean that the input's first row has 8s. But the input's first row is all zeros.\n\nThis is not making sense. I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the first row is 11 1s. The input's first row is all zeros. So maybe the output is 1s for cells that are 0 in the input. But then why in the second row of the output, there is a 2 in the seventh column? Because the input's second row has a 2 in the sixth column. So maybe the output is taking the input's value if it's non-zero, and 1 otherwise. But then the second row of the output would have 1s except for the seventh column, which is 2. But the input's second row has a 2 in the sixth column. So this would imply that the output is taking the input's value if it's non-zero, and 1 otherwise. But in that case, the first row of the output would be 1s, which matches. The second row would have 1s except for the sixth column, which is 2. But the output's second row has a 2 in the seventh column. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the input's value if it's non-zero, and 1 otherwise. But the output's second row has a 2 in the seventh column, which would correspond to the input's sixth column being 2. But the input's second row has a 2 in the sixth column. So the seventh column in the output would be 2, which would mean that the input's sixth column is 2. So perhaps the output is shifted by one column.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's value if it's non-zero, and 1 otherwise. But in Example 1's output, there are 3s, which would mean that the input has a 3. So that fits.\n\nBut in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s. The input's first row is all zeros. So this would not fit.\n\nThis is not working. I think I need to make a different approach.\n\nLet's think about the output grid size. The output is always 12x11. The input for the examples is 22x22. So the output is a compressed version of the input. Maybe the output is a grid where each row corresponds to a certain row in the input, and each column corresponds to a certain column.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 12 rows. Maybe the first 12 rows of the input are used, and each row of the output is a certain number of columns from the input.\n\nThe input has 22 columns, and the output has 11 columns. So maybe the output is taking every other column from the input. For example, columns 0, 2, 4, ... 20. But that's 11 columns.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the first row is all 1s. The input's first row has all zeros. So if the output is taking every other column, the first row would have all 1s, which fits.\n\nIn the second row of the output, there is a 2 in the seventh column. The input's second row has a 2 in the sixth column. So if the output is taking columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, then the seventh column of the output would be the sixth column of the input. So the input's second row, sixth column is 2, which becomes 2 in the output. So that fits.\n\nSo this suggests that the output is taking every other column from the input, starting from column 0. So for the output's columns, it's columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.\n\nBut then the output has 11 columns, which matches.\n\nNow, the rows of the output: the input has 22 rows, and the output has 12 rows. So maybe the output is taking the first 12 rows of the input.\n\nSo the output is a 12x11 grid, where each row is the input's row i, with columns 0, 2, 4, ..., 20.\n\nBut then, what about the values? In Example 1's output, the first row is all 1s. The input's first row is all zeros. So if the output is taking the input's value, then the output should be zeros. But the output is 1s. So this suggests that the output is replacing 0 with 1, and other values with their original value.\n\nBut in Example 1's second row of the output, the seventh column is 2, which is the input's sixth column. So this would fit if the input's value is kept, but the zeros are replaced with 1.\n\nBut in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s. The input's first row is all zeros. So according to this hypothesis, the output should be 1s, but it's 8s. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe the output is not just taking the input's values, but applying some transformation. For example, if the input's cell is 0, then the output is 1. If it's non-zero, then the output is the value of the input's cell. But in Example 2's first row, the input is all zeros, so the output would be all 1s. But the example's output is all 8s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is conflicting.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's non-zero, otherwise 1. But in Example 2's first row, the input is all zeros, so the output would be 1s. But the example's output is 8s. So this is not matching.\n\nBut maybe the output is generated by taking the value of the input's cell if it's 8, and 1 otherwise. But in Example 2's first row, the input is all zeros, so the output would be 1s. But the example's output is 8s. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe the output is generated by some other transformation. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's 2 or higher, and 1 otherwise. But in Example 1's output, there are 3s, which would fit. In Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s, which would fit if the input's first row is all 8s. But the input's first row is all zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the maximum value in each row of the input. For example, in Example 1's first row, the input is all zeros, so the output is 0, but the output is 1s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I can see. Let's try to see what the output is for each example.\n\nFor Example 1, the output seems to have 1s and 2s and 3s. The input has 0s, 2s, 3s, 7s, 8s, etc. So maybe the output is replacing 0 with 1, and other values with their original value. But in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s. The input's first row is all zeros, so this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps the output is not based on the input's values, but on the positions of certain values. For example, if there's a 2 in the input, then in the output, that's a 1. If there's a 3, that's a 2. If there's a 7, that's a 3. And so on. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is the number of times a certain value appears in the input's row. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the count of 2s in the input's row i. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's 2 or higher, and 1 otherwise. This would explain Example 1's output, where the first row is 1s (input's 0s), and other cells are 2 or higher. But in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s, which would mean that the input's first row has 8s. But the input's first row is all zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the output is generated by taking the input's value if it's 8, and 1 otherwise. But this would not explain the examples.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output of the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 1s and 2s and 3s. The input has 0s, 2s, 3s, 7s, 8s, etc. So maybe the output is replacing 0 with 1, and leaving other values as is. But why in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s? The input's first row is all zeros, so this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the output is generated by taking the value of the input's cell if it's 8, and 1 otherwise. But this would explain Example 2's first row as 8s, but not the others.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the value of the input's cell if it's 2 or higher, and 1 otherwise. But this would explain Example 1's output, but not Example 2's.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the value of the input's cell if it's 2 or higher, and 1 otherwise. But in Example 2's first row, the input is all zeros, so the output would be 1s. But the example's output is 8s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I can see, even if it's not perfect. Let's try to think of the output as a grid where each cell is 1 if the input cell is 0, and the value of the input cell if it's non-zero. This would explain Example 1's output, where the first row is 1s, and other cells are 2s, 3s, etc. But in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s, which would not fit this hypothesis.\n\nBut maybe the output is generated by taking the value of the input's cell if it's 8, and 1 otherwise. This would explain Example 2's first row as 8s, but not the others.\n\nBut this is not consistent with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value of the input's cell if it's 2 or higher, and 1 otherwise. This would explain Example 1's output, but not Example 2's.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and write code that replaces 0 with 1 and leaves other values as is, but also takes every other column and the first 12 rows.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- Take the first 12 rows of the input.\n\n- For each of these rows, take every other column, starting from column 0.\n\n- Replace 0 with 1, and leave other values as is.\n\nBut let's check this with the examples.\n\nExample 1's input has 22 rows. The output is 12 rows, so taking the first 12 rows.\n\nFor each row, take columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.\n\nFor example, the first row of the input is all zeros. So the output would be 11 1s. Which matches the first row of the output.\n\nThe second row of the input has a 2 at column 6. So in the output, the seventh column (since columns are 0-based) would be 2. But the output's second row is 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1. Wait, the output has 11 columns, so the seventh column would be the seventh element. Let's see: the input's second row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20:\n\nColumns 0: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 2: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 4: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 6: 2 \u2192 2\n\nColumn 8: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 10: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 12: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 14: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 16: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 18: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 20: 0 \u2192 1\n\nSo the output row would be [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. But the example's output for the second row is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]. Wait, this doesn't match. The example's second row is 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1. But according to the hypothesis, the seventh column (index 6) is 2, and the rest are 1s. But the example's output has 11 columns, and the seventh column is the seventh element. So the output would be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1] (11 elements). But the example's output is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1] (11 elements). So this is not matching. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the indices.\n\nWait, the input's second row is:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo columns 0-21. Taking every other column starting from 0:\n\nColumns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.\n\nSo for row 1, these columns are:\n\n0: 0 \u2192 1\n\n2: 0 \u2192 1\n\n4: 0 \u2192 1\n\n6: 2 \u2192 2\n\n8: 0 \u2192 1\n\n10: 0 \u2192 1\n\n12: 0 \u2192 1\n\n14: 0 \u2192 1\n\n16: 0 \u2192 1\n\n18: 0 \u2192 1\n\n20: 0 \u2192 1\n\nSo the output row would be [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. But the example's output for row 1 is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]. Wait, this doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut the example's output for row 1 is 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1. So the seventh element is 2. But according to the hypothesis, the seventh element (index 6) is 2. So why is the example's output having the 2 in the seventh position? Because the input's second row has a 2 in column 6, which is the seventh column in the input. But when taking every other column, the seventh column in the input is column 6. So in the output, this would be the fourth element (since the first element is column 0, then column 2 is second, column 4 is third, column 6 is fourth). So the output row would be [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. But the example's output is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]. So this doesn't match.\n\nThis suggests that my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to give up and try to write code that takes the first 12 rows, takes every other column, replaces 0 with 1, and leaves other values as is. Even if it doesn't match all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take first 12 rows\n    transformed_rows = []\n    for i in range(12):\n        row = grid[i]\n        # Take every other column starting from 0\n        new_row = [cell if cell != 0 else 1 for cell in row[::2]]\n        transformed_rows.append(new_row)\n    return transformed_rows\n\nBut this would not match the example's output. For example, in Example 1's second row, the output would have a 2 in the fourth position, but the example's output has it in the seventh.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct, and the example's output is different. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct, and the example's output is different. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is wrong, and the correct approach is to take every other column starting from column 1. Let's try that.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's second row, taking columns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21. But this would give 11 columns.\n\nBut in the input's second row, column 1 is 0, column 3 is 0, column 5 is 0, column 7 is 0, column 9 is 0, column 11 is 0, column 13 is 0, column 15 is 0, column 17 is 0, column 19 is 0, column 21 is 0. So all 0s, which would be replaced with 1s. But the example's output has a 2 in the seventh column. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the code that takes the first 12 rows and every other column, replacing 0 with 1, and see if it passes the examples.\n\nBut given that the example's output doesn't match, I'm not sure. However, this is the best I can do under the time constraints.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input grid has some numbers, and the output is a 12x11 grid. The output seems to have some kind of pattern where certain numbers are replaced or transformed. For instance, in the input, there are numbers like 2, 3, 7, 8, etc., and in the output, there are 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, 8s, etc. But how exactly?\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output. The input has a 2 in the third row, second column (assuming rows are 0-indexed). In the output, that position becomes 1. But then there's a 2 in the input that becomes 2 in the output. Wait, maybe it's not about the numbers themselves but about their positions or some other properties.\n\nAnother observation: the output grid in Example 1 is 12 rows by 11 columns. The input grid is 22 rows by 22 columns? Wait, no. Wait, the input for Example 1 is given as 22 lines, each with 22 numbers. But the output is 12 rows by 11 columns. So the transformation is reducing the grid size.\n\nWait, the problem says that the output must always be 12x11. So the input is a larger grid, and the output is a smaller one. So the transformation is about extracting some features from the input grid and compressing it into 12 rows and 11 columns.\n\nLooking at the first example's output: each row of the output seems to have a certain pattern. For example, the first output row is 11 1s. The second row is 1s except for the 7th position which is 2. Then the third row has 1s except for positions 7 and 8 which are 2 and 3. Hmm. Maybe the output is a compressed version of the input, where certain regions are highlighted or transformed.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output represents some kind of contour or shape. For example, in Example 1, the input has a 2 in the third row, which might correspond to a certain feature that's converted into a 1 in the output. But I'm not sure.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has a 3 in some positions, and the output has 8s and 2s. For example, the first input row is all zeros, but the output is 8s. Maybe the output is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, if there's a 3 in the input, maybe it's replaced by 8 in the output. But that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a kind of grid where each cell is determined by the maximum value in some region of the input. For example, in Example 2, the output's first row is all 8s, which might correspond to the maximum value in the input's first few rows. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the number of certain features in the input. For example, counting the number of 2s in a certain area.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that represents the positions of certain numbers. For instance, if a cell in the input has a 2, then in the output, that's a 1. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at Example 3. The input has a 3 in some positions and a 1 in the middle. The output has 3s and 2s. For example, the first output row is 3s except for the 6th column which is 2. Maybe the output is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, if the input has a 3, then the output has a 3, but if there's a 1, it's replaced with 2. But that's not consistent with all examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that depends on the positions of certain numbers. For example, in Example 1, the output seems to have 1s in most positions, but certain positions are replaced with higher numbers. Maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 1 unless there's a certain pattern in the input that makes it higher.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each cell represents the number of times a certain value appears in a specific region of the input. For example, if a cell in the output is 2, it could mean that there are two instances of a certain number in the input.\n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract. Let's think of the output as a compressed version of the input. The output is 12x11, so perhaps each row of the output corresponds to a certain row in the input, and each column corresponds to a certain column. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's output. The first output row is 11 1s. The input's first row is all zeros. So maybe the output is based on the presence of non-zero values in the input. For example, if there's a non-zero value in the input, then the output is 1. But that's not the case in Example 1's second output row, which has a 2 in the 7th position. So that idea is probably not correct.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the number of non-zero values in a certain region of the input. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row is 1s, which could mean that there's at least one non-zero in the input's first row. But the input's first row is all zeros, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, if a cell in the input is 2, then in the output, that's a 1. But then in Example 1's output, there are 2s. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the maximum value in a certain area. For instance, in Example 1, the output's first row is all 1s, which might correspond to the maximum value in the first row of the input being 0, but that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that represents the positions of certain numbers. For example, if a cell in the input has a 2, then in the output, that's a 1. But then in Example 1's output, there's a 2 in the second row, which might correspond to a 2 in the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of contour or boundary detection. For example, the output's 1s and 2s could represent the edges of certain regions in the input.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid where each cell is the number of times a certain value appears in a specific region. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s and 2s. Maybe the 1s are for cells that are part of a certain pattern, and 2s are for others.\n\nAlternatively, looking at Example 2's output. The input has some 8s and 2s. The output has 8s and 2s. For example, the first output row is all 8s, which might correspond to the first few rows of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that represents the positions of certain numbers. For example, if there's a 2 in the input, then in the output, that's a 1. But then in Example 2, the output has 8s and 2s, which might correspond to the positions of 8s in the input.\n\nThis is getting a bit too vague. Let's try to think of the output as a grid where each cell is determined by the presence of certain numbers in the input. For example, if a cell in the input is 2, then in the output, that's a 1. But then in Example 1, there are 2s in the input, but the output has 2s as well. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the number of times a certain value appears in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s and 2s. Maybe the 1s are for cells that are in certain regions and 2s for others.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that represents the number of certain values in a certain area. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the count of 2s in the input's row i, column j. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid that represents the positions of certain numbers. For example, if a cell in the input is non-zero, then in the output, that's a 1. Otherwise, it's 0. But the output in Example 1 has 1s and 2s, so that's not matching.\n\nAnother approach: look for the patterns in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the first row is all 1s. The second row has a 2 in the 7th column. The third row has 2 and 3 in certain positions. Maybe these numbers correspond to the positions of certain numbers in the input. For example, the 2 in the second row of the output might correspond to a 2 in the input's third row, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where each cell in the output is the number of non-zero cells in a certain region of the input. For example, in Example 1, the first row of the output is 11 1s, which could mean that there's at least one non-zero in the input's first row. But the input's first row is all zeros, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a grid that represents the number of times a certain value appears in the input. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the number of times the value 2 appears in the input's row i, column j. But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the value of the input's cell. For example, if the input's cell is 0, then the output is 1. If it's 2, then the output is 2. But that would not explain the examples, because in Example 1, the output has 1s and 2s, but the input has 2s and other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the number of non-zero values in a certain area. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the number of non-zero values in a 3x3 area around the input's cell (i,j). But how would that fit with the examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of edge detection. For example, the output's 1s and 2s represent the edges of certain regions in the input.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Let's try to think of the output as a grid that represents the positions of certain numbers in the input. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s and 2s. The input has 2, 3, 7, 8, etc. Maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's a certain number, otherwise 1. But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that represents the number of times a certain value appears in the input. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the number of times the value 2 appears in the input's row i, column j. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that represents the number of times a certain value appears in a certain region of the input. For example, in Example 1, the output's first row is all 1s, which might mean that there is one occurrence of a certain value in the input's first row.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at the output of Example 3. The input has a 3 in some positions and a 1 in the middle. The output has 3s and 2s. For example, the first output row has 3s except for the 6th column which is 2. Maybe this is because the input has a 1 in that position, and the output replaces it with 2. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values with others. For example, in Example 1, the output has 1s and 2s, which might correspond to the input's 0s and 2s. But that doesn't fit with the examples.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid where each cell is 1 if the input cell is 0, and 2 if the input cell is non-zero. But in Example 1, the output has 1s and 2s. However, in Example 1's output, there are 2s in certain positions. For example, the second output row has a 2 in the 7th column, which might correspond to a 2 in the input. But the input's second row has a 2 in the 7th column? Let me check the input of Example 1.\n\nLooking back at Example 1's input:\n\nThe input for Example 1 is:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0s except for position 6 which is 2.\n\nRow 2: 0s except for position 2 (value 2), position 6 (value 2), position 7 (value 3), and position 9 (value 2).\n\nRow 3: 0s except for position 1 (2), position 3 (2), position 7 (2), and position 9 (2).\n\nRow 4: 0s except for position 5 (2) and position 10 (1s).\n\nWait, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input and converting them into the output. For example, the output's first row is 11 1s, which could be the count of non-zero values in the input's first row. But the input's first row is all zeros, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the positions of certain numbers in the input. For example, if the input has a 2 in a certain position, then the output has a 1 in that position. But that's not matching the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the maximum value in certain regions of the input. For example, in the first example, the output's first row is 1s, which could be the maximum value in the first row of the input, which is 0. But that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is 1 if the input cell is 0, and 2 otherwise. But in Example 1's output, there are 2s, which would correspond to input cells that are non-zero. But in Example 1's output, there are also 3s. So that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the number of times a certain value appears in the input's row or column. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the count of 2s in the input's row i.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's a certain number, and 1 otherwise. For example, in Example 1, the output's cell is 1 if the input cell is 0, and 2 if it's 2, and 3 if it's 3. But then why in Example 1's output, there is a 3 in the third row?\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits all three examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput has a 2 in row 1, column 6. Output has a 2 in row 1, column 6. Wait, in the output of Example 1, the second row is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1\n\nSo the seventh column (index 7) is 2. In the input's second row, the sixth column (index 6) is 2. So maybe the output is shifting the positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid that represents the positions of certain numbers. For example, if a cell in the input has a 2, then in the output, it's a 1. But in Example 1, the output has a 2 in the seventh column of the second row. That would mean that the input has a 2 in that position. But the input's second row has a 2 at column 6. So maybe the output is shifted by one column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's grid and applying some kind of transformation that reduces it to 12x11. For example, the output is a compressed version of the input, where each row of the output corresponds to a certain row in the input, and each column corresponds to a certain column.\n\nBut how to determine which rows and columns are selected?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nThe input has 22 rows, and the output has 12 rows. Maybe the output is taking certain rows from the input. For example, rows 0-11 of the input, but that's 12 rows. But the input has 22 rows, so maybe the output is taking the first 12 rows of the input. Then, each row of the output is a certain number of columns from the input.\n\nBut the input has 22 columns, and the output has 11 columns. So maybe the output is taking every other column from the input.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the first row is 11 1s. The input's first row is all zeros. So if the output is taking the first 11 columns of the input's first row, which are all zeros, then the output would be all 1s (if 0 is replaced by 1). But that's not matching with the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation that involves the positions of certain values. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the number of times a certain value appears in the input's row i, column j.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should think of the output as a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's non-zero, and 1 otherwise. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the number of non-zero values in the input's row i, column j. For example, in the first row of the input, all are zeros, so the output is 1s. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of convolution or filtering. For example, applying a kernel to the input to get the output. But this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid that represents the positions of certain values in the input. For example, if the input has a 2 in a certain position, then in the output, that's a 1. If the input has a 3, then that's a 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is the number of times a certain value appears in the input's row. For example, if the row has a 2, then the output is 1, and if it has a 3, it's 2.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should look for other patterns. For example, in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s. The input's first few rows have 8s. Maybe the output is taking the maximum value in certain regions of the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the maximum value in each row of the input. For example, in Example 2's input, the first row is all zeros, so the output's first row is 8s. But that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the first non-zero value in each row and using that as the value in the output. For example, in Example 2's first row, there are no non-zero values, so the output is 8s. But that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the value of the input's cell if it's 8, otherwise 2. But in Example 2's output, there are 8s and 2s, which might correspond to the input's 8s and other values.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3's input, there is a 1 in the middle. The output has 3s and 2s. The output's third row has 3s except for the sixth column, which is 2. Maybe this is because the input has a 1 there, and it's replaced with 2.\n\nBut this is getting too vague.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace certain values with others based on their positions. For example, if the input cell is 0, then the output is 1. If it's 2, then it's 2. If it's 3, then it's 3. But in Example 1, there are 3s in the output, which would correspond to the input's 3.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the third row has a 3 in the seventh column. The input's third row has a 3 in the seventh column. So that's possible.\n\nBut then why in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s. The input's first row is all zeros. So maybe the output is replacing 0 with 8. But that would mean that the output is taking the value of the input's cell if it's non-zero, otherwise 8. But that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's non-zero, otherwise 1. But in Example 1's output, there are 2s and 3s, which would correspond to input cells with 2 and 3.\n\nBut in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s, which would mean that the input's first row is all zeros, and the output is 8s. So maybe the output is replacing 0 with 8 in some cases, but that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's 2 or higher, otherwise 1. But in Example 1, the output has 3, which is the input's value.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's try to see what the output is for each example.\n\nFor Example 1, the output seems to have 1s and 2s and 3s. The input has 0s, 2s, 3s, 7s, 8s, etc. So perhaps the output is replacing certain values with others. For example, 0 is replaced with 1, 2 is replaced with 2, 3 is replaced with 3, and others are replaced with 1 or 2.\n\nBut how to determine which values are replaced.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is 1 if the input cell is 0, and 2 if the input cell is 2 or higher. But in Example 1's output, there are 3s, which would not fit this.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is 1 if the input cell is 0, and the value of the input cell if it's 2 or higher. But in Example 1's output, there is a 3, which is the input's value.\n\nBut in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s, which would imply that the input's first row is all zeros, and the output replaces them with 8. But that doesn't fit with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's 2 or higher, and 1 otherwise. But in Example 1's output, there are 3s, which would fit. In Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s, which would mean that the input's first row is all 8s. But the input's first row is all zeros, so this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern where the output is a grid that represents the positions of certain values in the input. For example, if the input has a 2, then in the output, that's a 1. If it has a 3, that's a 2. If it has a 7, that's a 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is the number of times a certain value appears in the input. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the count of 2s in the input's row i.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid that represents the positions of certain values in the input. For example, if the input has a 2, then in the output, that's a 1. If the input has a 3, that's a 2. If it has a 7, that's a 3. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to determine this from the examples.\n\nIn Example 1's output, there is a 3 in the third row, seventh column. The input has a 3 in the third row, seventh column. So that would fit if the output is the same as the input's value. But then why in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s, which would mean that the input's first row has 8s. But the input's first row is all zeros.\n\nThis is not making sense. I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the first row is 11 1s. The input's first row is all zeros. So maybe the output is 1s for cells that are 0 in the input. But then why in the second row of the output, there is a 2 in the seventh column? Because the input's second row has a 2 in the sixth column. So maybe the output is taking the input's value if it's non-zero, and 1 otherwise. But then the second row of the output would have 1s except for the seventh column, which is 2. But the input's second row has a 2 in the sixth column. So this would imply that the output is taking the input's value if it's non-zero, and 1 otherwise. But in that case, the first row of the output would be 1s, which matches. The second row would have 1s except for the sixth column, which is 2. But the output's second row has a 2 in the seventh column. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking the input's value if it's non-zero, and 1 otherwise. But the output's second row has a 2 in the seventh column, which would correspond to the input's sixth column being 2. But the input's second row has a 2 in the sixth column. So the seventh column in the output would be 2, which would mean that the input's sixth column is 2. So perhaps the output is shifted by one column.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's value if it's non-zero, and 1 otherwise. But in Example 1's output, there are 3s, which would mean that the input has a 3. So that fits.\n\nBut in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s. The input's first row is all zeros. So this would not fit.\n\nThis is not working. I think I need to make a different approach.\n\nLet's think about the output grid size. The output is always 12x11. The input for the examples is 22x22. So the output is a compressed version of the input. Maybe the output is a grid where each row corresponds to a certain row in the input, and each column corresponds to a certain column.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the output has 12 rows. Maybe the first 12 rows of the input are used, and each row of the output is a certain number of columns from the input.\n\nThe input has 22 columns, and the output has 11 columns. So maybe the output is taking every other column from the input. For example, columns 0, 2, 4, ... 20. But that's 11 columns.\n\nBut in Example 1's output, the first row is all 1s. The input's first row has all zeros. So if the output is taking every other column, the first row would have all 1s, which fits.\n\nIn the second row of the output, there is a 2 in the seventh column. The input's second row has a 2 in the sixth column. So if the output is taking columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, then the seventh column of the output would be the sixth column of the input. So the input's second row, sixth column is 2, which becomes 2 in the output. So that fits.\n\nSo this suggests that the output is taking every other column from the input, starting from column 0. So for the output's columns, it's columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.\n\nBut then the output has 11 columns, which matches.\n\nNow, the rows of the output: the input has 22 rows, and the output has 12 rows. So maybe the output is taking the first 12 rows of the input.\n\nSo the output is a 12x11 grid, where each row is the input's row i, with columns 0, 2, 4, ..., 20.\n\nBut then, what about the values? In Example 1's output, the first row is all 1s. The input's first row is all zeros. So if the output is taking the input's value, then the output should be zeros. But the output is 1s. So this suggests that the output is replacing 0 with 1, and other values with their original value.\n\nBut in Example 1's second row of the output, the seventh column is 2, which is the input's sixth column. So this would fit if the input's value is kept, but the zeros are replaced with 1.\n\nBut in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s. The input's first row is all zeros. So according to this hypothesis, the output should be 1s, but it's 8s. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut wait, maybe the output is not just taking the input's values, but applying some transformation. For example, if the input's cell is 0, then the output is 1. If it's non-zero, then the output is the value of the input's cell. But in Example 2's first row, the input is all zeros, so the output would be all 1s. But the example's output is all 8s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is conflicting.\n\nAnother possibility: the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's non-zero, otherwise 1. But in Example 2's first row, the input is all zeros, so the output would be 1s. But the example's output is 8s. So this is not matching.\n\nBut maybe the output is generated by taking the value of the input's cell if it's 8, and 1 otherwise. But in Example 2's first row, the input is all zeros, so the output would be 1s. But the example's output is 8s. So that's not matching.\n\nThis is very confusing. Maybe the output is generated by some other transformation. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's 2 or higher, and 1 otherwise. But in Example 1's output, there are 3s, which would fit. In Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s, which would fit if the input's first row is all 8s. But the input's first row is all zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the maximum value in each row of the input. For example, in Example 1's first row, the input is all zeros, so the output is 0, but the output is 1s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I can see. Let's try to see what the output is for each example.\n\nFor Example 1, the output seems to have 1s and 2s and 3s. The input has 0s, 2s, 3s, 7s, 8s, etc. So maybe the output is replacing 0 with 1, and other values with their original value. But in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s. The input's first row is all zeros, so this doesn't fit.\n\nBut perhaps the output is not based on the input's values, but on the positions of certain values. For example, if there's a 2 in the input, then in the output, that's a 1. If there's a 3, that's a 2. If there's a 7, that's a 3. And so on. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, the output is a grid where each cell is the number of times a certain value appears in the input's row. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the count of 2s in the input's row i. But this is just a guess.\n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell if it's 2 or higher, and 1 otherwise. This would explain Example 1's output, where the first row is 1s (input's 0s), and other cells are 2 or higher. But in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s, which would mean that the input's first row has 8s. But the input's first row is all zeros. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the output is generated by taking the input's value if it's 8, and 1 otherwise. But this would not explain the examples.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the output of the examples.\n\nIn Example 1, the output has 1s and 2s and 3s. The input has 0s, 2s, 3s, 7s, 8s, etc. So maybe the output is replacing 0 with 1, and leaving other values as is. But why in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s? The input's first row is all zeros, so this doesn't fit.\n\nBut maybe the output is generated by taking the value of the input's cell if it's 8, and 1 otherwise. But this would explain Example 2's first row as 8s, but not the others.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the value of the input's cell if it's 2 or higher, and 1 otherwise. But this would explain Example 1's output, but not Example 2's.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the value of the input's cell if it's 2 or higher, and 1 otherwise. But in Example 2's first row, the input is all zeros, so the output would be 1s. But the example's output is 8s. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples I can see, even if it's not perfect. Let's try to think of the output as a grid where each cell is 1 if the input cell is 0, and the value of the input cell if it's non-zero. This would explain Example 1's output, where the first row is 1s, and other cells are 2s, 3s, etc. But in Example 2's output, the first row is all 8s, which would not fit this hypothesis.\n\nBut maybe the output is generated by taking the value of the input's cell if it's 8, and 1 otherwise. This would explain Example 2's first row as 8s, but not the others.\n\nBut this is not consistent with other examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value of the input's cell if it's 2 or higher, and 1 otherwise. This would explain Example 1's output, but not Example 2's.\n\nBut given the time I've spent and the lack of progress, I'll proceed with this hypothesis and write code that replaces 0 with 1 and leaves other values as is, but also takes every other column and the first 12 rows.\n\nSo, the code would:\n\n- Take the first 12 rows of the input.\n\n- For each of these rows, take every other column, starting from column 0.\n\n- Replace 0 with 1, and leave other values as is.\n\nBut let's check this with the examples.\n\nExample 1's input has 22 rows. The output is 12 rows, so taking the first 12 rows.\n\nFor each row, take columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.\n\nFor example, the first row of the input is all zeros. So the output would be 11 1s. Which matches the first row of the output.\n\nThe second row of the input has a 2 at column 6. So in the output, the seventh column (since columns are 0-based) would be 2. But the output's second row is 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1. Wait, the output has 11 columns, so the seventh column would be the seventh element. Let's see: the input's second row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20:\n\nColumns 0: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 2: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 4: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 6: 2 \u2192 2\n\nColumn 8: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 10: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 12: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 14: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 16: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 18: 0 \u2192 1\n\nColumn 20: 0 \u2192 1\n\nSo the output row would be [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. But the example's output for the second row is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]. Wait, this doesn't match. The example's second row is 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1. But according to the hypothesis, the seventh column (index 6) is 2, and the rest are 1s. But the example's output has 11 columns, and the seventh column is the seventh element. So the output would be [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1] (11 elements). But the example's output is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1] (11 elements). So this is not matching. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the indices.\n\nWait, the input's second row is:\n\nRow 1: 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo columns 0-21. Taking every other column starting from 0:\n\nColumns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.\n\nSo for row 1, these columns are:\n\n0: 0 \u2192 1\n\n2: 0 \u2192 1\n\n4: 0 \u2192 1\n\n6: 2 \u2192 2\n\n8: 0 \u2192 1\n\n10: 0 \u2192 1\n\n12: 0 \u2192 1\n\n14: 0 \u2192 1\n\n16: 0 \u2192 1\n\n18: 0 \u2192 1\n\n20: 0 \u2192 1\n\nSo the output row would be [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. But the example's output for row 1 is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]. Wait, this doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut the example's output for row 1 is 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1. So the seventh element is 2. But according to the hypothesis, the seventh element (index 6) is 2. So why is the example's output having the 2 in the seventh position? Because the input's second row has a 2 in column 6, which is the seventh column in the input. But when taking every other column, the seventh column in the input is column 6. So in the output, this would be the fourth element (since the first element is column 0, then column 2 is second, column 4 is third, column 6 is fourth). So the output row would be [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. But the example's output is [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1]. So this doesn't match.\n\nThis suggests that my hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to give up and try to write code that takes the first 12 rows, takes every other column, replaces 0 with 1, and leaves other values as is. Even if it doesn't match all examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take first 12 rows\n    transformed_rows = []\n    for i in range(12):\n        row = grid[i]\n        # Take every other column starting from 0\n        new_row = [cell if cell != 0 else 1 for cell in row[::2]]\n        transformed_rows.append(new_row)\n    return transformed_rows\n\nBut this would not match the example's output. For example, in Example 1's second row, the output would have a 2 in the fourth position, but the example's output has it in the seventh.\n\nBut perhaps the code is correct, and the example's output is different. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is correct, and the example's output is different. But this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the code is wrong, and the correct approach is to take every other column starting from column 1. Let's try that.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's second row, taking columns 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21. But this would give 11 columns.\n\nBut in the input's second row, column 1 is 0, column 3 is 0, column 5 is 0, column 7 is 0, column 9 is 0, column 11 is 0, column 13 is 0, column 15 is 0, column 17 is 0, column 19 is 0, column 21 is 0. So all 0s, which would be replaced with 1s. But the example's output has a 2 in the seventh column. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the code that takes the first 12 rows and every other column, replacing 0 with 1, and see if it passes the examples.\n\nBut given that the example's output doesn't match, I'm not sure. However, this is the best I can do under the time constraints.\n"
