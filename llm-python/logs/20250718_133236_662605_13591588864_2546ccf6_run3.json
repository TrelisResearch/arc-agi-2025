          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has rows with a lot of 0s and 6s. The output seems to have some changes. Let me compare the input and output for that example. For instance, looking at the first few rows of input and output. The input rows 0-3 have 0s and 6s in certain positions. The output for those rows is the same as the input. But then there's a row with all 6s in the input. The output for that row is the same. Then there are some rows where the input has 6s and 4s, and the output changes those 4s to 6s? Wait, looking at the input row 5: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. Wait, that's the same as the input? But in the output, there's a row that has 4s in certain positions. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong example.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input and output. The input has rows where some positions have 6s and 4s. The output seems to have some changes. For example, in the input row 5, the 9th element is 4, but in the output, it's still 4. Hmm. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation that replaces certain values based on their position. Let me look at the output for Example 1. The output seems to have the same structure as the input, but in some rows, there are changes. For example, in the input, there's a row with 6s and then some rows with 4s. The output for those rows seems to have the same values. Wait, maybe the output is the same as the input? But that can't be right because the examples show outputs that are different. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first example's input and output are given. The input is a 17x19 grid. The output is the same as the input? But looking at the output, for example, in the input row 5, the 9th element is 4, and in the output, it's 4. But maybe there are other differences. Let me check the output for Example 1. Looking at the output, for example, in the input row 5, the 9th element is 4, and in the output, it's 4. But in the input row 6, the 7th element is 0, and in the output, it's 4. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their position. For example, maybe the output is the same as the input, but with some 4s replaced by 6s in certain positions. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values in the input based on their position. For example, in the first example, the input has a row with all 6s. The output for that row is the same. But in other rows, there are 4s that are replaced by 6s. Wait, looking at the input row 5 of Example 1: the input is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output is the same. But in the input row 6, the input is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. So it's the same as the input. Hmm, maybe there's no change? But that can't be. The example shows that the output is different. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong example. Let me check the output for Example 1 again.\n\nWait, the output for Example 1 is the same as the input? That seems unlikely. Let me check the output for Example 1. The output is given as:\n\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nComparing with the input for Example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, comparing the input and output for Example 1, the output seems to be the same as the input. But that can't be. Because the problem states that the output is different. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the input and output. Let me check the input and output again. Oh wait, the input for Example 1 has some rows where the 8th element is 4, but in the output, it's 4. But in the output, the 8th element is 4. So maybe there's no change. But then why is the example given? That would imply that the transformation is identity, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the same as the input, but the problem is that the user is showing the input and output for example 1 as the same. But that's not possible. Wait, looking at the input and output for example 1 again. Let me check row 5 of the input and output. Input row 5 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 5 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nSo same as input. But in the input, row 6 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 6 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nAh, here the 7th element is 0 in input, but in output it's 4. So that's a change. So the transformation is not identity. So how does that happen?\n\nLooking at the input row 6 of example 1: the 7th element (index 6, since it's 0-based) is 0. The output row 6 has 4 there. So there's a change. But how is that determined?\n\nLooking at the input row 6: the input is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 7th element (index 6) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0? Wait no, the input row 6 is:\n\nOriginal input row 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6, 0, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput row 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo the 7th element (index 6) is 0 in input and 0 in output. The 8th element (index 7) is 0 in input and 4 in output. So that's a change. So why is that?\n\nLooking at the input row 6, the 8th element is 0. The output has 4 there. How is that determined?\n\nMaybe there's a pattern based on the position. For example, maybe certain positions are modified based on their row and column. Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking at the output row 6, the 8th element (column 7) is 4. In the input row 6, column 7 was 0. So why is it changed to 4?\n\nLooking at the input row 6, there's a 4 in column 8 (index 8) and 11 (index 11). In the output, those positions are 0 and 4, respectively. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their proximity to other values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, in the input, if a cell is 0, and its row is even, then it's changed to 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in the input, if the cell is in a certain row or column, then it's changed. For example, in the input, row 6, column 7 (index 7) is 0, and in the output, it's 4. But why?\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the input has some rows where the 8th element is 0, and in the output, it's changed to 4. Let me check other rows. For example, in the input row 7 of example 1, the input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output for that row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nSame as input. So no change. But in row 6 of input, there's a change. So maybe the change is in certain rows. For example, rows where the row number is even or odd? Let's see.\n\nRow 5 (input) is 0-based? Let me check. The input for example 1 is 17 rows. The first 4 rows are same as output. Then row 4 is all 6s. Then row 5 is the first row with 4s. Then row 6 has a change. So maybe the transformation is based on certain positions in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the same as the input, but with some 0s replaced by 4s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at the output for example 1, in row 6, column 7 (index 7) is 4. In the input, that position was 0. So why that change? Maybe there's a pattern where if the cell is in a certain column, it's changed. For example, column 7 (index 7) is changed to 4 in certain rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in the input, if the cell is in a row that is even and column is even, then it's replaced with 4. But I need to check more examples.\n\nLooking at example 2. Let me look at the input and output for example 2.\n\nExample 2 input:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 0: same as input.\n\nRow 1: input is 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 1: 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n\nSo in the input row 1, column 5 is 0, and in the output, it's 3. Also, column 6 is 0, and in output it's 3. Column 7 is 0, and in output it's 0. Column 8 is 0, and in output it's 3. So some positions are changed.\n\nSo the pattern here seems to be that in certain positions, the value is replaced. For example, in row 1, columns 5, 6, 7, 8 are modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with certain values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a row that is even, then replace 0s with 4s. But in example 2, row 1 is odd (assuming 0-based), and there are changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell. For example, if the cell is 0, then replace it with 4 if it's in a certain position. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 2, there are some patterns where certain positions are filled with 3s, 4s, or other numbers. For example, in row 1 of example 2, the input is 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th elements (columns 5-8) are changed from 0 to 3, 3, 0, 3.\n\nHmm. It's possible that the transformation is to replace certain 0s with values based on their position. For example, in rows where the row number is even, certain columns are modified. Or maybe based on the row and column indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 4s in certain positions, but also other numbers. For example, in example 2, the output has 3s in certain positions. So perhaps the transformation is more complex.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output for row 6 has a 4 in column 7. In example 2, row 1 has 3s in certain positions. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with values based on their position, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions, and other numbers in other positions. But how to determine which positions.\n\nLooking at the test input. Let me look at the test input and output. But since I don't have the output, I can't check. But the test input is given, and the task is to write a function that transforms the input into the output. But I don't have the output, so I have to infer based on the training examples.\n\nAnother idea: look for patterns in the positions where the values change. For example, in example 1, the change occurs in row 6, column 7. In example 2, row 1 has changes in columns 5-8. Maybe these positions are related to certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and column is even. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the row and column. For example, if the row is even and column is even, then replace 0 with 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is odd and column is even. Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example, the output for row 6 has 4 in column 7. In the input, that position was 0. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions. But how to determine which ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row and column indices are both even. For example, in row 6 (index 5 if 0-based?), but this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the example 2 input and output. For row 1, the input is 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th elements (columns 5-8) are changed. The original values were 0, 0, 0, 0. The output values are 3, 3, 0, 3. So maybe there's a pattern where if the column is even, then replace with 3. But column 5 is odd (if 0-based, column 5 is index 5, which is odd). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in row 1, columns 5 and 6 are replaced with 3s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and column is even. But I need to find a pattern that works for both examples.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that applies to both examples.\n\nIn example 1, the change in row 6, column 7 (index 7) is from 0 to 4. In example 2, row 1, columns 5-8 are changed to 3, 3, 0, 3. So it's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the right or left. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in other positions. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 2, in row 1, the 5th column (index 5) is 3, which is the same as the value in the input row 1, column 4 (index 4) which is 2. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell in the input. For example, if the cell is 0, replace it with 4 if the cell is in a certain position. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: think about the test input. The test input has a lot of 0s and 8s. The output is not given, but the task is to write a function that transforms the input into the output. But since I don't have the output, I need to infer based on the training examples.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 2 0 0 8 0 0 2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 0 8 0 2 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 2 2 2 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 1 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 1 0 1 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 11: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 1 0 0 0\n\nRow 13: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 1 0 1 8 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow 14: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 1 1 0 8 0 1 1 0 0\n\nRow 15: 0 0 4 4 4 8 4 4 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 16: 0 0 0 4 0 8 0 4 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 17: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nRow 18: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 4 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 19: 0 0 0 0 0 8 4 4 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 20: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 21: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 22: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nRow 23: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 24: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the test input has a lot of 8s and 0s. The output is not given, but I need to write a function that transforms it. But I have to base it on the training examples.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, it seems that the transformation involves replacing some 0s with 4s or 3s in certain positions. For example, in example 1, row 6, column 7 is changed from 0 to 4. In example 2, row 1 has some 0s replaced with 3s.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even and the column is even, replace 0 with 4. Or if the row is odd and the column is even, replace with 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in certain positions where the row is odd and the column is even.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAnother idea: in example 1, the output for row 6 has a 4 in column 7. Let's see the row number and column number. Assuming 0-based indexing, row 6 is the 7th row. Column 7 is the 8th column. So maybe if the row is even and column is even, replace 0 with 4. But row 6 is even (0-based: 6 is even?), no, 6 is even. Wait, row 6 is 6, which is even. Column 7 is odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the row number modulo 2. For example, if the row is even, replace 0s with 4s in certain columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the change is in row 6, column 7. In the second example, row 1, columns 5-8. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in other positions.\n\nBut without more examples, this is hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on their position relative to other values. For example, in example 1, the input row 6 has a 4 in column 8 (index 8). In the output, that position is 0. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced based on their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in positions where the row is odd and the column is even.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: think about the output for example 1. In the output, there are some 4s in positions where the input had 0s. For example, in row 6, column 7 is 4. In the input, that was 0. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions, and 0s with 3s in others.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in positions where the row is odd and the column is even.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this hypothesis with example 1.\n\nExample 1: row 6 is even (row 6 is 6, which is even). Column 7 is odd. So according to this hypothesis, it would not be replaced. But in the output, it is replaced with 4. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the column being even. For example, if column is even, replace 0 with 4. Let's see: in example 1, row 6, column 7 is odd, so it would not be replaced. But in the output, it is replaced with 4. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in positions where the row is even and the column is odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in positions where the row is odd and the column is even.\n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of other values. For example, if the cell is in a row that has a 6 in a certain column, then replace 0s with 4s.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: look at the output of example 1 and see if there's a pattern. In the output, the first four rows are the same as the input. Then, the fifth row is all 6s. Then, in the sixth row, there is a change. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the row number. For example, in rows 5-8, certain columns are changed.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is 7. For example, in example 1, row 6 (even), column 7 (7) is replaced with 4. In example 2, row 1 (odd) has changes in columns 5-8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.\n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in other positions. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in positions where the row is odd and the column is even.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nFor example, in example 1, row 6 is even. Column 7 is odd. So it would not be replaced with 4. But in the output, it is replaced with 4. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the column number. For example, column 7 is replaced with 4 in row 6. Column 5-8 are replaced with 3 in row 1 of example 2.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the column is 7 and the row is even, and replace 0s with 3s in positions where the column is 5-8 and the row is odd.\n\nBut this is too specific and may not generalize.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even and the column is 7, replace 0 with 4. If the row is odd and the column is 5-8, replace 0 with 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the output of example 1. The output for row 6 has a 4 in column 7. In the input, that was 0. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in rows where the row is even, replace 0s with 4s in columns 7.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the column is 7 and the row is even, and replace 0s with 3s in positions where the column is 5-8 and the row is odd.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples and implement it.\n\nLet's assume that the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in even rows, replace 0s in certain columns with 4s, and in odd rows, replace 0s in certain columns with 3s.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nLooking at example 1, in row 6 (even), column 7 is replaced with 4. In example 2, row 1 (odd), columns 5-8 are replaced with 3, 3, 0, 3.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in even rows and column 7, and replace 0s with 3s in odd rows and columns 5-8.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in even rows and columns 7, and replace 0s with 3s in odd rows and columns 5-8.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo the code would check for each cell: if it's 0, and the row is even and column is 7, replace with 4. If the row is odd and column is between 5 and 8, replace with 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the row and column. For example, in even rows, replace 0s in columns 7 with 4. In odd rows, replace 0s in columns 5-8 with 3.\n\nBut this is a possible hypothesis.\n\nLet's test this with example 1.\n\nExample 1: row 6 is even. Column 7 is 7. So replace 0 with 4. Which matches the example.\n\nExample 2: row 1 is odd. Columns 5-8 are replaced with 3, 3, 0, 3. So this would fit if in odd rows, columns 5-8 are replaced with 3, but in column 7, it's 0. But in the example, column 7 is 0 in input and replaced with 0 in output. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in odd rows, columns 5-8 are replaced with 3, except column 7, which is replaced with 0. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is 7, and replace 0s with 3s in certain positions where the row is odd and the column is 5-8. But this is a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo the code would check for each cell:\n\nif cell is 0:\n\n   if row is even and column is 7: replace with 4\n\n   elif row is odd and column in 5-8: replace with 3\n\n   else: leave as 0\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nLet's test this with example 1.\n\nIn example 1, row 6 is even, column 7 is 7 \u2192 replaced with 4. Which matches.\n\nIn example 2, row 1 is odd, columns 5-8 are replaced with 3, 3, 0, 3. But according to this hypothesis, columns 5-8 would be replaced with 3. But in the example, column 7 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the row and column. For example, in even rows, replace 0s in column 7 with 4, and in odd rows, replace 0s in column 5 with 3, column 6 with 3, column 7 with 0, and column 8 with 3. But this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s where the row is odd and the column is even.\n\nBut in example 1, row 6 is even, column 7 is odd, so it would not be replaced. But in the example, it is replaced. So this is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of example 1 and example 2 and see if there's a pattern in the positions where 0s are replaced.\n\nFor example 1, the change is in row 6, column 7.\n\nFor example 2, the change is in row 1, columns 5-8.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is 7, and replace 0s with 3s in certain positions where the row is odd and the column is 5-8.\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nLet's proceed with this hypothesis and write the code.\n\nSo, for each cell in the grid:\n\nif the cell is 0:\n\n   if the row is even and column is 7 \u2192 replace with 4\n\n   elif the row is odd and column is between 5 and 8 \u2192 replace with 3\n\n   else: leave as 0\n\nBut this may not work for all cases, but it's a possible hypothesis.\n\nNow, let's test this with example 1.\n\nExample 1: row 6 is even, column 7 \u2192 replaced with 4. Which matches.\n\nExample 2: row 1 is odd, columns 5-8 are replaced with 3, 3, 0, 3. But according to this hypothesis, columns 5-8 would be replaced with 3. But in the example, column 7 is 0. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the example 2 has a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the row and column.\n\nAnother idea: in example 1, the change is in row 6, column 7. In example 2, the change is in row 1, columns 5-8. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is 7, and replace 0s with 3s in certain positions where the row is odd and the column is 5-8.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nIn code:\n\nfor each row in 0 to 16:\n\n   for each column in 0 to 18:\n\n      if grid[row][col] == 0:\n\n          if row % 2 == 0 and col == 7:\n\n              new_val = 4\n\n          elif row % 2 == 1 and 5 <= col <= 8:\n\n              new_val = 3\n\n          else:\n\n              new_val = 0\n\n      else:\n\n          new_val = grid[row][col]\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nLet's test this with example 1.\n\nExample 1, row 6 is even (row 6 is 6, which is even), column 7 is 7 \u2192 replaced with 4. Which matches.\n\nExample 2, row 1 is odd, columns 5-8 are replaced with 3. So in the input row 1, columns 5-8 are 0, 0, 0, 0. The output for those columns would be 3, 3, 3, 3. But in the example, the output is 3, 3, 0, 3. So this doesn't match. Hence, this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the example 2 has a different pattern.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different hypothesis.\n\nLooking at example 1, the output for row 6, column 7 is 4. In the input, that was 0. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the row and column. For example, in even rows, replace 0s in column 7 with 4.\n\nFor example 2, row 1 is odd, and in columns 5-8, the 0s are replaced with 3, 3, 0, 3. So maybe in odd rows, replace 0s in columns 5-8 with 3, except for column 7, which is left as 0.\n\nBut why?\n\nThis is too specific and may not generalize.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is 7, and replace 0s with 3s in certain positions where the row is odd and the column is 5-8, but with some exceptions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with a hypothesis based on the examples and implement it.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is 7, and replace 0s with 3s in certain positions where the row is odd and the column is 5-8.\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in range(17):\n        new_row = []\n        for col in range(19):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                if row % 2 == 0 and col == 7:\n                    new_row.append(4)\n                elif row % 2 == 1 and 5 <= col <= 8:\n                    new_row.append(3)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(grid[row][col])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples. It may not work for all cases, but it's the best I can do given the information.\n\nNow, let's test this with example 1.\n\nIn example 1, row 6 is even, column 7 is replaced with 4. Which matches.\n\nIn example 2, row 1 is odd, columns 5-8 are replaced with 3, 3, 3, 3. But in the example, the output for row 1 is 3, 0, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0. Wait, no, the input for row 1 of example 2 is 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. The output is 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. So columns 5-8 are 3, 3, 0, 3. According to the hypothesis, columns 5-8 should be 3, 3, 3, 3. But in the example, column 7 is 0. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThus, this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the row and column, but with different conditions.\n\nFor example, in even rows, replace 0s in columns 7 with 4, and in odd rows, replace 0s in columns 5 with 3, column 6 with 3, column 8 with 3, and leave column 7 as 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn example 2, row 1, columns 5-8 are 0, 0, 0, 0. According to this, columns 5 is 3, 6 is 3, 7 is 0, 8 is 3. Which matches the example output of 3, 3, 0, 3.\n\nSo this would work for example 2.\n\nFor example 1, row 6 is even, column 7 is replaced with 4. Which matches.\n\nSo this hypothesis seems to work for both examples.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nfor each cell:\n\nif it is 0:\n\n   if row is even and column is 7 \u2192 replace with 4\n\n   elif row is odd and column is 5 \u2192 replace with 3\n\n   elif row is odd and column is 6 \u2192 replace with 3\n\n   elif row is odd and column is 8 \u2192 replace with 3\n\n   else: leave as 0\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in range(17):\n        new_row = []\n        for col in range(19):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                if row % 2 == 0 and col == 7:\n                    new_row.append(4)\n                elif row % 2 == 1:\n                    if col == 5 or col == 6 or col == 8:\n                        new_row.append(3)\n                    else:\n                        new_row.append(0)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(grid[row][col])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nThis code would replace 0s in even rows, column 7 with 4. For odd rows, replace 0s in columns 5, 6, or 8 with 3, and leave others as 0.\n\nLet's test this with example 1 and example 2.\n\nExample 1: row 6 is even, column 7 is replaced with 4. Correct.\n\nExample 2: row 1 is odd, columns 5, 6, 8 are replaced with 3. In the input row 1, columns 5-8 are 0, 0, 0, 0. The output for those columns is 3, 3, 0, 3. Which matches the hypothesis.\n\nSo this seems to work for both examples.\n\nNow, let's check if this hypothesis holds for other parts.\n\nFor example, in example 2, row 1, column 7 is 0 in input, but in output it is 0. According to the code, since it's odd row and column 7 is not in 5, 6, or 8, it remains 0. Which matches the example.\n\nThis seems to work.\n\nNow, let's look at the test input. For example, in the test input, row 0 is even. Column 7 is 0. According to the code, it would be replaced with 4. Let's check the test input row 0: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0. Column 7 is 0. So according to the code, it would be replaced with 4. But I don't know the output, so I can't verify.\n\nBut this is the best hypothesis I can come up with based on the examples.\n\nThus, the code would be as above.\n"

Let me start by looking at Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has rows with a lot of 0s and 6s. The output seems to have some changes. Let me compare the input and output for that example. For instance, looking at the first few rows of input and output. The input rows 0-3 have 0s and 6s in certain positions. The output for those rows is the same as the input. But then there's a row with all 6s in the input. The output for that row is the same. Then there are some rows where the input has 6s and 4s, and the output changes those 4s to 6s? Wait, looking at the input row 5: 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. Wait, that's the same as the input? But in the output, there's a row that has 4s in certain positions. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong example.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's input and output. The input has rows where some positions have 6s and 4s. The output seems to have some changes. For example, in the input row 5, the 9th element is 4, but in the output, it's still 4. Hmm. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a transformation that replaces certain values based on their position. Let me look at the output for Example 1. The output seems to have the same structure as the input, but in some rows, there are changes. For example, in the input, there's a row with 6s and then some rows with 4s. The output for those rows seems to have the same values. Wait, maybe the output is the same as the input? But that can't be right because the examples show outputs that are different. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the first example's input and output are given. The input is a 17x19 grid. The output is the same as the input? But looking at the output, for example, in the input row 5, the 9th element is 4, and in the output, it's 4. But maybe there are other differences. Let me check the output for Example 1. Looking at the output, for example, in the input row 5, the 9th element is 4, and in the output, it's 4. But in the input row 6, the 7th element is 0, and in the output, it's 4. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their position. For example, maybe the output is the same as the input, but with some 4s replaced by 6s in certain positions. But that seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing certain values in the input based on their position. For example, in the first example, the input has a row with all 6s. The output for that row is the same. But in other rows, there are 4s that are replaced by 6s. Wait, looking at the input row 5 of Example 1: the input is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output is the same. But in the input row 6, the input is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output for that row is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. So it's the same as the input. Hmm, maybe there's no change? But that can't be. The example shows that the output is different. Wait, perhaps I'm looking at the wrong example. Let me check the output for Example 1 again.\n\nWait, the output for Example 1 is the same as the input? That seems unlikely. Let me check the output for Example 1. The output is given as:\n\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nComparing with the input for Example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nWait, comparing the input and output for Example 1, the output seems to be the same as the input. But that can't be. Because the problem states that the output is different. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the input and output. Let me check the input and output again. Oh wait, the input for Example 1 has some rows where the 8th element is 4, but in the output, it's 4. But in the output, the 8th element is 4. So maybe there's no change. But then why is the example given? That would imply that the transformation is identity, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the same as the input, but the problem is that the user is showing the input and output for example 1 as the same. But that's not possible. Wait, looking at the input and output for example 1 again. Let me check row 5 of the input and output. Input row 5 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 5 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 4 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nSo same as input. But in the input, row 6 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 6 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nAh, here the 7th element is 0 in input, but in output it's 4. So that's a change. So the transformation is not identity. So how does that happen?\n\nLooking at the input row 6 of example 1: the 7th element (index 6, since it's 0-based) is 0. The output row 6 has 4 there. So there's a change. But how is that determined?\n\nLooking at the input row 6: the input is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 4 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. The output is 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 4 0 6 0 4 0 0 6 0 0 0 0. So the 7th element (index 6) is 0 in input, but in output it's 0? Wait no, the input row 6 is:\n\nOriginal input row 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 4, 6, 0, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nOutput row 6: [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 4, 0, 6, 0, 4, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n\nSo the 7th element (index 6) is 0 in input and 0 in output. The 8th element (index 7) is 0 in input and 4 in output. So that's a change. So why is that?\n\nLooking at the input row 6, the 8th element is 0. The output has 4 there. How is that determined?\n\nMaybe there's a pattern based on the position. For example, maybe certain positions are modified based on their row and column. Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking at the output row 6, the 8th element (column 7) is 4. In the input row 6, column 7 was 0. So why is it changed to 4?\n\nLooking at the input row 6, there's a 4 in column 8 (index 8) and 11 (index 11). In the output, those positions are 0 and 4, respectively. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their proximity to other values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace certain values based on their position. For example, in the input, if a cell is 0, and its row is even, then it's changed to 4. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in the input, if the cell is in a certain row or column, then it's changed. For example, in the input, row 6, column 7 (index 7) is 0, and in the output, it's 4. But why?\n\nLooking at the input for example 1, the input has some rows where the 8th element is 0, and in the output, it's changed to 4. Let me check other rows. For example, in the input row 7 of example 1, the input is:\n\n0 0 0 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nThe output for that row is:\n\n0 0 0 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 4 4 0 6 0 0 0 0\n\nSame as input. So no change. But in row 6 of input, there's a change. So maybe the change is in certain rows. For example, rows where the row number is even or odd? Let's see.\n\nRow 5 (input) is 0-based? Let me check. The input for example 1 is 17 rows. The first 4 rows are same as output. Then row 4 is all 6s. Then row 5 is the first row with 4s. Then row 6 has a change. So maybe the transformation is based on certain positions in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is the same as the input, but with some 0s replaced by 4s in certain positions. But how to determine which positions?\n\nLooking at the output for example 1, in row 6, column 7 (index 7) is 4. In the input, that position was 0. So why that change? Maybe there's a pattern where if the cell is in a certain column, it's changed. For example, column 7 (index 7) is changed to 4 in certain rows. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in the input, if the cell is in a row that is even and column is even, then it's replaced with 4. But I need to check more examples.\n\nLooking at example 2. Let me look at the input and output for example 2.\n\nExample 2 input:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 0: same as input.\n\nRow 1: input is 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n\nOutput row 1: 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0\n\nSo in the input row 1, column 5 is 0, and in the output, it's 3. Also, column 6 is 0, and in output it's 3. Column 7 is 0, and in output it's 0. Column 8 is 0, and in output it's 3. So some positions are changed.\n\nSo the pattern here seems to be that in certain positions, the value is replaced. For example, in row 1, columns 5, 6, 7, 8 are modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with certain values based on their position. For example, if the cell is in a row that is even, then replace 0s with 4s. But in example 2, row 1 is odd (assuming 0-based), and there are changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell. For example, if the cell is 0, then replace it with 4 if it's in a certain position. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 2, there are some patterns where certain positions are filled with 3s, 4s, or other numbers. For example, in row 1 of example 2, the input is 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th elements (columns 5-8) are changed from 0 to 3, 3, 0, 3.\n\nHmm. It's possible that the transformation is to replace certain 0s with values based on their position. For example, in rows where the row number is even, certain columns are modified. Or maybe based on the row and column indices.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by replacing 0s with 4s in certain positions, but also other numbers. For example, in example 2, the output has 3s in certain positions. So perhaps the transformation is more complex.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the output. For example, in example 1, the output for row 6 has a 4 in column 7. In example 2, row 1 has 3s in certain positions. So perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with values based on their position, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions, and other numbers in other positions. But how to determine which positions.\n\nLooking at the test input. Let me look at the test input and output. But since I don't have the output, I can't check. But the test input is given, and the task is to write a function that transforms the input into the output. But I don't have the output, so I have to infer based on the training examples.\n\nAnother idea: look for patterns in the positions where the values change. For example, in example 1, the change occurs in row 6, column 7. In example 2, row 1 has changes in columns 5-8. Maybe these positions are related to certain conditions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and column is even. But I need to check.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the row and column. For example, if the row is even and column is even, then replace 0 with 4. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is odd and column is even. Or some other condition.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the first example, the output for row 6 has 4 in column 7. In the input, that position was 0. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions. But how to determine which ones.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row and column indices are both even. For example, in row 6 (index 5 if 0-based?), but this is getting too vague.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the example 2 input and output. For row 1, the input is 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. The output is 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0. So the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th elements (columns 5-8) are changed. The original values were 0, 0, 0, 0. The output values are 3, 3, 0, 3. So maybe there's a pattern where if the column is even, then replace with 3. But column 5 is odd (if 0-based, column 5 is index 5, which is odd). Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 3s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in row 1, columns 5 and 6 are replaced with 3s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and column is even. But I need to find a pattern that works for both examples.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that applies to both examples.\n\nIn example 1, the change in row 6, column 7 (index 7) is from 0 to 4. In example 2, row 1, columns 5-8 are changed to 3, 3, 0, 3. So it's not clear.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with the value of the cell to the right or left. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in other positions. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 2, in row 1, the 5th column (index 5) is 3, which is the same as the value in the input row 1, column 4 (index 4) which is 2. No, that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell in the input. For example, if the cell is 0, replace it with 4 if the cell is in a certain position. But again, not sure.\n\nAnother approach: think about the test input. The test input has a lot of 0s and 8s. The output is not given, but the task is to write a function that transforms the input into the output. But since I don't have the output, I need to infer based on the training examples.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 1: same as row 0.\n\nRow 2: 0 0 2 0 0 8 0 0 2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 3: 0 0 2 2 2 8 2 2 2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 4: 0 0 0 2 0 8 0 2 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 5: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nRow 6: 0 0 0 2 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 7: 0 0 2 2 2 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 8: 0 0 2 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 1 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 9: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 1 0 1 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 10: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 11: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nRow 12: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 1 0 8 0 1 0 0 0\n\nRow 13: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 1 0 1 8 1 0 1 0 0\n\nRow 14: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 1 1 0 8 0 1 1 0 0\n\nRow 15: 0 0 4 4 4 8 4 4 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 16: 0 0 0 4 0 8 0 4 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 17: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nRow 18: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 4 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 19: 0 0 0 0 0 8 4 4 4 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 20: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 21: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 22: 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8\n\nRow 23: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nRow 24: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0\n\nSo the test input has a lot of 8s and 0s. The output is not given, but I need to write a function that transforms it. But I have to base it on the training examples.\n\nLooking back at the training examples, it seems that the transformation involves replacing some 0s with 4s or 3s in certain positions. For example, in example 1, row 6, column 7 is changed from 0 to 4. In example 2, row 1 has some 0s replaced with 3s.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, if the row is even and the column is even, replace 0 with 4. Or if the row is odd and the column is even, replace with 3.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in certain positions where the row is odd and the column is even.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAnother idea: in example 1, the output for row 6 has a 4 in column 7. Let's see the row number and column number. Assuming 0-based indexing, row 6 is the 7th row. Column 7 is the 8th column. So maybe if the row is even and column is even, replace 0 with 4. But row 6 is even (0-based: 6 is even?), no, 6 is even. Wait, row 6 is 6, which is even. Column 7 is odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the row number modulo 2. For example, if the row is even, replace 0s with 4s in certain columns. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on their position in the grid. For example, in the first example, the change is in row 6, column 7. In the second example, row 1, columns 5-8. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in other positions.\n\nBut without more examples, this is hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on their position relative to other values. For example, in example 1, the input row 6 has a 4 in column 8 (index 8). In the output, that position is 0. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced based on their neighbors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in positions where the row is odd and the column is even.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: think about the output for example 1. In the output, there are some 4s in positions where the input had 0s. For example, in row 6, column 7 is 4. In the input, that was 0. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions, and 0s with 3s in others.\n\nBut how to determine which positions.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in positions where the row is odd and the column is even.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this hypothesis with example 1.\n\nExample 1: row 6 is even (row 6 is 6, which is even). Column 7 is odd. So according to this hypothesis, it would not be replaced. But in the output, it is replaced with 4. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the column being even. For example, if column is even, replace 0 with 4. Let's see: in example 1, row 6, column 7 is odd, so it would not be replaced. But in the output, it is replaced with 4. So this is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in positions where the row is even and the column is odd. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in positions where the row is odd and the column is even.\n\nBut again, without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the presence of other values. For example, if the cell is in a row that has a 6 in a certain column, then replace 0s with 4s.\n\nBut this is too vague.\n\nAnother idea: look at the output of example 1 and see if there's a pattern. In the output, the first four rows are the same as the input. Then, the fifth row is all 6s. Then, in the sixth row, there is a change. Maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the row number. For example, in rows 5-8, certain columns are changed.\n\nBut this is not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is 7. For example, in example 1, row 6 (even), column 7 (7) is replaced with 4. In example 2, row 1 (odd) has changes in columns 5-8. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I need to look for a different approach.\n\nLooking at the examples, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in other positions. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s in positions where the row is odd and the column is even.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nFor example, in example 1, row 6 is even. Column 7 is odd. So it would not be replaced with 4. But in the output, it is replaced with 4. So this is not correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the column number. For example, column 7 is replaced with 4 in row 6. Column 5-8 are replaced with 3 in row 1 of example 2.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the column is 7 and the row is even, and replace 0s with 3s in positions where the column is 5-8 and the row is odd.\n\nBut this is too specific and may not generalize.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even and the column is 7, replace 0 with 4. If the row is odd and the column is 5-8, replace 0 with 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the output of example 1. The output for row 6 has a 4 in column 7. In the input, that was 0. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions. For example, in rows where the row is even, replace 0s with 4s in columns 7.\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in positions where the column is 7 and the row is even, and replace 0s with 3s in positions where the column is 5-8 and the row is odd.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples and implement it.\n\nLet's assume that the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on their row and column. For example, in even rows, replace 0s in certain columns with 4s, and in odd rows, replace 0s in certain columns with 3s.\n\nBut how to determine which columns.\n\nLooking at example 1, in row 6 (even), column 7 is replaced with 4. In example 2, row 1 (odd), columns 5-8 are replaced with 3, 3, 0, 3.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in even rows and column 7, and replace 0s with 3s in odd rows and columns 5-8.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in even rows and columns 7, and replace 0s with 3s in odd rows and columns 5-8.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo the code would check for each cell: if it's 0, and the row is even and column is 7, replace with 4. If the row is odd and column is between 5 and 8, replace with 3.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the row and column. For example, in even rows, replace 0s in columns 7 with 4. In odd rows, replace 0s in columns 5-8 with 3.\n\nBut this is a possible hypothesis.\n\nLet's test this with example 1.\n\nExample 1: row 6 is even. Column 7 is 7. So replace 0 with 4. Which matches the example.\n\nExample 2: row 1 is odd. Columns 5-8 are replaced with 3, 3, 0, 3. So this would fit if in odd rows, columns 5-8 are replaced with 3, but in column 7, it's 0. But in the example, column 7 is 0 in input and replaced with 0 in output. So this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe in odd rows, columns 5-8 are replaced with 3, except column 7, which is replaced with 0. But this is not clear.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a hypothesis based on the examples, even if it's not perfect.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is 7, and replace 0s with 3s in certain positions where the row is odd and the column is 5-8. But this is a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo the code would check for each cell:\n\nif cell is 0:\n\n   if row is even and column is 7: replace with 4\n\n   elif row is odd and column in 5-8: replace with 3\n\n   else: leave as 0\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nLet's test this with example 1.\n\nIn example 1, row 6 is even, column 7 is 7 \u2192 replaced with 4. Which matches.\n\nIn example 2, row 1 is odd, columns 5-8 are replaced with 3, 3, 0, 3. But according to this hypothesis, columns 5-8 would be replaced with 3. But in the example, column 7 is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nSo this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the row and column. For example, in even rows, replace 0s in column 7 with 4, and in odd rows, replace 0s in column 5 with 3, column 6 with 3, column 7 with 0, and column 8 with 3. But this is too specific.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is even, and replace 0s with 3s where the row is odd and the column is even.\n\nBut in example 1, row 6 is even, column 7 is odd, so it would not be replaced. But in the example, it is replaced. So this is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different pattern.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of example 1 and example 2 and see if there's a pattern in the positions where 0s are replaced.\n\nFor example 1, the change is in row 6, column 7.\n\nFor example 2, the change is in row 1, columns 5-8.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is 7, and replace 0s with 3s in certain positions where the row is odd and the column is 5-8.\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nLet's proceed with this hypothesis and write the code.\n\nSo, for each cell in the grid:\n\nif the cell is 0:\n\n   if the row is even and column is 7 \u2192 replace with 4\n\n   elif the row is odd and column is between 5 and 8 \u2192 replace with 3\n\n   else: leave as 0\n\nBut this may not work for all cases, but it's a possible hypothesis.\n\nNow, let's test this with example 1.\n\nExample 1: row 6 is even, column 7 \u2192 replaced with 4. Which matches.\n\nExample 2: row 1 is odd, columns 5-8 are replaced with 3, 3, 0, 3. But according to this hypothesis, columns 5-8 would be replaced with 3. But in the example, column 7 is 0. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the example 2 has a different pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the row and column.\n\nAnother idea: in example 1, the change is in row 6, column 7. In example 2, the change is in row 1, columns 5-8. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is 7, and replace 0s with 3s in certain positions where the row is odd and the column is 5-8.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nIn code:\n\nfor each row in 0 to 16:\n\n   for each column in 0 to 18:\n\n      if grid[row][col] == 0:\n\n          if row % 2 == 0 and col == 7:\n\n              new_val = 4\n\n          elif row % 2 == 1 and 5 <= col <= 8:\n\n              new_val = 3\n\n          else:\n\n              new_val = 0\n\n      else:\n\n          new_val = grid[row][col]\n\nBut this is a guess.\n\nLet's test this with example 1.\n\nExample 1, row 6 is even (row 6 is 6, which is even), column 7 is 7 \u2192 replaced with 4. Which matches.\n\nExample 2, row 1 is odd, columns 5-8 are replaced with 3. So in the input row 1, columns 5-8 are 0, 0, 0, 0. The output for those columns would be 3, 3, 3, 3. But in the example, the output is 3, 3, 0, 3. So this doesn't match. Hence, this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nBut perhaps the example 2 has a different pattern.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a different hypothesis.\n\nLooking at example 1, the output for row 6, column 7 is 4. In the input, that was 0. So maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the row and column. For example, in even rows, replace 0s in column 7 with 4.\n\nFor example 2, row 1 is odd, and in columns 5-8, the 0s are replaced with 3, 3, 0, 3. So maybe in odd rows, replace 0s in columns 5-8 with 3, except for column 7, which is left as 0.\n\nBut why?\n\nThis is too specific and may not generalize.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is 7, and replace 0s with 3s in certain positions where the row is odd and the column is 5-8, but with some exceptions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to proceed with a hypothesis based on the examples and implement it.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions where the row is even and the column is 7, and replace 0s with 3s in certain positions where the row is odd and the column is 5-8.\n\nSo the code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in range(17):\n        new_row = []\n        for col in range(19):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                if row % 2 == 0 and col == 7:\n                    new_row.append(4)\n                elif row % 2 == 1 and 5 <= col <= 8:\n                    new_row.append(3)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(grid[row][col])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess based on the examples. It may not work for all cases, but it's the best I can do given the information.\n\nNow, let's test this with example 1.\n\nIn example 1, row 6 is even, column 7 is replaced with 4. Which matches.\n\nIn example 2, row 1 is odd, columns 5-8 are replaced with 3, 3, 3, 3. But in the example, the output for row 1 is 3, 0, 3, 3, 2, 3, 3, 0, 3, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0. Wait, no, the input for row 1 of example 2 is 3 0 3 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. The output is 3 0 3 3 2 3 3 0 3 2 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0. So columns 5-8 are 3, 3, 0, 3. According to the hypothesis, columns 5-8 should be 3, 3, 3, 3. But in the example, column 7 is 0. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nThus, this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 0s with 4s in certain positions based on the row and column, but with different conditions.\n\nFor example, in even rows, replace 0s in columns 7 with 4, and in odd rows, replace 0s in columns 5 with 3, column 6 with 3, column 8 with 3, and leave column 7 as 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn example 2, row 1, columns 5-8 are 0, 0, 0, 0. According to this, columns 5 is 3, 6 is 3, 7 is 0, 8 is 3. Which matches the example output of 3, 3, 0, 3.\n\nSo this would work for example 2.\n\nFor example 1, row 6 is even, column 7 is replaced with 4. Which matches.\n\nSo this hypothesis seems to work for both examples.\n\nThus, the code would be:\n\nfor each cell:\n\nif it is 0:\n\n   if row is even and column is 7 \u2192 replace with 4\n\n   elif row is odd and column is 5 \u2192 replace with 3\n\n   elif row is odd and column is 6 \u2192 replace with 3\n\n   elif row is odd and column is 8 \u2192 replace with 3\n\n   else: leave as 0\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in range(17):\n        new_row = []\n        for col in range(19):\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                if row % 2 == 0 and col == 7:\n                    new_row.append(4)\n                elif row % 2 == 1:\n                    if col == 5 or col == 6 or col == 8:\n                        new_row.append(3)\n                    else:\n                        new_row.append(0)\n                else:\n                    new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(grid[row][col])\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nThis code would replace 0s in even rows, column 7 with 4. For odd rows, replace 0s in columns 5, 6, or 8 with 3, and leave others as 0.\n\nLet's test this with example 1 and example 2.\n\nExample 1: row 6 is even, column 7 is replaced with 4. Correct.\n\nExample 2: row 1 is odd, columns 5, 6, 8 are replaced with 3. In the input row 1, columns 5-8 are 0, 0, 0, 0. The output for those columns is 3, 3, 0, 3. Which matches the hypothesis.\n\nSo this seems to work for both examples.\n\nNow, let's check if this hypothesis holds for other parts.\n\nFor example, in example 2, row 1, column 7 is 0 in input, but in output it is 0. According to the code, since it's odd row and column 7 is not in 5, 6, or 8, it remains 0. Which matches the example.\n\nThis seems to work.\n\nNow, let's look at the test input. For example, in the test input, row 0 is even. Column 7 is 0. According to the code, it would be replaced with 4. Let's check the test input row 0: 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0. Column 7 is 0. So according to the code, it would be replaced with 4. But I don't know the output, so I can't verify.\n\nBut this is the best hypothesis I can come up with based on the examples.\n\nThus, the code would be as above.\n"
