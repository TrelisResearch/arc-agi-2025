From the examples, it seems that values of 8 are introduced in specific patterns, often in the middle of the grid.\n\nLooking at the examples, I notice that in Example 1, the value 8 appears in the 7th row (index 6) and 8th row (index 7) in the 7th column (index 6). In Example 2, 8s appear in the 6th row (index 5) and 7th row (index 6) in the 7th column (index 6). In Example 3, 8s appear in the 9th row (index 8) and 10th row (index 9) in the 7th column (index 6).\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain values with 8s in specific positions.\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values with 8s based on observed patterns\n    # These positions are based on observations from the training examples\n    # Replace values in the 7th column (index 6) of rows 6, 7, 8, 9\n    for i in range(6, 10):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            transformed_grid[i][6] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace certain values with 8s based on observed patterns\n    # These positions are based on observations from the training examples\n    # Replace values in the 7th column (index 6) of rows 6, 7, 8, 9\n    for i in range(6, 10):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            transformed_grid[i][6] = 8\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 2, there are 8s where the input had 0s in certain positions. In Example 3, there are 8s where the input had 0s in certain positions.\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves replacing certain 0s with 8s based on their position in the grid.\n\nHere's my best guess at the transformation pattern:\n- Replace 0s with 8s in certain positions that form specific patterns or shapes.\n\nBased on this, I'll write a Python function that implements this transformation.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
