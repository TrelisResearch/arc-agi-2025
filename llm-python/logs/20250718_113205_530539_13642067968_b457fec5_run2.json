The output grid seems to be a transformation where certain values are replaced or modified based on their position and value.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where values are \"spread out\" or \"extended\" in some way, particularly in the middle of the grid.\n3. Values like 1, 2, 3, 8 seem to be used as \"anchors\" or \"starting points\" for spreading other values.\n4. There's a pattern where certain values are replaced with other values in a specific pattern, especially in the middle of the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading values from certain positions to neighboring cells in a specific pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the pattern of spreading values\n    # This is a simplified version of the observed pattern\n    # We spread values from certain positions to neighboring cells\n    # This is a placeholder pattern that needs to be refined based on the examples\n    \n    # Example pattern: spread values from certain positions\n    # This is a simplified version and may need adjustment\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value to neighboring cells\n                # This is a simplified pattern and may need refinement\n                if i > 0 and grid_np[i-1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j] = grid_np[i][j]\n                if i < 22 and grid_np[i+1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = grid_np[i][j]\n                if j > 0 and grid_np[i][j-1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j-1] = grid_np[i][j]\n                if j < 18 and grid_np[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nThis implementation is a hypothesis based on the observed patterns in the training examples.

The actual transformation may be more complex and require further refinement based on the specific patterns in the examples.",

The output grid seems to be a transformation where certain values are replaced or modified based on their position and value.\n2. There appears to be a pattern where values are \"spread out\" or \"extended\" in some way, particularly in the middle of the grid.\n3. Values like 1, 2, 3, 8 seem to be used as \"anchors\" or \"starting points\" for spreading other values.\n4. There's a pattern where certain values are replaced with other values in a specific pattern, especially in the middle of the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading values from certain positions to neighboring cells in a specific pattern.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Define the pattern of spreading values\n    # This is a simplified version of the observed pattern\n    # We spread values from certain positions to neighboring cells\n    # This is a placeholder pattern that needs to be refined based on the examples\n    \n    # Example pattern: spread values from certain positions\n    # This is a simplified version and may need adjustment\n    for i in range(23):\n        for j in range(19):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value to neighboring cells\n                # This is a simplified pattern and may need refinement\n                if i > 0 and grid_np[i-1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i-1][j] = grid_np[i][j]\n                if i < 22 and grid_np[i+1][j] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i+1][j] = grid_np[i][j]\n                if j > 0 and grid_np[i][j-1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j-1] = grid_np[i][j]\n                if j < 18 and grid_np[i][j+1] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j+1] = grid_np[i][j]\n    \n    # Return the transformed grid as a list of lists\n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```\n\nThis implementation is a hypothesis based on the observed patterns in the training examples.

The actual transformation may be more complex and require further refinement based on the specific patterns in the examples.",
