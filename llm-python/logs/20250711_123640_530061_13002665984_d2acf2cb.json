          "Let's analyze the training examples carefully:\n\n- **Example 1:** The transformation seems to involve modifying some parts of the grid, notably changing values in specific rows or columns, but primarily the pattern isn't entirely clear. A notable change is that some 4s turn into 8s, and certain other pattern shifts happen near the bottom rows.\n\n- **Example 2:** The transformation appears to involve rearranging some color patterns, possibly reflecting or shifting the internal structure, reducing the complexity, or emphasizing certain regions.\n\n- **Example 3:** The output looks similar to the input but with some specific internal adjustments, especially with particular blocks turning into 7s or 8s, but overall the main shape seems preserved.\n\nFrom the visual and the pattern, a common theme appears:\n\n- The transformations often involve **modifying specific regions** or **adding certain colors around the boundary or within certain shapes**, possibly to highlight the central shape or borders.\n- The **test input** resembles a pink (value 6/ pink) shape with some modifications, and the output likely emphasizes or alters some boundary or inner pattern.\n\nGiven the complexity and partial pattern recognition, a common and simple transformation could be:\n\n### Hypothesis:\n- **Preserve the overall shape and main features** but **augment boundary or central regions**.\n- **Replace some certain colors (like 4) with new shades (like 8)**.\n- **Patch border areas with diagonal or horizontal patterns**.\n\n### Simplified implementation idea:\n- Expand the grid to 7x9 if not already (though the input size seems consistent, but always ensure output is 7x9).\n- For simplicity, let's **increase the values of certain cells based on their position** (e.g., border cells become a specific color).\n- Additionally, **modify specific color values** within the grid to \"highlight\" features \u2014 for instance, turn some 6s into 8s at the border to replicate a highlight pattern.\n\nI will implement a heuristic approach:\n- Highlight the border by changing some boundary cells into a specific value (e.g., 8).\n- Change some inner regions selectively.\n- For demonstration, I'll turn the outer border into value 8 and some inner areas into 7s, a pattern inspired by the examples.\n\nThis is a heuristic guess given the patterns observed.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    \n    # Ensure output is 7x9\n    height, width = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    transformed_grid = np.array(grid).copy()\n    \n    # Highlight the border (top, bottom, left, right) with a specific value, e.g., 8\n    transformed_grid[0, :] = 8\n    transformed_grid[-1, :] = 8\n    transformed_grid[:, 0] = 8\n    transformed_grid[:, -1] = 8\n    \n    # To emphasize inner structure, change some inner cells: e.g., turn inner 6s into 7s\n    for r in range(1, height - 1):\n        for c in range(1, width - 1):\n            if transformed_grid[r, c] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[r, c] = 7\n    \n    # Some additional patch: turn certain corner cells into yellowish (value 4 or 5)\n    # mimicking the corner modifications seen in training\n    transformed_grid[height//4, width//4] = 4\n    transformed_grid[3*height//4, 3*width//4] = 4\n    \n    # Ensure size consistency\n    # (Grid is already same size; if necessary, pad or crop, but in this case, left as-is)\n    \n    return transformed_grid.tolist()\n```"
