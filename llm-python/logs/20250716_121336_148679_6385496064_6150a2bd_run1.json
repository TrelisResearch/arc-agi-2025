    "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. So, there are two training examples and a test input. The task is to find out how the input grids are transformed into the output grids.\n\nLet me look at Example 1 first. The input is:\n\n3 3 8\n3 7 0\n5 0 0\n\nAnd the output is:\n\n0 0 5\n0 7 3\n8 3 3\n\nHmm. Let me write them down as matrices. The input is a 3x3 grid. The output also 3x3. Let me see what's happening here.\n\nLooking at the input, maybe there's some kind of rotation or reflection. For example, the output seems to have elements from the input but rearranged. Let me check the positions.\n\nIn the input, the first row is [3,3,8]. The output's first row is [0,0,5]. Wait, where does 5 come from? The input's third row first column is 5. So maybe there's some rotation. Let me think about rotating the grid.\n\nIf I rotate the input 90 degrees clockwise, what would happen? Let's see. The original grid:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 8\nRow 1: 3 7 0\nRow 2: 5 0 0\n\nRotating 90 degrees clockwise would make the first column of the original become the last row reversed. Let's compute that. The rotated grid would be:\n\nOriginal columns are:\nColumn 0: 3,3,5 \u2192 becomes row 2 (reversed?) \u2192 5,3,3?\nWait, rotating 90 degrees clockwise: the new row i is the original column (n-1 -i) reversed? Maybe I should think of it as:\n\nFor a 3x3 matrix, rotating 90 degrees clockwise would result in:\n\nnew_row_0 = original_column_2 (from bottom to top)\nnew_row_1 = original_column_1 (from bottom to top)\nnew_row_2 = original_column_0 (from bottom to top)\n\nSo for example, original column 2 is 8, 0, 0 \u2192 new row 0 would be 0,0,8? Wait, no. Wait, when you rotate 90 degrees clockwise, the first row of the original becomes the last column in reverse. Let me think of a standard rotation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a rotation. Let's check example 1's output. The output's first row is 0 0 5. The original's third row is 5 0 0. So maybe the output is a rotation. Let me try rotating the input 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nOriginal input:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 8\nRow 1: 3 7 0\nRow 2: 5 0 0\n\nAfter 90-degree rotation clockwise, the new grid would be:\n\nRow 0: 5 3 3\nRow 1: 0 7 3\nRow 2: 0 0 8\n\nWait, that's not matching the output. The output for example 1 is:\n\n0 0 5\n0 7 3\n8 3 3\n\nHmm, that's different. Let me check if it's a rotation of 180 degrees. Rotating 180 degrees would be rotating twice. Let's see. Original input rotated 180 degrees would be:\n\nOriginal row 0 becomes reversed and placed as row 2, etc. So:\n\nOriginal row 0: 3 3 8 \u2192 reversed is 8 3 3 \u2192 becomes row 2.\nOriginal row 1: 3 7 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 7 3 \u2192 row 1.\nOriginal row 2: 5 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 5 \u2192 row 0.\n\nSo the rotated grid would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 5\nRow 1: 0 7 3\nRow 2: 8 3 3\n\nWhich is exactly the output of example 1! Oh, right! So the output is the input rotated 180 degrees. Let me check example 2.\n\nExample 2 input:\n\n5 5 2\n1 0 0\n0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n\n0 0 0\n0 0 1\n2 5 5\n\nLet's rotate the input 180 degrees. Original rows:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 2 \u2192 reversed is 2 5 5 \u2192 becomes row 2.\nRow 1: 1 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 1 \u2192 becomes row 1.\nRow 2: 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 \u2192 becomes row 0.\n\nSo the rotated grid would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 1\nRow 2: 2 5 5\n\nWhich matches the output of example 2. So the pattern is that the output is the input grid rotated 180 degrees. So the transformation is to rotate the input grid 180 degrees.\n\nSo the task is to write a function that takes a 3x3 grid and returns the 180-degree rotated version.\n\nNow, how to implement that in Python. For a 3x3 grid, rotating 180 degrees can be done by reversing each row and then reversing the order of the rows. Or, alternatively, for each row, reverse it, then reverse the list of rows.\n\nFor example, original grid:\n\n[\n [a, b, c],\n [d, e, f],\n [g, h, i]\n]\n\nAfter rotating 180 degrees, it becomes:\n\n[\n [i, h, g],\n [f, e, d],\n [c, b, a]\n]\n\nSo, the steps are: reverse each row, then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nWait, let's see. Let's take example 1's input:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 8 \u2192 reversed is 8 3 3\nRow 1: 3 7 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 7 3\nRow 2: 5 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 5\n\nThen, reverse the order of the rows. So the new rows are:\n\n[0 0 5], [0 7 3], [8 3 3] \u2192 which is the output of example 1. Exactly.\n\nSo the process is: reverse each row, then reverse the list of rows.\n\nSo, in code, for a grid, we can do:\n\nrotated = [row[::-1] for row in grid][::-1]\n\nWait, let's see. Let's take the original grid as a list of lists. For each row in grid, reverse it (row[::-1]), then reverse the list of those reversed rows.\n\nYes. So for example, in example 1:\n\nOriginal grid is [[3,3,8], [3,7,0], [5,0,0]]\n\nReversing each row gives [[8,3,3], [0,7,3], [0,0,5]]\n\nThen reversing the list of rows gives [[0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3]] which is the output.\n\nSo that's the transformation.\n\nSo the code for the function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse each row, then reverse the list of rows\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    rotated = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return rotated\n\nWait, but in Python, lists are reversed with [::-1]. So for example, if grid is [[3,3,8], [3,7,0], [5,0,0]], then [row[::-1] for row in grid] would be [[8,3,3], [0,7,3], [0,0,5]]. Then reversing that list gives [[0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3]], which is correct.\n\nSo this code should work for the training examples. Let's check example 2:\n\nInput grid is [[5,5,2], [1,0,0], [0,0,0]]\n\nReversing each row gives [[2,5,5], [0,0,1], [0,0,0]]\n\nReversing the list of rows gives [[0,0,0], [0,0,1], [2,5,5]] which matches the output of example 2.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct transformation.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\n6 3 5\n6 8 0\n4 0 0\n\nApplying the same transformation. Let's see:\n\nOriginal grid:\n\nRow 0: [6,3,5] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [5,3,6]\nRow 1: [6,8,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,8,6]\nRow 2: [4,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,4]\n\nThen reverse the list of rows:\n\n[[0,0,4], [0,8,6], [5,3,6]]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n0 0 4\n0 8 6\n5 3 6\n\nBut the problem says that the test input is provided for context, but the code should handle the training examples. So the code as written should work.\n\nSo the Python function would be as described. Now, the code needs to return a new grid. So the code is:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    rotated = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return rotated\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you reverse a list, it's done with [::-1]. So for example, the code is correct.\n\nBut let me check for the test input. Let me see:\n\nOriginal test input:\n\nRow 0: 6 3 5 \u2192 reversed is [5,3,6]\nRow 1: 6 8 0 \u2192 reversed [0,8,6]\nRow 2: 4 0 0 \u2192 reversed [0,0,4]\n\nThen reversed_rows is [[5,3,6], [0,8,6], [0,0,4]]\n\nThen reversed_rows[::-1] is [[0,0,4], [0,8,6], [5,3,6]]\n\nSo the output grid is:\n\n0 0 4\n0 8 6\n5 3 6\n\nWhich is the transformed version.\n\nSo the code seems correct. Therefore, the function should be written as such.\n"

The output for example 1 is:\n\n0 0 5\n0 7 3\n8 3 3\n\nHmm, that's different. Let me check if it's a rotation of 180 degrees. Rotating 180 degrees would be rotating twice. Let's see. Original input rotated 180 degrees would be:\n\nOriginal row 0 becomes reversed and placed as row 2, etc. So:\n\nOriginal row 0: 3 3 8 \u2192 reversed is 8 3 3 \u2192 becomes row 2.\nOriginal row 1: 3 7 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 7 3 \u2192 row 1.\nOriginal row 2: 5 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 5 \u2192 row 0.\n\nSo the rotated grid would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 5\nRow 1: 0 7 3\nRow 2: 8 3 3\n\nWhich is exactly the output of example 1!

Original rows:\n\nRow 0: 5 5 2 \u2192 reversed is 2 5 5 \u2192 becomes row 2.\nRow 1: 1 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 1 \u2192 becomes row 1.\nRow 2: 0 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 0 \u2192 becomes row 0.\n\nSo the rotated grid would be:\n\nRow 0: 0 0 0\nRow 1: 0 0 1\nRow 2: 2 5 5\n\nWhich matches the output of example 2. So the pattern is that the output is the input grid rotated 180 degrees. So the transformation is to rotate the input grid 180 degrees.\n\nSo the task is to write a function that takes a 3x3 grid and returns the 180-degree rotated version.\n\nNow, how to implement that in Python. For a 3x3 grid, rotating 180 degrees can be done by reversing each row and then reversing the order of the rows. Or, alternatively, for each row, reverse it, then reverse the list of rows.\n\nFor example, original grid:\n\n[\n [a, b, c],\n [d, e, f],\n [g, h, i]\n]\n\nAfter rotating 180 degrees, it becomes:\n\n[\n [i, h, g],\n [f, e, d],\n [c, b, a]\n]\n\nSo, the steps are: reverse each row, then reverse the order of the rows.\n\nWait, let's see. Let's take example 1's input:\n\nOriginal rows:\n\nRow 0: 3 3 8 \u2192 reversed is 8 3 3\nRow 1: 3 7 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 7 3\nRow 2: 5 0 0 \u2192 reversed is 0 0 5\n\nThen, reverse the order of the rows. So the new rows are:\n\n[0 0 5], [0 7 3], [8 3 3] \u2192 which is the output of example 1. Exactly.\n\nSo the process is: reverse each row, then reverse the list of rows.\n\nSo, in code, for a grid, we can do:\n\nrotated = [row[::-1] for row in grid][::-1]\n\nWait, let's see. Let's take the original grid as a list of lists. For each row in grid, reverse it (row[::-1]), then reverse the list of those reversed rows.\n\nYes. So for example, in example 1:\n\nOriginal grid is [[3,3,8], [3,7,0], [5,0,0]]\n\nReversing each row gives [[8,3,3], [0,7,3], [0,0,5]]\n\nThen reversing the list of rows gives [[0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3]] which is the output.\n\nSo that's the transformation.\n\nSo the code for the function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Reverse each row, then reverse the list of rows\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    rotated = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return rotated\n\nWait, but in Python, lists are reversed with [::-1]. So for example, if grid is [[3,3,8], [3,7,0], [5,0,0]], then [row[::-1] for row in grid] would be [[8,3,3], [0,7,3], [0,0,5]]. Then reversing that list gives [[0,0,5], [0,7,3], [8,3,3]], which is correct.\n\nSo this code should work for the training examples. Let's check example 2:\n\nInput grid is [[5,5,2], [1,0,0], [0,0,0]]\n\nReversing each row gives [[2,5,5], [0,0,1], [0,0,0]]\n\nReversing the list of rows gives [[0,0,0], [0,0,1], [2,5,5]] which matches the output of example 2.\n\nSo this seems to be the correct transformation.\n\nNow, the test input is:\n\n6 3 5\n6 8 0\n4 0 0\n\nApplying the same transformation. Let's see:\n\nOriginal grid:\n\nRow 0: [6,3,5] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [5,3,6]\nRow 1: [6,8,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,8,6]\nRow 2: [4,0,0] \u2192 reversed \u2192 [0,0,4]\n\nThen reverse the list of rows:\n\n[[0,0,4], [0,8,6], [5,3,6]]\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n0 0 4\n0 8 6\n5 3 6\n\nBut the problem says that the test input is provided for context, but the code should handle the training examples. So the code as written should work.\n\nSo the Python function would be as described. Now, the code needs to return a new grid. So the code is:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    reversed_rows = [row[::-1] for row in grid]\n    rotated = reversed_rows[::-1]\n    return rotated\n\nBut wait, in Python, when you reverse a list, it's done with [::-1]. So for example, the code is correct.\n\nBut let me check for the test input. Let me see:\n\nOriginal test input:\n\nRow 0: 6 3 5 \u2192 reversed is [5,3,6]\nRow 1: 6 8 0 \u2192 reversed [0,8,6]\nRow 2: 4 0 0 \u2192 reversed [0,0,4]\n\nThen reversed_rows is [[5,3,6], [0,8,6], [0,0,4]]\n\nThen reversed_rows[::-1] is [[0,0,4], [0,8,6], [5,3,6]]\n\nSo the output grid is:\n\n0 0 4\n0 8 6\n5 3 6\n\nWhich is the transformed version.\n\nSo the code seems correct. Therefore, the function should be written as such.\n"
