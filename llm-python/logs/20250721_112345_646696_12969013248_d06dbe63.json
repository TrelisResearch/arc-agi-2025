          "reasoning": "**Considering Transformation Logic**\n\nI've started analyzing the provided training examples. Currently, I'm focused on understanding the transformation rules applied to a single '8' at coordinates (3,3) in the input grid. It's a small start, but I'm mapping out the initial shifts and rotations applied to the grid elements. I'm also taking notes on the potential patterns that may emerge from further examples.\n\n\n**Identifying Output Patterns**\n\nI've delved deeper into the initial training example. The radial pattern of '5's surrounding the '8' is clear, and I'm mapping how their coordinates relate to the '8's position, (R, C). I'm focusing on quadrant analysis, aiming to classify the relative coordinates to create a concise rule for generating the '5's, using an origin point, and offsets.\n\n\n**Decomposing Spatial Relations**\n\nI'm currently meticulously mapping the positions of the '5's in relation to the '8's coordinates (R, C). Specifically, I'm using relative offsets (row changes and column changes) from the '8's position to describe each '5's location. My focus now is on the geometrical patterns and distances to determine which coordinates influence which, and if a consistent formula governs the distribution. I'm considering quadrants to simplify the spatial organization.\n\n\n**Defining Radial Coordinates**\n\nI'm breaking down the positional relationships. Now, I'm focusing on defining a coordinate system relative to the '8' at (R, C). I plan on using relative row and column offsets (delta_row, delta_col) to locate the '5's. Also, I'm trying to simplify the offset calculations, and I will classify them by their relative quadrant to improve understanding.\n\n\n**Decoding Branching Patterns**\n\nI'm now analyzing the transformation patterns, focusing on Example 2. By mapping the '5's coordinates relative to the central '8' at (7, 6), I observe how branching patterns shift based on the '8's location. The previous quadrant analysis guides my coordinate pattern recognition efforts, and I'm working to generalize the logic.\n\n\n**Generating Relative Offsets**\n\nI'm now comparing the relative coordinates, or offsets, of the '5's in relation to the central '8's in both examples. Analyzing Example 2, I've observed a high degree of symmetry, which is a valuable hint. My next steps will be finding a correlation between row/col offsets and the '8's coordinates in each grid, simplifying the transformation to apply to future grids.\n\n\n**Comparing Coordinate Sets**\n\nI'm currently comparing the coordinate sets derived from Examples 1 and 2. The relative positions of the '5's around the '8' are not constant, especially in terms of direction (left/right, up/down). I have determined that a single, static set of offsets won't suffice, and I will need to consider the location of '8'.\n\n\n**Identifying Rule Symmetry**\n\nI'm currently comparing the sets of relative coordinates, or offsets, of the '5's. I'm observing both similarities and differences between the examples. It looks like the positions of these '5's relative to the '8's coordinates are key. My analysis shows consistent core coordinates, and branching variations.\n\n\n**Mapping Key Coordinates**\n\nI've identified a core pattern of offsets consistently forming a cross around the central '8', at (R,C), in both training examples. This cross structure includes points like (R-1, C), (R-2, C), (R+1, C), (R+2, C), which are always present. Now, I am focused on mapping these core coordinates.\n\n\n",
