In Example 1, the output grid has some cells set to 0 where the input had values, suggesting a \"zeroing\" pattern in certain positions.\n2. In Example 2, there's a similar pattern where certain cells are set to 0, but the pattern seems more complex.\n3. In Example 3, there's a clear pattern where certain cells are set to 0, and this seems to be related to the position of the cell in the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves setting certain cells to 0 based on their position in the grid. Specifically, it seems like cells in certain rows and columns are being set to 0.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Set cells in certain rows and columns to 0\n    # This pattern is based on observations from the training examples\n    for i in range(20):\n        for j in range(20):\n            # Set cells in rows 4-7 and columns 8-11 to 0\n            if (4 <= i <= 7) and (8 <= j <= 11):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            # Set cells in rows 12-15 and columns 4-7 to 0\n            if (12 <= i <= 15) and (4 <= j <= 7):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            # Set cells in rows 16-19 and columns 12-15 to 0\n            if (16 <= i <= 19) and (12 <= j <= 15):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Set cells in certain rows and columns to 0\n    # This pattern is based on observations from the training examples\n    for i in range(20):\n        for j in range(20):\n            # Set cells in rows 4-7 and columns 8-11 to 0\n            if (4 <= i <= 7) and (8 <= j <= 11):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            # Set cells in rows 12-15 and columns 4-7 to 0\n            if (12 <= i <= 15) and (4 <= j <= 7):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            # Set cells in rows 16-19 and columns 12-15 to 0\n            if (16 <= i <= 19) and (12 <= j <= 15):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

In Example 2, there's a similar pattern where certain cells are set to 0, but the pattern seems more complex.\n3. In Example 3, there's a clear pattern where certain cells are set to 0, and this seems to be related to the position of the cell in the grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves setting certain cells to 0 based on their position in the grid. Specifically, it seems like cells in certain rows and columns are being set to 0.\n\nHere's my implementation of this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Set cells in certain rows and columns to 0\n    # This pattern is based on observations from the training examples\n    for i in range(20):\n        for j in range(20):\n            # Set cells in rows 4-7 and columns 8-11 to 0\n            if (4 <= i <= 7) and (8 <= j <= 11):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            # Set cells in rows 12-15 and columns 4-7 to 0\n            if (12 <= i <= 15) and (4 <= j <= 7):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            # Set cells in rows 16-19 and columns 12-15 to 0\n            if (16 <= i <= 19) and (12 <= j <= 15):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Set cells in certain rows and columns to 0\n    # This pattern is based on observations from the training examples\n    for i in range(20):\n        for j in range(20):\n            # Set cells in rows 4-7 and columns 8-11 to 0\n            if (4 <= i <= 7) and (8 <= j <= 11):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            # Set cells in rows 12-15 and columns 4-7 to 0\n            if (12 <= i <= 15) and (4 <= j <= 7):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n            # Set cells in rows 16-19 and columns 12-15 to 0\n            if (16 <= i <= 19) and (12 <= j <= 15):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
