          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some non-zero values in the fifth and sixth rows. The output expands those values into a spread-out pattern. For instance, the 2 and 3 in the fifth input row become a block of 2s and 3s in the output. The output seems to spread these values outward, filling in the surrounding cells with the same numbers. Also, the 1 in the sixth input row becomes a long horizontal line of 1s in the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 2,5 in the fifth row and 5,3 in the sixth. The output spreads these into blocks. The 2 and 5 become a horizontal block, then the 5 and 3 spread into a vertical block. It looks like the non-zero values are expanding into a region, possibly filling in a certain area with their values.\n\nExample 3 is more complex. The input has numbers in the 8th and 9th rows (1,2 and 3,4). The output shows that these numbers spread outwards, creating larger blocks. For example, the 1 and 2 in the 8th row become a horizontal strip of 1s and 2s, and then expand into a larger area. Similarly, the 3 and 4 in the 9th row spread into a larger block. Also, there's a pattern where the numbers spread in a way that they fill in a region, possibly expanding in all directions.\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be that non-zero values in the input are expanded into a larger region in the output. The expansion might be such that the non-zero values spread outwards, filling adjacent cells, but with some constraints. For example, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in the fifth row become a block that spreads to the right and down. The 1 in the sixth row becomes a horizontal line that spreads down and to the right.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the numbers spread in a way that they form a sort of \"spread\" where the original cell's value is replicated in a region. For instance, the 1 in the 8th row (input) becomes a horizontal strip of 1s that expands to the right and down. Similarly, the 3 and 4 in the 9th row spread into a larger block.\n\nBut how exactly does the expansion work? Let's think about the steps. Maybe the non-zero values in the input are expanded into a region that is a certain distance away from their original positions. For example, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in the fifth row (row index 4, assuming zero-based) are spread into a block that starts at column 6 (since the original 2 is at column 1, 3 at column 2). Wait, maybe not. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 1's input, the fifth row is [2,3,0,...], and the output's fifth row is [1,1,...1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. Wait, no. Wait the output for Example 1's fifth row is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. Wait, the input fifth row is 2,3,0... and the output fifth row is 1s. Wait, that's confusing. Wait no, looking back at the example:\n\nExample 1's output for the fifth row is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nBut the input fifth row is 2 3 0 0 ... So how does that happen? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input for Example 1 is 10 rows. Let me look at the input and output:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: all 0s.\n\nRow 2: all 0s.\n\nRow 3: all 0s.\n\nRow 4: 2 3 0 ... (so row 4, columns 0 and 1 are 2 and 3, rest 0s)\n\nRow 5: 1 1 0 ... (columns 0 and 1 are 1s)\n\nThen rows 6-9 are all 0s.\n\nThe output for Example 1:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0s except columns 6-9 are 2,2,2,2 and 3,3,3,3.\n\nRow 2: same as row 1.\n\nRow 3: columns 2-5 are 2,2,2,2 and 3,3,3,3.\n\nRow 4: columns 0-1 are 2,3, then columns 2-5 are 2,2,2,2, then 3,3,3,3.\n\nRow 5: columns 0-1 are 1, then columns 2-13 are 1s.\n\nSo the pattern here seems to be that the non-zero values in the input are spread out into a larger region. For example, the 2 and 3 in row 4 (input) are spread into a block that starts at column 6 and 7, but also in row 3, they spread to columns 2-5. Also, the 1 in row 5 is spread into a horizontal line that covers columns 0-13.\n\nHmm. Maybe the non-zero values are expanding in a way that they form a sort of \"spread\" where their value is copied into adjacent cells, but only in certain directions. Alternatively, maybe the non-zero values are expanding into a region that is a certain distance away, and the expansion is such that the original cell's value is propagated outward.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the spread of the numbers. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 1 in row 7 (assuming 0-based) and 2 in row 8. The output for row 7 has 1s spread out, and row 8 has 3s and 4s spread out. The output seems to have these numbers expanding in a way that they fill in a larger area, possibly with a certain pattern.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the non-zero values in the input are expanded into a region that is a certain number of cells away. For example, the original cell's value is spread into a rectangle that starts from a certain position. For instance, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in row 4 are spread into a block that starts at column 6 (row 4, column 6?), but also in row 3, columns 2-5. Maybe the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a certain distance away from their original positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is filled with their value, but only in a certain area. For example, the 2 and 3 in row 4 are spread into a region that starts at column 6 and extends to the right, and also expands downward.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of the transformation as follows: for each non-zero value in the input, it is expanded into a certain region in the output. The region could be a rectangle or some shape that depends on the original position and value.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 1 in row 7, column 0, and 2 in column 1. The output for row 7 has 1s in columns 0-1, then 1s in columns 2-7, and then 2s in columns 7-13. Wait, maybe not. Let me check the output for Example 3's row 7:\n\nThe output for row 7 is:\n\n1 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nWait, no. The output for row 7 in Example 3 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nWait, the output for row 7 is the 15th row? Wait, the input for Example 3 is 16 rows (since the input has 16 rows, each with 32 columns? Wait, no. The input for Example 3 is 16 rows, each with 32 columns? Wait, the input for Example 3 is given as 32 columns (since the input line has 32 entries, like \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" which is 32 numbers). So the output must be 10x14, as per the problem statement. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 10x14. So the input and output have different dimensions. Wait, the input in the training examples is of varying sizes. For example, Example 1's input is 10 rows, each with 14 columns. The output is also 10 rows, each with 14 columns. So for the test input, which is 16 rows, each with 32 columns, the output must be 10x14. So the transformation must take the input grid and produce a 10x14 grid.\n\nWait, but the input for the training examples is of varying sizes. For example, Example 3's input is 16 rows, each with 32 columns. The output is 10 rows, each with 14 columns. So the transformation is not just a simple expansion but a mapping from the input grid to a fixed output size.\n\nSo the problem is to take an input grid of any size (but in the examples, the input is 10x14, 10x14, 16x32, etc.) and produce a 10x14 output grid. So the function must process the input and generate a 10x14 grid.\n\nBut how? The examples show that the input has certain non-zero values, and the output has those values spread out in a certain pattern.\n\nLooking again at Example 1: the input has some non-zero values in rows 4 and 5. The output for these rows has those values spread out in a way that they form blocks. For example, the 2 and 3 in row 4 (input) are spread into a block that starts in row 3, columns 2-5 and 6-9. The 1 in row 5 is spread into a horizontal line across the entire row.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, it is expanded into a region that is a certain distance away from its original position. But how to determine that distance?\n\nAnother approach: think of the output as being generated by expanding the non-zero values in the input into a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in row 4 (input) are spread into a block that starts in row 3 and column 2, and extends to the right. Similarly, the 1 in row 5 is spread into a block that covers the entire row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a rectangle, where the rectangle starts at a certain position and extends in a certain direction. For example, the 2 and 3 in row 4 (input) are spread into a rectangle that starts at row 3, column 2, and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a rectangle that starts from a certain offset. For example, the original non-zero cell is at (row, col), and the expansion starts at (row - 2, col - 2) or something like that. But this is just a guess.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nThe 2 is at (4, 0), 3 at (4, 1). The output for row 3 has 2s starting at column 2. So the original cell (4,0) is expanded into row 3, column 2. That's a distance of 1 row up and 2 columns to the right. Similarly, the 3 is at (4,1), which is expanded into row 3, column 3. So the expansion is such that the original cell's value is spread into a region that starts a certain number of rows and columns away.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a certain distance away from their original position, and the expansion is in all directions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being generated by taking the non-zero values in the input and expanding them into a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in row 4 are spread into a block that starts in row 3, columns 2-5 (for the 2 and 3), and then in row 4, columns 0-1 are 2 and 3, and columns 2-5 are 2s, and columns 6-9 are 3s. This seems like the original values are spread into a region that is a rectangle, but the exact pattern is unclear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the non-zero values and expanding them into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away. For example, the original non-zero values are expanded into a rectangle that starts at a certain offset. For instance, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in row 4 are spread into a region that starts at row 3, column 2. The 1 in row 5 is spread into a region that starts at row 5, column 0 and extends to the right.\n\nBut how to determine the offset? Maybe the expansion is based on the position of the non-zero value. For example, if a non-zero value is in the input grid, it is expanded into a certain area in the output grid. The exact area depends on the original position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero values in the input are expanded into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away. For example, the original non-zero value is in row i, column j. The expansion starts at row i - a, column j - b, and expands in certain directions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's think about the third example. The input has a 1 in row 7, column 0, and 2 in row 7, column 1. The output for row 7 is 1s starting at column 0, then 1s in columns 2-7, and then 2s in columns 7-13. Wait, maybe the expansion is such that the original non-zero values are spread into a region that starts at a certain offset and expands in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being generated by taking the non-zero values in the input and expanding them into a region that is a rectangle. For example, the 2 and 3 in row 4 (input) are spread into a rectangle that starts at row 3, column 2 and extends to row 4, column 9. Then the 1 in row 5 is spread into a rectangle that starts at row 5, column 0 and extends to row 5, column 13.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the expansion is such that each non-zero value in the input is spread into a rectangle that starts at a certain offset and extends in certain directions. But how to determine the offset?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a certain number of cells away from their original position. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 4, column 0 is expanded into a region that starts at row 3, column 2. That's one row up and two columns to the right. Similarly, the 3 in row 4, column 1 is expanded into row 3, column 3. So the offset is (row-1, column+2). But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a rectangle that starts from the original cell's position and expands outward. For example, the 2 in row 4, column 0 is expanded into a region that starts at row 4, column 0 and expands to the right and down. But in the output, the 2 is spread into row 3, columns 2-5, and row 4, columns 0-1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern based on the positions of the non-zero values. For example, in the output, the non-zero values are spread in a way that they form a rectangle that starts at a certain position and extends in certain directions. For example, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in row 4 are spread into a rectangle that starts at row 3, column 2 and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how to find the starting point of this rectangle? Maybe the starting point is based on the original non-zero value's position. For example, if a non-zero value is in row i, column j, then in the output, it starts at row i - 3, column j + 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being generated by expanding each non-zero value into a region that is a certain number of cells away. For example, the 2 and 3 in row 4 (input) are spread into a region that starts at row 3, column 2. The 1 in row 5 is spread into a region that starts at row 5, column 0.\n\nBut how to determine the starting point? Maybe the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a rectangle that starts from the original position and expands in certain directions. For example, the 2 in row 4, column 0 is expanded into a rectangle that starts at row 4, column 0 and expands to the right. But in the output, the 2 is spread into row 3, columns 2-5. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the non-zero values into a region that is a certain distance away from their original position. For example, the non-zero values are expanded into a rectangle that starts at a certain offset from their original position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the non-zero values in the input and expanding them into a region that is a certain shape, like a rectangle or a diamond. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the output for the test input. The test input has non-zero values in rows 7 and 8 (assuming 0-based). The output should be 10x14. Let's imagine what the output might look like.\n\nThe test input's rows 7 and 8 are:\n\nRow 7: 1 1 0 ... (columns 0 and 1 are 1, others 0)\n\nRow 8: 8 8 0 ... (columns 0 and 1 are 8, others 0)\n\nIn the output, these non-zero values should be expanded into a region. For example, the 1s in row 7 might be expanded into a horizontal strip that starts at row 7, columns 0-1, and expands to the right and down. Similarly, the 8s in row 8 would be expanded into a horizontal strip that starts at row 8, columns 0-1 and expands to the right and down.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a rectangle that starts at their original position and extends in certain directions. For example, the 1s in row 7, columns 0-1 are expanded into a rectangle that starts at row 7, column 0 and extends to the right and down. Similarly for the 8s.\n\nBut how to determine the size of the rectangle? For example, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in row 4 are spread into a rectangle that starts at row 3, column 2 and extends to row 4, column 9. But the original non-zero values are in row 4, columns 0 and 1.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Given the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLet me think about the pattern in Example 3. The input has a 1 in row 7, column 0, and 2 in row 7, column 1. The output for row 7 has 1s in columns 0-1, then 1s in columns 2-7, and then 2s in columns 7-13. This suggests that the 1s are expanded to the right and down, and the 2s are also expanded to the right and down. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a rectangle that starts at a certain offset from the original position. For example, the original 1 in row 7, column 0 is expanded into a rectangle that starts at row 7, column 0 and extends to the right and down. Similarly, the 2 in row 7, column 1 is expanded into a rectangle that starts at row 7, column 1 and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how to determine the size of the rectangle? Perhaps the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a certain number of columns and rows away. For example, the original non-zero value is expanded into a region that is 3 columns to the right and 3 rows down.\n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in row 4 are spread into a region that starts in row 3 and column 2, and extends to the right and down. The 1 in row 5 is spread into a region that starts in row 5, column 0 and extends to the right.\n\nThis suggests that the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away from their original position. For example, the original non-zero value in row 4, column 0 is spread into a region that starts at row 3, column 2 (which is row-1, column+2). Similarly, the original non-zero value in row 4, column 1 is spread into row 3, column 3 (row-1, column+3).\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away, but this depends on their position in the input.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being generated by taking the non-zero values in the input and expanding them into a region that is a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 are expanded into a region that forms a rectangle that starts at row 3, column 2 and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how to model this in code?\n\nPerhaps the key is to find that for each non-zero value in the input, it is expanded into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away, and the value is copied into that region. For example, the original value is expanded into a rectangle that starts at (row - 3, column + 2) and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a certain distance away from their original position, and the expansion is in a way that the value is copied into adjacent cells. For example, the 2 in row 4, column 0 is expanded into a region that starts at row 3, column 2, and then expands to the right and down.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe the following approach:\n\nFor each cell (i, j) in the input grid, if the value is non-zero, then in the output grid, it is expanded into a region that starts at a certain position and extends in certain directions. The exact position and size of the region depend on the original cell's position.\n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that the non-zero values are expanded into a region that starts at a certain offset. For example, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in row 4 are expanded into a region that starts at row 3, column 2. The 1 in row 5 is expanded into a region that starts at row 5, column 0.\n\nThis suggests that the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away from their original position. For example, the original cell is at (i, j), and the expansion starts at (i-1, j+2). But this is just a guess based on the first example.\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a rectangle that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being generated by expanding the non-zero values into a region that is a certain distance away from their original position. For example, the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a rectangle that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the non-zero values in the input are expanded into a region that starts at a certain offset from their original position, and the value is copied into that region. The exact offset is determined by the original position.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the non-zero values in row 4 (input) are expanded into a region that starts at row 3, column 2. This suggests that the offset is (row - 1, column + 2). Similarly, the 1 in row 5 is expanded into a region that starts at row 5, column 0.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Perhaps the expansion is such that for each non-zero value at (i, j), the output is filled with that value in a rectangle that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut this is just a guess. To implement this, I need to find for each non-zero value in the input, the region in the output grid where it should be copied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away, and the value is copied into that region. For example, the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a rectangle that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how to determine the size of the rectangle?\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for Example 1. The 2 and 3 in row 4 (input) are spread into a region that covers rows 3-4 and columns 2-9. The 1 in row 5 is spread into a region that covers row 5 and columns 0-13. This suggests that the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away.\n\nBut how to determine the starting point?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being generated by expanding the non-zero values into a region that is a certain shape, such as a rectangle, and the shape is determined by the position of the non-zero value in the input.\n\nBut without more examples, this is challenging.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each non-zero value in the input, expand it into a region that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero values are expanded into a region that starts at (i - 2, j + 2) and extends to the right and down. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 4 (i=4) is expanded into row 3 (i-1), column 2 (j+2). The 3 in row 4 is expanded into row 3, column 3 (j+3). This might be a possible pattern.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThe output grid is 10 rows by 14 columns. So for each cell in the input grid, if it's non-zero, we need to determine which cells in the output grid should be filled with that value.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 4 (input) is at (4, 0). The output starts at row 3, column 2. So the value 2 is copied into the output grid starting at (3, 2) and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how far does it extend? In the output for row 3, columns 2-5 are 2, and columns 6-9 are 3. So the 2 is spread into columns 2-5, and the 3 is spread into columns 6-9.\n\nThis suggests that for each non-zero value in the input, the value is spread into a region that starts at a certain offset and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how to determine the offset and the size of the region?\n\nMaybe the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that starts at (i - 3, j + 2), and extends to the right and down for a certain number of rows and columns.\n\nBut without more examples, this is hard to confirm.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code logic:\n\nFor each cell (i, j) in the input grid, if the value is non-zero, then in the output grid, we fill a region starting at (i - 3, j + 2), and extend to the right and down. However, this is just a guess.\n\nBut this might not work for all examples. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 1 in row 7, column 0, which would be expanded into row 4 (7-3=4), column 2 (0+2=2). The output for row 4 in Example 3 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nWait, this is the fifth row of the output. But according to this logic, the 1 in row 7, column 0 would be expanded into row 4, column 2. But in the output, the 1s start at row 4, column 14? Or perhaps this is not the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away, but the exact pattern is unclear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: for each non-zero value in the input, expand it into a rectangle that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down. If this is not correct, the code will not work, but it's the best I can do with the given examples.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nThe output grid is 10 rows by 14 columns. For each cell in the input, if it's non-zero, we need to determine which cells in the output should be filled with that value.\n\nBut how to handle the expansion? For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 4, column 0 is expanded into a region that starts at row 3, column 2 and extends to the right and down. The 3 in row 4, column 1 is expanded into row 3, column 3 and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how to determine the size of the region?\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is such that the non-zero value is copied into a region that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down for 4 rows and 7 columns. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by expanding each non-zero value into a region that is a rectangle, where the rectangle starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down for a certain number of rows and columns.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\n- Create a 10x14 grid filled with 0s.\n- For each cell (i, j) in the input grid:\n   - if the value is non-zero:\n      - calculate the starting row and column in the output grid.\n      - for each row in the output grid from start_row to 9:\n         - for each column in the output grid from start_col to 13:\n             - set the output cell to the input value.\n\nBut how to determine start_row and start_col?\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 in row 4 (i=4) is expanded into row 3 (start_row = i - 1), column 2 (start_col = j + 2). Similarly, the 3 in row 4, column 1 is expanded into row 3, column 3.\n\nThis suggests that start_row = i - 1, start_col = j + 2.\n\nBut for the 1 in row 5, start_row = 5 - 1 = 4, start_col = 0 + 2 = 2. But in the output, the 1 in row 5 is spread across the entire row, which starts at column 0. So this approach might not work for that case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start_row and start_col are determined based on the original position. For example, the start_row is i - 3, start_col is j + 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the start_row is i - 3, start_col is j + 2. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 4 (i=4) would start at row 1 (4-3=1), column 2 (j=0 + 2=2). But in the output, the 2 is in row 3, so this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to look for the pattern in the examples and find that the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a certain distance away, and the expansion is such that the value is copied into a rectangle that starts at a certain position and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\n- Create a 10x14 grid filled with 0s.\n- For each cell (i, j) in the input grid:\n   - if the value is non-zero:\n      - calculate the starting row and column in the output grid as (i - 3, j + 2).\n      - for each row in the output grid from start_row to 9:\n         - for each column in the output grid from start_col to 13:\n             - set the output cell to the input value.\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, this may not work for all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nNow, let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 at (4, 0). start_row = 4 - 3 = 1, start_col = 0 + 2 = 2. So the output cells from row 1 to 9, columns 2 to 13 are set to 2. But in the output, the 2 is only in rows 3-4, columns 2-5 and 6-9. So this approach would overwrite too much, which is not correct.\n\nThis suggests that the approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away, but only in certain directions. For example, the non-zero value is expanded into a region that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down for a certain number of rows and columns.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code that tries to expand non-zero values into a region that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down, but only for a certain number of rows and columns. This is a guess, but it's the best I can do.\n\nThe code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*14 for _ in range(10)]\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            if val != 0:\n                start_row = max(0, i - 3)\n                start_col = max(0, j + 2)\n                end_row = min(9, i + 3)\n                end_col = min(13, j + 10)\n                for row in range(start_row, end_row + 1):\n                    for col in range(start_col, end_col + 1):\n                        output[row][col] = val\n    return output\n\nBut this is just a guess. In Example 1, the 2 at (4, 0) would start at row 1, column 2, and extend to row 7, column 12. This would overwrite many cells, but in the output, the 2 is only in rows 3-4, columns 2-5 and 6-9. So this approach is not correct.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll have to make a best guess based on the examples. The correct pattern is likely that non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a certain distance away, and the expansion is such that the value is copied into a rectangle that starts at a certain offset.\n\nBut without more information, I'll proceed with the following code, which tries to expand non-zero values into a region that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down for a certain number of rows and columns. This is a guess, but it's the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern from the training examples to create a transformation function. Let's look at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has some non-zero values in the fifth and sixth rows. The output expands those values into a spread-out pattern. For instance, the 2 and 3 in the fifth input row become a block of 2s and 3s in the output. The output seems to spread these values outward, filling in the surrounding cells with the same numbers. Also, the 1 in the sixth input row becomes a long horizontal line of 1s in the output.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 2,5 in the fifth row and 5,3 in the sixth. The output spreads these into blocks. The 2 and 5 become a horizontal block, then the 5 and 3 spread into a vertical block. It looks like the non-zero values are expanding into a region, possibly filling in a certain area with their values.\n\nExample 3 is more complex. The input has numbers in the 8th and 9th rows (1,2 and 3,4). The output shows that these numbers spread outwards, creating larger blocks. For example, the 1 and 2 in the 8th row become a horizontal strip of 1s and 2s, and then expand into a larger area. Similarly, the 3 and 4 in the 9th row spread into a larger block. Also, there's a pattern where the numbers spread in a way that they fill in a region, possibly expanding in all directions.\n\nSo, the pattern seems to be that non-zero values in the input are expanded into a larger region in the output. The expansion might be such that the non-zero values spread outwards, filling adjacent cells, but with some constraints. For example, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in the fifth row become a block that spreads to the right and down. The 1 in the sixth row becomes a horizontal line that spreads down and to the right.\n\nAnother observation: in Example 3, the numbers spread in a way that they form a sort of \"spread\" where the original cell's value is replicated in a region. For instance, the 1 in the 8th row (input) becomes a horizontal strip of 1s that expands to the right and down. Similarly, the 3 and 4 in the 9th row spread into a larger block.\n\nBut how exactly does the expansion work? Let's think about the steps. Maybe the non-zero values in the input are expanded into a region that is a certain distance away from their original positions. For example, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in the fifth row (row index 4, assuming zero-based) are spread into a block that starts at column 6 (since the original 2 is at column 1, 3 at column 2). Wait, maybe not. Let me check:\n\nIn Example 1's input, the fifth row is [2,3,0,...], and the output's fifth row is [1,1,...1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. Wait, no. Wait the output for Example 1's fifth row is [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]. Wait, the input fifth row is 2,3,0... and the output fifth row is 1s. Wait, that's confusing. Wait no, looking back at the example:\n\nExample 1's output for the fifth row is:\n\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nBut the input fifth row is 2 3 0 0 ... So how does that happen? Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the input for Example 1 is 10 rows. Let me look at the input and output:\n\nInput rows:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: all 0s.\n\nRow 2: all 0s.\n\nRow 3: all 0s.\n\nRow 4: 2 3 0 ... (so row 4, columns 0 and 1 are 2 and 3, rest 0s)\n\nRow 5: 1 1 0 ... (columns 0 and 1 are 1s)\n\nThen rows 6-9 are all 0s.\n\nThe output for Example 1:\n\nRow 0: all 0s.\n\nRow 1: 0s except columns 6-9 are 2,2,2,2 and 3,3,3,3.\n\nRow 2: same as row 1.\n\nRow 3: columns 2-5 are 2,2,2,2 and 3,3,3,3.\n\nRow 4: columns 0-1 are 2,3, then columns 2-5 are 2,2,2,2, then 3,3,3,3.\n\nRow 5: columns 0-1 are 1, then columns 2-13 are 1s.\n\nSo the pattern here seems to be that the non-zero values in the input are spread out into a larger region. For example, the 2 and 3 in row 4 (input) are spread into a block that starts at column 6 and 7, but also in row 3, they spread to columns 2-5. Also, the 1 in row 5 is spread into a horizontal line that covers columns 0-13.\n\nHmm. Maybe the non-zero values are expanding in a way that they form a sort of \"spread\" where their value is copied into adjacent cells, but only in certain directions. Alternatively, maybe the non-zero values are expanding into a region that is a certain distance away, and the expansion is such that the original cell's value is propagated outward.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the spread of the numbers. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 1 in row 7 (assuming 0-based) and 2 in row 8. The output for row 7 has 1s spread out, and row 8 has 3s and 4s spread out. The output seems to have these numbers expanding in a way that they fill in a larger area, possibly with a certain pattern.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the non-zero values in the input are expanded into a region that is a certain number of cells away. For example, the original cell's value is spread into a rectangle that starts from a certain position. For instance, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in row 4 are spread into a block that starts at column 6 (row 4, column 6?), but also in row 3, columns 2-5. Maybe the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a certain distance away from their original positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is filled with their value, but only in a certain area. For example, the 2 and 3 in row 4 are spread into a region that starts at column 6 and extends to the right, and also expands downward.\n\nBut how to model this? Let's think of the transformation as follows: for each non-zero value in the input, it is expanded into a certain region in the output. The region could be a rectangle or some shape that depends on the original position and value.\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has a 1 in row 7, column 0, and 2 in column 1. The output for row 7 has 1s in columns 0-1, then 1s in columns 2-7, and then 2s in columns 7-13. Wait, maybe not. Let me check the output for Example 3's row 7:\n\nThe output for row 7 is:\n\n1 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nWait, no. The output for row 7 in Example 3 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nWait, the output for row 7 is the 15th row? Wait, the input for Example 3 is 16 rows (since the input has 16 rows, each with 32 columns? Wait, no. The input for Example 3 is 16 rows, each with 32 columns? Wait, the input for Example 3 is given as 32 columns (since the input line has 32 entries, like \"0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\" which is 32 numbers). So the output must be 10x14, as per the problem statement. Wait, the problem says that the output must be 10x14. So the input and output have different dimensions. Wait, the input in the training examples is of varying sizes. For example, Example 1's input is 10 rows, each with 14 columns. The output is also 10 rows, each with 14 columns. So for the test input, which is 16 rows, each with 32 columns, the output must be 10x14. So the transformation must take the input grid and produce a 10x14 grid.\n\nWait, but the input for the training examples is of varying sizes. For example, Example 3's input is 16 rows, each with 32 columns. The output is 10 rows, each with 14 columns. So the transformation is not just a simple expansion but a mapping from the input grid to a fixed output size.\n\nSo the problem is to take an input grid of any size (but in the examples, the input is 10x14, 10x14, 16x32, etc.) and produce a 10x14 output grid. So the function must process the input and generate a 10x14 grid.\n\nBut how? The examples show that the input has certain non-zero values, and the output has those values spread out in a certain pattern.\n\nLooking again at Example 1: the input has some non-zero values in rows 4 and 5. The output for these rows has those values spread out in a way that they form blocks. For example, the 2 and 3 in row 4 (input) are spread into a block that starts in row 3, columns 2-5 and 6-9. The 1 in row 5 is spread into a horizontal line across the entire row.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that for each non-zero value in the input, it is expanded into a region that is a certain distance away from its original position. But how to determine that distance?\n\nAnother approach: think of the output as being generated by expanding the non-zero values in the input into a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in row 4 (input) are spread into a block that starts in row 3 and column 2, and extends to the right. Similarly, the 1 in row 5 is spread into a block that covers the entire row.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a rectangle, where the rectangle starts at a certain position and extends in a certain direction. For example, the 2 and 3 in row 4 (input) are spread into a rectangle that starts at row 3, column 2, and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a rectangle that starts from a certain offset. For example, the original non-zero cell is at (row, col), and the expansion starts at (row - 2, col - 2) or something like that. But this is just a guess.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nThe 2 is at (4, 0), 3 at (4, 1). The output for row 3 has 2s starting at column 2. So the original cell (4,0) is expanded into row 3, column 2. That's a distance of 1 row up and 2 columns to the right. Similarly, the 3 is at (4,1), which is expanded into row 3, column 3. So the expansion is such that the original cell's value is spread into a region that starts a certain number of rows and columns away.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a certain distance away from their original position, and the expansion is in all directions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being generated by taking the non-zero values in the input and expanding them into a certain pattern. For example, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in row 4 are spread into a block that starts in row 3, columns 2-5 (for the 2 and 3), and then in row 4, columns 0-1 are 2 and 3, and columns 2-5 are 2s, and columns 6-9 are 3s. This seems like the original values are spread into a region that is a rectangle, but the exact pattern is unclear.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the non-zero values and expanding them into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away. For example, the original non-zero values are expanded into a rectangle that starts at a certain offset. For instance, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in row 4 are spread into a region that starts at row 3, column 2. The 1 in row 5 is spread into a region that starts at row 5, column 0 and extends to the right.\n\nBut how to determine the offset? Maybe the expansion is based on the position of the non-zero value. For example, if a non-zero value is in the input grid, it is expanded into a certain area in the output grid. The exact area depends on the original position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero values in the input are expanded into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away. For example, the original non-zero value is in row i, column j. The expansion starts at row i - a, column j - b, and expands in certain directions.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's think about the third example. The input has a 1 in row 7, column 0, and 2 in row 7, column 1. The output for row 7 is 1s starting at column 0, then 1s in columns 2-7, and then 2s in columns 7-13. Wait, maybe the expansion is such that the original non-zero values are spread into a region that starts at a certain offset and expands in a certain way.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being generated by taking the non-zero values in the input and expanding them into a region that is a rectangle. For example, the 2 and 3 in row 4 (input) are spread into a rectangle that starts at row 3, column 2 and extends to row 4, column 9. Then the 1 in row 5 is spread into a rectangle that starts at row 5, column 0 and extends to row 5, column 13.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the expansion is such that each non-zero value in the input is spread into a rectangle that starts at a certain offset and extends in certain directions. But how to determine the offset?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a certain number of cells away from their original position. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 4, column 0 is expanded into a region that starts at row 3, column 2. That's one row up and two columns to the right. Similarly, the 3 in row 4, column 1 is expanded into row 3, column 3. So the offset is (row-1, column+2). But this seems arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a rectangle that starts from the original cell's position and expands outward. For example, the 2 in row 4, column 0 is expanded into a region that starts at row 4, column 0 and expands to the right and down. But in the output, the 2 is spread into row 3, columns 2-5, and row 4, columns 0-1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe there's a pattern based on the positions of the non-zero values. For example, in the output, the non-zero values are spread in a way that they form a rectangle that starts at a certain position and extends in certain directions. For example, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in row 4 are spread into a rectangle that starts at row 3, column 2 and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how to find the starting point of this rectangle? Maybe the starting point is based on the original non-zero value's position. For example, if a non-zero value is in row i, column j, then in the output, it starts at row i - 3, column j + 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being generated by expanding each non-zero value into a region that is a certain number of cells away. For example, the 2 and 3 in row 4 (input) are spread into a region that starts at row 3, column 2. The 1 in row 5 is spread into a region that starts at row 5, column 0.\n\nBut how to determine the starting point? Maybe the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a rectangle that starts from the original position and expands in certain directions. For example, the 2 in row 4, column 0 is expanded into a rectangle that starts at row 4, column 0 and expands to the right. But in the output, the 2 is spread into row 3, columns 2-5. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the non-zero values into a region that is a certain distance away from their original position. For example, the non-zero values are expanded into a rectangle that starts at a certain offset from their original position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the non-zero values in the input and expanding them into a region that is a certain shape, like a rectangle or a diamond. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the output for the test input. The test input has non-zero values in rows 7 and 8 (assuming 0-based). The output should be 10x14. Let's imagine what the output might look like.\n\nThe test input's rows 7 and 8 are:\n\nRow 7: 1 1 0 ... (columns 0 and 1 are 1, others 0)\n\nRow 8: 8 8 0 ... (columns 0 and 1 are 8, others 0)\n\nIn the output, these non-zero values should be expanded into a region. For example, the 1s in row 7 might be expanded into a horizontal strip that starts at row 7, columns 0-1, and expands to the right and down. Similarly, the 8s in row 8 would be expanded into a horizontal strip that starts at row 8, columns 0-1 and expands to the right and down.\n\nBut how to model this? Maybe the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a rectangle that starts at their original position and extends in certain directions. For example, the 1s in row 7, columns 0-1 are expanded into a rectangle that starts at row 7, column 0 and extends to the right and down. Similarly for the 8s.\n\nBut how to determine the size of the rectangle? For example, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in row 4 are spread into a rectangle that starts at row 3, column 2 and extends to row 4, column 9. But the original non-zero values are in row 4, columns 0 and 1.\n\nThis is quite challenging. Given the time constraints, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples.\n\nLet me think about the pattern in Example 3. The input has a 1 in row 7, column 0, and 2 in row 7, column 1. The output for row 7 has 1s in columns 0-1, then 1s in columns 2-7, and then 2s in columns 7-13. This suggests that the 1s are expanded to the right and down, and the 2s are also expanded to the right and down. But how?\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a rectangle that starts at a certain offset from the original position. For example, the original 1 in row 7, column 0 is expanded into a rectangle that starts at row 7, column 0 and extends to the right and down. Similarly, the 2 in row 7, column 1 is expanded into a rectangle that starts at row 7, column 1 and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how to determine the size of the rectangle? Perhaps the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a certain number of columns and rows away. For example, the original non-zero value is expanded into a region that is 3 columns to the right and 3 rows down.\n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in row 4 are spread into a region that starts in row 3 and column 2, and extends to the right and down. The 1 in row 5 is spread into a region that starts in row 5, column 0 and extends to the right.\n\nThis suggests that the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away from their original position. For example, the original non-zero value in row 4, column 0 is spread into a region that starts at row 3, column 2 (which is row-1, column+2). Similarly, the original non-zero value in row 4, column 1 is spread into row 3, column 3 (row-1, column+3).\n\nBut this seems arbitrary. Alternatively, maybe the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away, but this depends on their position in the input.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being generated by taking the non-zero values in the input and expanding them into a region that is a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 are expanded into a region that forms a rectangle that starts at row 3, column 2 and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how to model this in code?\n\nPerhaps the key is to find that for each non-zero value in the input, it is expanded into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away, and the value is copied into that region. For example, the original value is expanded into a rectangle that starts at (row - 3, column + 2) and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a certain distance away from their original position, and the expansion is in a way that the value is copied into adjacent cells. For example, the 2 in row 4, column 0 is expanded into a region that starts at row 3, column 2, and then expands to the right and down.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nMaybe the following approach:\n\nFor each cell (i, j) in the input grid, if the value is non-zero, then in the output grid, it is expanded into a region that starts at a certain position and extends in certain directions. The exact position and size of the region depend on the original cell's position.\n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that the non-zero values are expanded into a region that starts at a certain offset. For example, in Example 1, the 2 and 3 in row 4 are expanded into a region that starts at row 3, column 2. The 1 in row 5 is expanded into a region that starts at row 5, column 0.\n\nThis suggests that the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away from their original position. For example, the original cell is at (i, j), and the expansion starts at (i-1, j+2). But this is just a guess based on the first example.\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a rectangle that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being generated by expanding the non-zero values into a region that is a certain distance away from their original position. For example, the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a rectangle that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following hypothesis: the non-zero values in the input are expanded into a region that starts at a certain offset from their original position, and the value is copied into that region. The exact offset is determined by the original position.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the non-zero values in row 4 (input) are expanded into a region that starts at row 3, column 2. This suggests that the offset is (row - 1, column + 2). Similarly, the 1 in row 5 is expanded into a region that starts at row 5, column 0.\n\nBut how to generalize this? Perhaps the expansion is such that for each non-zero value at (i, j), the output is filled with that value in a rectangle that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut this is just a guess. To implement this, I need to find for each non-zero value in the input, the region in the output grid where it should be copied.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away, and the value is copied into that region. For example, the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a rectangle that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how to determine the size of the rectangle?\n\nAnother approach: look at the output for Example 1. The 2 and 3 in row 4 (input) are spread into a region that covers rows 3-4 and columns 2-9. The 1 in row 5 is spread into a region that covers row 5 and columns 0-13. This suggests that the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away.\n\nBut how to determine the starting point?\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being generated by expanding the non-zero values into a region that is a certain shape, such as a rectangle, and the shape is determined by the position of the non-zero value in the input.\n\nBut without more examples, this is challenging.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each non-zero value in the input, expand it into a region that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the non-zero values are expanded into a region that starts at (i - 2, j + 2) and extends to the right and down. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 4 (i=4) is expanded into row 3 (i-1), column 2 (j+2). The 3 in row 4 is expanded into row 3, column 3 (j+3). This might be a possible pattern.\n\nBut how to implement this?\n\nThe output grid is 10 rows by 14 columns. So for each cell in the input grid, if it's non-zero, we need to determine which cells in the output grid should be filled with that value.\n\nFor example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 4 (input) is at (4, 0). The output starts at row 3, column 2. So the value 2 is copied into the output grid starting at (3, 2) and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how far does it extend? In the output for row 3, columns 2-5 are 2, and columns 6-9 are 3. So the 2 is spread into columns 2-5, and the 3 is spread into columns 6-9.\n\nThis suggests that for each non-zero value in the input, the value is spread into a region that starts at a certain offset and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how to determine the offset and the size of the region?\n\nMaybe the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that starts at (i - 3, j + 2), and extends to the right and down for a certain number of rows and columns.\n\nBut without more examples, this is hard to confirm.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code logic:\n\nFor each cell (i, j) in the input grid, if the value is non-zero, then in the output grid, we fill a region starting at (i - 3, j + 2), and extend to the right and down. However, this is just a guess.\n\nBut this might not work for all examples. For example, in Example 3, the input has a 1 in row 7, column 0, which would be expanded into row 4 (7-3=4), column 2 (0+2=2). The output for row 4 in Example 3 is:\n\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n\nWait, this is the fifth row of the output. But according to this logic, the 1 in row 7, column 0 would be expanded into row 4, column 2. But in the output, the 1s start at row 4, column 14? Or perhaps this is not the correct approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the expansion is such that the non-zero values are spread into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away, but the exact pattern is unclear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code: for each non-zero value in the input, expand it into a rectangle that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down. If this is not correct, the code will not work, but it's the best I can do with the given examples.\n\nBut how to implement this in code?\n\nThe output grid is 10 rows by 14 columns. For each cell in the input, if it's non-zero, we need to determine which cells in the output should be filled with that value.\n\nBut how to handle the expansion? For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 4, column 0 is expanded into a region that starts at row 3, column 2 and extends to the right and down. The 3 in row 4, column 1 is expanded into row 3, column 3 and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut how to determine the size of the region?\n\nAlternatively, the expansion is such that the non-zero value is copied into a region that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down for 4 rows and 7 columns. But this is arbitrary.\n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by expanding each non-zero value into a region that is a rectangle, where the rectangle starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down for a certain number of rows and columns.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\n- Create a 10x14 grid filled with 0s.\n- For each cell (i, j) in the input grid:\n   - if the value is non-zero:\n      - calculate the starting row and column in the output grid.\n      - for each row in the output grid from start_row to 9:\n         - for each column in the output grid from start_col to 13:\n             - set the output cell to the input value.\n\nBut how to determine start_row and start_col?\n\nIn Example 1, the 2 in row 4 (i=4) is expanded into row 3 (start_row = i - 1), column 2 (start_col = j + 2). Similarly, the 3 in row 4, column 1 is expanded into row 3, column 3.\n\nThis suggests that start_row = i - 1, start_col = j + 2.\n\nBut for the 1 in row 5, start_row = 5 - 1 = 4, start_col = 0 + 2 = 2. But in the output, the 1 in row 5 is spread across the entire row, which starts at column 0. So this approach might not work for that case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the start_row and start_col are determined based on the original position. For example, the start_row is i - 3, start_col is j + 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, the start_row is i - 3, start_col is j + 2. For example, in Example 1, the 2 in row 4 (i=4) would start at row 1 (4-3=1), column 2 (j=0 + 2=2). But in the output, the 2 is in row 3, so this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe the correct approach is to look for the pattern in the examples and find that the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a certain distance away, and the expansion is such that the value is copied into a rectangle that starts at a certain position and extends to the right and down.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to know.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code:\n\n- Create a 10x14 grid filled with 0s.\n- For each cell (i, j) in the input grid:\n   - if the value is non-zero:\n      - calculate the starting row and column in the output grid as (i - 3, j + 2).\n      - for each row in the output grid from start_row to 9:\n         - for each column in the output grid from start_col to 13:\n             - set the output cell to the input value.\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, this may not work for all examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nNow, let's test this with Example 1.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has a 2 at (4, 0). start_row = 4 - 3 = 1, start_col = 0 + 2 = 2. So the output cells from row 1 to 9, columns 2 to 13 are set to 2. But in the output, the 2 is only in rows 3-4, columns 2-5 and 6-9. So this approach would overwrite too much, which is not correct.\n\nThis suggests that the approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: the non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a certain number of rows and columns away, but only in certain directions. For example, the non-zero value is expanded into a region that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down for a certain number of rows and columns.\n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is not helpful.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following code that tries to expand non-zero values into a region that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down, but only for a certain number of rows and columns. This is a guess, but it's the best I can do.\n\nThe code would look like this:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*14 for _ in range(10)]\n    for i in range(len(grid)):\n        for j in range(len(grid[0])):\n            val = grid[i][j]\n            if val != 0:\n                start_row = max(0, i - 3)\n                start_col = max(0, j + 2)\n                end_row = min(9, i + 3)\n                end_col = min(13, j + 10)\n                for row in range(start_row, end_row + 1):\n                    for col in range(start_col, end_col + 1):\n                        output[row][col] = val\n    return output\n\nBut this is just a guess. In Example 1, the 2 at (4, 0) would start at row 1, column 2, and extend to row 7, column 12. This would overwrite many cells, but in the output, the 2 is only in rows 3-4, columns 2-5 and 6-9. So this approach is not correct.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll have to make a best guess based on the examples. The correct pattern is likely that non-zero values are expanded into a region that is a certain distance away, and the expansion is such that the value is copied into a rectangle that starts at a certain offset.\n\nBut without more information, I'll proceed with the following code, which tries to expand non-zero values into a region that starts at (i - 3, j + 2) and extends to the right and down for a certain number of rows and columns. This is a guess, but it's the best I can do.\n"
