          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, the task is to transform the input grid into the output grid. Let's look at the examples provided.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input and output grids are both 7x9. The input has some 6s and 0s, and the output has some changes. For instance, in the sixth row of the input, it's 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. The output for that row is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. So the middle elements changed from 6s to 8s and 7s. Hmm, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their neighbors or some rule.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has a row like 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4, and the output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the middle elements changed from 8s to 0s and 6s. Wait, but in the output, the first row of example 2 is the same as input. So maybe some rows are unchanged, others are modified.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Example 3, the input has a row like 6 0 6 4 6 0 0 4 6, and the output is the same. But another row in example 3's input is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6, and the output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So here, the fourth element changes from 0 to 8, and the eighth element changes from 0 to 8. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced based on their neighbors.\n\nLooking for possible patterns. Let's think about the positions. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers based on their neighbors. For example, in example 1, the sixth row's middle elements (positions 3-6) are changed from 6 to 8 and 7. Maybe there's a rule where if a cell is surrounded by certain numbers, it's replaced with another.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid operation, like replacing numbers based on their row or column. Let's check the rows. For example, in example 1, the second row of input is all 6s, and the output is the same. So that row is unchanged. But in example 2, the second row of input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4, and the output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the middle elements are changed. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their position in the row or column.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of example 1. The sixth row of output is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The input for that row was 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. So the first and last elements are same. The middle elements (positions 2-7) are changed. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input for row 5 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's check the examples. The input for example 1 is 7 rows, so rows 0-6. The sixth row in example 1's input is row 5 (if 0-based). The output for that row is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. So the original row was 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. The output has 4, then 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 4. So the positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (assuming 0-based) are 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7. So maybe the original 6s are being replaced with 7s and 8s. But how?\n\nLooking at the original input, the sixth row (row 5) in example 1 has 0s in positions 1 and 2, and 6s in positions 3-6. The output has 8s and 7s. Maybe the transformation depends on the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is adjacent to certain values, it changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the sum of neighboring cells. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's based on the position in the grid. For example, certain cells are replaced based on their row or column.\n\nAnother thought: in example 1, the output for row 5 is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The original input for that row was 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. The output has 8s and 7s in the middle. Maybe the 0s are replaced with 8s and 6s are replaced with 7s? But in the original row, the 0s are in positions 1 and 2, and the 6s are in positions 3-6. The output for those positions is 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 8s, and the 6s are replaced with 7s. But why?\n\nBut then, looking at example 2, in the second row of input, the original is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are being replaced with 6s and 0s. So maybe the rule is different based on the original value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain cells are modified. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 3. The input row is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6, and the output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So the fourth and eighth elements (positions 3 and 7) are changed from 0 to 8. Maybe this is a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their column. For example, columns 3 and 7 are modified.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the positions where the transformation occurs. For example, in example 1, the sixth row's middle elements (positions 1-6) are changed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell to the left or right. For instance, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with 8, and if it's 6, it's replaced with 7. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of adjacent 6s. For example, in example 1, the sixth row's original cells are 0,0,6,6,6,6,0,4. The output for these cells is 8,8,7,7,7,7,8,4. So the 0s are replaced with 8, and the 6s are replaced with 7. So maybe if the original value is 0, it's replaced with 8, and if it's 6, it's replaced with 7. But then in example 2, the input has 7 and 8 in some positions, and the output has 6 and 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell above or below. For example, if a cell is 0, and the cell above is 6, then replace with 8. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 3. The input row is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. The output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So the 0s at positions 3 and 7 are changed to 8. Maybe this is a pattern where certain positions (like columns 3 and 7) are modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 2. The second row of input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are being replaced with 6s and 0s. Maybe the transformation is based on the original value. For example, if the original value is 7, replace with 6, and if it's 8, replace with 0. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, in example 1, the sixth row's original values are 0,0,6,6,6,6,0,4. The output for those positions is 8,8,7,7,7,7,8,4. So the 0s become 8s, and the 6s become 7s. Then, the 4 remains as 4. So perhaps the rule is: if the original value is 0, replace with 8; if it's 6, replace with 7. But in example 2, the second row of input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are replaced with 6 and 0. So maybe there's a different rule for different positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the original value and some other value. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the position in the grid. For example, certain cells are modified based on their row or column. For instance, in example 1, the sixth row (row 5) is modified. But in example 2, the second row is modified. Maybe rows 1, 2, 3, etc., are modified in different ways.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the output of example 3. The input row is 6 0 6 4 6 0 0 4 6. The output is the same. But another row in example 3's input is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6, and the output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So in this case, the fourth and eighth elements are changed from 0 to 8. Maybe this is a pattern where certain positions (like columns 3 and 7) are modified. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell to the left or right. For example, if a cell is 0 and the cell to the left is 6, then replace with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid pattern. For example, in example 1, the output for row 5 is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The original row is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. So the first and last elements are same. The middle elements are 8,8,7,7,7,7. Maybe the pattern is that for certain positions, the value is determined by the number of adjacent 6s. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 6s, it becomes 7. But again, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of parity or distance from the edges. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain cells are modified. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output in the examples. Let's take example 1. The output for row 5 is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The input is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. So the changes are:\n\nOriginal: [4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4]\nOutput: [4, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 4]\n\nSo positions 1 and 2 (original 0s) become 8, 8. Positions 3-6 (original 6s) become 7, 7, 7, 7. Position 7 (original 0) becomes 8.\n\nSo for the original 0s, they are replaced with 8. For original 6s, they are replaced with 7. But why? Maybe the rule is that 0 becomes 8, and 6 becomes 7. But then in example 2, the second row of input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are replaced with 6 and 0. So maybe there's a different rule for different values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, in example 1, the 0s in positions 1 and 2 are replaced with 8, and the 6s are replaced with 7. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the value of the cell to the left or right. For example, if a cell is 0 and the cell to the left is 6, then replace with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, in example 1, the sixth row's original values are 0,0,6,6,6,6,0,4. The output for these positions is 8,8,7,7,7,7,8,4. So the 0s are replaced with 8, and the 6s with 7. So maybe the rule is: if the original value is 0, replace with 8; if it's 6, replace with 7. But in example 2, the second row's input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are replaced with 6 and 0. So this would suggest that the rule is different for different values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the value of the cell above it. For example, if the cell above is 6, then replace with 7. But again, without more data, this is hard to determine.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output for row 5 is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The original row is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. The output for the first and last elements is the same as input. The middle elements are modified. So maybe the transformation is applied to certain positions, like the middle of the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position in the grid. For example, in the middle of the grid (like columns 3-6), the values are replaced. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original value and the number of adjacent 6s. For example, if a cell is 0 and has neighbors with 6s, it becomes 8. But this is getting too speculative.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern that can explain multiple examples. For instance, in example 1, the 0s become 8, and 6s become 7. In example 2, the 7s and 8s become 6 and 0. In example 3, the 0s become 8. So maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell in the same row or column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following rule: if the original value is 0, replace with 8; if it's 6, replace with 7; if it's 7, replace with 6; if it's 8, replace with 0. But this is just a guess, but let's test it against the examples.\n\nIn example 1, the input row 5 has 0s and 6s, which would become 8 and 7. That fits. In example 2, the input row 1 has 7 and 8, which would become 6 and 0. That fits. In example 3, the input row 2 has 0s, which would become 8. That fits. So this seems to be a possible pattern.\n\nBut wait, in example 2, the second row of input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s become 6 and 0, and the 8s become 0. But according to the rule I mentioned, 7 becomes 6 and 8 becomes 0. That would fit. So this seems to be a possible pattern.\n\nSo the rule could be: replace each cell with a value based on the original value. Let's make a mapping:\n\nOriginal value \u2192 new value:\n\n0 \u2192 8\n\n6 \u2192 7\n\n7 \u2192 6\n\n8 \u2192 0\n\nBut what about other values? For example, in example 2, the input row is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 4s remain the same. So maybe the rule is that for each cell, if the original value is in the set {0,6,7,8}, it is replaced according to the mapping. Otherwise, it remains the same.\n\nBut what about other values like 4, 5, 9, etc.? In example 1, the input has 4, which is unchanged. In example 2, the input has 4, which is unchanged. In example 3, the input has 6, 0, 4, etc., which are replaced according to the mapping.\n\nSo this seems to fit the examples. Let's check example 3.\n\nIn example 3's input, the first row is 6 0 6 4 6 0 0 4 6. The output is the same. So the 6s are replaced with 7s? Wait, no. The output is the same as input. But according to the mapping, 6 should be replaced with 7. But in example 3's output, the first row is the same as input. So this contradicts the earlier hypothesis.\n\nWait, example 3's input is:\n\nInput:\n6 0 6 4 6 0 0 4 6\n6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6\n0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0\n6 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6\n6 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 6\n6 6 6 4 0 6 6 4 0\n\nOutput:\n6 0 6 4 6 0 0 4 6\n6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6\n0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0\n6 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 6\n6 0 0 7 6 0 0 8 6\n6 6 6 4 0 6 6 4 0\n\nSo for the first row of input, the output is the same. But according to the mapping, the 6s should be replaced with 7s. But in the output, the first row is unchanged. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So the earlier idea that 6 becomes 7 is not correct. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLet me look again. In example 3's output, the third row of input is 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. The output is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. So the fourth element (originally 0) is replaced with 8, and the eighth element (originally 6) is replaced with 7. So for the original 0, it becomes 8, and for original 6, it becomes 7. But in the first row of example 3's input, the original values are 6, 0, 6, 4, 6, 0, 0, 4, 6. The output is the same as input. So why is that? Because in the output, the 6s are not changed. So this contradicts the earlier hypothesis.\n\nSo this suggests that the rule is not as simple as replacing 0\u21928 and 6\u21927. So there must be another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in example 3's output, the third row has 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. The original row was 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. So the fourth element (0) becomes 8, and the eighth element (6) becomes 7. So maybe this is based on the position. For example, columns 3 and 7 are modified. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell in the grid. For example, certain cells are modified based on their row or column.\n\nLooking at example 3's output, the third row of input is modified in columns 3 and 7. Similarly, in example 1's sixth row, the middle columns are modified. Maybe the pattern is that for certain positions (like columns 3, 4, 5, 6, 7?), the values are modified based on their original value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell in the same column. For example, if the cell is in column 3, then it's replaced based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell to the left or right. For example, if a cell is 0 and the cell to the left is 6, then replace with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 3's third row: the fourth element (originally 0) becomes 8, and the eighth element (originally 6) becomes 7. So maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, in columns 3 and 7, the 0s become 8 and 6s become 7. But why those columns?\n\nIn example 1's sixth row, the middle columns (positions 3-6) are modified. So maybe the transformation is applied to certain columns based on their position. For example, columns 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are modified in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied to certain cells based on their row and column. For example, in rows 1-5, certain columns are modified.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The second row of input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s are replaced with 6 and 0, and the 8s are replaced with 0. But why?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the number of adjacent 6s. For example, if a cell has a certain number of 6s around it, it changes. But this is hard to determine without more data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the original value is 0, and the cell to the left is 6, then replace with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell in the same column. For example, if the cell is in column 3 and the original value is 0, replace with 8.\n\nBut how to determine this without more data?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the original value is 0, replace with 8; if it's 6, replace with 7; if it's 7, replace with 6; if it's 8, replace with 0. But this doesn't explain example 3's first row.\n\nWait, in example 3's first row, the output is the same as input. So for that row, the original values are 6, 0, 6, 4, 6, 0, 0, 4, 6. According to the rule, the 6s should become 7, the 0s become 8, and the 4s remain. But the output is the same. So this suggests that the rule is not applied to all cells. So perhaps the rule is applied to certain cells based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied only to certain cells, like those in the middle of the grid. For example, in example 1, the sixth row's middle columns are modified. In example 3, the third row's columns 3 and 7 are modified. Maybe the transformation is applied to certain positions based on their row and column.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 3's third row, the fourth element (column 3) is changed from 0 to 8. In example 1's sixth row, the fourth element (column 3) is changed from 6 to 7. So maybe column 3 is a special column where certain values are replaced. Similarly, column 7 is modified in example 3's third row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied to cells in certain columns, like columns 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. For example, in example 1's sixth row, columns 3-6 are modified. In example 3's third row, columns 3 and 7 are modified.\n\nBut this is still not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in example 3's output, the third row has 8 in column 3 and 7 in column 7. In example 1's sixth row, the middle columns are 7,7,7,7. So maybe for certain columns, the transformation is applied based on the original value and the column number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position in the row. For example, if the cell is in row 5 (sixth row), then certain columns are modified.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to find a pattern.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern that can explain as many examples as possible, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLet's try to find a rule that works for example 1, 2, and 3.\n\nIn example 1's sixth row, the 0s become 8, and the 6s become 7.\n\nIn example 2's second row, the 7s become 6 and 0, and the 8s become 0.\n\nIn example 3's third row, the 0 becomes 8 and the 6 becomes 7.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is:\n\n- If the original value is 0, replace with 8.\n- If the original value is 6, replace with 7.\n- If the original value is 7, replace with 6.\n- If the original value is 8, replace with 0.\n- For other values, leave unchanged.\n\nBut in example 3's first row, the output is unchanged. So why? Because in that row, the original values are 6, 0, 6, 4, 6, 0, 0, 4, 6. According to the rule, the 6s should be replaced with 7, the 0s with 8, and the 4s remain. But the output is the same. This suggests that the rule is not applied to all cells, but only to certain cells.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is applied only to certain cells, like those in the middle of the grid. For example, in example 1's sixth row, the middle columns are modified. In example 3's third row, the fourth and eighth columns are modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied to cells that are not in the first or last row or column. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied to cells that are in certain rows and columns. For example, in example 1, the sixth row is modified. In example 3, the third row is modified.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is applied to cells that are not in the first or last column. For example, in example 1's sixth row, the middle columns are modified. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to implement the rule that replaces 0\u21928, 6\u21927, 7\u21926, 8\u21920, and leave other values as is. Even though it doesn't explain example 3's first row, it might be that in that row, the transformation is not applied. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied to certain cells based on their position in the grid. For example, in rows 1-5, certain columns are modified, and in other rows, not. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is applied to cells that are in the middle of the grid, like columns 3-6, and rows 1-5.\n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nGiven the time, I think the best approach is to proceed with the rule that replaces 0\u21928, 6\u21927, 7\u21926, 8\u21920, and leave others as is. Even though it doesn't explain example 3's first row, it might be that in that case, the transformation is not applied. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is applied only to certain positions, like those in the middle of the grid. For example, in example 1's sixth row, the middle columns are modified. In example 3's third row, columns 3 and 7 are modified. So maybe the rule is applied to cells in columns 3-7.\n\nLet's test this. In example 1's sixth row, the columns 3-7 are modified. In example 3's third row, columns 3 and 7 are modified. So perhaps the rule is applied to columns 3-7.\n\nSo for each cell in columns 3-7, apply the rule: 0\u21928, 6\u21927, 7\u21926, 8\u21920. For other columns, leave as is.\n\nLet's check example 1's sixth row. Columns 3-7 are 6,6,6,6,0. According to the rule, these would become 7,7,7,7,8. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 2's second row: columns 3-7 are 7,8,7,8,8. According to the rule, these would become 6,0,6,0,0. Which matches the output (the second row of example 2's output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So columns 3-7 are 6,0,6,0,0. Which matches the transformed values.\n\nExample 3's third row: columns 3-7 are 0,0,0,6,0. According to the rule, these would become 8,8,8,7,8. But the output is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. So columns 3-7 are 8,0,0,7,8. Wait, the original row is 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. Columns 3-7 are 0,0,0,0,6. Applying the rule: 0\u21928, 0\u21928, 0\u21928, 0\u21928, 6\u21927. So the transformed values would be 8,8,8,8,7. But in the output, the third row is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. So columns 3-7 are 8, 0, 0, 0, 7. So this doesn't match. Hmm, this suggests that the rule is not applied to all columns 3-7.\n\nBut in example 3's third row, the fourth column (column 3) is 0 \u2192 8. The fifth column (column 4) is 0 \u2192 8, but in the output, it's 0. So this contradicts the rule.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nAt this point, it's clear that the pattern is not straightforward. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the rule that replaces 0\u21928, 6\u21927, 7\u21926, 8\u21920, and leave other values as is, even if it doesn't explain all examples. This seems to fit example 1 and 2, but not example 3. However, perhaps the test input has a pattern that fits this rule.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 0:\n                new_row.append(8)\n            elif val == 6:\n                new_row.append(7)\n            elif val == 7:\n                new_row.append(6)\n            elif val == 8:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, the output for example 3's first row is the same as input. According to this code, the first row would have 6 \u2192 7, 0 \u2192 8, etc. So why is the output the same?\n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct. But perhaps the transformation is applied only to certain cells, like those in the middle of the grid.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is applied only to cells that are not in the first or last row or column. For example, in example 1's sixth row (row 5), the middle columns are modified. In example 3's third row, the middle columns are modified.\n\nSo, for each cell in rows 1-5 (assuming 0-based) and columns 3-7 (assuming 0-based), apply the rule. For other cells, leave as is.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample 1's sixth row (row 5) is in rows 1-5 (assuming 0-based, rows 0-6). So row 5 is included. Columns 3-7 are modified. So the code would apply the rule to those cells.\n\nExample 3's third row (row 2) is included. Columns 3-7 are modified.\n\nIn example 3's third row, the original row is [0,6,6,0,0,0,0,6,0]. Columns 3-7 are 0,0,0,0,6. Applying the rule: 0\u21928, 0\u21928, 0\u21928, 0\u21928, 6\u21927. So the transformed values would be 8,8,8,8,7. But the output for this row is [0,6,6,8,0,0,0,7,0]. So the fourth column (column 3) is 8, the fifth (column 4) is 0, sixth (column 5) is 0, seventh (column 6) is 0, eighth (column 7) is 7. This doesn't match the transformed values.\n\nSo this suggests that the rule is not applied to all columns 3-7.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time, I'll proceed with the initial rule, even if it doesn't explain all examples, and hope that it works for the test input.\n\nBut wait, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 4 6 6 0 4 6 4 0\n0 6 0 0 0 6 6 6 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 6 6 6\n6 6 6 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\n0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\n6 6 6 6 0 6 0 6 6\n0 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n\nApplying the rule: replace 0\u21928, 6\u21927, 7\u21926, 8\u21920.\n\nBut in the test input, there are no 7s or 8s. So the transformation would replace 0\u21928 and 6\u21927.\n\nSo for example, the first row of test input is 0 4 6 6 0 4 6 4 0. After transformation, it would be 8 4 7 7 8 4 7 4 8.\n\nBut the test input's output is not provided, so I can't verify. But the code would transform the input according to this rule.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 0:\n                new_row.append(8)\n            elif val == 6:\n                new_row.append(7)\n            elif val == 7:\n                new_row.append(6)\n            elif val == 8:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not be correct. However, given the time and the examples provided, this is the best I can do.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern from the training examples. So, the task is to transform the input grid into the output grid. Let's look at the examples provided.\n\nStarting with Example 1. The input and output grids are both 7x9. The input has some 6s and 0s, and the output has some changes. For instance, in the sixth row of the input, it's 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. The output for that row is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. So the middle elements changed from 6s to 8s and 7s. Hmm, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their neighbors or some rule.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input has a row like 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4, and the output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the middle elements changed from 8s to 0s and 6s. Wait, but in the output, the first row of example 2 is the same as input. So maybe some rows are unchanged, others are modified.\n\nAnother thing to note: in Example 3, the input has a row like 6 0 6 4 6 0 0 4 6, and the output is the same. But another row in example 3's input is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6, and the output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So here, the fourth element changes from 0 to 8, and the eighth element changes from 0 to 8. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are replaced based on their neighbors.\n\nLooking for possible patterns. Let's think about the positions. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers based on their neighbors. For example, in example 1, the sixth row's middle elements (positions 3-6) are changed from 6 to 8 and 7. Maybe there's a rule where if a cell is surrounded by certain numbers, it's replaced with another.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid operation, like replacing numbers based on their row or column. Let's check the rows. For example, in example 1, the second row of input is all 6s, and the output is the same. So that row is unchanged. But in example 2, the second row of input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4, and the output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the middle elements are changed. Maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their position in the row or column.\n\nAnother approach: look at the output of example 1. The sixth row of output is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The input for that row was 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. So the first and last elements are same. The middle elements (positions 2-7) are changed. Let's see:\n\nOriginal input for row 5 (assuming 0-based or 1-based? Let's check the examples. The input for example 1 is 7 rows, so rows 0-6. The sixth row in example 1's input is row 5 (if 0-based). The output for that row is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. So the original row was 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. The output has 4, then 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 4. So the positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (assuming 0-based) are 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7. So maybe the original 6s are being replaced with 7s and 8s. But how?\n\nLooking at the original input, the sixth row (row 5) in example 1 has 0s in positions 1 and 2, and 6s in positions 3-6. The output has 8s and 7s. Maybe the transformation depends on the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is adjacent to certain values, it changes.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's based on the sum of neighboring cells. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's based on the position in the grid. For example, certain cells are replaced based on their row or column.\n\nAnother thought: in example 1, the output for row 5 is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The original input for that row was 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. The output has 8s and 7s in the middle. Maybe the 0s are replaced with 8s and 6s are replaced with 7s? But in the original row, the 0s are in positions 1 and 2, and the 6s are in positions 3-6. The output for those positions is 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7. So maybe the 0s are replaced with 8s, and the 6s are replaced with 7s. But why?\n\nBut then, looking at example 2, in the second row of input, the original is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are being replaced with 6s and 0s. So maybe the rule is different based on the original value. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of pattern where certain cells are replaced based on their position. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain cells are modified. But how?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 3. The input row is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6, and the output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So the fourth and eighth elements (positions 3 and 7) are changed from 0 to 8. Maybe this is a pattern where certain positions are modified based on their column. For example, columns 3 and 7 are modified.\n\nAlternatively, looking for the positions where the transformation occurs. For example, in example 1, the sixth row's middle elements (positions 1-6) are changed. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell to the left or right. For instance, if a cell is 0, it's replaced with 8, and if it's 6, it's replaced with 7. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of adjacent 6s. For example, in example 1, the sixth row's original cells are 0,0,6,6,6,6,0,4. The output for these cells is 8,8,7,7,7,7,8,4. So the 0s are replaced with 8, and the 6s are replaced with 7. So maybe if the original value is 0, it's replaced with 8, and if it's 6, it's replaced with 7. But then in example 2, the input has 7 and 8 in some positions, and the output has 6 and 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell above or below. For example, if a cell is 0, and the cell above is 6, then replace with 8. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 3. The input row is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6. The output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So the 0s at positions 3 and 7 are changed to 8. Maybe this is a pattern where certain positions (like columns 3 and 7) are modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 2. The second row of input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are being replaced with 6s and 0s. Maybe the transformation is based on the original value. For example, if the original value is 7, replace with 6, and if it's 8, replace with 0. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position. For example, in example 1, the sixth row's original values are 0,0,6,6,6,6,0,4. The output for those positions is 8,8,7,7,7,7,8,4. So the 0s become 8s, and the 6s become 7s. Then, the 4 remains as 4. So perhaps the rule is: if the original value is 0, replace with 8; if it's 6, replace with 7. But in example 2, the second row of input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are replaced with 6 and 0. So maybe there's a different rule for different positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the sum of the original value and some other value. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the position in the grid. For example, certain cells are modified based on their row or column. For instance, in example 1, the sixth row (row 5) is modified. But in example 2, the second row is modified. Maybe rows 1, 2, 3, etc., are modified in different ways.\n\nAnother thought: looking at the output of example 3. The input row is 6 0 6 4 6 0 0 4 6. The output is the same. But another row in example 3's input is 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6, and the output is 6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6. So in this case, the fourth and eighth elements are changed from 0 to 8. Maybe this is a pattern where certain positions (like columns 3 and 7) are modified. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell to the left or right. For example, if a cell is 0 and the cell to the left is 6, then replace with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of grid pattern. For example, in example 1, the output for row 5 is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The original row is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. So the first and last elements are same. The middle elements are 8,8,7,7,7,7. Maybe the pattern is that for certain positions, the value is determined by the number of adjacent 6s. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 6s, it becomes 7. But again, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on some kind of parity or distance from the edges. For example, in the middle of the grid, certain cells are modified. But without more examples, it's hard to see.\n\nAnother approach: look for the difference between input and output in the examples. Let's take example 1. The output for row 5 is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The input is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. So the changes are:\n\nOriginal: [4, 0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 6, 0, 4]\nOutput: [4, 8, 8, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8, 4]\n\nSo positions 1 and 2 (original 0s) become 8, 8. Positions 3-6 (original 6s) become 7, 7, 7, 7. Position 7 (original 0) becomes 8.\n\nSo for the original 0s, they are replaced with 8. For original 6s, they are replaced with 7. But why? Maybe the rule is that 0 becomes 8, and 6 becomes 7. But then in example 2, the second row of input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are replaced with 6 and 0. So maybe there's a different rule for different values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, in example 1, the 0s in positions 1 and 2 are replaced with 8, and the 6s are replaced with 7. But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the value of the cell to the left or right. For example, if a cell is 0 and the cell to the left is 6, then replace with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell in the same row or column. For example, in example 1, the sixth row's original values are 0,0,6,6,6,6,0,4. The output for these positions is 8,8,7,7,7,7,8,4. So the 0s are replaced with 8, and the 6s with 7. So maybe the rule is: if the original value is 0, replace with 8; if it's 6, replace with 7. But in example 2, the second row's input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s and 8s are replaced with 6 and 0. So this would suggest that the rule is different for different values. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the value of the cell above it. For example, if the cell above is 6, then replace with 7. But again, without more data, this is hard to determine.\n\nAnother observation: in example 1, the output for row 5 is 4 8 8 7 7 7 7 8 4. The original row is 4 0 0 6 6 6 6 0 4. The output for the first and last elements is the same as input. The middle elements are modified. So maybe the transformation is applied to certain positions, like the middle of the row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position in the grid. For example, in the middle of the grid (like columns 3-6), the values are replaced. But again, this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the original value and the number of adjacent 6s. For example, if a cell is 0 and has neighbors with 6s, it becomes 8. But this is getting too speculative.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern that can explain multiple examples. For instance, in example 1, the 0s become 8, and 6s become 7. In example 2, the 7s and 8s become 6 and 0. In example 3, the 0s become 8. So maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell in the same row or column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following rule: if the original value is 0, replace with 8; if it's 6, replace with 7; if it's 7, replace with 6; if it's 8, replace with 0. But this is just a guess, but let's test it against the examples.\n\nIn example 1, the input row 5 has 0s and 6s, which would become 8 and 7. That fits. In example 2, the input row 1 has 7 and 8, which would become 6 and 0. That fits. In example 3, the input row 2 has 0s, which would become 8. That fits. So this seems to be a possible pattern.\n\nBut wait, in example 2, the second row of input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s become 6 and 0, and the 8s become 0. But according to the rule I mentioned, 7 becomes 6 and 8 becomes 0. That would fit. So this seems to be a possible pattern.\n\nSo the rule could be: replace each cell with a value based on the original value. Let's make a mapping:\n\nOriginal value \u2192 new value:\n\n0 \u2192 8\n\n6 \u2192 7\n\n7 \u2192 6\n\n8 \u2192 0\n\nBut what about other values? For example, in example 2, the input row is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 4s remain the same. So maybe the rule is that for each cell, if the original value is in the set {0,6,7,8}, it is replaced according to the mapping. Otherwise, it remains the same.\n\nBut what about other values like 4, 5, 9, etc.? In example 1, the input has 4, which is unchanged. In example 2, the input has 4, which is unchanged. In example 3, the input has 6, 0, 4, etc., which are replaced according to the mapping.\n\nSo this seems to fit the examples. Let's check example 3.\n\nIn example 3's input, the first row is 6 0 6 4 6 0 0 4 6. The output is the same. So the 6s are replaced with 7s? Wait, no. The output is the same as input. But according to the mapping, 6 should be replaced with 7. But in example 3's output, the first row is the same as input. So this contradicts the earlier hypothesis.\n\nWait, example 3's input is:\n\nInput:\n6 0 6 4 6 0 0 4 6\n6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0 6\n0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0\n6 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 6\n6 0 0 6 6 0 0 0 6\n6 6 6 4 0 6 6 4 0\n\nOutput:\n6 0 6 4 6 0 0 4 6\n6 0 6 8 0 6 0 8 6\n0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0\n6 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 6\n6 0 0 7 6 0 0 8 6\n6 6 6 4 0 6 6 4 0\n\nSo for the first row of input, the output is the same. But according to the mapping, the 6s should be replaced with 7s. But in the output, the first row is unchanged. So this suggests that the hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nHmm, this is a problem. So the earlier idea that 6 becomes 7 is not correct. So maybe there's a different pattern.\n\nLet me look again. In example 3's output, the third row of input is 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. The output is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. So the fourth element (originally 0) is replaced with 8, and the eighth element (originally 6) is replaced with 7. So for the original 0, it becomes 8, and for original 6, it becomes 7. But in the first row of example 3's input, the original values are 6, 0, 6, 4, 6, 0, 0, 4, 6. The output is the same as input. So why is that? Because in the output, the 6s are not changed. So this contradicts the earlier hypothesis.\n\nSo this suggests that the rule is not as simple as replacing 0\u21928 and 6\u21927. So there must be another pattern.\n\nAnother observation: in example 3's output, the third row has 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. The original row was 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. So the fourth element (0) becomes 8, and the eighth element (6) becomes 7. So maybe this is based on the position. For example, columns 3 and 7 are modified. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell in the grid. For example, certain cells are modified based on their row or column.\n\nLooking at example 3's output, the third row of input is modified in columns 3 and 7. Similarly, in example 1's sixth row, the middle columns are modified. Maybe the pattern is that for certain positions (like columns 3, 4, 5, 6, 7?), the values are modified based on their original value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell in the same column. For example, if the cell is in column 3, then it's replaced based on some rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell to the left or right. For example, if a cell is 0 and the cell to the left is 6, then replace with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 3's third row: the fourth element (originally 0) becomes 8, and the eighth element (originally 6) becomes 7. So maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, in columns 3 and 7, the 0s become 8 and 6s become 7. But why those columns?\n\nIn example 1's sixth row, the middle columns (positions 3-6) are modified. So maybe the transformation is applied to certain columns based on their position. For example, columns 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 are modified in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied to certain cells based on their row and column. For example, in rows 1-5, certain columns are modified.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I need to look for another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's output. The second row of input is 4 7 8 7 8 8 8 8 4. The output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So the 7s are replaced with 6 and 0, and the 8s are replaced with 0. But why?\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the number of adjacent 6s. For example, if a cell has a certain number of 6s around it, it changes. But this is hard to determine without more data.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell in the same row. For example, if the original value is 0, and the cell to the left is 6, then replace with 8. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the value of the cell in the same column. For example, if the cell is in column 3 and the original value is 0, replace with 8.\n\nBut how to determine this without more data?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the following: for each cell, if the original value is 0, replace with 8; if it's 6, replace with 7; if it's 7, replace with 6; if it's 8, replace with 0. But this doesn't explain example 3's first row.\n\nWait, in example 3's first row, the output is the same as input. So for that row, the original values are 6, 0, 6, 4, 6, 0, 0, 4, 6. According to the rule, the 6s should become 7, the 0s become 8, and the 4s remain. But the output is the same. So this suggests that the rule is not applied to all cells. So perhaps the rule is applied to certain cells based on their position.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied only to certain cells, like those in the middle of the grid. For example, in example 1, the sixth row's middle columns are modified. In example 3, the third row's columns 3 and 7 are modified. Maybe the transformation is applied to certain positions based on their row and column.\n\nBut how to determine which positions?\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 3's third row, the fourth element (column 3) is changed from 0 to 8. In example 1's sixth row, the fourth element (column 3) is changed from 6 to 7. So maybe column 3 is a special column where certain values are replaced. Similarly, column 7 is modified in example 3's third row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied to cells in certain columns, like columns 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. For example, in example 1's sixth row, columns 3-6 are modified. In example 3's third row, columns 3 and 7 are modified.\n\nBut this is still not clear.\n\nAnother observation: in example 3's output, the third row has 8 in column 3 and 7 in column 7. In example 1's sixth row, the middle columns are 7,7,7,7. So maybe for certain columns, the transformation is applied based on the original value and the column number.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position in the row. For example, if the cell is in row 5 (sixth row), then certain columns are modified.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to find a pattern.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the best approach is to look for a pattern that can explain as many examples as possible, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLet's try to find a rule that works for example 1, 2, and 3.\n\nIn example 1's sixth row, the 0s become 8, and the 6s become 7.\n\nIn example 2's second row, the 7s become 6 and 0, and the 8s become 0.\n\nIn example 3's third row, the 0 becomes 8 and the 6 becomes 7.\n\nSo perhaps the rule is:\n\n- If the original value is 0, replace with 8.\n- If the original value is 6, replace with 7.\n- If the original value is 7, replace with 6.\n- If the original value is 8, replace with 0.\n- For other values, leave unchanged.\n\nBut in example 3's first row, the output is unchanged. So why? Because in that row, the original values are 6, 0, 6, 4, 6, 0, 0, 4, 6. According to the rule, the 6s should be replaced with 7, the 0s with 8, and the 4s remain. But the output is the same. This suggests that the rule is not applied to all cells, but only to certain cells.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is applied only to certain cells, like those in the middle of the grid. For example, in example 1's sixth row, the middle columns are modified. In example 3's third row, the fourth and eighth columns are modified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied to cells that are not in the first or last row or column. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied to cells that are in certain rows and columns. For example, in example 1, the sixth row is modified. In example 3, the third row is modified.\n\nBut without more data, it's hard to determine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is applied to cells that are not in the first or last column. For example, in example 1's sixth row, the middle columns are modified. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the best approach is to implement the rule that replaces 0\u21928, 6\u21927, 7\u21926, 8\u21920, and leave other values as is. Even though it doesn't explain example 3's first row, it might be that in that row, the transformation is not applied. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is applied to certain cells based on their position in the grid. For example, in rows 1-5, certain columns are modified, and in other rows, not. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is applied to cells that are in the middle of the grid, like columns 3-6, and rows 1-5.\n\nBut how to determine this?\n\nGiven the time, I think the best approach is to proceed with the rule that replaces 0\u21928, 6\u21927, 7\u21926, 8\u21920, and leave others as is. Even though it doesn't explain example 3's first row, it might be that in that case, the transformation is not applied. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is applied only to certain positions, like those in the middle of the grid. For example, in example 1's sixth row, the middle columns are modified. In example 3's third row, columns 3 and 7 are modified. So maybe the rule is applied to cells in columns 3-7.\n\nLet's test this. In example 1's sixth row, the columns 3-7 are modified. In example 3's third row, columns 3 and 7 are modified. So perhaps the rule is applied to columns 3-7.\n\nSo for each cell in columns 3-7, apply the rule: 0\u21928, 6\u21927, 7\u21926, 8\u21920. For other columns, leave as is.\n\nLet's check example 1's sixth row. Columns 3-7 are 6,6,6,6,0. According to the rule, these would become 7,7,7,7,8. Which matches the output.\n\nExample 2's second row: columns 3-7 are 7,8,7,8,8. According to the rule, these would become 6,0,6,0,0. Which matches the output (the second row of example 2's output is 4 6 0 6 0 0 0 0 4. So columns 3-7 are 6,0,6,0,0. Which matches the transformed values.\n\nExample 3's third row: columns 3-7 are 0,0,0,6,0. According to the rule, these would become 8,8,8,7,8. But the output is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. So columns 3-7 are 8,0,0,7,8. Wait, the original row is 0 6 6 0 0 0 0 6 0. Columns 3-7 are 0,0,0,0,6. Applying the rule: 0\u21928, 0\u21928, 0\u21928, 0\u21928, 6\u21927. So the transformed values would be 8,8,8,8,7. But in the output, the third row is 0 6 6 8 0 0 0 7 0. So columns 3-7 are 8, 0, 0, 0, 7. So this doesn't match. Hmm, this suggests that the rule is not applied to all columns 3-7.\n\nBut in example 3's third row, the fourth column (column 3) is 0 \u2192 8. The fifth column (column 4) is 0 \u2192 8, but in the output, it's 0. So this contradicts the rule.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nAt this point, it's clear that the pattern is not straightforward. Given the time constraints, I'll proceed with the rule that replaces 0\u21928, 6\u21927, 7\u21926, 8\u21920, and leave other values as is, even if it doesn't explain all examples. This seems to fit example 1 and 2, but not example 3. However, perhaps the test input has a pattern that fits this rule.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 0:\n                new_row.append(8)\n            elif val == 6:\n                new_row.append(7)\n            elif val == 7:\n                new_row.append(6)\n            elif val == 8:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, the output for example 3's first row is the same as input. According to this code, the first row would have 6 \u2192 7, 0 \u2192 8, etc. So why is the output the same?\n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct. But perhaps the transformation is applied only to certain cells, like those in the middle of the grid.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is applied only to cells that are not in the first or last row or column. For example, in example 1's sixth row (row 5), the middle columns are modified. In example 3's third row, the middle columns are modified.\n\nSo, for each cell in rows 1-5 (assuming 0-based) and columns 3-7 (assuming 0-based), apply the rule. For other cells, leave as is.\n\nLet's test this.\n\nExample 1's sixth row (row 5) is in rows 1-5 (assuming 0-based, rows 0-6). So row 5 is included. Columns 3-7 are modified. So the code would apply the rule to those cells.\n\nExample 3's third row (row 2) is included. Columns 3-7 are modified.\n\nIn example 3's third row, the original row is [0,6,6,0,0,0,0,6,0]. Columns 3-7 are 0,0,0,0,6. Applying the rule: 0\u21928, 0\u21928, 0\u21928, 0\u21928, 6\u21927. So the transformed values would be 8,8,8,8,7. But the output for this row is [0,6,6,8,0,0,0,7,0]. So the fourth column (column 3) is 8, the fifth (column 4) is 0, sixth (column 5) is 0, seventh (column 6) is 0, eighth (column 7) is 7. This doesn't match the transformed values.\n\nSo this suggests that the rule is not applied to all columns 3-7.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Given the time, I'll proceed with the initial rule, even if it doesn't explain all examples, and hope that it works for the test input.\n\nBut wait, the test input is:\n\nTest Input:\n0 4 6 6 0 4 6 4 0\n0 6 0 0 0 6 6 6 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 6 6 6\n6 6 6 0 0 0 6 0 0\n0 6 0 6 0 0 6 0 0\n0 6 6 0 6 6 0 6 6\n6 6 6 6 0 6 0 6 6\n0 6 0 6 6 6 6 6 6\n6 0 0 0 6 0 0 6 0\n\nApplying the rule: replace 0\u21928, 6\u21927, 7\u21926, 8\u21920.\n\nBut in the test input, there are no 7s or 8s. So the transformation would replace 0\u21928 and 6\u21927.\n\nSo for example, the first row of test input is 0 4 6 6 0 4 6 4 0. After transformation, it would be 8 4 7 7 8 4 7 4 8.\n\nBut the test input's output is not provided, so I can't verify. But the code would transform the input according to this rule.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 0:\n                new_row.append(8)\n            elif val == 6:\n                new_row.append(7)\n            elif val == 7:\n                new_row.append(6)\n            elif val == 8:\n                new_row.append(0)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(val)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not be correct. However, given the time and the examples provided, this is the best I can do.\n"
