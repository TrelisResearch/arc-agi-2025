The output grid seems to have a \"spread\" pattern where certain numbers (like 2, 3, 4, etc.) are spread out in a specific pattern\n2. There's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced with others in a specific way\n3. The output grid seems to have a \"block\" pattern where certain numbers are repeated in blocks\n4. The output grid seems to have a \"spread\" pattern where certain numbers are spread out in a specific way\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads certain numbers in a specific pattern.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 14x14 output grid initialized with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(14)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(14):\n        for col in range(14):\n            # If the input cell is 0, leave it as 0\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n            # If the input cell is 8, replace it with 8\n            elif grid[row][col] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 8\n            # If the input cell is 5, replace it with 5\n            elif grid[row][col] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 5\n            # If the input cell is 3, replace it with 3\n            elif grid[row][col] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 3\n            # If the input cell is 2, replace it with 2\n            elif grid[row][col] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n            # If the input cell is 1, replace it with 1\n            elif grid[row][col] == 1:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 1\n            # If the input cell is 4, replace it with 4\n            elif grid[row][col] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 4\n            # If the input cell is 6, replace it with 6\n            elif grid[row][col] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 6\n            # If the input cell is 7, replace it with 7\n            elif grid[row][col] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 7\n            # If the input cell is 9, replace it with 9\n            elif grid[row][col] == 9:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 9\n            # If the input cell is 0, leave it as 0\n            else:\n                transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The output grid seems to have a \"spread\" of numbers where certain values (like 2, 3, 4, etc.) are spread out in a pattern.\n2. There's a pattern where certain values (like 2, 3, 4, etc.) are repeated in a way that forms a \"wave\" or \"spread\" across the grid.\n3. The value 8 seems to be replaced with other values in a pattern.\n4. The value 5 seems to be preserved in some areas but transformed in others.\n5. The value 0 seems to be used as a \"filler\" or \"background\" value.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads certain values in a pattern and replaces others.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 14x14 output grid initialized with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(14)]\n    \n    # Copy the input grid values where they are not 0\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Spread values in a pattern\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value to neighboring cells\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 14 and 0 <= nj < 14:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 14x14 output grid initialized with 0s\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(14)]\n    \n    # Copy the input grid values where they are not 0\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = grid[i][j]\n    \n    # Spread values in a pattern\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(14):\n            if transformed_grid[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread the value to neighboring cells\n                for di in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    for dj in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                        if di == 0 and dj == 0:\n                            continue\n                        ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n                        if 0 <= ni < 14 and 0 <= nj < 14:\n                            transformed_grid[ni][nj] = transformed_grid[i][j]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

There seems to be a transformation where values in the input grid are replaced with a pattern that repeats the value in a specific way.\n3. In Example 1, values like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 appear to be repeated in a way that forms a \"snake-like\" pattern.\n4.

It captures some of the observed patterns but is not a complete solution. The actual transformation likely involves more complex patterns that repeat values in a structured way.",

The output grid seems to have a structure where certain values are repeated in a pattern\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Repeats values in a pattern based on their row and column positions\n- Applies a transformation that seems to be based on the position of the cell in the grid\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 14x14 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(14)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(14):\n        for col in range(14):\n            # Apply a transformation based on the position of the cell\n            # This is a hypothesis based on the patterns observed in the training examples\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                # If the value is 0, we might be replacing it with a pattern\n                # This is a hypothesis based on the patterns observed in the training examples\n                # We'll use the row and column to determine the value\n                # This is a simple pattern that seems to work for the examples\n                if row % 2 == 0 and col % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n                elif row % 2 == 0 and col % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                elif row % 2 == 1 and col % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n            else:\n                # For non-zero values, we might be repeating them in a pattern\n                # This is a hypothesis based on the patterns observed in the training examples\n                # We'll use the row and column to determine the value\n                # This is a simple pattern that seems to work for the examples\n                if row % 2 == 0 and col % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][col]\n                elif row % 2 == 0 and col % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][col]\n                elif row % 2 == 1 and col % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][col]\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][col]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 14x14 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(14)] for _ in range(14)]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(14):\n        for col in range(14):\n            # Apply a transformation based on the position of the cell\n            # This is a hypothesis based on the patterns observed in the training examples\n            # We'll use the row and column to determine the value\n            # This is a simple pattern that seems to work for the examples\n            if grid[row][col] == 0:\n                # If the value is 0, we might be replacing it with a pattern\n                # This is a hypothesis based on the patterns observed in the training examples\n                # We'll use the row and column to determine the value\n                # This is a simple pattern that seems to work for the examples\n                if row % 2 == 0 and col % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n                elif row % 2 == 0 and col % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                elif row % 2 == 1 and col % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 0\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = 2\n            else:\n                # For non-zero values, we might be repeating them in a pattern\n                # This is a hypothesis based on the patterns observed in the training examples\n                # We'll use the row and column to determine the value\n                # This is a simple pattern that seems to work for the examples\n                if row % 2 == 0 and col % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][col]\n                elif row % 2 == 0 and col % 2 == 1:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][col]\n                elif row % 2 == 1 and col % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][col]\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[row][col] = grid[row][col]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
