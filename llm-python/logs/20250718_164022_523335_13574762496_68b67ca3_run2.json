Let's look at the patterns:\n\n1. In Example 1, the output grid seems to be formed by taking values from the input grid in a specific pattern:\n   - The first row of the output is formed by taking the first, third, and fifth elements of the first row of the input\n   - The second row of the output is formed by taking the second, fourth, and sixth elements of the first row of the input\n   - The third row of the output is formed by taking the first, third, and fifth elements of the third row of the input\n\n2. In Example 2, the output grid seems to be formed by taking values from the input grid in a similar pattern:\n   - The first row of the output is formed by taking the first, third, and fifth elements of the first row of the input\n   - The second row of the output is formed by taking the second, fourth, and sixth elements of the second row of the input\n   - The third row of the output is formed by taking the first, third, and fifth elements of the third row of the input\n\n3.
