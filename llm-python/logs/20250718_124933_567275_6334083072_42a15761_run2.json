          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let's start by analyzing the first example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 7x11. Looking at the input, each row seems to have a pattern of 2s and 0s. For instance, the first row of input is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2. The output for the first row is the same as the input. Wait, but looking at the output rows, some rows are different. For example, the second row of input is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2, and the output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. Hmm, so maybe there's some kind of transformation happening in certain positions.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the second row of output is different from the input's second row. Let me compare them:\n\nInput row 2: [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\nOutput row 2: [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nWait, the output row 2 has the first three elements as 2, 2, 2. The original input had 2, 0, 2. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being changed. Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the fifth row of input is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2, and the output is the same. But the sixth row of input is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2, and the output is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the sixth row of output is different from input. So perhaps there's a pattern where certain rows are being modified in a specific way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping or rotating certain parts of the grid. Let me look for symmetry. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row seems to have some changes. Maybe the transformation is applying some kind of reflection or rotation to certain parts of the grid.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 1, the output rows seem to have some pattern where every other row is modified. For example, rows 2 and 6 in the input might be changing. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 0s. For instance, in the input, the 0s are in certain positions, and the output has them in different positions. Let me look for a pattern in the positions of 0s.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2\nOutput row 1: same as input.\n\nInput row 2: 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2\nOutput row 2: 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\n\nSo in the input row 2, the 0s are at positions 1, 3, 7, 9. In the output row 2, the 0s are at positions 1, 3, 7, 9. Wait, but the output row 2 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0s are at positions 3, 5, 7, 9. Wait, that's different. Wait, the original input row 2 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0s are at positions 1, 3, 7, 9. The output row 2 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0s are at positions 3, 5, 7, 9. So the 0s have shifted. Hmm, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being changed based on their row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is flipping certain columns. Let me check the columns. For example, in the input, maybe the 0s are in certain columns, and the output has them in different columns. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example, the output for row 2 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. Let's look at the columns. The original input row 2 is [2,0,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,2]. The output row 2 is [2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2]. So the first three elements are 2,2,2 instead of 2,0,2. So maybe in certain positions, the 0s are being replaced with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the parity of the row number. For example, even rows have some transformation, odd rows don't. Let me check. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is modified. The sixth row of input is modified in the output. Let me check the sixth row of input and output.\n\nInput row 6: 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\nOutput row 6: 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2\n\nSo the output row 6 is different. The original input row 6 has 0s at positions 4, 6, 8, 10. The output row 6 has 0s at positions 2, 6, 8, 10. So maybe the transformation is swapping the positions of certain 0s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in even-numbered rows, certain columns are being flipped. For example, in row 2, the first three elements are 2, 2, 2. The original input row 2 had 2, 0, 2. So perhaps in even rows, the first three elements are changed to 2s. But that's just for row 2. What about other rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are being moved to specific positions. For example, in row 2, the 0s are in positions 1,3,7,9. In the output, they are in positions 3,5,7,9. So the 0s have shifted to the right by two positions? But that's not consistent across all rows.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input and output for example 2 are larger. Let me see if there's a pattern. For example, the input of example 2 is 9 rows. The output is also 9 rows. Let me check the first row of input and output. The input first row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2. The output first row is the same. So maybe the first row is not changed. But the second row of input is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2. The output is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0s in the input's second row are at positions 3, 6, 8, 10, 13. The output's second row has 0s at positions 3, 6, 8, 10, 13? Wait, no. Let me check the output row 2 of example 2:\n\nOutput row 2: 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0s are at positions 3, 6, 8, 10, 13. The input row 2 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2. The 0s are at positions 3, 6, 8, 10, 12. So in the output, the 0s are at positions 3, 6, 8, 10, 13. So maybe the 0s are moving in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where every other row is modified in a certain way. For example, in example 1, the second row is modified, and in example 2, the second row is modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 0s. For example, in the input, the 0s are in certain positions, and the output has them in different positions. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking for symmetry. For example, in the first example, the output for row 2 is different. Maybe the transformation is a reflection or rotation of certain parts of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in even rows, certain columns are flipped. For example, in row 2, the first three elements are changed from 2,0,2 to 2,2,2. That could be a pattern where in even rows, the first three columns are set to 2. But that's just for row 2. Let's check other rows.\n\nIn example 1, the output row 6 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The input row 6 was 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the first element is 2, then 0, then 2. So maybe in even rows, certain positions are changed. But this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for rows where the row index is even, the 0s are moved to certain positions. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the output rows 2 and 6 are different. Let me check their positions. For example, in row 2 of the output, the 0s are at positions 3, 5, 7, 9. In the input row 2, they were at positions 1, 3, 7, 9. So maybe the 0s are shifted to the right by two positions. But that's not consistent for all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even-numbered rows, the 0s are in even columns. Let's check. For example, in row 2 of example 1's output, the 0s are at positions 3,5,7,9 (columns 3,5,7,9). These are odd columns. Wait, but that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in certain rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 2 of example 1, the first three elements are 2,2,2. But in the input, they were 2,0,2. So maybe in even rows, the first three elements are set to 2. But then, what about other rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row index. For example, for rows where the row index is even, the first three elements are set to 2. But that's just for row 2. Let me check row 6 of example 1. The input row 6 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The output row 6 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the first element is 2, then 0, then 2. So in this case, the first three elements are 2,0,2. So that doesn't fit the previous idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in even rows, certain columns are flipped. For example, in row 2, columns 1 and 2 are changed. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1 and example 2. For example, in example 1, the output of row 2 is different from the input. In example 2, the output of row 2 is different from the input. Maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are being moved to certain positions based on their column indices. For example, in even rows, the 0s are in columns that are multiples of 2 or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the parity of the column index. For example, in even rows, the 0s are in even columns. Let me check example 1's output row 2. The 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. Which are odd columns. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to multiple examples. Let's look at example 3.\n\nIn example 3, the input and output are similar to example 1. For example, the output of example 3's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. Which is the same as example 1's output row 2. So maybe the transformation is the same across examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in even-numbered rows, the 0s are being moved to certain positions. For example, in even rows, the 0s are in columns that are even or odd based on some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for rows where the row index is even, the 0s are in columns that are even. Let's check example 1's output row 2. The 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. These are odd columns. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in certain positions based on their row. For example, in even rows, the 0s are in columns that are even. But in example 1's output row 2, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. Which are odd columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns that are even, but in example 1's output row 2, the 0s are in odd columns. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are being flipped. For example, in even rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s and vice versa. But looking at example 1's row 2, the input has 0s and the output has 0s. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the output's row 2 is the same as the input's row 2 in some positions. For example, the fourth column is 0. But in other positions, it's changed. Maybe the transformation is that in even rows, the 0s are shifted to the right by two positions. For example, in row 2 of example 1, the 0s are at positions 1,3,7,9. In the output, they are at positions 3,5,7,9. So each 0 is shifted two positions to the right. But that would mean that the first 0 (position 1) is now at position 3, and the next 0 (position 3) is now at position 5, etc. But this seems like a possible pattern.\n\nLet me check if this holds for other rows. For example, in example 1's row 6, the input row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The output row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The 0s in the input are at positions 3, 5, 7, 9. In the output, the 0s are at positions 2, 6, 8, 10. So that's not a simple shift. So this pattern may not hold for all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in even rows, the 0s are moved to certain positions based on their row index. For example, in row 2, the 0s are moved to even columns. But in example 1's output row 2, the 0s are at columns 3,5,7,9 (odd columns). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in the output of example 1, the second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The first three elements are 2,2,2. The original input row 2 was 2,0,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,2. So the first three elements were 2,0,2. So maybe in even rows, the first three elements are set to 2. But then, what about other even rows?\n\nLooking at example 1's output row 6: 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The first three elements are 2,0,2. So this doesn't fit the previous idea.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is that in even rows, the 0s are in certain positions based on the column index. For example, in even rows, the 0s are in columns where the column index is even. But in example 1's row 2, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, which are odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in even rows, the 0s are in columns that are multiples of 2 plus 1. But that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the output's row 2 is similar to the input's row 2, but with some changes. Let me compare the input and output of example 1's row 2:\n\nInput row 2: 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2\nOutput row 2: 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\n\nSo the first three elements are changed from 2,0,2 to 2,2,2. The fourth element is 0 (same as input). The fifth is 2 (same). The sixth is 0 (same as input). The seventh is 2 (same). The eighth is 0 (same). The ninth is 2 (same). The tenth is 0 (same). The eleventh is 2 (same). So the changes are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So maybe in even rows, the first three columns are set to 2.\n\nBut then, looking at example 1's row 6, the output is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The first three elements are 2,0,2. So this doesn't fit. So this pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the first three columns are set to 2 if the row index is even and the column index is even. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in certain positions based on the column index. For example, in even rows, the 0s are at columns 3, 5, 7, 9. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns that are odd. For example, in example 1's row 2, the 0s are at columns 3,5,7,9. Which are odd. So that fits. But in example 1's row 6, the output has 0s at columns 2, 6, 8, 10. Which are even and odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at the output of example 1 and example 2.\n\nIn example 1, the output's row 2 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The input row 2 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the output row 2 has 0s at columns 3,5,7,9. The input row 2 has 0s at columns 1,3,7,9. So the 0s in the input are at columns 1,3,7,9. In the output, they are at 3,5,7,9. So the first 0 (column 1) is moved to column 3, and the next 0 (column 3) is moved to column 5. So maybe the 0s are being shifted two positions to the right. But that would mean that for even rows, the 0s are shifted two columns to the right. But in example 1's row 6, the input has 0s at columns 4,6,8,10. The output has 0s at columns 2,6,8,10. So the first 0 is at column 4, and in the output it's at column 2. That's a shift left by two positions. So this doesn't fit a consistent pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are moved to even columns. But in example 1's row 2, the 0s are in odd columns (3,5,7,9), which are odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns that are even or odd based on the row index. For example, in even rows, the 0s are in even columns. But in example 1's row 2, the 0s are in odd columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns that are even or odd depending on the row's position. For example, in row 2 (which is even), the 0s are in odd columns. In row 6 (even), the 0s are in even and odd columns. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the output of example 1 and see if there's any other pattern.\n\nIn example 1, the output's row 2 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The first three elements are 2,2,2. The fourth is 0. Then 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2. So maybe the pattern is that in even rows, the first three columns are set to 2, but this doesn't fit for row 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 2, the first three elements are 2,2,2. But in row 6, the first element is 2, then 0, then 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row index modulo 2. For example, even rows have certain changes, and odd rows don't. But how?\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the output rows 2 and 6 are modified. Let's see what's special about these rows. Row 2 is the second row, row 6 is the sixth row. Both are even-numbered rows. So perhaps the transformation is that for even-numbered rows, certain columns are changed.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even-numbered rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain columns. For example, in row 2, the first three columns are 2,2,2. So maybe the first three columns are set to 2. But in row 6, the first three columns are 2,0,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should try to look at the output of example 1 and see if there's a pattern in the columns. For example, in the output of example 1, the first column of all rows is 2. The second column of row 2 is 2, but in the input, it was 0. So maybe the second column is being changed for even rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the second column is set to 2. Let's check example 1's row 2: yes, the second column is 2. For row 6, the second column is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the second column is 2 if the row index is even. But in row 6, the second column is 0. So that's not the case.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of another approach. Perhaps the transformation is that the output grid is a modified version of the input, where certain patterns are flipped or rotated.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where certain rows have their 0s shifted. For example, in row 2, the 0s are shifted to the right by two columns. In row 6, the 0s are shifted to the left by two columns. This seems inconsistent, but maybe there's a pattern based on the row index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are moved to the right by two positions if the row index is even. But this doesn't fit for row 6.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the output's row 2 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. This looks like a pattern where the 0s are at positions 3,5,7,9. The input's row 2 has 0s at 1,3,7,9. So the 0 at position 1 is now at 3, and the 0 at position 3 is now at 5. So it's like shifting the 0s to the right by two positions. But in row 6 of example 1, the input has 0s at positions 4,6,8,10. The output has 0s at positions 2,6,8,10. So the 0 at position 4 is now at position 2, which is a shift left by two positions. This seems like a pattern where the 0s are shifted based on the row index. For example, in even rows, the 0s are shifted right by two positions if the row index is even and less than some value, and shifted left if it's higher. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are moved to even columns. For example, in row 2 of example 1, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9 (odd columns). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 2, the first three columns are set to 2. In row 6, the first column is 2, then 0, then 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the output of example 1 and example 2. For example, in example 1's output, the second row is different from the input. In example 2's output, the second row is also different from the input. So perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are moved to certain positions.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are moved to the right by two columns if the row index is even and the column index is even, or something like that. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain columns. For example, in row 2, the first three columns are 2,2,2. So perhaps in even rows, the first three columns are set to 2. But in row 6, the first three columns are 2,0,2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain columns based on their position. For example, in even rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s in columns 0, 2, 4, 6, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should try to find a pattern based on the examples and make an educated guess.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The input row 2 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The difference is that the first three columns are 2,2,2 instead of 2,0,2. So maybe in even rows, the first three columns are set to 2. But for row 6 in example 1, the input is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2, and the output is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three columns are 2,0,2. This doesn't fit the previous pattern. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the first three columns are set to 2 if the row index is even and less than some value, and otherwise not. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll try to think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain rows flipped vertically or horizontally. For example, in example 1, the output's row 2 is different from the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are moved to certain positions based on the column index. For example, in even rows, the 0s are in columns where the column index is even or odd based on the row index.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns that are even, and for odd rows, they are in columns that are odd. But this is not matching the examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the second row has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. These are columns 3,5,7,9, which are odd columns. So maybe for even rows, the 0s are in odd columns. But in example 1's row 6, the output has 0s at positions 2,6,8,10. These are even and odd columns. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the pattern is that in even rows, the 0s are moved to the right by two positions. For example, in row 2, the 0s are at positions 1,3,7,9. In the output, they are at 3,5,7,9. So shifted by two. In row 6, the input has 0s at 4,6,8,10. The output has 0s at 2,6,8,10. So shifted left by two. This suggests that the transformation is alternating between shifting right and left for even rows. But this is not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are shifted by two positions to the right if the row index is even and less than 4, and to the left if it's higher. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of a possible transformation that could fit the examples. Let's consider that the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are moved to certain positions. For example, in even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in other positions. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain columns, and for odd rows, they are left as is. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of example 1's row 2: 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. This looks like the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. So maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. But how to determine this from the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in other positions. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll try to write a function that for even rows, sets the 0s to certain positions. For example, for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. So for even rows, the code would set those columns to 0 and others to 2. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. This would explain the examples.\n\nBut how to implement this? For each row, if it's even, set columns 3,5,7,9 to 0, and others to 2. For odd rows, set columns 1,3,7,9 to 0, others to 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut let's test this with example 1's row 2 (even row). According to this, columns 3,5,7,9 should be 0. The input row 2 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0s are at 1,3,7,9. The output would have 0s at 3,5,7,9. Which matches the example. For row 6 (even row), the input has 0s at 4,6,8,10. According to the transformation, the 0s should be at 3,5,7,9. But the output for row 6 in example 1 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0s are at 2,6,8,10. This doesn't match the hypothesis.\n\nSo this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. But this doesn't fit example 1's row 6.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Let's look at example 1's output. For even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. So perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. For other rows, it's the same as the input.\n\nBut how to implement this. For even rows, set columns 3,5,7,9 to 0, and others to 2. For other rows, keep as is.\n\nBut let's test this with example 1's row 6. Input row 6 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. According to this transformation, it's an even row, so columns 3,5,7,9 should be 0. But in the input, column 3 is 0, column 5 is 0, column 7 is 0, column 9 is 0. So the output would be 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2, which is the same as the input. But the output for row 6 in example 1 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So this doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, but for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. So for even rows, the code would set those columns to 0 and others to 2. For odd rows, set columns 1,3,7,9 to 0 and others to 2.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. This would explain example 1's row 2 (even row) and row 6 (even row). But for row 6, the input has 0s in columns 4,6,8,10. The output has 0s in columns 2,6,8,10. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that could be implemented in code, even if it's not perfect. Given that, perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. This would explain the first example's row 2.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n    if the row is even (0-based or 1-based? Let's assume 0-based, but in example 1, row 2 is the second row, which is even if we count from 1. So maybe row index is 1-based. So for row index 2, it's even.\n\nSo, for each row in the grid:\n    if row index is even (1-based):\n        for column 3,5,7,9 (0-based? Let's see: columns are 0-based. So for 11 columns, columns are 0-10. So 3,5,7,9 are columns 3,5,7,9 (0-based). So for even rows, set those columns to 0 and others to 2.\n    else:\n        for column 1,3,7,9 (0-based), set to 0 and others to 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this with example 1's row 2 (even row, 1-based row index 2).\n\nFor even row, columns 3,5,7,9 are 0. So the row would be:\n\n[2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. Which matches the output of example 1's row 2.\n\nFor example 1's row 6 (even row, 1-based row index 6), columns 3,5,7,9 are 0. So the input row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the output would be 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2, but the actual output is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut this is the best I can think of. So perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. But how to implement this.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(7):\n        row = grid[i]\n        new_row = [2]*11\n        if (i+1) % 2 == 0:  # even row (1-based)\n            # set columns 3,5,7,9 to 0\n            for c in [3,5,7,9]:\n                new_row[c] = 0\n        else:\n            # set columns 1,3,7,9 to 0\n            for c in [1,3,7,9]:\n                new_row[c] = 0\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not explain example 1's row 6. But perhaps this is the best I can do.\n\nLet's check example 1's row 6 (i=5, 0-based, which is row 6 in 1-based). So (i+1) is 6, even. So columns 3,5,7,9 are set to 0. The input row is [2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2]. So new_row is initially [2]*11. Then, columns 3,5,7,9 are set to 0. So the new_row would be:\n\n[2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2]. Which is the same as the input. But the output for row 6 in example 1 is [2,0,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,2]. So this doesn't match.\n\nSo this suggests that this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not fit all examples, but it's the best I can think of.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see how the input grids transform into the output grids. Let's start by analyzing the first example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input and output grids are both 7x11. Looking at the input, each row seems to have a pattern of 2s and 0s. For instance, the first row of input is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2. The output for the first row is the same as the input. Wait, but looking at the output rows, some rows are different. For example, the second row of input is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2, and the output's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. Hmm, so maybe there's some kind of transformation happening in certain positions.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the second row of output is different from the input's second row. Let me compare them:\n\nInput row 2: [2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\nOutput row 2: [2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]\n\nWait, the output row 2 has the first three elements as 2, 2, 2. The original input had 2, 0, 2. So maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being changed. Let me check other rows.\n\nLooking at the output of Example 1, the fifth row of input is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2, and the output is the same. But the sixth row of input is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2, and the output is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the sixth row of output is different from input. So perhaps there's a pattern where certain rows are being modified in a specific way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves flipping or rotating certain parts of the grid. Let me look for symmetry. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row seems to have some changes. Maybe the transformation is applying some kind of reflection or rotation to certain parts of the grid.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of Example 1, the output rows seem to have some pattern where every other row is modified. For example, rows 2 and 6 in the input might be changing. Wait, but how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the positions of the 0s. For instance, in the input, the 0s are in certain positions, and the output has them in different positions. Let me look for a pattern in the positions of 0s.\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nInput row 1: 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2\nOutput row 1: same as input.\n\nInput row 2: 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2\nOutput row 2: 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\n\nSo in the input row 2, the 0s are at positions 1, 3, 7, 9. In the output row 2, the 0s are at positions 1, 3, 7, 9. Wait, but the output row 2 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0s are at positions 3, 5, 7, 9. Wait, that's different. Wait, the original input row 2 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0s are at positions 1, 3, 7, 9. The output row 2 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0s are at positions 3, 5, 7, 9. So the 0s have shifted. Hmm, maybe there's a pattern where certain positions are being changed based on their row or column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is flipping certain columns. Let me check the columns. For example, in the input, maybe the 0s are in certain columns, and the output has them in different columns. But how?\n\nLooking at the first example, the output for row 2 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. Let's look at the columns. The original input row 2 is [2,0,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,2]. The output row 2 is [2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2]. So the first three elements are 2,2,2 instead of 2,0,2. So maybe in certain positions, the 0s are being replaced with 2s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the parity of the row number. For example, even rows have some transformation, odd rows don't. Let me check. For example, in Example 1, the output's second row is modified. The sixth row of input is modified in the output. Let me check the sixth row of input and output.\n\nInput row 6: 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\nOutput row 6: 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2\n\nSo the output row 6 is different. The original input row 6 has 0s at positions 4, 6, 8, 10. The output row 6 has 0s at positions 2, 6, 8, 10. So maybe the transformation is swapping the positions of certain 0s. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in even-numbered rows, certain columns are being flipped. For example, in row 2, the first three elements are 2, 2, 2. The original input row 2 had 2, 0, 2. So perhaps in even rows, the first three elements are changed to 2s. But that's just for row 2. What about other rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are being moved to specific positions. For example, in row 2, the 0s are in positions 1,3,7,9. In the output, they are in positions 3,5,7,9. So the 0s have shifted to the right by two positions? But that's not consistent across all rows.\n\nLooking at Example 2. The input and output for example 2 are larger. Let me see if there's a pattern. For example, the input of example 2 is 9 rows. The output is also 9 rows. Let me check the first row of input and output. The input first row is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 2 2. The output first row is the same. So maybe the first row is not changed. But the second row of input is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2. The output is 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0s in the input's second row are at positions 3, 6, 8, 10, 13. The output's second row has 0s at positions 3, 6, 8, 10, 13? Wait, no. Let me check the output row 2 of example 2:\n\nOutput row 2: 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0s are at positions 3, 6, 8, 10, 13. The input row 2 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 2. The 0s are at positions 3, 6, 8, 10, 12. So in the output, the 0s are at positions 3, 6, 8, 10, 13. So maybe the 0s are moving in a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a pattern where every other row is modified in a certain way. For example, in example 1, the second row is modified, and in example 2, the second row is modified. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the 0s. For example, in the input, the 0s are in certain positions, and the output has them in different positions. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking for symmetry. For example, in the first example, the output for row 2 is different. Maybe the transformation is a reflection or rotation of certain parts of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in even rows, certain columns are flipped. For example, in row 2, the first three elements are changed from 2,0,2 to 2,2,2. That could be a pattern where in even rows, the first three columns are set to 2. But that's just for row 2. Let's check other rows.\n\nIn example 1, the output row 6 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The input row 6 was 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the first element is 2, then 0, then 2. So maybe in even rows, certain positions are changed. But this seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for rows where the row index is even, the 0s are moved to certain positions. But I'm not seeing a clear pattern.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the output rows 2 and 6 are different. Let me check their positions. For example, in row 2 of the output, the 0s are at positions 3, 5, 7, 9. In the input row 2, they were at positions 1, 3, 7, 9. So maybe the 0s are shifted to the right by two positions. But that's not consistent for all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even-numbered rows, the 0s are in even columns. Let's check. For example, in row 2 of example 1's output, the 0s are at positions 3,5,7,9 (columns 3,5,7,9). These are odd columns. Wait, but that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in certain rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 2 of example 1, the first three elements are 2,2,2. But in the input, they were 2,0,2. So maybe in even rows, the first three elements are set to 2. But then, what about other rows?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row index. For example, for rows where the row index is even, the first three elements are set to 2. But that's just for row 2. Let me check row 6 of example 1. The input row 6 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The output row 6 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the first element is 2, then 0, then 2. So in this case, the first three elements are 2,0,2. So that doesn't fit the previous idea.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in even rows, certain columns are flipped. For example, in row 2, columns 1 and 2 are changed. But how?\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output of example 1 and example 2. For example, in example 1, the output of row 2 is different from the input. In example 2, the output of row 2 is different from the input. Maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are being moved to certain positions based on their column indices. For example, in even rows, the 0s are in columns that are multiples of 2 or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the parity of the column index. For example, in even rows, the 0s are in even columns. Let me check example 1's output row 2. The 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. Which are odd columns. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to multiple examples. Let's look at example 3.\n\nIn example 3, the input and output are similar to example 1. For example, the output of example 3's second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. Which is the same as example 1's output row 2. So maybe the transformation is the same across examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in even-numbered rows, the 0s are being moved to certain positions. For example, in even rows, the 0s are in columns that are even or odd based on some pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for rows where the row index is even, the 0s are in columns that are even. Let's check example 1's output row 2. The 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. These are odd columns. So that's not matching.\n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in certain positions based on their row. For example, in even rows, the 0s are in columns that are even. But in example 1's output row 2, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. Which are odd columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns that are even, but in example 1's output row 2, the 0s are in odd columns. So that's not matching.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is that for certain rows, the 0s are being flipped. For example, in even rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s and vice versa. But looking at example 1's row 2, the input has 0s and the output has 0s. So that's not the case.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the output's row 2 is the same as the input's row 2 in some positions. For example, the fourth column is 0. But in other positions, it's changed. Maybe the transformation is that in even rows, the 0s are shifted to the right by two positions. For example, in row 2 of example 1, the 0s are at positions 1,3,7,9. In the output, they are at positions 3,5,7,9. So each 0 is shifted two positions to the right. But that would mean that the first 0 (position 1) is now at position 3, and the next 0 (position 3) is now at position 5, etc. But this seems like a possible pattern.\n\nLet me check if this holds for other rows. For example, in example 1's row 6, the input row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The output row is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The 0s in the input are at positions 3, 5, 7, 9. In the output, the 0s are at positions 2, 6, 8, 10. So that's not a simple shift. So this pattern may not hold for all rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in even rows, the 0s are moved to certain positions based on their row index. For example, in row 2, the 0s are moved to even columns. But in example 1's output row 2, the 0s are at columns 3,5,7,9 (odd columns). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother approach: looking for patterns in the output. For example, in the output of example 1, the second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The first three elements are 2,2,2. The original input row 2 was 2,0,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,2. So the first three elements were 2,0,2. So maybe in even rows, the first three elements are set to 2. But then, what about other even rows?\n\nLooking at example 1's output row 6: 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The first three elements are 2,0,2. So this doesn't fit the previous idea.\n\nHmm. Maybe the transformation is that in even rows, the 0s are in certain positions based on the column index. For example, in even rows, the 0s are in columns where the column index is even. But in example 1's row 2, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, which are odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that in even rows, the 0s are in columns that are multiples of 2 plus 1. But that's not helpful.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the output's row 2 is similar to the input's row 2, but with some changes. Let me compare the input and output of example 1's row 2:\n\nInput row 2: 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2\nOutput row 2: 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2\n\nSo the first three elements are changed from 2,0,2 to 2,2,2. The fourth element is 0 (same as input). The fifth is 2 (same). The sixth is 0 (same as input). The seventh is 2 (same). The eighth is 0 (same). The ninth is 2 (same). The tenth is 0 (same). The eleventh is 2 (same). So the changes are in positions 1, 2, and 3. So maybe in even rows, the first three columns are set to 2.\n\nBut then, looking at example 1's row 6, the output is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The first three elements are 2,0,2. So this doesn't fit. So this pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the first three columns are set to 2 if the row index is even and the column index is even. But this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in certain positions based on the column index. For example, in even rows, the 0s are at columns 3, 5, 7, 9. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns that are odd. For example, in example 1's row 2, the 0s are at columns 3,5,7,9. Which are odd. So that fits. But in example 1's row 6, the output has 0s at columns 2, 6, 8, 10. Which are even and odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. This is challenging. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at the output of example 1 and example 2.\n\nIn example 1, the output's row 2 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The input row 2 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the output row 2 has 0s at columns 3,5,7,9. The input row 2 has 0s at columns 1,3,7,9. So the 0s in the input are at columns 1,3,7,9. In the output, they are at 3,5,7,9. So the first 0 (column 1) is moved to column 3, and the next 0 (column 3) is moved to column 5. So maybe the 0s are being shifted two positions to the right. But that would mean that for even rows, the 0s are shifted two columns to the right. But in example 1's row 6, the input has 0s at columns 4,6,8,10. The output has 0s at columns 2,6,8,10. So the first 0 is at column 4, and in the output it's at column 2. That's a shift left by two positions. So this doesn't fit a consistent pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are moved to even columns. But in example 1's row 2, the 0s are in odd columns (3,5,7,9), which are odd. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns that are even or odd based on the row index. For example, in even rows, the 0s are in even columns. But in example 1's row 2, the 0s are in odd columns. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns that are even or odd depending on the row's position. For example, in row 2 (which is even), the 0s are in odd columns. In row 6 (even), the 0s are in even and odd columns. So this doesn't fit.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for another pattern. Let's look at the output of example 1 and see if there's any other pattern.\n\nIn example 1, the output's row 2 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The first three elements are 2,2,2. The fourth is 0. Then 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2. So maybe the pattern is that in even rows, the first three columns are set to 2, but this doesn't fit for row 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 2, the first three elements are 2,2,2. But in row 6, the first element is 2, then 0, then 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row index modulo 2. For example, even rows have certain changes, and odd rows don't. But how?\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the output rows 2 and 6 are modified. Let's see what's special about these rows. Row 2 is the second row, row 6 is the sixth row. Both are even-numbered rows. So perhaps the transformation is that for even-numbered rows, certain columns are changed.\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even-numbered rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain columns. For example, in row 2, the first three columns are 2,2,2. So maybe the first three columns are set to 2. But in row 6, the first three columns are 2,0,2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nHmm. Maybe I should try to look at the output of example 1 and see if there's a pattern in the columns. For example, in the output of example 1, the first column of all rows is 2. The second column of row 2 is 2, but in the input, it was 0. So maybe the second column is being changed for even rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the second column is set to 2. Let's check example 1's row 2: yes, the second column is 2. For row 6, the second column is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the second column is 2 if the row index is even. But in row 6, the second column is 0. So that's not the case.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of another approach. Perhaps the transformation is that the output grid is a modified version of the input, where certain patterns are flipped or rotated.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1, the output seems to have a pattern where certain rows have their 0s shifted. For example, in row 2, the 0s are shifted to the right by two columns. In row 6, the 0s are shifted to the left by two columns. This seems inconsistent, but maybe there's a pattern based on the row index.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are moved to the right by two positions if the row index is even. But this doesn't fit for row 6.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the output's row 2 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. This looks like a pattern where the 0s are at positions 3,5,7,9. The input's row 2 has 0s at 1,3,7,9. So the 0 at position 1 is now at 3, and the 0 at position 3 is now at 5. So it's like shifting the 0s to the right by two positions. But in row 6 of example 1, the input has 0s at positions 4,6,8,10. The output has 0s at positions 2,6,8,10. So the 0 at position 4 is now at position 2, which is a shift left by two positions. This seems like a pattern where the 0s are shifted based on the row index. For example, in even rows, the 0s are shifted right by two positions if the row index is even and less than some value, and shifted left if it's higher. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are moved to even columns. For example, in row 2 of example 1, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9 (odd columns). So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain positions. For example, in row 2, the first three columns are set to 2. In row 6, the first column is 2, then 0, then 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure what the pattern is. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the output of example 1 and example 2. For example, in example 1's output, the second row is different from the input. In example 2's output, the second row is also different from the input. So perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are moved to certain positions.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are moved to the right by two columns if the row index is even and the column index is even, or something like that. But this is too vague.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain columns. For example, in row 2, the first three columns are 2,2,2. So perhaps in even rows, the first three columns are set to 2. But in row 6, the first three columns are 2,0,2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain columns based on their position. For example, in even rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s in columns 0, 2, 4, 6, etc. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, perhaps I should try to find a pattern based on the examples and make an educated guess.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the second row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. The input row 2 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. The difference is that the first three columns are 2,2,2 instead of 2,0,2. So maybe in even rows, the first three columns are set to 2. But for row 6 in example 1, the input is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2, and the output is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the first three columns are 2,0,2. This doesn't fit the previous pattern. So this suggests that the pattern is not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the first three columns are set to 2 if the row index is even and less than some value, and otherwise not. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll try to think of another approach. Maybe the transformation is that the output is the same as the input, but with certain rows flipped vertically or horizontally. For example, in example 1, the output's row 2 is different from the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are moved to certain positions based on the column index. For example, in even rows, the 0s are in columns where the column index is even or odd based on the row index.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns that are even, and for odd rows, they are in columns that are odd. But this is not matching the examples.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output of example 1, the second row has 0s at positions 3,5,7,9. These are columns 3,5,7,9, which are odd columns. So maybe for even rows, the 0s are in odd columns. But in example 1's row 6, the output has 0s at positions 2,6,8,10. These are even and odd columns. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Maybe the pattern is that in even rows, the 0s are moved to the right by two positions. For example, in row 2, the 0s are at positions 1,3,7,9. In the output, they are at 3,5,7,9. So shifted by two. In row 6, the input has 0s at 4,6,8,10. The output has 0s at 2,6,8,10. So shifted left by two. This suggests that the transformation is alternating between shifting right and left for even rows. But this is not a clear pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are shifted by two positions to the right if the row index is even and less than 4, and to the left if it's higher. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to think of a possible transformation that could fit the examples. Let's consider that the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are moved to certain positions. For example, in even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in other positions. But this is not clear.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are replaced with 2s in certain columns, and for odd rows, they are left as is. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess based on the examples. Let's look at the output of example 1's row 2: 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. This looks like the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. So maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. But how to determine this from the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in other positions. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, I'll try to write a function that for even rows, sets the 0s to certain positions. For example, for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. So for even rows, the code would set those columns to 0 and others to 2. But how to determine this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. This would explain the examples.\n\nBut how to implement this? For each row, if it's even, set columns 3,5,7,9 to 0, and others to 2. For odd rows, set columns 1,3,7,9 to 0, others to 2. But this is just a guess.\n\nBut let's test this with example 1's row 2 (even row). According to this, columns 3,5,7,9 should be 0. The input row 2 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0s are at 1,3,7,9. The output would have 0s at 3,5,7,9. Which matches the example. For row 6 (even row), the input has 0s at 4,6,8,10. According to the transformation, the 0s should be at 3,5,7,9. But the output for row 6 in example 1 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So the 0s are at 2,6,8,10. This doesn't match the hypothesis.\n\nSo this hypothesis is not correct.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. But this doesn't fit example 1's row 6.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a guess based on the examples. Let's look at example 1's output. For even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. So perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9. For other rows, it's the same as the input.\n\nBut how to implement this. For even rows, set columns 3,5,7,9 to 0, and others to 2. For other rows, keep as is.\n\nBut let's test this with example 1's row 6. Input row 6 is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. According to this transformation, it's an even row, so columns 3,5,7,9 should be 0. But in the input, column 3 is 0, column 5 is 0, column 7 is 0, column 9 is 0. So the output would be 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2, which is the same as the input. But the output for row 6 in example 1 is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So this doesn't match. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, but for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. But this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. So for even rows, the code would set those columns to 0 and others to 2. For odd rows, set columns 1,3,7,9 to 0 and others to 2.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. This would explain example 1's row 2 (even row) and row 6 (even row). But for row 6, the input has 0s in columns 4,6,8,10. The output has 0s in columns 2,6,8,10. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think the best approach is to look for a pattern that could be implemented in code, even if it's not perfect. Given that, perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. This would explain the first example's row 2.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\nFor each row in the grid:\n    if the row is even (0-based or 1-based? Let's assume 0-based, but in example 1, row 2 is the second row, which is even if we count from 1. So maybe row index is 1-based. So for row index 2, it's even.\n\nSo, for each row in the grid:\n    if row index is even (1-based):\n        for column 3,5,7,9 (0-based? Let's see: columns are 0-based. So for 11 columns, columns are 0-10. So 3,5,7,9 are columns 3,5,7,9 (0-based). So for even rows, set those columns to 0 and others to 2.\n    else:\n        for column 1,3,7,9 (0-based), set to 0 and others to 2.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's test this with example 1's row 2 (even row, 1-based row index 2).\n\nFor even row, columns 3,5,7,9 are 0. So the row would be:\n\n[2, 2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2, 0, 2]. Which matches the output of example 1's row 2.\n\nFor example 1's row 6 (even row, 1-based row index 6), columns 3,5,7,9 are 0. So the input row is 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2. So the output would be 2 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 0 2, but the actual output is 2 0 2 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 2. So this doesn't fit.\n\nBut this is the best I can think of. So perhaps the transformation is that for even rows, the 0s are in columns 3,5,7,9, and for odd rows, they are in columns 1,3,7,9. But how to implement this.\n\nSo, the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(7):\n        row = grid[i]\n        new_row = [2]*11\n        if (i+1) % 2 == 0:  # even row (1-based)\n            # set columns 3,5,7,9 to 0\n            for c in [3,5,7,9]:\n                new_row[c] = 0\n        else:\n            # set columns 1,3,7,9 to 0\n            for c in [1,3,7,9]:\n                new_row[c] = 0\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this would not explain example 1's row 6. But perhaps this is the best I can do.\n\nLet's check example 1's row 6 (i=5, 0-based, which is row 6 in 1-based). So (i+1) is 6, even. So columns 3,5,7,9 are set to 0. The input row is [2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2]. So new_row is initially [2]*11. Then, columns 3,5,7,9 are set to 0. So the new_row would be:\n\n[2,2,2,0,2,0,2,0,2,0,2]. Which is the same as the input. But the output for row 6 in example 1 is [2,0,2,0,2,2,2,0,2,0,2]. So this doesn't match.\n\nSo this suggests that this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nAt this point, I'm not sure. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not fit all examples, but it's the best I can think of.\n"
