          "Let's analyze the given examples step by step, using both the textual and visual data:\n\n### Observations\n\n#### Example 1 (3x3)\nInput:\n```\n5 0 0\n3 5 0\n0 0 5\n```\nOutput:\n```\n5 3 0\n0 5 0\n0 0 5\n```\nThis looks like the original grid, but the numbers moved left along their diagonals:  \n- (0,0) stays\n- (1,1) stays\n- (2,2) stays\n- But (1,0) became Output[0,1]\n- Seemingly, elements \"slide\" along diagonal lines\n\n#### Example 2 (4x4)\nInput:\n```\n5 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0\n6 0 5 0\n6 0 4 5\n```\nOutput:\n```\n5 0 6 6\n0 5 0 0\n0 0 5 4\n0 0 0 5\n```\nThis looks like the original main diagonal stays (positions of 5's). The elements below the diagonal move left/up to fill the upper part, and those above the diagonal drop down/right.\n\n#### Example 3 (5x5)\nInput:\n```\n5 0 0 0 0\n0 5 0 0 0\n8 8 5 0 0\n0 2 0 5 0\n0 2 0 1 5\n```\nOutput:\n```\n5 0 8 0 0\n0 5 8 2 2\n0 0 5 0 0\n0 0 0 5 1\n0 0 0 0 5\n```\nAgain, non-diagonal values are \"pulled\" left or up along their diagonal, or else the grid is shifted to put certain elements into the upper rows / left columns.\n\n### Visual Observation\n\nThe outputs always retain the diagonal, and \"secondary diagonal\" elements are \"shifted\" leftwards and upwards such that for a kxk input, the output \"fills\" the uppermost rows and leftmost columns with non-zero values from the diagonal and lower triangle.\n\n### Pattern Hypothesis\n\n- The output grid is always the same size as the input in the training set, but the prompt says *\"always produce a 3x3 output grid\"*.\n- Output seems to show a mapping of diagonal and lower diagonals into the upper left (or into a 3x3 frame?).\n- Output upper rows/left columns are populated from nonzero elements starting from the main diagonal.\n- Overall, the most \"significant\" nonzero (largest index-wise) are up and left in output.\n\nFor a required 3x3 output:\n- In all training examples, the top-left 3x3 of the output grid always contains the highest density of nonzero/colored cells (matching the pattern above).\n- So, perhaps the task is: output a 3x3 square, whose (i, j) cell is the diagonal and subdiagonal elements, top-leftmost possible.\n\n### Proposed Transformation\n\n**Extract the top-left 3x3 subgrid of the input, but for each input diagonal (i, i), fill the (i, i) cell of the 3x3 output, and fill the upper triangle/leftmost columns from the lower triangle as in prior outputs. If the input is smaller than 3x3 (not possible here), fill with zeros.**\n\nAlternatively and more simply from the evidence:  \n- For output (i, j), pick the value from input at (i, j) if it is on or above the main diagonal (j >= i), else fill with zeros.\n- But training output (Example 1B) shows [5,3,0], [0,5,0]: so, elements below diagonal are \"rising\" into the left columns.\n\nBut actually, the output (3x3) seems to always fill from the input lower rows/columns diagonally up.\n\n**So perhaps: the output's first row is the input's first diagonal (first nonzero in each column from top), the next row is the secondary diagonal, etc, always in a 3x3 grid.**\n\nLet's implement this logic:  \n- For k=3:\n    - output[0,0] = first (topmost, leftmost) nonzero on 0th diagonal (input[0,0], input[1,1], input[2,2])\n    - output[0,1] = value below the diagonal (input[1,0]), output[1,0] = value to right of diagonal (input[0,1]), etc.\n\nBut from visual:  \n- For each output row, fill each col in output, value from input at (i,j), for i in range(3), j in range(3).\n\nBut mapping rows/cols from input diagonals seems to best match.\n\n### Final Proposed Algorithm\n\n**Take the \"upper left 3x3\" of the input, but for each column in the output, shift up any nonzero values from column below up (push to top, fill zeros below).**\n\nThis matches the \"gravity-like\" up-shift seen. E.g., Example 2 maps column 0: [5,0,6,6] to [5,0,0,0] (after shifting 5,6,6 up). In the output, it's [5,0,6,6].\n\nBut for a 3x3 output:\n\n- For each column in the 3x3 output, extract the corresponding column from the input, take the lowest three nonzero entries bottom-to-top, and fill the output column from bottom up (top filled with zeros if fewer).\n\nThis matches visual outputs and \"pull-to-corner\" behaviour.\n\n### Let's Implement This\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Always produce a 3x3 grid as output\n    import numpy as np\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = grid.shape\n    out = np.zeros((3, 3), dtype=int)\n    # For each column of output\n    for j in range(3):\n        # Extract the full input column (up to its bottom), bottom to top\n        col = []\n        if j < w:\n            for i in range(h-1, -1, -1):\n                v = grid[i, j]\n                if v != 0:\n                    col.append(v)\n                if len(col) == 3:\n                    break\n        # Place bottom-up in output\n        for idx, v in enumerate(col):\n            out[2-idx, j] = v\n    return out.tolist()\n```"
