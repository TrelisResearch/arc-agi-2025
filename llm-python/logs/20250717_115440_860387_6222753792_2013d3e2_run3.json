Let's look at Example 1:\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 6 8 8 6 0 0 0\n0 0 7 8 4 4 8 7 0 0\n0 0 7 8 4 4 8 7 0 0\n0 0 0 6 8 8 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n0 0 7\n0 6 8\n7 8 4\n\nThe output seems to be formed by taking specific positions from the input grid. Looking at the output positions:\n- (0, 2) from input (2, 4)\n- (1, 1) from input (3, 3)\n- (2, 0) from input (4, 2)\n\nThis suggests that the output is formed by taking values from specific positions in the input grid.\n\nLooking at Example 2:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 3 6 5 3 0 0 0 0\n0 0 5 2 2 6 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 2 2 5 0 0 0 0\n0 0 3 5 6 3 0 0 0 0\n0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\nOutput:\n1 0 0\n0 3 6\n0 5 2\n\nThe output seems to be formed by taking specific positions from the input grid.
