There appears to be a pattern where certain cells are updated based on the values of their neighbors, especially in specific patterns or shapes\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that looks at the values of neighboring cells and applies some transformation rules.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the
