The output values seem to be derived from specific positions in the input grid.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that the output values are derived from the top-left and bottom-right corners of the input grid. For example:\n\n- In Example 1, the output is [2, 2] and [2, 0]. These values correspond to the top-left (0,0) and bottom-right (4,4) positions of the input grid.\n- In Example 2, the output is [1, 0] and [1, 1]. These values correspond to the top-left (0,0) and bottom-right (4,4) positions of the input grid.\n- In Example 3, the output is [0, 8] and [8, 0]. These values correspond to the top-left (0,0) and bottom-right (4,4) positions of the input grid.\n\nBased on this pattern, I hypothesize that the transformation takes the values from the top-left and bottom-right corners of the input grid and uses them to form the output grid.\n\nHere's the Python function that implements this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Extract values from top-left and bottom-right corners\n    top_left = grid[0][0]\n    bottom_right = grid[4][4]\n    \n    # Create the 2x2 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [\n        [top_left, bottom_right],\n        [bottom_right, top_left]\n    ]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Extract values from top-left and bottom-right corners\n    top_left = grid[0][0]\n    bottom_right = grid[4][4]\n    \n    # Create the 2x2 output grid\n    transformed_grid = [\n        [top_left, bottom_right],\n        [bottom_right, top_left]\n    ]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
