There seems to be a pattern where certain values (like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) are being replaced with other values in a structured way.\n3. The transformation seems to involve replacing values in specific regions of the grid, particularly in the middle and lower parts.\n4. There's a pattern where values in the middle of the grid are being replaced with higher values, while values in the corners are being replaced with lower values.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with others based on their position and value.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # Replace values in the middle and lower parts of the grid\n    for i in range(1, 17):  # Rows 1 to 16 (0-indexed)\n        for j in range(1, 21):  # Columns 1 to 20 (0-indexed)\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n    \n    # Replace values in the lower part of the grid\n    for i in range(17, 18):  # Row 17 (0-indexed)\n        for j in range(1, 21):  # Columns 1 to 20 (0-indexed)\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis implementation is based on the observed patterns in the training examples, but it's important to note that the exact transformation rules may need to be refined based on more detailed analysis of the examples.",

There seems to be a pattern where certain values (like 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) are being replaced with other values in a structured way.\n3. The transformation seems to involve replacing values in specific regions of the grid, particularly in the middle and lower parts.\n4. There's a pattern where values in the middle of the grid are being replaced with higher values, while values in the corners are being replaced with lower values.\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that replaces certain values with others based on their position and value.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation rules\n    # This is a simplified version based on observed patterns\n    # Replace values in the middle and lower parts of the grid\n    for i in range(1, 17):  # Rows 1 to 16 (0-indexed)\n        for j in range(1, 21):  # Columns 1 to 20 (0-indexed)\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n    \n    # Replace values in the lower part of the grid\n    for i in range(17, 18):  # Row 17 (0-indexed)\n        for j in range(1, 21):  # Columns 1 to 20 (0-indexed)\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n            elif grid[i][j] == 3:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 5\n            elif grid[i][j] == 4:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 6\n            elif grid[i][j] == 5:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 7\n            elif grid[i][j] == 6:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n            elif grid[i][j] == 7:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n            elif grid[i][j] == 8:\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 9\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis implementation is based on the observed patterns in the training examples, but it's important to note that the exact transformation rules may need to be refined based on more detailed analysis of the examples.",
