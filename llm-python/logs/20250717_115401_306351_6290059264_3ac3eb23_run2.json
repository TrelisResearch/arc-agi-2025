          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find a pattern that maps input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples:\n\nExample 1 shows that the value 2 and 8 are being replicated in a pattern. The output seems to be repeating the first row in a pattern that alternates between the original row and a transformed version of it.\n\nExample 2 shows a similar pattern where the value 4 is being replicated in a pattern that alternates between the original row and a transformed version of it.\n\nFrom these examples, I observe a pattern where the first row is repeated in a pattern that alternates between the original row and a transformed version of it. The transformation seems to be duplicating the values in a specific pattern.\n\nHere's my hypothesis for the transformation:\n- The first row is repeated in a pattern that alternates between the original row and a transformed version of it.\n- The transformed version of a row seems to be the original row with values duplicated in a specific pattern.\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that repeats the first row in a pattern that alternates between the original row and a transformed version of it.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Ensure the grid is 6x10\n    if len(grid) != 6 or len(grid[0]) != 10:\n        raise ValueError(\"Grid must be 6x10\")\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    #

The output seems to be repeating the first row in a pattern of \"row, row, row, row\" with alternating values.\n\nExample 2 shows a similar pattern where the value 4 is being replicated in a pattern of \"row, row, row, row\" with alternating values.\n\nFrom these examples, I observe a pattern where the first row is being repeated in a pattern of \"row, row, row, row\" with alternating values. The values 2 and 8 in example 1, and 4 in example 2, are being replicated in this pattern.\n\nBased on this observation, I'll implement a transformation that repeats the first row in a pattern of \"row, row, row, row\" with alternating values.\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Extract the first row\n    first_row = grid[0]\n    \n    # Create a new grid by repeating the first row in a pattern of \"row, row, row, row\" with alternating values\n    transformed_grid = []\n    for i in range(6):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            transformed_grid.append(first_row)\n        else:\n            transformed_grid.append([val if j % 2 == 0 else 0 for j, val in enumerate(first_row)])\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
