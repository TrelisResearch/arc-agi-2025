The transformation seems to propagate values from certain positions to their neighbors\n2. Values of 8 in Example 4 seem to spread to adjacent cells\n3. Values of 3 in Example 1 seem to spread to adjacent cells\n4. Values of 6 in Example 2 seem to spread to adjacent cells\n5. Values of 2 in Example 3 seem to spread to adjacent cells\n6. Values of 3 in Example 4 seem to spread to adjacent cells\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves spreading values from certain positions to their neighbors, with some values spreading more than others.\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the spread pattern: values spread to adjacent cells\n    # We'll use a breadth-first search approach to spread values\n    # We'll use a queue to process cells to spread\n    \n    # Create a queue to store cells that need to spread\n    from collections import deque\n    queue = deque()\n    \n    # Identify cells that need to spread\n    for i in range(11):\n        for j in range(11):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Directions to spread: up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    \n    # Perform BFS to spread values\n    while queue:\n        i, j = queue.popleft()\n        value = grid[i][j]\n        \n        for di, dj in directions:\n            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n            if 0 <= ni < 11 and 0 <= nj < 11:\n                # If the neighbor cell is 0, spread the value\n                if transformed_grid[ni][nj] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[ni][nj] = value\n                    queue.append((ni, nj))\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the spread pattern: values spread to adjacent cells\n    # We'll use a breadth-first search approach to spread values\n    # We'll use a queue to process cells to spread\n    \n    # Create a queue to store cells that need to spread\n    from collections import deque\n    queue = deque()\n    \n    # Identify cells that need to spread\n    for i in range(11):\n        for j in range(11):\n            if grid[i][j] != 0:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Directions to spread: up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    \n    # Perform BFS to spread values\n    while queue:\n        i, j = queue.popleft()\n        value = grid[i][j]\n        \n        for di, dj in directions:\n            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj\n            if 0 <= ni < 11 and 0 <= nj < 11:\n                # If the neighbor cell is 0, spread the value\n                if transformed_grid[ni][nj] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[ni][nj] = value\n                    queue.append((ni, nj))\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
