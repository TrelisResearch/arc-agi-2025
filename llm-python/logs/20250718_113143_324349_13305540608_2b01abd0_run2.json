In Example 1, the output grid appears to be transforming certain values (like 2 and 3) into new values based on their position and context.\n2. In Example 2, certain values (like 8 and 4) are being transformed in a pattern that seems to be related to their position and the values around them.\n3. In Example 3, values are being transformed in a way that seems to be related to their position and the values around them, with some values being replaced by others in a specific pattern.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain values with others based on their position and context\n- Transforming values in a way that seems to be related to their position in the grid\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

In Example 1, the output grid appears to be transforming certain values (like 2 and 3) into new values based on their position and context.\n2. In Example 2, certain values (like 8 and 4) are being transformed in a pattern that seems to be related to their position and the values around them.\n3. In Example 3, values are being transformed in a way that seems to be related to their position and the values around them, with some values being replaced by others in a specific pattern.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing certain values with others based on their position and context\n- Transforming values in a way that seems to be related to their position in the grid\n\nHere's my implementation based on these observations:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
