The output grids have 5s in certain positions\n2. The 8 in the first example seems to be a key point\n3. The 8 in the second example is also a key point\n4. The 5s seem to spread out from these key points in a certain pattern\n\nFrom these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Identifying key points (like the 8s)\n- Spreading 5s out from these points in a certain pattern\n- Filling the rest of the grid with 0s\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 13x13 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    \n    # Find the position of the 8 in the input grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Spread 5s from this position in a certain pattern\n                # This is a simple pattern that spreads 5s in a diamond shape\n                for dx in range(-3, 4):\n                    for dy in range(-3, 4):\n                        if abs(dx) + abs(dy) <= 3:\n                            ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                            if 0 <= ni < 13 and 0 <= nj < 13:\n                                transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 13x13 output grid initialized to 0\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(13)] for _ in range(13)]\n    \n    # Find the position of the 8 in the input grid\n    for i in range(13):\n        for j in range(13):\n            if grid[i][j] == 8:\n                # Spread 5s from this position in a certain pattern\n                # This is a simple pattern that spreads 5s in a diamond shape\n                for dx in range(-3, 4):\n                    for dy in range(-3, 4):\n                        if abs(dx) + abs(dy) <= 3:\n                            ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                            if 0 <= ni < 13 and 0 <= nj < 13:\n                                transformed_grid[ni][nj] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
