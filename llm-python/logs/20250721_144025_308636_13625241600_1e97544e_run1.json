          "reasoning_content": "**Analyzing the Training Examples**\n\nThe training examples appear to involve transformations that involve copying and rotating segments of a grid. The patterns observed are:\n\n1. **Copy and Rotate**: A segment of the grid is copied to a new position, often rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.\n2. **Rotation**: The original grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n3. **Copy and Rotate with Offset**: The original grid is rotated, then some segments are copied to new positions.\n4. **Copy and Rotate with Cut-Off**: A rotated version of the grid has some edge segments cut-off and replaced with a copy of a segment from the original grid.\n5. **Copy and Rotate with Offset and Cut-Off**: Similar to previous, but with an offset and some edge segments replaced with copies from the original grid.\n6. **Copy and Rotate with Offset and Cut-Off and Trim**: A rotated version of the grid has some edge segments replaced with copies from the original grid, but the original grid is also cut-off and rotated.\n\n**Approaching the Problem**\n\nThe solution should implement the transformation that handles the training examples as well as possible. The function should attempt to:\n\n- Identify the pattern of copy and rotation.\n- Handle the rotation of the original grid.\n- Replace some edge segments with copies from the original grid.\n- Handle the offset and cut-off as needed.\n\nThe function should return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied based on the patterns observed.\n\n**Implementing the Transformation**\n\nThe transformation function should attempt to handle the patterns observed in the training examples. It involves copying and rotating segments of the grid.\n\nThe function will:\n\n- Attempt to rotate the original grid 90 degrees clockwise.\n- Replace some edge segments with copies from the original grid.\n- Handle the offset and cut-off as needed.\n\nThe function will return a new grid based on these transformations.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nThe following function attempts to handle the patterns observed in the training examples. It involves copying and rotating segments of the grid.\n\nThe function will:\n\n- Attempt to rotate the original grid 90 degrees clockwise.\n- Replace some edge segments with copies from the original grid.\n- Handle the offset and cut-off as needed.\n\nThe function will return a new grid based on these transformations.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nThe following function implements the transformation based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

For example, in Example 1, the input and output grids have the same values in the same positions, but the output grid seems to have the values moved in a way that the values increase from the top to the bottom, and the colors seem to repeat in certain patterns. For instance, in Example 1, the input and output grids both have the same values in certain positions, but the output grid seems to have the values moved to the right in certain positions. For example, in Example 1, the input grid has the values \"5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 0 0 4 5 6 1 2 3\" and the output grid has the values \"5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 3\". It seems like the values are moved to the right in certain positions, and the colors (values) repeat in a certain pattern.\n\n**Approaching the Transformation:**\nThe values in the input grid are being copied into the output grid, but with some patterns. The values increase from the top to the bottom, and the colors repeat in certain patterns.

This pattern is repeated in the first 23 rows.\n\n2. **Color Shifting:**\n   - The 24th row (index 23) in the output grid has the same values as the input grid's 23rd row (index 22), with the first 23 values duplicated.\n\n3. **Color Expansion:**\n   - The first 23 values in the input grid are expanded to fill the first 23 columns.\n\n4. **Color Splitting:**\n   - The input grid's values are split into smaller blocks, which are then rearranged in the output grid.\n\n5. **Color Stretching:**\n   - The input grid's values are stretched to fill the output grid's dimensions.\n\n6. **Color Reflection:**\n   - The input grid's values are reflected across a vertical axis to produce the output grid.\n\n7. **Color Rotation:**\n   - The input grid's values are rotated to produce the output grid.\n\n8. **Color Translation:**\n   - The input grid's values are translated to produce the output grid.\n\n9. **Color Scattering:**\n   - The input grid's values are scattered to produce the output grid.\n\n**Implementing the Pattern**\n\nBased on the patterns observed, the transformation involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Copy Values:**\n   - The first 23 values of the input grid's first 23 rows are copied to the output grid's first 23 rows.\n\n2. **Expand Values:**\n   - The first 23 values of the input grid's first 23 rows are expanded to fill the first 23 columns.\n\n3. **Rotate Values:**\n   - The input grid's values are rotated to produce the output grid.\n\n4. **Reflect Values:**\n   - The input grid's values are reflected across a vertical axis to produce the output grid.\n\n5. **Translate Values:**\n   - The input grid's values are translated to produce the output grid.\n\n6. **Scatter Values:**\n   - The input grid's values are scattered to produce the output grid.\n\n7. **Stretch Values:**\n   - The input grid's values are stretched to fill the output grid's dimensions.\n\n8. **Split Values:**\n   - The input grid's values are split into smaller blocks, which are then rearranged in the output grid.\n\n**Final Implementation**\n\nBased on the patterns observed, the transformation involves copying, expanding, rotating, reflecting, translating, scattering, stretching, and splitting the input grid's values. The implementation will focus on the most consistent patterns observed in the training examples.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Copy the first 23 values of the first 23 rows\n    transformed_grid = [row[:23] for row in grid[:23]]\n    \n    # Expand the first 23 values of the first 23 rows\n    for row in transformed_grid:\n        row.extend(row[:23])\n    \n    # Rotate the values\n    transformed_grid = [list(row) for row in zip(*transformed_grid)]\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **Copy Values:** The first 23 values of the first 23 rows are copied to the output grid's first 23 rows.\n2. **Expand Values:** The first 23 values of the first 23 rows are expanded to fill the first 23 columns.\n3. **Rotate Values:** The values are rotated to produce the output grid.\n\n**Note:** This implementation may not perfectly capture all patterns observed, but it implements the most consistent patterns seen in the training examples.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "**Analyzing the Training Examples**\n\nThe training examples appear to involve transformations that involve copying and rotating segments of a grid. The patterns observed are:\n\n1. **Copy and Rotate**: A segment of the grid is copied to a new position, often rotated by 90 degrees clockwise.\n2. **Rotation**: The original grid is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n3. **Copy and Rotate with Offset**: The original grid is rotated, then some segments are copied to new positions.\n4. **Copy and Rotate with Cut-Off**: A rotated version of the grid has some edge segments cut-off and replaced with a copy of a segment from the original grid.\n5. **Copy and Rotate with Offset and Cut-Off**: Similar to previous, but with an offset and some edge segments replaced with copies from the original grid.\n6. **Copy and Rotate with Offset and Cut-Off and Trim**: A rotated version of the grid has some edge segments replaced with copies from the original grid, but the original grid is also cut-off and rotated.\n\n**Approaching the Problem**\n\nThe solution should implement the transformation that handles the training examples as well as possible. The function should attempt to:\n\n- Identify the pattern of copy and rotation.\n- Handle the rotation of the original grid.\n- Replace some edge segments with copies from the original grid.\n- Handle the offset and cut-off as needed.\n\nThe function should return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied based on the patterns observed.\n\n**Implementing the Transformation**\n\nThe transformation function should attempt to handle the patterns observed in the training examples. It involves copying and rotating segments of the grid.\n\nThe function will:\n\n- Attempt to rotate the original grid 90 degrees clockwise.\n- Replace some edge segments with copies from the original grid.\n- Handle the offset and cut-off as needed.\n\nThe function will return a new grid based on these transformations.\n\n**Final Solution**\n\nThe following function attempts to handle the patterns observed in the training examples. It involves copying and rotating segments of the grid.\n\nThe function will:\n\n- Attempt to rotate the original grid 90 degrees clockwise.\n- Replace some edge segments with copies from the original grid.\n- Handle the offset and cut-off as needed.\n\nThe function will return a new grid based on these transformations.\n\n**Implementation**\n\nThe following function implements the transformation based on the patterns observed in the training examples.
