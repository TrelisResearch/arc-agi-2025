The number 5 seems to stay in the first column, but its position changes.\n2. The number 0 seems to be moved to different positions.\n3. The numbers 3, 1, 9, 8, 6, 7, 2, 4 appear to be moved in a pattern that seems to be related to their positions in the grid.\n4. The transformation appears to involve moving values from one position to another in a way that creates a new pattern.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves moving values from one position to another in a specific pattern that creates a new grid.\n\nHere is my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
