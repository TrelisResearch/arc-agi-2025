Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 30\u00d720 output grid.**\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0

this transformation.\n\n**Approach Guidelines:**\n- Look for patterns in shapes, colors, positions, sizes, rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

My task is to write a Python function that implements my best understanding of the transformation.\n\n**Observing Patterns**\n\nLooking at the first example:\n- The input contains a 3x3 square with 2s in the center and 3 in the middle of the right side.\n- The output transforms this into a 3x3 square with 2s at the bottom and 3s on the right edge.\n\nIn the second example:\n- The input has a 4x4 square with 4s on the corners and 3s in certain positions, and the output shows the 4s on the bottom and 3s in certain positions.\n- There's a 7 in the center, which is mirrored on the bottom.\n\n**Trying to Implement Patterns**\n\nI notice the following patterns:\n- **Horizontal Mirroring**: The first example mirrors values horizontally (left to right).\n- **Vertical Mirroring**: The second example mirrors values vertically (top to bottom).\n- **Value Changes**: 2s become 3s, 3s become 5s, and 4s become 7s.\n- **Mirroring Values**: Values like 3 are mirrored in the output, but 7s are mirrored as well.\n\n**Implementing the Transformation**\n\nI will write a function that:\n1. **Mirrors** the grid horizontally.\n2. **Mirrors** the grid vertically.\n3. **Changes values** according to the observed patterns:\n   - 2 becomes 3\n   - 3 becomes 5 \n   - 4 becomes 7\n   - 7 becomes 8\n   - 8 becomes 0\n   - 9 becomes 0\n\nI'll test this function on the training examples and see if it matches the outputs as closely as possible.\n\nI'm aware that this may not capture all the transformations perfectly, especially for values like 9 and the full 2x3 grid. However, based on the patterns observed in the first two examples, this is my best attempt at an initial implementation.\n\n**Final Implementation**\n\nI will now implement the transformation function based on these observations.\n"
