The output values are always 0, 1, 2, or other numbers (like 3 in example 3)\n2. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"expansion\" or \"growth\" pattern\n3. Values in the input grid that are 5 seem to be transformed to 2 in some cases\n4. There are patterns of shapes that seem to be \"grown\" or \"expanded\" in the output\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Identifying regions of 5s in the input grid\n- Expanding those regions into larger regions of 2s or 1s\n- The expansion seems to follow some kind of \"growth\" pattern, possibly similar to cellular automata\n\nHere's my implementation based on this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to store the transformed values\n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Identify regions of 5s and expand them\n    # This is a simple flood fill approach to expand regions of 5s\n    # We'll use a queue to perform BFS\n    from collections import deque\n    \n    # Create a visited matrix to track which cells have been processed\n    visited = np.zeros_like(grid_np, dtype=bool)\n    \n    # Find all starting points (cells with value 5)\n    queue = deque()\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 5 and not visited[i][j]:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n                visited[i][j] = True\n    \n    # Directions for BFS (up, right, down, left)\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]\n    \n    # Perform BFS to expand regions of 5s\n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check all four directions\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            \n            # Check if the new position is within bounds\n            if 0 <= nx < 10 and 0 <= ny < 10:\n                # If the cell is 5 and not visited, add to queue\n                if grid_np[nx][ny] == 5 and not visited[nx][ny]:\n                    visited[nx][ny] = True\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n                \n                # If the cell is 0, we'll transform it to 2 or 1 based on distance\n                if grid_np[nx][ny] == 0:\n                    # Transform to 2 if it's close to the region of 5s\n                    # This is a simple heuristic -

              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The output values seem to be derived from the input values through some transformation, possibly involving counting or grouping.\n2. In Example 1, the 5s in the input become 2s in the output, and the 0s remain 0s.\n3. In Example 2, the 5s in the input become 1s and 2s in the output, with some pattern of transformation.\n4. In Example 3, the 5s in the input become 1s and 2s in the output, with some pattern of transformation.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves counting the number of adjacent 5s (or other values) and replacing them with a value based on that count.\n\nHere's my implementation of this hypothesis:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate over each cell in the grid\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            # Count the number of adjacent 5s (including diagonally adjacent)\n            count = 0\n            for dx in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                for dy in [-1, 0, 1]:\n                    if dx == 0 and dy == 0:\n                        continue  # Skip the cell itself\n                    ni, nj = i + dx, j + dy\n                    if 0 <= ni < 10 and 0 <= nj < 10:\n                        if grid[ni][nj] == 5:\n                            count += 1\n            # Replace 5s with a value based on the count\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                if count == 3:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n                elif count == 4:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif count == 5:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif count == 6:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif count == 7:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif count == 8:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif count == 9:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n                elif count == 10:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n            # For other values, we leave them as is\n            # For 0s, we leave them as is\n            # For other values, we leave them as is\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nThis implementation assumes that the transformation involves counting the number of adjacent 5s and replacing them with a value based on that count. It handles the training examples as well as possible based on this hypothesis.",
