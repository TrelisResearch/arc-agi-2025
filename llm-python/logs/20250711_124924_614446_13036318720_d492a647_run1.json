          "Analysis:\n\n- Both training examples have a large mostly black area (value 0) in the center, surrounded by grey (value 5).\n- Within the black area is a single colored cell (3 in example 1, 1 in example 2) centered or near center.\n- The transformation overlays extra colored cells of the same color as this special central colored cell, on some of the black cells.\n- These additional colored cells appear in a grid pattern spaced 2 cells apart vertically and horizontally, essentially forming a \"checkerboard\" or lattice inside the black region:\n  - Example 1: special color = 3 (green in visual)\n  - Example 2: special color = 1 (blue in visual)\n- The original colored cell remains unchanged.\n- In other positions within the black area (value 0), some cells in a spaced pattern are replaced by the special color, others remain 0.\n- There's no color change to the grey (value 5) or other color cells in the grid.\n- The output has the same dimensions as input (both are 13x16 grids).\n- The pattern of colored cells \"fills out\" the black region with the special color in a 2x2 spacing pattern, starting from the special colored cell position.\n\nHypothesis:\n\n- Detect the \"special color\" inside the black area (the unique non-0, non-5 color inside black).\n- Find its position (r0, c0).\n- Then, for each cell inside black area (value 0) in the input:\n  - If (row - r0) % 2 == 0 and (col - c0) % 2 == 0, color it with the special color.\n  - Else keep as 0.\n- Leave other cells unchanged.\n- This matches the lattice pattern seen in the output.\n  \nThis matches the description from visual and textual data well.\n\n---\n\nImplementation notes:\n\n- Inputs are 2D lists.\n- Grid size is always 13 rows x 16 cols.\n- Black area = value 0.\n- Surrounding area mostly 5.\n- Special color: unique non 0 and non 5 color inside the black area.\n- Return transformed grid.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find special color inside black area (0) - uniquely inside black area is a distinct color !=0,5\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    \n    special_color = None\n    special_pos = None\n    \n    # Scan grid for non-0, non-5 inside black (value 0) area neighbors?\n    # Actually, from input it's just a single colored cell inside black area\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            val = grid[r][c]\n            if val != 0 and val != 5:\n                # Check if this cell is roughly inside black area (surrounded by zeros)?\n                # Given the pattern, just take the first such cell (there should be exactly one)\n                special_color = val\n                special_pos = (r, c)\n                break\n        if special_color is not None:\n            break\n    \n    if special_color is None or special_pos is None:\n        # No special color found, return input unchanged (safe fallback)\n        return [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    r0, c0 = special_pos\n    \n    # Create output grid as copy first\n    output = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 0:\n                # Inside black area: decide if color special_color or keep 0\n                if (r - r0) % 2 == 0 and (c - c0) % 2 == 0:\n                    output[r][c] = special_color\n                else:\n                    output[r][c] = 0\n            else:\n                # Copy unchanged non-black areas\n                output[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n    \n    return output\n```\n"

              "Analysis:\n\n- Both training examples have a large mostly black area (value 0) in the center, surrounded by grey (value 5).\n- Within the black area is a single colored cell (3 in example 1, 1 in example 2) centered or near center.\n- The transformation overlays extra colored cells of the same color as this special central colored cell, on some of the black cells.\n- These additional colored cells appear in a grid pattern spaced 2 cells apart vertically and horizontally, essentially forming a \"checkerboard\" or lattice inside the black region:\n  - Example 1: special color = 3 (green in visual)\n  - Example 2: special color = 1 (blue in visual)\n- The original colored cell remains unchanged.\n- In other positions within the black area (value 0), some cells in a spaced pattern are replaced by the special color, others remain 0.\n- There's no color change to the grey (value 5) or other color cells in the grid.\n- The output has the same dimensions as input (both are 13x16 grids).\n- The pattern of colored cells \"fills out\" the black region with the special color in a 2x2 spacing pattern, starting from the special colored cell position.\n\nHypothesis:\n\n- Detect the \"special color\" inside the black area (the unique non-0, non-5 color inside black).\n- Find its position (r0, c0).\n- Then, for each cell inside black area (value 0) in the input:\n  - If (row - r0) % 2 == 0 and (col - c0) % 2 == 0, color it with the special color.\n  - Else keep as 0.\n- Leave other cells unchanged.\n- This matches the lattice pattern seen in the output.\n  \nThis matches the description from visual and textual data well.\n\n---\n\nImplementation notes:\n\n- Inputs are 2D lists.\n- Grid size is always 13 rows x 16 cols.\n- Black area = value 0.\n- Surrounding area mostly 5.\n- Special color: unique non 0 and non 5 color inside the black area.\n- Return transformed grid.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find special color inside black area (0) - uniquely inside black area is a distinct color !=0,5\n    rows = len(grid)\n    cols = len(grid[0])\n    \n    special_color = None\n    special_pos = None\n    \n    # Scan grid for non-0, non-5 inside black (value 0) area neighbors?\n    # Actually, from input it's just a single colored cell inside black area\n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            val = grid[r][c]\n            if val != 0 and val != 5:\n                # Check if this cell is roughly inside black area (surrounded by zeros)?\n                # Given the pattern, just take the first such cell (there should be exactly one)\n                special_color = val\n                special_pos = (r, c)\n                break\n        if special_color is not None:\n            break\n    \n    if special_color is None or special_pos is None:\n        # No special color found, return input unchanged (safe fallback)\n        return [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    r0, c0 = special_pos\n    \n    # Create output grid as copy first\n    output = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    for r in range(rows):\n        for c in range(cols):\n            if grid[r][c] == 0:\n                # Inside black area: decide if color special_color or keep 0\n                if (r - r0) % 2 == 0 and (c - c0) % 2 == 0:\n                    output[r][c] = special_color\n                else:\n                    output[r][c] = 0\n            else:\n                # Copy unchanged non-black areas\n                output[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n    \n    return output\n```\n"
