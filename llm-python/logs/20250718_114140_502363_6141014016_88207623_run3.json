The transformation seems to involve propagating values from certain positions to surrounding areas\n2. Values like 4, 2, and 8 seem to be spreading from their original positions\n3. Values like 3 and 7 appear to be spreading from specific positions\n4. There's a pattern of spreading values in certain directions (possibly right and down)\n5. Some values (like 3) seem to be spreading from specific positions and then spreading further\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that propagates values from certain positions to their neighbors.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Spread values from positions where value is not zero\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(16):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread to the right\n                for k in range(j+1, 16):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = grid_np[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Spread down\n                for k in range(i+1, 14):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = grid_np[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    # Special case for value 3\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(16):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                # Spread to the right\n                for k in range(j+1, 16):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = 3\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Spread down\n                for k in range(i+1, 14):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = 3\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    # Special case for value 7\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(16):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 7:\n                # Spread to the right\n                for k in range(j+1, 16):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = 7\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Spread down\n                for k in range(i+1, 14):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = 7\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(16):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                for k in range(j+1, 16):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = grid_np[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                for k in range(i+1, 14):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = grid_np[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(16):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                for k in range(j+1, 16):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = 3\n                    else:\n                        break\n                for k in range(i+1, 14):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = 3\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(16):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 7:\n                for k in range(j+1, 16):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = 7\n                    else:\n                        break\n                for k in range(i+1, 14):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = 7\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    return transformed.tolist()\n```",

The transformation seems to involve propagating values from certain positions to surrounding areas\n2. Values like 4, 2, and 8 seem to be spreading from their original positions\n3. Values like 3 and 7 appear to be spreading from specific positions\n4. There's a pattern of spreading values in certain directions (possibly right and down)\n5. Some values (like 3) seem to be spreading from specific positions and then spreading further\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that propagates values from certain positions to their neighbors.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Convert grid to numpy array for easier manipulation\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    # Spread values from positions where value is not zero\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(16):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                # Spread to the right\n                for k in range(j+1, 16):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = grid_np[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Spread down\n                for k in range(i+1, 14):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = grid_np[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    # Special case for value 3\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(16):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                # Spread to the right\n                for k in range(j+1, 16):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = 3\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Spread down\n                for k in range(i+1, 14):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = 3\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    # Special case for value 7\n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(16):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 7:\n                # Spread to the right\n                for k in range(j+1, 16):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = 7\n                    else:\n                        break\n                # Spread down\n                for k in range(i+1, 14):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = 7\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    return transformed.tolist()\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    grid_np = np.array(grid, dtype=int)\n    \n    transformed = grid_np.copy()\n    \n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(16):\n            if grid_np[i][j] != 0:\n                for k in range(j+1, 16):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = grid_np[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n                for k in range(i+1, 14):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = grid_np[i][j]\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(16):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 3:\n                for k in range(j+1, 16):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = 3\n                    else:\n                        break\n                for k in range(i+1, 14):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = 3\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    for i in range(14):\n        for j in range(16):\n            if grid_np[i][j] == 7:\n                for k in range(j+1, 16):\n                    if transformed[i][k] == 0:\n                        transformed[i][k] = 7\n                    else:\n                        break\n                for k in range(i+1, 14):\n                    if transformed[k][j] == 0:\n                        transformed[k][j] = 7\n                    else:\n                        break\n    \n    return transformed.tolist()\n```",
