Numbers in the input grid often appear in specific positions that get expanded or spread out in the output grid.\n2. Numbers like 8, 4, 6, and 9 seem to be expanded into blocks of the same number in the output grid.\n3. Numbers like 2, 3, 5, and 7 also appear in expanded blocks in the output grid.\n4. The output grid always has a 14\u00d715 size, which is one row and one column larger than the input grid.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves expanding certain numbers into blocks in the output grid, with some specific patterns.\n\nHere's my implementation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(14)]\n    \n    # Process each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(14):\n        for col in range(15):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # If the value is not zero, expand it into a block in the output grid\n            if value != 0:\n                # Expand the value into a block of the same value in the output grid\n                # This is a simple expansion pattern that works for some examples\n                for i in range(14):\n                    for j in range(15):\n                        if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                            output[i][j] = value\n    \n    return output\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Initialize the output grid with zeros\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(14)]\n    \n    # Process each cell in the input grid\n    for row in range(14):\n        for col in range(15):\n            value = grid[row][col]\n            \n            # If the value is not zero, expand it into a block in the output grid\n            # This is a simple expansion pattern that works for some examples\n            if value != 0:\n                # Expand the value into a block of the same value in the output grid\n                for i in range(14):\n                    for j in range(15):\n                        if i % 2 == 0 and j % 2 == 0:\n                            output[i][j] = value\n    \n    return output\n```",
