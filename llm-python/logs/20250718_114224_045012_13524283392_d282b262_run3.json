The output grid appears to be a transformation of the input grid where certain values are moved or transformed in specific patterns.\n2. There seems to be a pattern where values in the input grid are \"reflected\" or \"rotated\" in certain positions.\n3. In Example 1, values like 8 and 3 seem to be moved to specific positions in the output grid.\n4. In Example 2, values like 9 and 8 seem to be moved or transformed in specific patterns.\n5. In Example 3, values like 9 and 2 seem to be moved or transformed in specific patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves moving values from specific positions in the input grid to specific positions in the output grid, possibly involving reflections or rotations.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #

The output grid appears to be a transformation of the input grid where certain values are moved or transformed in specific patterns.\n2. There seems to be a pattern where values in the input grid are \"reflected\" or \"rotated\" in certain positions.\n3. In Example 1, values like 8 and 3 seem to be moved to specific positions in the output grid.\n4. In Example 2, values like 9 and 8 seem to be moved or transformed in specific patterns.\n5. In Example 3, values like 9 and 2 seem to be moved or transformed in specific patterns.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves moving values from specific positions in the input grid to specific positions in the output grid, possibly involving reflections or rotations.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    #
