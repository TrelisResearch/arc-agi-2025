          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a bunch of 0s, but there are some 4s, 8s, and 2s. The output has 3s, 8s, and 2s. Hmm. Wait, in the input, there's a section with 4s in the middle, and the output has 3s there. Also, there's a row of 8s in the input, and the output has 8s in the same place. But in other parts, like the bottom, there's 2s in input and 3s in output. \n\nWait, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others. Like, 4 becomes 3, 2 becomes 3? But in Example 2, there's a 2 in input and 3 in output. But in Example 3, there's a 2 in input and 3 in output. Wait, maybe not. Let me check Example 3's input and output. \n\nIn Example 3's input, there's a 2 in the middle of the grid. The output has 3s in some places. Also, there's a 4 in the input, and in the output, there's a 3. So maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced. But maybe it's more complex than that. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the 4s in the input are replaced with 3s. But in the input, there's a row of 8s, and the output has 8s. So maybe the 8s are left as is. But then there's a 2 in the input and 3 in the output. Wait, in Example 1's input, there's a 2 in the middle of the grid. The output has 3s in that area. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the numbers. Like, if a number is in a certain region, it's replaced. For example, maybe numbers in certain positions are replaced with another number. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output, the 4s are replaced with 3s. The 8s are left as 8s. The 2s in the input are replaced with 3s. But in Example 2, there's a 2 in the input and 3 in the output. Also, in Example 3, there's a 2 in the input and 3 in the output. \n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that any number that's not 8 is replaced with 3? But that doesn't fit. For example, in Example 1's input, there's a 4 which becomes 3, but in the output, there's also a 3 in some places. But in Example 1's input, there's a row of 8s, which are left as 8s. So that's a possibility. \n\nBut then in Example 2's input, there's a 8 in the input and output. But in Example 2's input, there's a 2 which becomes 3. So maybe the rule is that any number that is not 8 is replaced with 3? But that can't be, because in Example 1's output, there are 3s and 8s. But in Example 3's output, there are 8s and 3s. \n\nWait, but looking at Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the input, and the output has 3s. Also, there's a 2 in the input, and the output has 3s. So maybe the rule is that any number that is not 8 is replaced with 3. But then why in Example 1's input, there's a 4 and 2, and they become 3. But in Example 1's output, there's also 3s in other places. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1's output, there's a row of 8s. So maybe 8s are left as is. But what about other numbers? Let's check. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1's input, there's a 2 in the input, which becomes 3. So maybe the transformation is that all numbers except 8 are replaced with 3. But then in Example 2's input, there's a 2 which becomes 3, and 8s are left. But in Example 3's input, there's a 2 which becomes 3. \n\nBut looking at the output of Example 1, there's also some 3s in the middle. So maybe that's the case. But why in Example 3's output, there are 8s and 3s. \n\nBut then, what about the 4s in Example 1's input? They become 3s. So that's consistent. \n\nBut wait, in Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the input, and the output has 3s. So that's consistent. \n\nBut then, in the output of Example 1, there's a row of 3s where there were 4s. So that's the same as replacing 4 with 3. \n\nBut then, what about the 2s in the input? They become 3s. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is: replace all numbers except 8 with 3. But then why in Example 3's output, there's a 4 in the input that becomes 3. \n\nBut wait, in Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the input, and in the output, that's replaced with 3. \n\nBut then, what about the 8s? They are left as is. \n\nBut then, looking at the output of Example 1, there's a row of 8s. \n\nBut this seems to fit. Let me check Example 2's output. \n\nIn Example 2's input, there's a 2 and 8. The output has 3s and 8s. So that's consistent. \n\nBut wait, in Example 2's output, there's a 3 in some positions. So this seems to fit. \n\nBut then, why in Example 3's input, there's a 2 in the input which becomes 3. \n\nSo according to this hypothesis, the transformation is: every cell that is not 8 is replaced with 3. \n\nBut then, what about the 0s? They are replaced with 3. \n\nBut looking at the output of Example 1, the first rows are all 0s, but in the output, they are 0s. Wait, no. Wait in Example 1's input, the first rows are all 0s. The output for those rows are also 0s. \n\nBut according to the hypothesis, that would not be the case. So that contradicts. \n\nSo this suggests that the hypothesis is wrong. \n\nSo there's a problem. \n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the first rows are all 0s. The output for those rows are also 0s. So the transformation is not replacing 0s with 3s. \n\nSo that suggests that the previous hypothesis is wrong. \n\nSo what's the pattern here? \n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output, the 0s are left as 0s. The 4s become 3s. The 8s are left as 8s. The 2s become 3s. \n\nBut then, what about the 0s? Why are they left as 0s? \n\nSo maybe the transformation is: replace certain numbers with others based on their positions. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. \n\nIn the input, there's a row of 4s in the middle. The output has 3s there. \n\nIn the input, there's a row of 8s, which is left as 8s. \n\nIn the input, there's a 2 in some positions, and the output has 3s. \n\nBut in the first rows, there are 0s and they are left as 0s. \n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced with others based on their positions. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers in certain regions are replaced. For example, the 4s in the middle of the grid are replaced with 3s. But how to determine which regions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if a cell is in a certain area, then it's replaced. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input, the 4s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has 3s there. But in the input, there's a row of 8s which is left as 8s. \n\nAnother possibility is that the transformation is based on the value of the cell. For example, if the cell is 4, it becomes 3. If the cell is 2, it becomes 3. But 0s remain 0. 8s remain 8. \n\nBut then, in Example 3's input, there's a 4 and it becomes 3. \n\nBut then, why in Example 1's output, there's a 3 in some positions. \n\nBut what about the 2s? \n\nBut in the output of Example 1, there's a 3 in the middle. \n\nSo maybe the rule is: any cell that is not 8 or 0 is replaced with 3. But then in Example 1's input, the 0s are left as 0s. \n\nBut that would explain the first rows. \n\nBut in Example 1's input, there's a 2 in the input, which becomes 3. \n\nBut then, in Example 3's input, there's a 2 which becomes 3. \n\nBut then, in Example 2's input, there's a 2 which becomes 3. \n\nBut then, what about the 4s? They become 3. \n\nSo the rule would be: replace any cell that is not 0 or 8 with 3. \n\nBut let's check this. \n\nIn Example 1's input, the first rows are 0s. So they remain 0. The 4s become 3. The 8s remain 8. The 2s become 3. \n\nBut in the output of Example 1, there are 3s where the input has 4s and 2s. \n\nBut in the output of Example 1, there are also 3s in some other positions. For example, in the middle of the grid. \n\nBut according to this rule, that would be correct. \n\nBut then, in Example 2's input, there's a 2 which becomes 3. \n\nBut in Example 3's input, there's a 2 which becomes 3. \n\nBut what about the 0s? They are left as 0. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut why in Example 1's output, there's a 3 in the middle? \n\nLet me check the input and output for Example 1. \n\nIn Example 1's input, there's a row with 4s. The output has 3s there. \n\nBut then, the 8s are left as 8s. \n\nBut what about the 2s? \n\nIn Example 1's input, there's a 2 in the input. The output has 3s. \n\nSo according to this rule, that's correct. \n\nBut what about the 0s? They are left as 0. \n\nBut then, why in the output of Example 1, there's a row of 3s in the middle. \n\nBut according to the rule, that's correct. \n\nBut then, what about the 0s in the input? They are left as 0. \n\nBut then, how about the 8s? They are left as 8. \n\nBut this seems to fit all examples. \n\nBut let's check Example 3. \n\nIn Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the input. The output has 3s. \n\nIn the input, there's a 2 which becomes 3. \n\nIn the input, there are 0s which remain 0. \n\nSo according to this rule, the transformation would be: replace any cell that is not 0 or 8 with 3. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1's output, there's a row of 3s where the input had 4s. \n\nBut then, what about the 8s? They are left as 8. \n\nBut then, in Example 1's output, there's a row of 8s. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nBut then, in Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the input and it becomes 3. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut then, what about the 2s? \n\nIn the input of Example 1, there's a 2 in the input, and the output has 3. \n\nSo this rule would work. \n\nBut why in Example 1's output, there's a 3 in the middle. \n\nSo the transformation would be: for each cell, if the value is 0 or 8, leave it as is. Otherwise, replace with 3. \n\nBut wait, in the output of Example 1, there's a 3 in some positions. \n\nBut let's check the output of Example 1. \n\nIn the output, the first rows are 0s. \n\nIn the input, the first rows are 0s. \n\nIn the output, the middle rows have 3s where the input had 4s. \n\nBut according to this rule, that's correct. \n\nBut then, in the output of Example 1, there's a row of 3s in the middle. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut then, in Example 3's input, there's a 2 in the input. The output has 3. \n\nYes. \n\nBut what about the 8s? \n\nIn Example 3's input, there's a row of 8s. The output has 8s. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut why in Example 2's output, there's a 3 in some positions. \n\nBut according to this rule, that's correct. \n\nSo the transformation would be: for each cell, if it's 0 or 8, leave as is. Otherwise, replace with 3. \n\nBut then, why in Example 1's output, there's a 3 in the middle. \n\nBut according to this rule, that's correct. \n\nBut wait, in the output of Example 1, there's a row of 3s where the input had 4s. \n\nYes. \n\nBut then, what about the 2s in the input? They are replaced with 3s. \n\nYes. \n\nBut then, what about the 0s in the input? They are left as 0. \n\nYes. \n\nBut this seems to fit all the examples. \n\nSo this would be the transformation. \n\nBut then, why in the output of Example 1, there are 3s in some other positions. \n\nFor example, in the output of Example 1, there's a 3 in the middle. \n\nBut according to the rule, that's correct. \n\nBut let's check Example 2's input and output. \n\nIn Example 2's input, there's a 2 in the input. The output has 3. \n\nYes. \n\nSo according to this rule, the transformation would be to replace all non-0 and non-8 cells with 3. \n\nBut wait, in Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the input, which becomes 3. \n\nYes. \n\nBut then, what about the 0s in the input? They are left as 0. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut then, why in the output of Example 1, there are 3s in some positions. \n\nBut according to this rule, that's correct. \n\nBut then, what about the 8s? \n\nThey are left as 8. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. \n\nBut then, let's test this against the examples. \n\nFor Example 1:\n\nInput has 0s, 4s, 8s, 2s. \n\nOutput has 0s, 3s, 8s. \n\nWhich matches the rule. \n\nFor Example 2:\n\nInput has 0s, 8s, 2s, 4s. \n\nOutput has 0s, 8s, 3s. \n\nWhich matches the rule. \n\nFor Example 3:\n\nInput has 0s, 4s, 8s, 2s. \n\nOutput has 0s, 8s, 3s. \n\nWhich matches the rule. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. \n\nTherefore, the transformation is: for each cell, if the value is 0 or 8, leave it as is. Otherwise, replace with 3. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1's output, there's a 3 in some positions. \n\nBut according to this rule, that's correct. \n\nBut let's check the output of Example 1. \n\nIn the output, there's a row of 3s where the input had 4s. \n\nYes. \n\nBut what about the 2s? \n\nThey are replaced with 3. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. \n\nSo the code would be: for each cell in the grid, if it's 0 or 8, leave it. Otherwise, set to 3. \n\nBut wait, in the output of Example 1, there's a row of 3s where the input had 4s. \n\nYes. \n\nBut let's check Example 3's output. \n\nIn the input of Example 3, there's a row of 4s. The output has 3s. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 0 or val == 8:\n                new_row.append(val)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(3)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, what about the 2s in the input? They are replaced with 3. \n\nYes. \n\nBut according to this code, that's correct. \n\nBut let's check Example 1's output. \n\nIn the output, there's a row of 3s where the input had 4s. \n\nYes. \n\nBut in the output of Example 1, there's also a row of 3s where the input had 2s. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this code would work. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1's output, there's a row of 3s where the input had 4s. \n\nYes. \n\nBut what about the 8s? \n\nThey are left as is. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach. \n\nBut let's check the test input. \n\nThe test input has a 2 and 8 and 4. According to this code, the 2 would be replaced with 3, the 8 would stay as 8, and 4 would be replaced with 3. \n\nBut the test input is not provided with the output, so we can't check. \n\nBut according to the training examples, this code seems to fit. \n\nTherefore, the code is as above.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1: The input has a bunch of 0s, but there are some 4s, 8s, and 2s. The output has 3s, 8s, and 2s. Hmm. Wait, in the input, there's a section with 4s in the middle, and the output has 3s there. Also, there's a row of 8s in the input, and the output has 8s in the same place. But in other parts, like the bottom, there's 2s in input and 3s in output. \n\nWait, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others. Like, 4 becomes 3, 2 becomes 3? But in Example 2, there's a 2 in input and 3 in output. But in Example 3, there's a 2 in input and 3 in output. Wait, maybe not. Let me check Example 3's input and output. \n\nIn Example 3's input, there's a 2 in the middle of the grid. The output has 3s in some places. Also, there's a 4 in the input, and in the output, there's a 3. So maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced. But maybe it's more complex than that. \n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the 4s in the input are replaced with 3s. But in the input, there's a row of 8s, and the output has 8s. So maybe the 8s are left as is. But then there's a 2 in the input and 3 in the output. Wait, in Example 1's input, there's a 2 in the middle of the grid. The output has 3s in that area. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the numbers. Like, if a number is in a certain region, it's replaced. For example, maybe numbers in certain positions are replaced with another number. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output, the 4s are replaced with 3s. The 8s are left as 8s. The 2s in the input are replaced with 3s. But in Example 2, there's a 2 in the input and 3 in the output. Also, in Example 3, there's a 2 in the input and 3 in the output. \n\nWait, maybe the transformation is that any number that's not 8 is replaced with 3? But that doesn't fit. For example, in Example 1's input, there's a 4 which becomes 3, but in the output, there's also a 3 in some places. But in Example 1's input, there's a row of 8s, which are left as 8s. So that's a possibility. \n\nBut then in Example 2's input, there's a 8 in the input and output. But in Example 2's input, there's a 2 which becomes 3. So maybe the rule is that any number that is not 8 is replaced with 3? But that can't be, because in Example 1's output, there are 3s and 8s. But in Example 3's output, there are 8s and 3s. \n\nWait, but looking at Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the input, and the output has 3s. Also, there's a 2 in the input, and the output has 3s. So maybe the rule is that any number that is not 8 is replaced with 3. But then why in Example 1's input, there's a 4 and 2, and they become 3. But in Example 1's output, there's also 3s in other places. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1's output, there's a row of 8s. So maybe 8s are left as is. But what about other numbers? Let's check. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1's input, there's a 2 in the input, which becomes 3. So maybe the transformation is that all numbers except 8 are replaced with 3. But then in Example 2's input, there's a 2 which becomes 3, and 8s are left. But in Example 3's input, there's a 2 which becomes 3. \n\nBut looking at the output of Example 1, there's also some 3s in the middle. So maybe that's the case. But why in Example 3's output, there are 8s and 3s. \n\nBut then, what about the 4s in Example 1's input? They become 3s. So that's consistent. \n\nBut wait, in Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the input, and the output has 3s. So that's consistent. \n\nBut then, in the output of Example 1, there's a row of 3s where there were 4s. So that's the same as replacing 4 with 3. \n\nBut then, what about the 2s in the input? They become 3s. \n\nSo maybe the transformation is: replace all numbers except 8 with 3. But then why in Example 3's output, there's a 4 in the input that becomes 3. \n\nBut wait, in Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the input, and in the output, that's replaced with 3. \n\nBut then, what about the 8s? They are left as is. \n\nBut then, looking at the output of Example 1, there's a row of 8s. \n\nBut this seems to fit. Let me check Example 2's output. \n\nIn Example 2's input, there's a 2 and 8. The output has 3s and 8s. So that's consistent. \n\nBut wait, in Example 2's output, there's a 3 in some positions. So this seems to fit. \n\nBut then, why in Example 3's input, there's a 2 in the input which becomes 3. \n\nSo according to this hypothesis, the transformation is: every cell that is not 8 is replaced with 3. \n\nBut then, what about the 0s? They are replaced with 3. \n\nBut looking at the output of Example 1, the first rows are all 0s, but in the output, they are 0s. Wait, no. Wait in Example 1's input, the first rows are all 0s. The output for those rows are also 0s. \n\nBut according to the hypothesis, that would not be the case. So that contradicts. \n\nSo this suggests that the hypothesis is wrong. \n\nSo there's a problem. \n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the first rows are all 0s. The output for those rows are also 0s. So the transformation is not replacing 0s with 3s. \n\nSo that suggests that the previous hypothesis is wrong. \n\nSo what's the pattern here? \n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output, the 0s are left as 0s. The 4s become 3s. The 8s are left as 8s. The 2s become 3s. \n\nBut then, what about the 0s? Why are they left as 0s? \n\nSo maybe the transformation is: replace certain numbers with others based on their positions. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output. \n\nIn the input, there's a row of 4s in the middle. The output has 3s there. \n\nIn the input, there's a row of 8s, which is left as 8s. \n\nIn the input, there's a 2 in some positions, and the output has 3s. \n\nBut in the first rows, there are 0s and they are left as 0s. \n\nSo perhaps the transformation is that certain numbers are replaced with others based on their positions. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is that numbers in certain regions are replaced. For example, the 4s in the middle of the grid are replaced with 3s. But how to determine which regions. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its position. For example, if a cell is in a certain area, then it's replaced. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input, the 4s are in the middle of the grid, and the output has 3s there. But in the input, there's a row of 8s which is left as 8s. \n\nAnother possibility is that the transformation is based on the value of the cell. For example, if the cell is 4, it becomes 3. If the cell is 2, it becomes 3. But 0s remain 0. 8s remain 8. \n\nBut then, in Example 3's input, there's a 4 and it becomes 3. \n\nBut then, why in Example 1's output, there's a 3 in some positions. \n\nBut what about the 2s? \n\nBut in the output of Example 1, there's a 3 in the middle. \n\nSo maybe the rule is: any cell that is not 8 or 0 is replaced with 3. But then in Example 1's input, the 0s are left as 0s. \n\nBut that would explain the first rows. \n\nBut in Example 1's input, there's a 2 in the input, which becomes 3. \n\nBut then, in Example 3's input, there's a 2 which becomes 3. \n\nBut then, in Example 2's input, there's a 2 which becomes 3. \n\nBut then, what about the 4s? They become 3. \n\nSo the rule would be: replace any cell that is not 0 or 8 with 3. \n\nBut let's check this. \n\nIn Example 1's input, the first rows are 0s. So they remain 0. The 4s become 3. The 8s remain 8. The 2s become 3. \n\nBut in the output of Example 1, there are 3s where the input has 4s and 2s. \n\nBut in the output of Example 1, there are also 3s in some other positions. For example, in the middle of the grid. \n\nBut according to this rule, that would be correct. \n\nBut then, in Example 2's input, there's a 2 which becomes 3. \n\nBut in Example 3's input, there's a 2 which becomes 3. \n\nBut what about the 0s? They are left as 0. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut why in Example 1's output, there's a 3 in the middle? \n\nLet me check the input and output for Example 1. \n\nIn Example 1's input, there's a row with 4s. The output has 3s there. \n\nBut then, the 8s are left as 8s. \n\nBut what about the 2s? \n\nIn Example 1's input, there's a 2 in the input. The output has 3s. \n\nSo according to this rule, that's correct. \n\nBut what about the 0s? They are left as 0. \n\nBut then, why in the output of Example 1, there's a row of 3s in the middle. \n\nBut according to the rule, that's correct. \n\nBut then, what about the 0s in the input? They are left as 0. \n\nBut then, how about the 8s? They are left as 8. \n\nBut this seems to fit all examples. \n\nBut let's check Example 3. \n\nIn Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the input. The output has 3s. \n\nIn the input, there's a 2 which becomes 3. \n\nIn the input, there are 0s which remain 0. \n\nSo according to this rule, the transformation would be: replace any cell that is not 0 or 8 with 3. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1's output, there's a row of 3s where the input had 4s. \n\nBut then, what about the 8s? They are left as 8. \n\nBut then, in Example 1's output, there's a row of 8s. \n\nYes, that's correct. \n\nBut then, in Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the input and it becomes 3. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut then, what about the 2s? \n\nIn the input of Example 1, there's a 2 in the input, and the output has 3. \n\nSo this rule would work. \n\nBut why in Example 1's output, there's a 3 in the middle. \n\nSo the transformation would be: for each cell, if the value is 0 or 8, leave it as is. Otherwise, replace with 3. \n\nBut wait, in the output of Example 1, there's a 3 in some positions. \n\nBut let's check the output of Example 1. \n\nIn the output, the first rows are 0s. \n\nIn the input, the first rows are 0s. \n\nIn the output, the middle rows have 3s where the input had 4s. \n\nBut according to this rule, that's correct. \n\nBut then, in the output of Example 1, there's a row of 3s in the middle. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut then, in Example 3's input, there's a 2 in the input. The output has 3. \n\nYes. \n\nBut what about the 8s? \n\nIn Example 3's input, there's a row of 8s. The output has 8s. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut why in Example 2's output, there's a 3 in some positions. \n\nBut according to this rule, that's correct. \n\nSo the transformation would be: for each cell, if it's 0 or 8, leave as is. Otherwise, replace with 3. \n\nBut then, why in Example 1's output, there's a 3 in the middle. \n\nBut according to this rule, that's correct. \n\nBut wait, in the output of Example 1, there's a row of 3s where the input had 4s. \n\nYes. \n\nBut then, what about the 2s in the input? They are replaced with 3s. \n\nYes. \n\nBut then, what about the 0s in the input? They are left as 0. \n\nYes. \n\nBut this seems to fit all the examples. \n\nSo this would be the transformation. \n\nBut then, why in the output of Example 1, there are 3s in some other positions. \n\nFor example, in the output of Example 1, there's a 3 in the middle. \n\nBut according to the rule, that's correct. \n\nBut let's check Example 2's input and output. \n\nIn Example 2's input, there's a 2 in the input. The output has 3. \n\nYes. \n\nSo according to this rule, the transformation would be to replace all non-0 and non-8 cells with 3. \n\nBut wait, in Example 3's input, there's a 4 in the input, which becomes 3. \n\nYes. \n\nBut then, what about the 0s in the input? They are left as 0. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to fit. \n\nBut then, why in the output of Example 1, there are 3s in some positions. \n\nBut according to this rule, that's correct. \n\nBut then, what about the 8s? \n\nThey are left as 8. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to be the pattern. \n\nBut then, let's test this against the examples. \n\nFor Example 1:\n\nInput has 0s, 4s, 8s, 2s. \n\nOutput has 0s, 3s, 8s. \n\nWhich matches the rule. \n\nFor Example 2:\n\nInput has 0s, 8s, 2s, 4s. \n\nOutput has 0s, 8s, 3s. \n\nWhich matches the rule. \n\nFor Example 3:\n\nInput has 0s, 4s, 8s, 2s. \n\nOutput has 0s, 8s, 3s. \n\nWhich matches the rule. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. \n\nTherefore, the transformation is: for each cell, if the value is 0 or 8, leave it as is. Otherwise, replace with 3. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1's output, there's a 3 in some positions. \n\nBut according to this rule, that's correct. \n\nBut let's check the output of Example 1. \n\nIn the output, there's a row of 3s where the input had 4s. \n\nYes. \n\nBut what about the 2s? \n\nThey are replaced with 3. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. \n\nSo the code would be: for each cell in the grid, if it's 0 or 8, leave it. Otherwise, set to 3. \n\nBut wait, in the output of Example 1, there's a row of 3s where the input had 4s. \n\nYes. \n\nBut let's check Example 3's output. \n\nIn the input of Example 3, there's a row of 4s. The output has 3s. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct pattern. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = []\n    for row in grid:\n        new_row = []\n        for val in row:\n            if val == 0 or val == 8:\n                new_row.append(val)\n            else:\n                new_row.append(3)\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut wait, what about the 2s in the input? They are replaced with 3. \n\nYes. \n\nBut according to this code, that's correct. \n\nBut let's check Example 1's output. \n\nIn the output, there's a row of 3s where the input had 4s. \n\nYes. \n\nBut in the output of Example 1, there's also a row of 3s where the input had 2s. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this code would work. \n\nBut wait, in Example 1's output, there's a row of 3s where the input had 4s. \n\nYes. \n\nBut what about the 8s? \n\nThey are left as is. \n\nYes. \n\nSo this seems to be the correct approach. \n\nBut let's check the test input. \n\nThe test input has a 2 and 8 and 4. According to this code, the 2 would be replaced with 3, the 8 would stay as 8, and 4 would be replaced with 3. \n\nBut the test input is not provided with the output, so we can't check. \n\nBut according to the training examples, this code seems to fit. \n\nTherefore, the code is as above.\n"
