          "Let's analyze the two examples:\n\n### Observations:\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input has two nonzero numbers on the same row but on the edges: 1 at (1,0) and 2 at (1,10)\n- Output keeps the same shape (5\u00d711), but the middle row (row 1) is filled as follows:\n  - From 0 to 4: filled with 1 (the left number)\n  - Position 5: filled with 5 (a fixed marker)\n  - From 6 to 10: filled with 2 (the right number)\n- All other rows zero\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input has two nonzero numbers on the same row but this time it's row 3:\n  - 3 at (3,0)\n  - 7 at (3,10)\n- Output:\n  - Row 3 is filled similarly:\n    - Columns 0 to 4: 3\n    - Column 5: 5\n    - Columns 6 to 10: 7\n- Other rows zero\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- Find the row containing two nonzero integers located on the edges (columns 0 and 10)\n- Fill columns 0-4 with the left integer\n- Place a 5 in column 5\n- Fill columns 6-10 with the right integer\n- All other cells zero\n\n**What if the two numbers are on different rows (like test input)?**\n\n- The test input has three numbers 4 at (1,0), 8 at (1,10), and also 6 at (4,0), 9 at (4,10).\n- Because training examples have always a single row containing the two corner markers, I hypothesize we apply the rule **per each row that contains corner numbers at columns 0 and 10**.\n\nTherefore, the solution will:\n\n- Start with a zero grid\n- For each row in the input:\n  - If leftmost and rightmost cells are nonzero, fill that row following the pattern (left fill, 5 middle, right fill)\n- All other rows are all zero\n\nThis explains both examples and probably the test too.\n\n---\n\nImplementing this logic now.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    height = 5\n    width = 11\n    # Initialize output grid with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0]*width for _ in range(height)]\n    \n    for r in range(height):\n        left_val = grid[r][0]\n        right_val = grid[r][width-1]\n        if left_val != 0 and right_val != 0:\n            # fill left 0-4 with left_val\n            for c in range(0,5):\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = left_val\n            # fill position 5 with 5\n            transformed_grid[r][5] = 5\n            # fill right 6-10 with right_val\n            for c in range(6,11):\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = right_val\n        else:\n            # else leave row as zeros\n            pass\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

              "Let's analyze the two examples:\n\n### Observations:\n\n**Example 1:**\n- Input has two nonzero numbers on the same row but on the edges: 1 at (1,0) and 2 at (1,10)\n- Output keeps the same shape (5\u00d711), but the middle row (row 1) is filled as follows:\n  - From 0 to 4: filled with 1 (the left number)\n  - Position 5: filled with 5 (a fixed marker)\n  - From 6 to 10: filled with 2 (the right number)\n- All other rows zero\n\n**Example 2:**\n- Input has two nonzero numbers on the same row but this time it's row 3:\n  - 3 at (3,0)\n  - 7 at (3,10)\n- Output:\n  - Row 3 is filled similarly:\n    - Columns 0 to 4: 3\n    - Column 5: 5\n    - Columns 6 to 10: 7\n- Other rows zero\n\nSo the pattern is:\n\n- Find the row containing two nonzero integers located on the edges (columns 0 and 10)\n- Fill columns 0-4 with the left integer\n- Place a 5 in column 5\n- Fill columns 6-10 with the right integer\n- All other cells zero\n\n**What if the two numbers are on different rows (like test input)?**\n\n- The test input has three numbers 4 at (1,0), 8 at (1,10), and also 6 at (4,0), 9 at (4,10).\n- Because training examples have always a single row containing the two corner markers, I hypothesize we apply the rule **per each row that contains corner numbers at columns 0 and 10**.\n\nTherefore, the solution will:\n\n- Start with a zero grid\n- For each row in the input:\n  - If leftmost and rightmost cells are nonzero, fill that row following the pattern (left fill, 5 middle, right fill)\n- All other rows are all zero\n\nThis explains both examples and probably the test too.\n\n---\n\nImplementing this logic now.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    height = 5\n    width = 11\n    # Initialize output grid with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0]*width for _ in range(height)]\n    \n    for r in range(height):\n        left_val = grid[r][0]\n        right_val = grid[r][width-1]\n        if left_val != 0 and right_val != 0:\n            # fill left 0-4 with left_val\n            for c in range(0,5):\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = left_val\n            # fill position 5 with 5\n            transformed_grid[r][5] = 5\n            # fill right 6-10 with right_val\n            for c in range(6,11):\n                transformed_grid[r][c] = right_val\n        else:\n            # else leave row as zeros\n            pass\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"
