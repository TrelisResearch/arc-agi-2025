          "Let's analyze the transformation from the training examples:\n\n### Observations\n\n**General:**\n- All grids are 30x30, both input and output.\n- The input has certain \"border\" stripes (solid green: color 3).\n- In the \"main\" black region (0), there are colored blocks (mainly 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\n- The shapes in the input are variously colored squares, rectangles, or inner structures.\n\n#### What changes between input and output:\n\n##### Example 1\n- In the lower (black) area:\n    - Every colored square is replaced with a specific pattern: a smaller square of another color is inserted \"inside\" larger squares, or a more complicated pattern appears.\n    - The colored regions seem to \"inherit\" the structure or mini-pattern from similar-colored blocks at the border, or from \"template\" patterns visible in the border amoung blocks of the same color.\n- The green border doesn't change.\n\n##### Example 2\n- The transformation is similar: each colored rectangle or square in the black area is \"decorated\" or replaced with an inner mini-pattern that matches/repeats the relevant border's block pattern.\n    - E.g., a yellow block on the left border is a 5x5 'square with a smaller blue 3x3 square inside', and so every large yellow square in the black area is replaced with that same nested pattern.\n    - Other colors (blue, red, etc.) are treated the same way.\n\n##### Example 3\n- This one confirms the pattern: for each color present, the relevant \"template\" comes from that color's region on the border, and is used to fill every occurence of that color in the main region, regardless of size.\n\n---\n\n### Hypothesis\n\n#### Transformation Rule (summary):\n\n1. **For each connected colored region (not black, not green border) appearing in the main region:**\n   - **Find the template** for that color on the border (usually the first region of that color on the border, and its exact pattern).\n   - **Replace each region in the main area** with the template, scaling (or not scaling) as needed for the region size, but preserving the template's \"inner\" structure.\n\n   It is as if every block's style in the main area is replaced by the template shape from the border for the same color, pasted over the old location.\n\n    - Borders are not changed.\n\n#### Implementation Approach\n\n- For each color in the grid, extract all the border patterns for that color.\n- For each region of that color in the main area, replace it with the template pattern for that color, aligned at the same top-left.\n- If the region is bigger than the template, tile the template or pad with background color (usually black).\n\n---\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Identify the border regions** and extract templates for each color.\n2. **Find all connected components in the main area** (colors != 0 and != 3).\n3. **For each such region, paste the template from border at its location**.\n\nLet\u2019s write the code for this approach:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    from scipy.ndimage import label, find_objects\n\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = grid.shape\n    assert h == 30 and w == 30\n\n    # 1.

Your task is to:\n\n1. **Analyze the training examples** to discover patterns that map input grids to output grids\n2. **Write a Python program** that implements your best understanding of the transformation  \n3. **DO NOT predict or generate the test output** - your job is only to write the transformation program\n4. **Attempt a solution** - even if the pattern isn't completely clear, provide your best hypothesis\n5. **Do not repeat the same transformation** - if you have already tried a transformation, do not repeat it.\n\n**IMPORTANT: Your transformation must always produce a 30\u00d730 output grid.**\n\nThe test input is shown for context so you understand what type of grid your program will eventually process. Focus on learning patterns from training examples and writing code that captures your understanding.\n\nTraining Examples:\n\nExample 1:\nInput:\n3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3

rotations, reflections, etc.\n- Even if you can't solve all training examples perfectly, implement what patterns you do observe\n- A partial solution that captures some aspects is better than returning the input unchanged\n- If the pattern is unclear, make your best educated guess based on what you can see\n\nRequirements:\n- The function takes a 2D list (grid) where grid[row][col] gives the value at that position\n- Values are integers from 0-9\n- Return a new grid (2D list) with the transformation applied\n- You can use numpy if needed - just add 'import numpy as np' at the start of your function\n- Aim to handle the training examples as well as possible, even if not perfectly\n- Your function should attempt some meaningful transformation based on the patterns you observe\n\nYou MUST end your response with the following exact format:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Your transformation logic here (implement your best understanding)\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"

          "Let's analyze the transformation from the training examples:\n\n### Observations\n\n**General:**\n- All grids are 30x30, both input and output.\n- The input has certain \"border\" stripes (solid green: color 3).\n- In the \"main\" black region (0), there are colored blocks (mainly 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).\n- The shapes in the input are variously colored squares, rectangles, or inner structures.\n\n#### What changes between input and output:\n\n##### Example 1\n- In the lower (black) area:\n    - Every colored square is replaced with a specific pattern: a smaller square of another color is inserted \"inside\" larger squares, or a more complicated pattern appears.\n    - The colored regions seem to \"inherit\" the structure or mini-pattern from similar-colored blocks at the border, or from \"template\" patterns visible in the border amoung blocks of the same color.\n- The green border doesn't change.\n\n##### Example 2\n- The transformation is similar: each colored rectangle or square in the black area is \"decorated\" or replaced with an inner mini-pattern that matches/repeats the relevant border's block pattern.\n    - E.g., a yellow block on the left border is a 5x5 'square with a smaller blue 3x3 square inside', and so every large yellow square in the black area is replaced with that same nested pattern.\n    - Other colors (blue, red, etc.) are treated the same way.\n\n##### Example 3\n- This one confirms the pattern: for each color present, the relevant \"template\" comes from that color's region on the border, and is used to fill every occurence of that color in the main region, regardless of size.\n\n---\n\n### Hypothesis\n\n#### Transformation Rule (summary):\n\n1. **For each connected colored region (not black, not green border) appearing in the main region:**\n   - **Find the template** for that color on the border (usually the first region of that color on the border, and its exact pattern).\n   - **Replace each region in the main area** with the template, scaling (or not scaling) as needed for the region size, but preserving the template's \"inner\" structure.\n\n   It is as if every block's style in the main area is replaced by the template shape from the border for the same color, pasted over the old location.\n\n    - Borders are not changed.\n\n#### Implementation Approach\n\n- For each color in the grid, extract all the border patterns for that color.\n- For each region of that color in the main area, replace it with the template pattern for that color, aligned at the same top-left.\n- If the region is bigger than the template, tile the template or pad with background color (usually black).\n\n---\n\n### Steps\n\n1. **Identify the border regions** and extract templates for each color.\n2. **Find all connected components in the main area** (colors != 0 and != 3).\n3. **For each such region, paste the template from border at its location**.\n\nLet\u2019s write the code for this approach:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    from scipy.ndimage import label, find_objects\n\n    grid = np.array(grid)\n    h, w = grid.shape\n    assert h == 30 and w == 30\n\n    # 1.
