          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by looking at Example 1. The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 15x15 grid. So the transformation seems to expand the input into a larger grid. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n0 5 0\n5 5 5\n0 5 0\n\nThe output has a lot of 5s in certain positions. Let me try to see how the input elements are placed in the output. For instance, the first row of the input is 0 5 0. In the output, the first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5 in the input's first row, second column is placed in the 8th position of the output's first row. Hmm, maybe there's some expansion around the 5s?\n\nWait, the output is 15x15. The input is 3x3. Maybe the input is being expanded into a larger grid by some pattern. Let me think about how the input elements are replicated or expanded. \n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, there's a central 3x3 block of 5s. Wait, the output's middle rows have 5s in the middle. Let me check. The output's middle rows (like the 7th row) have 5s in the middle. Maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross shape or something similar. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is being used to determine the positions of 5s in the output. For example, each 5 in the input might be expanded into a cross shape in the output. Let's think about the input's 5s. \n\nIn Example 1's input, the middle row is all 5s. So in the output, there's a block of 5s in the middle. The output's middle part has a vertical line of 5s. Also, the output has some horizontal lines. \n\nAnother thing to note: the output for Example 1 has 5s in the middle columns. For example, the first row of output has a 5 in the 8th position (index 7 if zero-based). The second row has 5s starting from position 6 (index 6?), and so on. \n\nWait, maybe the input is being used to determine the positions of 5s in the output. For instance, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross shape. Let me think: if the input has a 5 in position (i,j), then in the output, there's a cross centered around that position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a pattern that's being replicated in the output. For example, the input's 5s are being expanded into a larger grid where each 5 is surrounded by 5s in a certain way. \n\nLooking at Example 3's input:\n5 0 0\n0 5 0\n0 0 5\n\nThe output for Example 3 has 5s in the first column, middle column, and third column. Wait, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5 is in the 4th position. Then, in the next rows, there's a vertical line of 5s in the middle. \n\nWait, maybe the input is being used to determine the positions of 5s in the output. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross shape that's centered around that position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a cross shape that spans a certain number of rows and columns. For example, a 5 in the input might generate a cross that's 3x3 in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where the 5s are placed in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid in a way that forms a cross. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input, the middle row is all 5s. The output has a vertical line of 5s in the middle columns. For example, the output's middle rows (rows 6-8) have 5s in columns 6-8. Wait, maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a vertical and horizontal line in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a 3x3 block in the output. For example, a 5 in the input's (i,j) position is replaced by a 3x3 block of 5s in the output. But that would not fit the example. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the middle row is all 5s. The output's middle rows (rows 6-8) have 5s in columns 6-8. But that's not a 3x3 block. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a pattern that's being mirrored or expanded in certain ways. For example, the input's 5s are being used to create a cross in the output. Let's think about the output for Example 1. The output has a vertical line of 5s in the middle columns (columns 6-8?), and horizontal lines in the middle rows. \n\nWait, looking at the output for Example 1, the first row has a 5 in the 8th position. Then, the second row has 5s starting from position 6. The third row has 5s starting from position 6. Then, rows 4-6 have 5s in positions 6-8. Then, row 7 has 5s in positions 6-8. Row 8 has 5s in positions 6-8. Then, row 9 has 5s in positions 6-8. Then, row 10 has 5s in positions 6-8. Then, row 11 has 5s in positions 6-8. Then, row 12 has 5s in position 6. Row 13 has 5s in position 6. Row 14 has 5s in position 6. \n\nWait, that seems like the 5s are forming a vertical line in the middle columns (positions 6-8?), but also a horizontal line in the middle rows. Maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross shape that's centered around them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a cross shape that spans a certain number of positions. For example, each 5 in the input is replaced by a cross that is 3x3 in the output. \n\nBut how does that fit with the examples? Let's take Example 1's input. The input has a 5 in the middle of the first row. In the output, that 5 is placed in the 8th position of the first row. So maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that's centered at a certain position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and expanding them into a cross that is centered at the same position. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid in a way that forms a cross. \n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is a grid where the 5s are placed in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, for each 5 in the input, the output has a cross shape around that position. \n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the input's positions. For example, in Example 1's input, the middle row is all 5s. In the output, that's represented by a vertical line of 5s in the middle columns. So maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a vertical line in the output. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a larger grid where each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid in a way that forms a cross. \n\nAnother thought: the output is 15x15. The input is 3x3. So maybe the input is being scaled up by a factor of 5. But that's not possible because 3x5 is 15. But how? \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding each cell in the input into a 5x5 block. But that would make the output 15x15 (since 3x5=15). But that would require each cell in the input to be expanded into a 5x5 block. However, in the examples, the output seems to have 5s in certain positions, not filled blocks. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is being used to determine the positions of 5s in the output. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid in a way that forms a cross. \n\nLooking at Example 3's input, which is a diagonal of 5s. The output for Example 3 has 5s in the first column, middle column, and third column. Wait, the output's first row has a 5 in the 4th position. Then, the second row has a 5 in the 5th position. The third row has a 5 in the 6th position. Then, the fourth row has a 5 in the 4th position. Hmm, that seems like the 5s are arranged in a cross shape. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at their position. For example, a 5 in the input's (i,j) position is expanded into a cross in the output's grid that is centered at (i*5, j*5). But that's just a hypothesis. \n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the middle row is all 5s. So if each input cell is expanded into a 5x5 block, then the middle row's 5s would form a horizontal line in the output. But the output seems to have a vertical line in the middle. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's 5s are placed in the output's grid in such a way that they form a cross. For example, the input's 5s are placed in positions that are mirrored in the output. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 5s are in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the 5s are in the middle columns (columns 6-8) and middle rows (rows 6-8). \n\nWait, the output for Example 1 has 5s in positions that form a vertical line in the middle columns and horizontal lines in the middle rows. So perhaps the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross shape. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and expanding them into a 3x3 cross in the output. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid at positions that form a cross. \n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the coordinates. For example, if the input's cell (i,j) is a 5, then in the output, it's expanded into a cross centered at (i*5, j*5). But that's just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that spans certain positions. For example, a 5 in the input's (i,j) is represented in the output as a cross that spans from (i*5 - 2) to (i*5 + 2) in rows and columns. \n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract. Let's think about the test input. The test input is:\n\n0 5 0\n0 5 0\n5 0 5\n\nSo the input is a 3x3 grid. The output should be 15x15. \n\nIf the pattern is that each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross in the output, then the test input's 5s would be in positions (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). \n\nSo in the output, these positions would be expanded into crosses. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has 5s in positions that form a cross. For example, in Example 1, the output has a vertical line in the middle columns (columns 6-8) and horizontal lines in the middle rows (rows 6-8). \n\nSo maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and placing them in the output's grid in positions that are determined by the input's coordinates. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid at positions that are multiples of 5. \n\nBut how? Let's think of the input as a 3x3 grid. The output is 15x15. So each input cell is mapped to a 5x5 block in the output. But that would make the output 15x15 (since 3*5=15). \n\nBut in that case, the output would have 5s in all positions of the 5x5 blocks where the input has 5s. \n\nBut looking at Example 1's input, the first row is 0 5 0. So the input's (0,1) is 5. In the output, that would correspond to a 5x5 block starting at (0*5, 1*5) = (0,5). But the output's first row has a 5 in position 7 (index 7), which is 5+2. So maybe the 5 is placed in the center of the 5x5 block. \n\nWait, if each input cell is expanded into a 5x5 block, then the center of that block would be at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). For example, for input (0,1), the center is (2, 6). But in the output's first row, the 5 is at position 7 (index 7). That would be (row 0, column 7). So that doesn't match. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is placed in the middle of the 5x5 block. So the block starts at (i*5, j*5), and the center is (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). So for input (0,1), the center is (2, 6). But in the output's first row, the 5 is at position 7 (column 7). That's not matching. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think of the output for Example 1. The first row of the output has a 5 at position 7 (0-based index 7). The second row has 5s starting at position 6 (index 6). The third row has 5s starting at position 6. Then rows 4-6 have 5s in positions 6-8. \n\nThis seems to form a vertical line of 5s in the middle columns (columns 6-8). So maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a vertical line in the output. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross shape that is centered at certain positions. \n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has 5s in positions that form a cross. For example, in Example 1, the middle columns and middle rows have 5s. \n\nSo maybe the input's 5s are being used to determine the positions of 5s in the output. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid in a way that forms a cross. \n\nBut how? Let's think of the input's 5s as being in positions that are then expanded into a cross. For example, if the input has a 5 at (i,j), then in the output, there's a cross centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). \n\nBut how does that fit with the examples? \n\nIn Example 1's input, the middle row (i=1) is all 5s. So for each j in 0,1,2, the input has a 5. So in the output, each of these would be expanded into a cross centered at (1*5 + 2, j*5 + 2) = (7, j*5 + 2). \n\nSo for j=0, the center is (7, 2). For j=1, (7, 7). For j=2, (7, 12). But the output's middle rows have 5s in columns 6-8. So that might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's 5s are expanded into a cross that spans from (i*5, j*5) to (i*5 + 4, j*5 + 4). But that would be a 5x5 block. \n\nBut then, the output's first row (row 0) would have 5s in positions 0*5 to 0*5+4 = 0-4. But in the output, the first row has a 5 at position 7, which is not in that range. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the output as being generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), and the cross has a certain pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a cross that spans a certain number of rows and columns. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid such that it forms a vertical and horizontal line. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid where the 5s are placed in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, if the input has a 5 at (i,j), then in the output, the 5 is placed in positions (i*5 + k, j*5 + l) where k and l are such that they form a cross. \n\nBut without seeing the exact pattern, this is hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that is centered at (i*5, j*5). \n\nBut again, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 3, where the input is a diagonal of 5s. The output has 5s in the middle columns and rows. \n\nMaybe the pattern is that the output is a grid where the 5s are placed in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid in a way that forms a cross. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and placing them in the output's grid in positions that are mirrored. For example, the input's 5s are placed in the output's grid in positions that are mirrored around the center. \n\nBut again, not sure. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output has 5s. For example, in Example 1's output, the 5s are in the middle columns and rows. So maybe the output is a grid where the 5s are placed in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that spans a certain number of positions. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid such that it forms a cross that is 3x3 in the output. \n\nBut how to determine the exact positions? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and expanding them into a cross that is centered at (i*5, j*5). \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nLet me think about the test input. The test input is:\n\n0 5 0\n0 5 0\n5 0 5\n\nSo the input has 5s at (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). \n\nIf the output is generated by expanding each 5 into a cross centered at (i*5, j*5), then for (0,1), the center would be (0*5, 1*5) = (0,5). But in the output, the first row has a 5 at position 7 (index 7), which is not 5. \n\nAlternatively, if the center is (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), then for (0,1), the center is (2,7). So in the output's row 2, column 7 would be a 5. \n\nBut the output for the test input is not known, but according to the pattern, the output should be 15x15. \n\nBut without seeing the test output, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). For example, in the output, the 5s are placed in a cross shape around that center. \n\nFor example, if the input has a 5 at (i,j), then in the output, the cross is formed by positions (i*5 + 2 - k, j*5 + 2 + l) for certain k and l. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a 3x3 cross in the output. For example, each 5 in the input is replaced by a cross in the output. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by placing 5s in the output's grid in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, for each 5 in the input at (i,j), the output has 5s in positions (i*5 + k, j*5 + l) where k and l are such that they form a cross. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nMaybe the pattern is that the output is a grid where the 5s are placed in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that spans from (i*5, j*5) to (i*5 + 4, j*5 + 4), but only the center of that block is a 5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), and the cross has 5s in all positions that are within a certain distance from the center. \n\nFor example, the cross could be a vertical line and a horizontal line that extend from the center. \n\nBut again, without seeing the exact pattern, this is hard. \n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has a vertical line of 5s in the middle columns (columns 6-8) and horizontal lines in the middle rows (rows 6-8). This suggests that the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at the middle of the output grid. \n\nBut how? \n\nMaybe the input is a pattern that is being expanded into a cross that is centered at the middle of the output. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that is centered at the same position as the input's 5s. \n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. \n\nLooking at the output for Example 3, the input is a diagonal of 5s. The output has 5s in the first column, middle column, and third column. Wait, the output's first row has a 5 in column 3 (index 3). Then, the second row has a 5 in column 4. The third row has a 5 in column 5. The fourth row has a 5 in column 3. The fifth row has a 5 in column 4. The sixth row has a 5 in column 5. And so on. This seems like a diagonal pattern. \n\nBut this is confusing. \n\nMaybe the pattern is that the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that has 5s in positions (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2 \u00b1 1), (i*5 + 2 \u00b1 1, j*5 + 2), etc. \n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), and the cross has a certain pattern. \n\nFor example, the cross could be a vertical line of 5s from (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2 - 2) to (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2 + 2), and a horizontal line from (i*5 + 2 - 2, j*5 + 2) to (i*5 + 2 + 2, j*5 + 2). \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nLet me try to code this. For each cell in the input grid, if it's a 5, then in the output grid, we place 5s in the positions that form a cross around (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). \n\nBut how to determine the exact positions? \n\nFor example, for a 5 in the input's (i,j), the cross would be:\n\n- Vertical line: rows from i*5 + 2 - 2 to i*5 + 2 + 2, column j*5 + 2.\n- Horizontal line: columns from j*5 + 2 - 2 to j*5 + 2 + 2, row i*5 + 2.\n\nBut this would create a cross that is 5 rows and 5 columns long. \n\nBut in the output, the 5s would be placed in these positions. \n\nLet's test this with Example 1. \n\nIn Example 1's input, the middle row is all 5s. So for each j in 0,1,2, the input has a 5 at (1, j). \n\nFor each of these, the center is (1*5 + 2, j*5 + 2) = (7, j*5 + 2). \n\nFor j=0: center is (7, 2). The vertical line would be from 7-2=5 to 7+2=9, column 2. So rows 5-9, column 2. \n\nFor j=1: center is (7, 7). Vertical line from 5-9, column 7. \n\nFor j=2: center is (7, 12). Vertical line from 5-9, column 12. \n\nBut in the output for Example 1, the middle columns (columns 6-8) have 5s. This doesn't match. \n\nHmm, this approach might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is centered at (i*5, j*5), and extends 2 units in all directions. \n\nFor example, for a 5 in (i,j), the cross would be:\n\n- Vertical line from i*5 - 2 to i*5 + 2, column j*5.\n- Horizontal line from j*5 - 2 to j*5 + 2, row i*5.\n\nBut again, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a cross that is centered at (i*5, j*5), and the cross has 5s in positions that are in the same row and column. \n\nBut this is too vague. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the 5s seem to be in a cross shape that is centered at the middle of the output grid. For example, the middle of the output is around row 7, column 7. \n\nIn the input, the middle row is all 5s. So maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at the middle of the output grid. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and placing them in the output's grid in positions that form a cross around the center of the output. \n\nFor example, the input's 5s are used to determine the positions of the cross. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is difficult. \n\nMaybe the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that is centered at the same position as the input's 5s. \n\nBut I'm not making progress. \n\nPerhaps I should think about the output as being generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that spans a certain number of rows and columns. For example, each 5 in the input is replaced by a cross that is 3x3 in the output. \n\nBut how to determine the exact positions? \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), and the cross has 5s in all positions that are in the same row or column as the center. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), and the cross has 5s in the same row and column. \n\nSo for each 5 in the input, we would place 5s in the output grid in the same row and column as the center, but within a certain range. \n\nLet me try to code this. \n\nThe function would take the input grid, and for each cell (i,j) in the input, if it's a 5, then in the output grid, we would set 5s in the positions (i*5 + 2 - k, j*5 + 2) for k in -2 to +2, and (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2 + l) for l in -2 to +2. \n\nBut this would create a cross of 5s around the center. \n\nHowever, this might not fit the examples, but it's a possible approach. \n\nLet's test this with Example 1. \n\nIn Example 1, the input's middle row is all 5s. So for each j in 0,1,2, the input has a 5 at (1, j). \n\nThe center for each would be (1*5 + 2, j*5 + 2) = (7, j*5 + 2). \n\nFor j=0, the center is (7, 2). The cross would include positions (7-2, 2) to (7+2, 2) = rows 5-9, column 2. And for the horizontal line, columns 2-2 \u00b1 2, row 7. So columns 0-4, row 7. \n\nBut in the output, the first row has a 5 at position 7 (column 7), which is not part of this. \n\nThis suggests that this approach is not correct. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another pattern. \n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the 5s seem to form a vertical line in the middle columns and a horizontal line in the middle rows. This suggests that the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at the middle of the output grid. \n\nFor example, the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at (7,7) in the output. \n\nBut how to determine this? \n\nMaybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at (7,7), and the input's 5s determine the size of the cross. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), and the cross has a certain pattern. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nMaybe the output is generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a 3x3 cross in the output, centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). \n\nSo, for each 5 in the input at (i,j), in the output, we set the following positions to 5:\n\n- All positions in the same row as the center, from column j*5 + 2 - 2 to j*5 + 2 + 2.\n- All positions in the same column as the center, from row i*5 + 2 - 2 to i*5 + 2 + 2.\n\nThis would create a cross of 5s around the center. \n\nLet's see if this fits with the examples. \n\nFor Example 1's input, the middle row is all 5s. So for each j in 0,1,2, the input has a 5 at (1,j). \n\nThe center for each would be (1*5 + 2, j*5 + 2) = (7, j*5 + 2). \n\nFor j=0, center is (7, 2). The cross would include:\n\n- Row 7, columns 0-4 (since j*5 + 2 - 2 = 2-2=0, j*5 + 2 + 2 = 2+2=4).\n- Column 2, rows 5-9 (i*5 + 2 - 2 = 7-2=5, i*5 + 2 + 2=7+2=9).\n\nThis would create a horizontal line in row 7, columns 0-4, and a vertical line in column 2, rows 5-9. \n\nBut in the output, the first row has a 5 at position 7 (column 7), which is not part of this. \n\nThis suggests that this approach is not correct. \n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. \n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has 5s in positions that form a cross in the middle of the output grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has a vertical line in the middle columns and a horizontal line in the middle rows. This suggests that the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at the middle of the output grid. \n\nSo, the input's 5s are being used to determine the positions of the cross in the output. \n\nBut how? \n\nMaybe the input's 5s are being used to determine the size of the cross. For example, if the input has a 5 in the middle, then the cross is larger. \n\nAlternatively, the input's 5s are being used to determine the positions of the cross. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). \n\nBut without seeing the exact pattern, I'll proceed with this hypothesis. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\n- Initialize a 15x15 grid with 0s.\n- For each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n   - If the cell is 5:\n      - For k in -2 to +2:\n         - For l in -2 to +2:\n            - if k == 0 or l == 0:\n               - set the output at (i*5 + k, j*5 + l) to 5.\n- But this would create a 5x5 square of 5s for each input 5, which may not fit the examples. \n\nBut in Example 1's input, the middle row is all 5s. So for each j, the input has a 5 at (1,j). \n\nFor each such cell, the code would set 5s in a 5x5 square around (1*5 + k, j*5 + l). \n\nBut this would create a 5x5 square for each input 5, leading to overlapping squares. \n\nBut in the output for Example 1, there is a vertical line of 5s in the middle columns. This suggests that this approach may not be correct. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the code that expands each input 5 into a cross centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), and the cross includes the same row and column. \n\nHere's the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Center of the cross\n                center_row = i * 5 + 2\n                center_col = j * 5 + 2\n                # Vertical line\n                for k in range(-2, 3):\n                    output[center_row + k][center_col] = 5\n                # Horizontal line\n                for l in range(-2, 3):\n                    output[center_row][center_col + l] = 5\n    return output\n\nBut this would create a cross of 5s around each input 5. \n\nTesting this with Example 1's input:\n\nInput is:\n0 5 0\n5 5 5\n0 5 0\n\nFor i=0, j=1: center_row = 0*5 + 2 = 2, center_col = 1*5 + 2 = 7. \n\nVertical line: rows 2-2+4= 0 to 4? Wait, k ranges from -2 to +2, so center_row + k would be 2-2=0, 2-1=1, 2, 2+1=3, 2+2=4. So rows 0-4, column 7. \n\nHorizontal line: columns 7-2=5 to 7+2=9, row 2. \n\nSo in the output, row 2, columns 5-9 would have 5s. \n\nThis would create a horizontal line in row 2, columns 5-9. \n\nSimilarly, for the input's middle row (i=1, j=0,1,2), their centers would be (1*5 + 2=7, j*5 + 2). For j=0, center is (7, 2). Vertical line: rows 5-9, column 2. Horizontal line: columns 0-4, row 7. \n\nSo this would create a vertical line in column 2, rows 5-9, and a horizontal line in row 7, columns 0-4. \n\nThis would create a cross in the middle of the output. \n\nThis might fit with the examples. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nIn Example 1's output, the first row has a 5 at position 7 (column 7). According to this code, for the input's (0,1) cell, the horizontal line would include column 7 in row 2. So the first row (row 0) would not have a 5 from this. \n\nBut in the output, the first row has a 5 at column 7. So this suggests that this code is not correct. \n\nBut perhaps the code is correct, and the output for Example 1 has a 5 in row 0, column 7 from another input cell. \n\nWait, in the input, the first row is 0 5 0. So for i=0, j=1, the code would set a horizontal line in row 2, columns 5-9. But in the output's first row, column 7 is 5. How does that happen? \n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision based on the examples and the patterns I can see. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the code that expands each 5 in the input into a cross centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), and the cross is a vertical and horizontal line of 5s. This is my best guess based on the examples.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let's start by looking at Example 1. The input is a 3x3 grid, and the output is a 15x15 grid. So the transformation seems to expand the input into a larger grid. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n0 5 0\n5 5 5\n0 5 0\n\nThe output has a lot of 5s in certain positions. Let me try to see how the input elements are placed in the output. For instance, the first row of the input is 0 5 0. In the output, the first row is 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5 in the input's first row, second column is placed in the 8th position of the output's first row. Hmm, maybe there's some expansion around the 5s?\n\nWait, the output is 15x15. The input is 3x3. Maybe the input is being expanded into a larger grid by some pattern. Let me think about how the input elements are replicated or expanded. \n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, there's a central 3x3 block of 5s. Wait, the output's middle rows have 5s in the middle. Let me check. The output's middle rows (like the 7th row) have 5s in the middle. Maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross shape or something similar. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is being used to determine the positions of 5s in the output. For example, each 5 in the input might be expanded into a cross shape in the output. Let's think about the input's 5s. \n\nIn Example 1's input, the middle row is all 5s. So in the output, there's a block of 5s in the middle. The output's middle part has a vertical line of 5s. Also, the output has some horizontal lines. \n\nAnother thing to note: the output for Example 1 has 5s in the middle columns. For example, the first row of output has a 5 in the 8th position (index 7 if zero-based). The second row has 5s starting from position 6 (index 6?), and so on. \n\nWait, maybe the input is being used to determine the positions of 5s in the output. For instance, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross shape. Let me think: if the input has a 5 in position (i,j), then in the output, there's a cross centered around that position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a pattern that's being replicated in the output. For example, the input's 5s are being expanded into a larger grid where each 5 is surrounded by 5s in a certain way. \n\nLooking at Example 3's input:\n5 0 0\n0 5 0\n0 0 5\n\nThe output for Example 3 has 5s in the first column, middle column, and third column. Wait, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 5 is in the 4th position. Then, in the next rows, there's a vertical line of 5s in the middle. \n\nWait, maybe the input is being used to determine the positions of 5s in the output. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross shape that's centered around that position. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a cross shape that spans a certain number of rows and columns. For example, a 5 in the input might generate a cross that's 3x3 in the output. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where the 5s are placed in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid in a way that forms a cross. \n\nLooking at Example 1's input, the middle row is all 5s. The output has a vertical line of 5s in the middle columns. For example, the output's middle rows (rows 6-8) have 5s in columns 6-8. Wait, maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a vertical and horizontal line in the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a 3x3 block in the output. For example, a 5 in the input's (i,j) position is replaced by a 3x3 block of 5s in the output. But that would not fit the example. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1's input, the middle row is all 5s. The output's middle rows (rows 6-8) have 5s in columns 6-8. But that's not a 3x3 block. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is a pattern that's being mirrored or expanded in certain ways. For example, the input's 5s are being used to create a cross in the output. Let's think about the output for Example 1. The output has a vertical line of 5s in the middle columns (columns 6-8?), and horizontal lines in the middle rows. \n\nWait, looking at the output for Example 1, the first row has a 5 in the 8th position. Then, the second row has 5s starting from position 6. The third row has 5s starting from position 6. Then, rows 4-6 have 5s in positions 6-8. Then, row 7 has 5s in positions 6-8. Row 8 has 5s in positions 6-8. Then, row 9 has 5s in positions 6-8. Then, row 10 has 5s in positions 6-8. Then, row 11 has 5s in positions 6-8. Then, row 12 has 5s in position 6. Row 13 has 5s in position 6. Row 14 has 5s in position 6. \n\nWait, that seems like the 5s are forming a vertical line in the middle columns (positions 6-8?), but also a horizontal line in the middle rows. Maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross shape that's centered around them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a cross shape that spans a certain number of positions. For example, each 5 in the input is replaced by a cross that is 3x3 in the output. \n\nBut how does that fit with the examples? Let's take Example 1's input. The input has a 5 in the middle of the first row. In the output, that 5 is placed in the 8th position of the first row. So maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that's centered at a certain position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and expanding them into a cross that is centered at the same position. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid in a way that forms a cross. \n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is a grid where the 5s are placed in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, for each 5 in the input, the output has a cross shape around that position. \n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the input's positions. For example, in Example 1's input, the middle row is all 5s. In the output, that's represented by a vertical line of 5s in the middle columns. So maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a vertical line in the output. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a larger grid where each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid in a way that forms a cross. \n\nAnother thought: the output is 15x15. The input is 3x3. So maybe the input is being scaled up by a factor of 5. But that's not possible because 3x5 is 15. But how? \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding each cell in the input into a 5x5 block. But that would make the output 15x15 (since 3x5=15). But that would require each cell in the input to be expanded into a 5x5 block. However, in the examples, the output seems to have 5s in certain positions, not filled blocks. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the input is being used to determine the positions of 5s in the output. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid in a way that forms a cross. \n\nLooking at Example 3's input, which is a diagonal of 5s. The output for Example 3 has 5s in the first column, middle column, and third column. Wait, the output's first row has a 5 in the 4th position. Then, the second row has a 5 in the 5th position. The third row has a 5 in the 6th position. Then, the fourth row has a 5 in the 4th position. Hmm, that seems like the 5s are arranged in a cross shape. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at their position. For example, a 5 in the input's (i,j) position is expanded into a cross in the output's grid that is centered at (i*5, j*5). But that's just a hypothesis. \n\nWait, in Example 1's input, the middle row is all 5s. So if each input cell is expanded into a 5x5 block, then the middle row's 5s would form a horizontal line in the output. But the output seems to have a vertical line in the middle. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's 5s are placed in the output's grid in such a way that they form a cross. For example, the input's 5s are placed in positions that are mirrored in the output. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 5s are in the output. For example, in Example 1's output, the 5s are in the middle columns (columns 6-8) and middle rows (rows 6-8). \n\nWait, the output for Example 1 has 5s in positions that form a vertical line in the middle columns and horizontal lines in the middle rows. So perhaps the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross shape. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and expanding them into a 3x3 cross in the output. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid at positions that form a cross. \n\nBut how to model this? Let's think about the coordinates. For example, if the input's cell (i,j) is a 5, then in the output, it's expanded into a cross centered at (i*5, j*5). But that's just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that spans certain positions. For example, a 5 in the input's (i,j) is represented in the output as a cross that spans from (i*5 - 2) to (i*5 + 2) in rows and columns. \n\nBut this is getting a bit abstract. Let's think about the test input. The test input is:\n\n0 5 0\n0 5 0\n5 0 5\n\nSo the input is a 3x3 grid. The output should be 15x15. \n\nIf the pattern is that each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross in the output, then the test input's 5s would be in positions (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). \n\nSo in the output, these positions would be expanded into crosses. \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has 5s in positions that form a cross. For example, in Example 1, the output has a vertical line in the middle columns (columns 6-8) and horizontal lines in the middle rows (rows 6-8). \n\nSo maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at certain positions. \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and placing them in the output's grid in positions that are determined by the input's coordinates. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid at positions that are multiples of 5. \n\nBut how? Let's think of the input as a 3x3 grid. The output is 15x15. So each input cell is mapped to a 5x5 block in the output. But that would make the output 15x15 (since 3*5=15). \n\nBut in that case, the output would have 5s in all positions of the 5x5 blocks where the input has 5s. \n\nBut looking at Example 1's input, the first row is 0 5 0. So the input's (0,1) is 5. In the output, that would correspond to a 5x5 block starting at (0*5, 1*5) = (0,5). But the output's first row has a 5 in position 7 (index 7), which is 5+2. So maybe the 5 is placed in the center of the 5x5 block. \n\nWait, if each input cell is expanded into a 5x5 block, then the center of that block would be at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). For example, for input (0,1), the center is (2, 6). But in the output's first row, the 5 is at position 7 (index 7). That would be (row 0, column 7). So that doesn't match. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 5 is placed in the middle of the 5x5 block. So the block starts at (i*5, j*5), and the center is (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). So for input (0,1), the center is (2, 6). But in the output's first row, the 5 is at position 7 (column 7). That's not matching. \n\nHmm, this is confusing. Let me think of the output for Example 1. The first row of the output has a 5 at position 7 (0-based index 7). The second row has 5s starting at position 6 (index 6). The third row has 5s starting at position 6. Then rows 4-6 have 5s in positions 6-8. \n\nThis seems to form a vertical line of 5s in the middle columns (columns 6-8). So maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a vertical line in the output. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross shape that is centered at certain positions. \n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has 5s in positions that form a cross. For example, in Example 1, the middle columns and middle rows have 5s. \n\nSo maybe the input's 5s are being used to determine the positions of 5s in the output. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid in a way that forms a cross. \n\nBut how? Let's think of the input's 5s as being in positions that are then expanded into a cross. For example, if the input has a 5 at (i,j), then in the output, there's a cross centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). \n\nBut how does that fit with the examples? \n\nIn Example 1's input, the middle row (i=1) is all 5s. So for each j in 0,1,2, the input has a 5. So in the output, each of these would be expanded into a cross centered at (1*5 + 2, j*5 + 2) = (7, j*5 + 2). \n\nSo for j=0, the center is (7, 2). For j=1, (7, 7). For j=2, (7, 12). But the output's middle rows have 5s in columns 6-8. So that might not fit. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the input's 5s are expanded into a cross that spans from (i*5, j*5) to (i*5 + 4, j*5 + 4). But that would be a 5x5 block. \n\nBut then, the output's first row (row 0) would have 5s in positions 0*5 to 0*5+4 = 0-4. But in the output, the first row has a 5 at position 7, which is not in that range. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think of the output as being generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), and the cross has a certain pattern. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a cross that spans a certain number of rows and columns. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid such that it forms a vertical and horizontal line. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nAnother idea: the output is a grid where the 5s are placed in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, if the input has a 5 at (i,j), then in the output, the 5 is placed in positions (i*5 + k, j*5 + l) where k and l are such that they form a cross. \n\nBut without seeing the exact pattern, this is hard. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that is centered at (i*5, j*5). \n\nBut again, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for Example 3, where the input is a diagonal of 5s. The output has 5s in the middle columns and rows. \n\nMaybe the pattern is that the output is a grid where the 5s are placed in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid in a way that forms a cross. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and placing them in the output's grid in positions that are mirrored. For example, the input's 5s are placed in the output's grid in positions that are mirrored around the center. \n\nBut again, not sure. \n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the output has 5s. For example, in Example 1's output, the 5s are in the middle columns and rows. So maybe the output is a grid where the 5s are placed in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that spans a certain number of positions. For example, each 5 in the input is placed in the output's grid such that it forms a cross that is 3x3 in the output. \n\nBut how to determine the exact positions? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and expanding them into a cross that is centered at (i*5, j*5). \n\nBut how to model this? \n\nLet me think about the test input. The test input is:\n\n0 5 0\n0 5 0\n5 0 5\n\nSo the input has 5s at (0,1), (1,1), (2,0), (2,2). \n\nIf the output is generated by expanding each 5 into a cross centered at (i*5, j*5), then for (0,1), the center would be (0*5, 1*5) = (0,5). But in the output, the first row has a 5 at position 7 (index 7), which is not 5. \n\nAlternatively, if the center is (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), then for (0,1), the center is (2,7). So in the output's row 2, column 7 would be a 5. \n\nBut the output for the test input is not known, but according to the pattern, the output should be 15x15. \n\nBut without seeing the test output, I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). For example, in the output, the 5s are placed in a cross shape around that center. \n\nFor example, if the input has a 5 at (i,j), then in the output, the cross is formed by positions (i*5 + 2 - k, j*5 + 2 + l) for certain k and l. \n\nBut this is getting too vague. \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a 3x3 cross in the output. For example, each 5 in the input is replaced by a cross in the output. \n\nBut how? \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by placing 5s in the output's grid in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, for each 5 in the input at (i,j), the output has 5s in positions (i*5 + k, j*5 + l) where k and l are such that they form a cross. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nMaybe the pattern is that the output is a grid where the 5s are placed in positions that are determined by the input's 5s. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that spans from (i*5, j*5) to (i*5 + 4, j*5 + 4), but only the center of that block is a 5. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), and the cross has 5s in all positions that are within a certain distance from the center. \n\nFor example, the cross could be a vertical line and a horizontal line that extend from the center. \n\nBut again, without seeing the exact pattern, this is hard. \n\nAnother observation: in Example 1, the output has a vertical line of 5s in the middle columns (columns 6-8) and horizontal lines in the middle rows (rows 6-8). This suggests that the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at the middle of the output grid. \n\nBut how? \n\nMaybe the input is a pattern that is being expanded into a cross that is centered at the middle of the output. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that is centered at the same position as the input's 5s. \n\nBut I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for a different pattern. \n\nLooking at the output for Example 3, the input is a diagonal of 5s. The output has 5s in the first column, middle column, and third column. Wait, the output's first row has a 5 in column 3 (index 3). Then, the second row has a 5 in column 4. The third row has a 5 in column 5. The fourth row has a 5 in column 3. The fifth row has a 5 in column 4. The sixth row has a 5 in column 5. And so on. This seems like a diagonal pattern. \n\nBut this is confusing. \n\nMaybe the pattern is that the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that has 5s in positions (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2 \u00b1 1), (i*5 + 2 \u00b1 1, j*5 + 2), etc. \n\nBut this is just a hypothesis. \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), and the cross has a certain pattern. \n\nFor example, the cross could be a vertical line of 5s from (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2 - 2) to (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2 + 2), and a horizontal line from (i*5 + 2 - 2, j*5 + 2) to (i*5 + 2 + 2, j*5 + 2). \n\nBut how to implement this? \n\nLet me try to code this. For each cell in the input grid, if it's a 5, then in the output grid, we place 5s in the positions that form a cross around (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). \n\nBut how to determine the exact positions? \n\nFor example, for a 5 in the input's (i,j), the cross would be:\n\n- Vertical line: rows from i*5 + 2 - 2 to i*5 + 2 + 2, column j*5 + 2.\n- Horizontal line: columns from j*5 + 2 - 2 to j*5 + 2 + 2, row i*5 + 2.\n\nBut this would create a cross that is 5 rows and 5 columns long. \n\nBut in the output, the 5s would be placed in these positions. \n\nLet's test this with Example 1. \n\nIn Example 1's input, the middle row is all 5s. So for each j in 0,1,2, the input has a 5 at (1, j). \n\nFor each of these, the center is (1*5 + 2, j*5 + 2) = (7, j*5 + 2). \n\nFor j=0: center is (7, 2). The vertical line would be from 7-2=5 to 7+2=9, column 2. So rows 5-9, column 2. \n\nFor j=1: center is (7, 7). Vertical line from 5-9, column 7. \n\nFor j=2: center is (7, 12). Vertical line from 5-9, column 12. \n\nBut in the output for Example 1, the middle columns (columns 6-8) have 5s. This doesn't match. \n\nHmm, this approach might not be correct. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the cross is centered at (i*5, j*5), and extends 2 units in all directions. \n\nFor example, for a 5 in (i,j), the cross would be:\n\n- Vertical line from i*5 - 2 to i*5 + 2, column j*5.\n- Horizontal line from j*5 - 2 to j*5 + 2, row i*5.\n\nBut again, not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a cross that is centered at (i*5, j*5), and the cross has 5s in positions that are in the same row and column. \n\nBut this is too vague. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the 5s seem to be in a cross shape that is centered at the middle of the output grid. For example, the middle of the output is around row 7, column 7. \n\nIn the input, the middle row is all 5s. So maybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at the middle of the output grid. \n\nBut how to code this? \n\nAnother idea: the output is generated by taking the input's 5s and placing them in the output's grid in positions that form a cross around the center of the output. \n\nFor example, the input's 5s are used to determine the positions of the cross. \n\nBut without knowing the exact pattern, this is difficult. \n\nMaybe the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that is centered at the same position as the input's 5s. \n\nBut I'm not making progress. \n\nPerhaps I should think about the output as being generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that spans a certain number of rows and columns. For example, each 5 in the input is replaced by a cross that is 3x3 in the output. \n\nBut how to determine the exact positions? \n\nAlternatively, the output is generated by expanding the input's 5s into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), and the cross has 5s in all positions that are in the same row or column as the center. \n\nBut this is just a guess. \n\nGiven the time constraints, I'll proceed with the hypothesis that each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), and the cross has 5s in the same row and column. \n\nSo for each 5 in the input, we would place 5s in the output grid in the same row and column as the center, but within a certain range. \n\nLet me try to code this. \n\nThe function would take the input grid, and for each cell (i,j) in the input, if it's a 5, then in the output grid, we would set 5s in the positions (i*5 + 2 - k, j*5 + 2) for k in -2 to +2, and (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2 + l) for l in -2 to +2. \n\nBut this would create a cross of 5s around the center. \n\nHowever, this might not fit the examples, but it's a possible approach. \n\nLet's test this with Example 1. \n\nIn Example 1, the input's middle row is all 5s. So for each j in 0,1,2, the input has a 5 at (1, j). \n\nThe center for each would be (1*5 + 2, j*5 + 2) = (7, j*5 + 2). \n\nFor j=0, the center is (7, 2). The cross would include positions (7-2, 2) to (7+2, 2) = rows 5-9, column 2. And for the horizontal line, columns 2-2 \u00b1 2, row 7. So columns 0-4, row 7. \n\nBut in the output, the first row has a 5 at position 7 (column 7), which is not part of this. \n\nThis suggests that this approach is not correct. \n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should look for another pattern. \n\nLooking at the output for Example 1, the 5s seem to form a vertical line in the middle columns and a horizontal line in the middle rows. This suggests that the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at the middle of the output grid. \n\nFor example, the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at (7,7) in the output. \n\nBut how to determine this? \n\nMaybe the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at (7,7), and the input's 5s determine the size of the cross. \n\nBut this is not clear. \n\nAlternatively, the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), and the cross has a certain pattern. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples. \n\nMaybe the output is generated by expanding each 5 in the input into a 3x3 cross in the output, centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). \n\nSo, for each 5 in the input at (i,j), in the output, we set the following positions to 5:\n\n- All positions in the same row as the center, from column j*5 + 2 - 2 to j*5 + 2 + 2.\n- All positions in the same column as the center, from row i*5 + 2 - 2 to i*5 + 2 + 2.\n\nThis would create a cross of 5s around the center. \n\nLet's see if this fits with the examples. \n\nFor Example 1's input, the middle row is all 5s. So for each j in 0,1,2, the input has a 5 at (1,j). \n\nThe center for each would be (1*5 + 2, j*5 + 2) = (7, j*5 + 2). \n\nFor j=0, center is (7, 2). The cross would include:\n\n- Row 7, columns 0-4 (since j*5 + 2 - 2 = 2-2=0, j*5 + 2 + 2 = 2+2=4).\n- Column 2, rows 5-9 (i*5 + 2 - 2 = 7-2=5, i*5 + 2 + 2=7+2=9).\n\nThis would create a horizontal line in row 7, columns 0-4, and a vertical line in column 2, rows 5-9. \n\nBut in the output, the first row has a 5 at position 7 (column 7), which is not part of this. \n\nThis suggests that this approach is not correct. \n\nGiven that I'm unable to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make a guess based on the examples. \n\nAnother observation: in all examples, the output has 5s in positions that form a cross in the middle of the output grid. For example, in Example 1, the output has a vertical line in the middle columns and a horizontal line in the middle rows. This suggests that the input's 5s are being expanded into a cross that is centered at the middle of the output grid. \n\nSo, the input's 5s are being used to determine the positions of the cross in the output. \n\nBut how? \n\nMaybe the input's 5s are being used to determine the size of the cross. For example, if the input has a 5 in the middle, then the cross is larger. \n\nAlternatively, the input's 5s are being used to determine the positions of the cross. For example, each 5 in the input is expanded into a cross that is centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2). \n\nBut without seeing the exact pattern, I'll proceed with this hypothesis. \n\nSo, the code would be:\n\n- Initialize a 15x15 grid with 0s.\n- For each cell (i,j) in the input grid:\n   - If the cell is 5:\n      - For k in -2 to +2:\n         - For l in -2 to +2:\n            - if k == 0 or l == 0:\n               - set the output at (i*5 + k, j*5 + l) to 5.\n- But this would create a 5x5 square of 5s for each input 5, which may not fit the examples. \n\nBut in Example 1's input, the middle row is all 5s. So for each j, the input has a 5 at (1,j). \n\nFor each such cell, the code would set 5s in a 5x5 square around (1*5 + k, j*5 + l). \n\nBut this would create a 5x5 square for each input 5, leading to overlapping squares. \n\nBut in the output for Example 1, there is a vertical line of 5s in the middle columns. This suggests that this approach may not be correct. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to proceed with the code that expands each input 5 into a cross centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), and the cross includes the same row and column. \n\nHere's the code:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0 for _ in range(15)] for _ in range(15)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if grid[i][j] == 5:\n                # Center of the cross\n                center_row = i * 5 + 2\n                center_col = j * 5 + 2\n                # Vertical line\n                for k in range(-2, 3):\n                    output[center_row + k][center_col] = 5\n                # Horizontal line\n                for l in range(-2, 3):\n                    output[center_row][center_col + l] = 5\n    return output\n\nBut this would create a cross of 5s around each input 5. \n\nTesting this with Example 1's input:\n\nInput is:\n0 5 0\n5 5 5\n0 5 0\n\nFor i=0, j=1: center_row = 0*5 + 2 = 2, center_col = 1*5 + 2 = 7. \n\nVertical line: rows 2-2+4= 0 to 4? Wait, k ranges from -2 to +2, so center_row + k would be 2-2=0, 2-1=1, 2, 2+1=3, 2+2=4. So rows 0-4, column 7. \n\nHorizontal line: columns 7-2=5 to 7+2=9, row 2. \n\nSo in the output, row 2, columns 5-9 would have 5s. \n\nThis would create a horizontal line in row 2, columns 5-9. \n\nSimilarly, for the input's middle row (i=1, j=0,1,2), their centers would be (1*5 + 2=7, j*5 + 2). For j=0, center is (7, 2). Vertical line: rows 5-9, column 2. Horizontal line: columns 0-4, row 7. \n\nSo this would create a vertical line in column 2, rows 5-9, and a horizontal line in row 7, columns 0-4. \n\nThis would create a cross in the middle of the output. \n\nThis might fit with the examples. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nIn Example 1's output, the first row has a 5 at position 7 (column 7). According to this code, for the input's (0,1) cell, the horizontal line would include column 7 in row 2. So the first row (row 0) would not have a 5 from this. \n\nBut in the output, the first row has a 5 at column 7. So this suggests that this code is not correct. \n\nBut perhaps the code is correct, and the output for Example 1 has a 5 in row 0, column 7 from another input cell. \n\nWait, in the input, the first row is 0 5 0. So for i=0, j=1, the code would set a horizontal line in row 2, columns 5-9. But in the output's first row, column 7 is 5. How does that happen? \n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct. \n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision based on the examples and the patterns I can see. \n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of a clear pattern, I'll proceed with the code that expands each 5 in the input into a cross centered at (i*5 + 2, j*5 + 2), and the cross is a vertical and horizontal line of 5s. This is my best guess based on the examples.\n"
