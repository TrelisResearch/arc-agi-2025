          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at each example and see if I can spot any common transformations.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput is a 3x3 grid with 8 in the center and 0s elsewhere. The output is a grid with 2s in the corners and edges, and 0 in the center. Wait, the output is:\n0 2 2\n2 0 2\n2 2 2\nSo the center is 0, and the edges and corners are 2s. Hmm. The input had 8 in the center. Maybe there's some relation between the input value and the output. But 8 is transformed to 0 here. Wait, but in example 5, the input has 8s in certain positions and the output has 2s. So maybe 8 is mapped to 2? But in example 1, the center is 8 and the output center is 0. Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe not directly.\n\nLooking at example 2:\nInput is a 3x3 grid with 3s on the edges and 0 in the center. The output is:\n1 1 0\n1 0 1\n0 1 1\nSo the output has 1s on the edges and corners, but the center is 0. The input's 3 is transformed to 1? But the input's 3 is in the corners, and the output's 1s are in the corners. But the center is 0. So maybe the value is being adjusted based on some rule.\n\nExample 3:\nInput is a grid with 5s in the first column and 0s elsewhere. Output is:\n0 4 4\n0 0 4\n0 4 4\nSo the first column is 5, and the output has 0s in the first column, and 4s elsewhere. Wait, the input's 5 is in the first column, and the output's first column is 0. But the other columns have 4s. Maybe the value is being transformed based on some function. For example, 5 is transformed to 0, but 4 is 4? Not sure.\n\nExample 4:\nInput is 5s in the first row, then 0s and a 5 in the third column. The output is:\n0 0 0\n4 4 0\n4 4 4\nSo the first row is all 0s. The second row has 4s in the first two columns and 0 in third. Third row has 4s in first two and 4 in third. Hmm. Maybe the input's 5s are transformed to 0s, and other values are transformed to 4s? Not sure.\n\nLooking at example 5:\nInput is 8 in the center and corners. Output is 2s in the corners and edges, but the center is 0. So maybe the 8s are transformed to 2s, but the center is 0. Wait, in example 1, the input's center is 8, and output is 0. But in example 5, the input's center is 8 and output is 0. So maybe when a cell is 8, it's transformed to 0? But in example 5, the corners are 8 and the output has 2s there. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value is being transformed based on some function. Let's think about example 1. The input is 8 in the center. The output is 0 in the center. So maybe 8 is mapped to 0. But in example 5, the input has 8 in the corners, and the output has 2s there. So that's conflicting. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nLooking at example 2, the input is 3 in the corners and 0 in the center. The output has 1s in the corners and 0 in the center. So 3 becomes 1. But example 3 has 5 in the first column, and the output is 0 in that column. So maybe 5 is mapped to 0, but 3 is mapped to 1. So maybe the transformation is based on the value's position and value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value's position in the grid. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is transformed based on some rule involving the original value and its position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the sum of the original cell's value and some function of its position. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the outputs. For example, in example 1, the output is a grid where the center is 0, and the rest are 2. In example 5, the output is 2s in the corners and edges, but the center is 0. So maybe the output is a grid where the center is 0, and the rest are 2s. But that's not the case for example 2. In example 2, the output's center is 0, but the corners are 1s. So that's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value. For example, if the original value is 8, then the output is 0. If it's 3, then 1. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nLooking at example 3: input is 5s in the first column. Output is 0s in that column and 4s elsewhere. So maybe the original value is 5, and the output is 0 for that cell, but others are 4. But why 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's position. For example, if the cell is in the center, then it's 0. But in example 1, the center is 8 and output is 0. In example 5, the center is 8 and output is 0. In example 2, the center is 0 and output is 0. So that's consistent. So maybe the center cell is always 0. But that's not the case for example 3, where the input's center is 0 and output is 0. So that's consistent.\n\nBut what about other cells? Let's think. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s in all cells except the center. In example 2, the output has 1s in the corners and edges, but the center is 0. So maybe the value of a cell in the output depends on its position and the original value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 8, then the output is 0 for the center and 2 for others. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's position. For example, for cells that are in the same row or column as the center, but that's unclear.\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the outputs. Let's see:\n\nExample 1: Output is a grid where all cells are 2 except the center, which is 0. So the output is a grid with 2s in the perimeter and 0 in the center.\n\nExample 2: Output is a grid with 1s in the corners and edges, and 0 in the center. So maybe the output is a grid where the corners and edges are 1s, and the center is 0.\n\nExample 3: Output is 0 in the first column, and 4s elsewhere. So maybe the first column is 0, and others are 4.\n\nExample 4: Output is 0 in the first row, and 4s in the second and third rows except for the third column.\n\nHmm. This seems inconsistent. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nWait, looking at example 1 and 5. Both have 8s in the input, but their outputs are different. In example 1, the output is 0 in the center and 2s elsewhere. In example 5, the output is 2s in the corners and edges, but the center is 0. So maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position of the cell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the original value and the cell's position. For example, if the original value is 8, then the output is 2 for cells that are not in the center, and 0 for the center. But example 5's input has 8 in the corners and edges, and output is 2s there. So that's possible.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Let's think of each cell's output value as a function of the original value and its position.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is based on the original value's position. For example, if the original value is in the center, output is 0. If it's in the corner, then output is 2 (for example 1 and 5). But in example 2, the original value is 3 in the corners, and output is 1. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value's value. For example, if the original value is 8, output is 2. If it's 3, output is 1. If it's 5, output is 0. But example 3's input is 5, and output is 0. But example 4's input is 5 in the first row, and output is 0 in that row. So maybe the original value is transformed to 0 if it's 5, but 3 is transformed to 1. But how to find the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value's value minus some function. For example, 8-6=2, 3-2=1, 5-5=0. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 1: input is 8, output is 0. So 8-8=0. But in example 5, input is 8, output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the position. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. Otherwise, output is (original value - 6) if the original value is 8, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3: input is 5, output is 0. So maybe 5 is mapped to 0. But example 4's input has 5 in the first row, output is 0 in that row. So maybe 5 is mapped to 0.\n\nBut example 2's input is 3, and output is 1. So 3-2=1. Example 1's input is 8, output is 0. So 8-8=0. Example 5's input is 8, output is 2. So 8-6=2. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value and the cell's position. For example, for cells not in the center, if the original value is 8, then output is 2. If original value is 3, output is 1. If original value is 5, output is 0. But how to find a general rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the position. For example, for cells that are not in the center, the output is (original value - 6) if the original value is 8, but that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being determined by the original value's value and whether it's in the center. For example, if the original value is 8, then output is 2 for non-center cells, 0 for center. But in example 5, the input has 8 in the corners, which are not center, and output is 2. So that fits. In example 1, the center is 8, output is 0. That fits. But example 2's input is 3 in the corners, output is 1. So that would fit if 3-2=1. But how to find the general rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for a cell is (original value - 6) if the original value is 8 or 3, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a function of the original value. For example, in example 1, input is 8, output is 0. In example 2, input is 3, output is 1. In example 3, input is 5, output is 0. In example 4, input is 5, output is 0. In example 5, input is 8, output is 2. In example 6, input is 8, output is 0. Wait, example 6's input is:\n\nInput:\n8 0 8\n0 8 0\n0 8 0\nOutput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n\nSo for the center cell (original value 8), output is 0. For the corners (original value 8), output is 0 (first row, first column is 0?), wait no. Let me check example 6's output:\n\nOutput is:\n0 2 0\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n\nSo the first row is 0, 2, 0. So the first cell is 0, which is the original value 8. So that's 0. The second cell is 2 (original value 0?), no. Wait the input for example 6 is:\n\nInput:\n8 0 8\n0 8 0\n0 8 0\n\nSo the first row is 8, 0, 8. The second row is 0, 8, 0. The third row is 0, 8, 0.\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 2 0\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n\nSo for the first row, first cell (original 8) is 0. Second cell (original 0) is 2. Third cell (original 8) is 0. So for original 0, output is 2. For original 8, output is 0. So maybe the output is 0 if the original is 8, and 2 if original is 0. But that's not consistent with other examples.\n\nIn example 1, the input is 8 in the center. Output is 0. In example 5, the input has 8 in the corners, and output is 2. Wait, example 5's output is:\n\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n0 2 2\n\nSo the corners are 2, but the center is 0. So for original 8 in the corners, the output is 2. But in example 6, the original 8 in the corners is output as 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the output grids.\n\nLooking at example 1 and 5, the output has 2s in the corners and edges, except the center. But in example 6, the output has 0s in the corners and edges. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 8, then the output is 0 if it's in the center, and 2 if it's on the edge. But example 6's input has 8 in the corners, which are edges. But in example 6's output, the corners are 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value's position and the value. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. For other cells, if the original value is 8, then output is 2. If the original value is 3, then output is 1. If the original value is 5, then output is 0. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value and whether it's in the center. For example, if it's in the center, output is 0. Otherwise, output is (original value - 6) if the original value is 8, 3, or 5. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being a grid where certain patterns are generated. For example, in example 1, the output is a grid with 2s in the perimeter and 0 in the center. In example 2, the output is a grid with 1s in the perimeter and 0 in the center. In example 3, the output is 0 in the first column and 4s elsewhere. In example 4, the output is 0 in the first row and 4s elsewhere. In example 5, the output is 2s in the perimeter and 0 in the center. In example 6, the output is 0 in the corners and edges, and 2 in the center.\n\nWait, example 6's output is:\n\n0 2 0\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n\nSo the center is 0, and the edges are 2. So the output is a grid where the center is 0, and the edges are 2. But the corners are 0. So this is different from example 1 and 5.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not uniform. It depends on the original grid's values.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, for each cell, if the original value is 8, then the output is 0 if it's in the center, and 2 if it's on the edge. But in example 6, the original 8 is in the corners (edges), and the output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value's value and the number of adjacent cells with certain values. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell's value is the original value's value minus 6, but only if the original value is 8 or 3. For example, 8-6=2, 3-2=1. But in example 3, the original value is 5, and output is 0. So 5-5=0. So maybe the output is original value minus some value based on the original value.\n\nBut how to find the pattern. Let's see:\n\nExample 1: input is 8, output is 0. 8-8=0.\nExample 2: input is 3, output is 1. 3-2=1.\nExample 3: input is 5, output is 0. 5-5=0.\nExample 4: input is 5, output is 0. 5-5=0.\nExample 5: input is 8, output is 2. 8-6=2.\nExample 6: input is 8, output is 0. 8-8=0.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. But perhaps there's a pattern based on the original value and its position. For example, if the cell is in the center, subtract 8. If it's in the edge, subtract 6. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value's value and the position. For example, if the original value is 8, then the output is 0 for the center, and 2 for the edges. If the original value is 3, then output is 1 for the edges. If the original value is 5, output is 0 for the first column.\n\nBut this seems too arbitrary. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the output for example 1 and 5. In both cases, the output has 2s in the edges and corners, and 0 in the center. But in example 6, the output has 0s in the corners and edges, and 2 in the center. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell's value is 2 if the original value is 8 and it's not in the center, 0 if it's in the center. But example 6's input has 8 in the corners (edges), but the output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 8, then the output is 0 if it's in the center, and 2 if it's in the corners. But in example 6, the original 8 is in the corners, and the output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to all examples.\n\nLooking at example 1 and 5, the output is a grid with 2s in the perimeter and 0 in the center. Example 2's output is 1s in the perimeter and 0 in the center. Example 3's output is 0 in the first column and 4s elsewhere. Example 4's output is 0 in the first row and 4s elsewhere. Example 6's output is 0 in the corners and edges, and 2 in the center.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the output depends on the original grid's values. For example, if the original grid has a certain value, the output is a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell's value is determined by the original value and the position. For example:\n\nIf the cell is in the center, output is 0.\n\nFor other cells:\n\nIf the original value is 8, output is 2.\n\nIf the original value is 3, output is 1.\n\nIf the original value is 5, output is 0.\n\nBut this doesn't explain example 6's output. In example 6, the original value is 8 in the corners, and the output is 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value's value and the cell's position. For example, for cells not in the center:\n\nIf the original value is 8, then output is 2 if it's in the corners, 0 if it's in the edges.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original value's value and whether it's in a certain position. For example, if the original value is 8, then the output is 0 for the center and 2 for the edges. But in example 6, the original value is 8 in the corners, which are edges, but the output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the number of times it appears in the grid. But that's not helpful.\n\nMaybe it's better to think of the output as a grid where each cell's value is determined by the original value's value and the position. For example, for each cell, if it's in the center, output is 0. Otherwise, if the original value is 8, output is 2. If the original value is 3, output is 1. If the original value is 5, output is 0. But this is not consistent with example 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value minus 6, but only for certain values. For example, 8-6=2, 3-2=1, 5-5=0. But why those numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the cell's position. For example, for cells not in the center:\n\nIf the original value is 8, output is 2.\n\nIf the original value is 3, output is 1.\n\nIf the original value is 5, output is 0.\n\nBut how to handle other values.\n\nIn example 4, the input has 5 in the first row, and output is 0 in that row. So 5 is mapped to 0. But in example 3, the input has 5 in the first column, and output is 0 in that column. So maybe 5 is mapped to 0.\n\nBut example 2's input has 3 in the corners, and output is 1 in those positions. So 3 is mapped to 1.\n\nSo maybe the output is determined by the original value's value, with certain mappings:\n\n8 \u2192 2 (if not in center)\n\n3 \u2192 1 (if not in center)\n\n5 \u2192 0 (if not in center)\n\nBut what about other values? For example, in example 4, the input has 5 in the first row, output is 0 in that row. So perhaps for 5, output is 0.\n\nBut how to explain example 6's output. In example 6, the input has 8 in the corners, which are not in the center, but the output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value's value and the position. For example, if the original value is 8 and the cell is in the center, output is 0. If the original value is 8 and the cell is not in the center, output is 2. But in example 6, the original value is 8 in the corners (not center), and the output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the output as being determined by the original value's value and the position, but with some other rules.\n\nLooking at example 6's output:\n\nInput:\n8 0 8\n0 8 0\n0 8 0\n\nOutput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n\nSo for the first row, the first cell is 8 \u2192 0. The second cell is 0 \u2192 2. The third cell is 8 \u2192 0.\n\nIn the second row, first cell is 0 \u2192 2, center is 8 \u2192 0, third cell is 0 \u2192 2.\n\nThird row: first cell is 0 \u2192 2, center is 8 \u2192 0, third cell is 0 \u2192 2.\n\nSo the output seems to be 0 for cells with original value 8, and 2 for cells with original value 0. But in example 1, the input is 8 in the center and 0 elsewhere. The output is 0 in the center and 2 elsewhere. So that fits. In example 5, the input has 8 in the corners and edges, and output is 2 in the corners and edges, but the center is 0. Wait, no. Example 5's output is:\n\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n0 2 2\n\nSo the center is 0, and the corners are 2. But the input has 8 in the corners and edges. So for the corners (original 8), output is 2. For the edges (original 8), output is 0? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nIn example 5's input:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0 \u2192 so the middle cell is 8.\n\nRow 1: 0 8 0 \u2192 middle cell is 8.\n\nRow 2: 8 0 0 \u2192 first cell is 8.\n\nSo the output is:\n\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n0 2 2\n\nSo the first row's first cell is 0 (original 0?), no. Wait the input for example 5 is:\n\nInput:\n0 8 0\n0 8 0\n8 0 0\n\nSo the first row is 0, 8, 0. So the first cell is 0, which is in the top-left corner. The output is 2 in that position. The second cell is 8 (middle of the top row), output is 0. The third cell is 0, output is 2. So for the original value 0, output is 2. For the original value 8, output is 0 if it's in the center, and 2 if it's in the corners?\n\nBut that doesn't fit with example 6. In example 6, the original value is 8 in the corners, and the output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not consistent. Maybe the output is determined by the original value's value and whether it's in the center or not. For example:\n\nIf the original value is 8 and it's in the center, output is 0.\n\nIf the original value is 8 and it's not in the center, output is 2.\n\nBut in example 6, the original value is 8 in the corners (not center), but the output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value's value and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. If the cell is in the corner, output is 2 if original value is 8, 0 if original value is 0. But this is getting too arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits as many examples as possible.\n\nLet me think about the output for each example:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 8 in center, 0 elsewhere.\n\nOutput: 0 in center, 2 elsewhere.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: 3 in corners, 0 in center.\n\nOutput: 1 in corners, 0 in center.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: 5 in first column, 0 elsewhere.\n\nOutput: 0 in first column, 4 elsewhere.\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: 5 in first row, 0 elsewhere.\n\nOutput: 0 in first row, 4 elsewhere.\n\nExample 5:\n\nInput: 8 in corners and edges, 0 in center.\n\nOutput: 2 in corners and edges, 0 in center.\n\nExample 6:\n\nInput: 8 in corners and edges, 0 in center.\n\nOutput: 0 in corners and edges, 2 in center.\n\nWait, in example 6's output, the center is 2. So this is different from other examples.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not consistent. But maybe there's a pattern that for certain values, the output is based on the original value's value and the position.\n\nAnother idea: the output is determined by the original value's value and the number of 8s in the grid. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original value's value and the cell's position. For example:\n\n- If the cell is in the center, output is 0.\n- For other cells:\n   - If the original value is 8, output is 2.\n   - If the original value is 3, output is 1.\n   - If the original value is 5, output is 0.\n   - If the original value is 0, output is 2.\n   - If the original value is 4, output is 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's see:\n\nExample 1: input is 8 in center \u2192 output is 0. Other cells are 0 \u2192 output is 2. So that fits.\n\nExample 2: input is 3 in corners \u2192 output is 1. Center is 0 \u2192 output is 0. So that fits.\n\nExample 3: input is 5 in first column \u2192 output is 0. Other cells are 0 \u2192 output is 2. But the output is 0 in first column and 4 elsewhere. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value minus 6 for certain values. For example:\n\n8 \u2192 2 (8-6=2)\n\n3 \u2192 1 (3-2=1)\n\n5 \u2192 0 (5-5=0)\n\n0 \u2192 2 (0+2=2)\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nIn example 3, input is 5, output is 0. So 5-5=0.\n\nIn example 4, input is 5, output is 0. So same as example 3.\n\nIn example 2, input is 3, output is 1. So 3-2=1.\n\nIn example 1, input is 8, output is 0. So 8-8=0.\n\nIn example 5, input is 8, output is 2. So 8-6=2.\n\nIn example 6, input is 8, output is 0. So 8-8=0.\n\nThis suggests that the output is original value minus some value, but the subtracted value depends on the original value. For example:\n\nIf the original value is 8, subtract 8 if it's in the center, subtract 6 if it's in the edge. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, the output is determined by the original value and the position. For example:\n\nFor cells not in the center:\n\n- If original value is 8 \u2192 2\n- If original value is 3 \u2192 1\n- If original value is 5 \u2192 0\n- If original value is 0 \u2192 2\n\nBut this doesn't explain example 6's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. Otherwise, if the original value is 8, output is 2 if it's in the corners, 0 if it's in the edges. But this is not consistent with example 6.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples that seem to fit.\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that the output is determined by the original value's value and the position. For example, if the original value is 8, the output is 0 if it's in the center, 2 if it's in the corners. For 3, output is 1 if it's in the corners. For 5, output is 0 if it's in the first column or row.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nMaybe the output is based on the original value's value and the position. For example:\n\n- If the cell is in the center, output is 0.\n- For other cells:\n   - If the original value is 8, output is 2.\n   - If the original value is 3, output is 1.\n   - If the original value is 5, output is 0.\n   - If the original value is 0, output is 2.\n\nBut this would explain example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but not example 6. In example 6, the original value is 8 in the corners, which would be output as 2. But the output is 0. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the cell's position. For example, for cells not in the center:\n\n- If the original value is 8, output is 2 if it's in the corners, 0 if it's in the edges.\n- If the original value is 3, output is 1 if it's in the corners.\n- If the original value is 5, output is 0 if it's in the first column or row.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the examples, I'll try to write a function that for each cell:\n\n- If it's the center, output is 0.\n- Otherwise, if the original value is 8, output is 2.\n- If the original value is 3, output is 1.\n- If the original value is 5, output is 0.\n- If the original value is 0, output is 2.\n\nBut this may not work for all examples, but let's see.\n\nFor example 1: input is 8 in center \u2192 output 0. Other cells are 0 \u2192 output 2. Which matches.\n\nExample 2: input is 3 in corners \u2192 output 1. Center is 0 \u2192 output 0. Which matches.\n\nExample 3: input is 5 in first column \u2192 output 0. Other cells are 0 \u2192 output 2. But example 3's output is 0 in first column and 4 elsewhere. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is based on the original value and the cell's position. For example:\n\nFor cells not in the center:\n\n- If the original value is 8, output is 2 if it's in the corners, 0 if it's in the edges.\n- If the original value is 3, output is 1 if it's in the corners.\n- If the original value is 5, output is 0 if it's in the first column or row.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the cell's position. For example, for each cell:\n\noutput = (original value - 6) if original value is 8 or 3, else 0 if original value is 5, else 2 if original value is 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn example 1, original value is 8 \u2192 8-6=2. But the output is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the position. For example, for each cell:\n\nif it's in the center, output is 0.\n\nelse:\n\nif original value is 8 \u2192 2\n\nif original value is 3 \u2192 1\n\nif original value is 5 \u2192 0\n\nelse \u2192 2\n\nBut this would explain example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but not example 6.\n\nIn example 6, the original value is 8 in the corners (not center), so output is 2. But the output is 0. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut maybe the example 6 is an exception, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the cell's position, but for cells in the center, it's 0, and for others, it's 2 if the original value is 8, 1 if it's 3, 0 if it's 5, and 2 if it's 0.\n\nBut example 6's output for the corners (original 8) is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision based on the examples I can fit.\n\nLet me try to code a function that for each cell:\n\n- If it's the center, output is 0.\n- Else, if the original value is 8, output is 2.\n- If original value is 3, output is 1.\n- If original value is 5, output is 0.\n- Else, output is 2.\n\nThis would handle example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but not example 6.\n\nBut let's see what the output for example 6 would be.\n\nExample 6's input:\n\n8 0 8\n0 8 0\n0 8 0\n\nSo for each cell:\n\nCenter is 8 \u2192 output 0.\n\nOther cells:\n\nFirst row: 8 \u2192 2, 0 \u2192 2, 8 \u2192 2.\n\nSecond row: 0 \u2192 2, 8 \u2192 0, 0 \u2192 2.\n\nThird row: 0 \u2192 2, 8 \u2192 0, 0 \u2192 2.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n2 2 2\n2 0 2\n2 2 2\n\nBut the actual output for example 6 is:\n\n0 2 0\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n\nSo this is different. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the position. For example, for cells not in the center:\n\nif original value is 8, output is 2 if it's in the corners, 0 if it's in the edges.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the cell's position. For example:\n\nFor cells not in the center:\n\n- If the cell is in the corner, output is 2 if original value is 8, 1 if original value is 3, 0 if original value is 5, 2 if original value is 0.\n\n- If the cell is in the edge (not corner), output is 0 if original value is 8, 1 if original value is 3, 0 if original value is 5, 2 if original value is 0.\n\nBut this would explain example 6.\n\nIn example 6, the input is 8 in the corners (which are corners), so output is 2. But the actual output is 0. So this is not matching.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent, I think I need to make a best guess based on the examples that seem to fit.\n\nPerhaps the output is determined by the original value's value and the cell's position. For example:\n\nFor each cell:\n\nIf it's in the center, output is 0.\n\nOtherwise, if the original value is 8, output is 2 if it's in the corners, 0 if it's in the edges.\n\nIf the original value is 3, output is 1 if it's in the corners, 0 if it's in the edges.\n\nIf the original value is 5, output is 0 if it's in the first column or row, 2 otherwise.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the cell's position. For example, the output is 2 if the original value is 8 and it's in the corners, 0 if it's in the edges. For other values, it's based on their value.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nFor each cell:\n\n- If it's the center, output is 0.\n\n- Else, if the original value is 8, output is 2.\n\n- Else, if the original value is 3, output is 1.\n\n- Else, if the original value is 5, output is 0.\n\n- Else, output is 2.\n\nThis would handle examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but not 6. But perhaps the test input is designed to fit this.\n\nLet me check the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n3 0 0\n3 3 3\n0 0 3\n\nSo the input grid is:\n\nRow 0: 3 0 0\n\nRow 1: 3 3 3\n\nRow 2: 0 0 3\n\nAccording to the above rules:\n\nCenter is (1,1) which is 3 \u2192 output 1.\n\nOther cells:\n\nFor cells not in center:\n\n- Row 0, col 0: 3 \u2192 output 1.\n\n- Row 0, col 1: 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n- Row 0, col 2: 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nRow 1, col 0: 3 \u2192 output 1.\n\nRow 1, col 1: 3 \u2192 output 1.\n\nRow 1, col 2: 3 \u2192 output 1.\n\nRow 2, col 0: 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nRow 2, col 1: 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nRow 2, col 2: 3 \u2192 output 1.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n1 2 2\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 1\n\nBut I don't know what the actual output is. However, this is the best I can do based on the patterns observed.\n\nSo the Python function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if i == 1 and j == 1:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                val = grid[i][j]\n                if val == 8:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif val == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                elif val == 5:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 0\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not handle all cases correctly, but it's based on the patterns observed.\n\nHowever, in example 6, this would produce:\n\nFor the input:\n\n8 0 8\n\n0 8 0\n\n0 8 0\n\nThe center is 8 \u2192 output 0.\n\nOther cells:\n\nFor example, (0,0) is 8 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(0,1) is 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(0,2) is 8 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(1,0) is 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(1,1) is 8 \u2192 output 0.\n\n(1,2) is 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(2,0) is 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(2,1) is 8 \u2192 output 0.\n\n(2,2) is 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n2 2 2\n\n2 0 2\n\n2 2 2\n\nBut the actual output for example 6 is:\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 0 2\n\n2 0 2\n\nSo this is different. Hence, this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not handle all examples correctly.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's going on. Let me start by looking at each example and see if I can spot any common transformations.\n\nLooking at Example 1:\nInput is a 3x3 grid with 8 in the center and 0s elsewhere. The output is a grid with 2s in the corners and edges, and 0 in the center. Wait, the output is:\n0 2 2\n2 0 2\n2 2 2\nSo the center is 0, and the edges and corners are 2s. Hmm. The input had 8 in the center. Maybe there's some relation between the input value and the output. But 8 is transformed to 0 here. Wait, but in example 5, the input has 8s in certain positions and the output has 2s. So maybe 8 is mapped to 2? But in example 1, the center is 8 and the output center is 0. Wait, that's conflicting. Maybe not directly.\n\nLooking at example 2:\nInput is a 3x3 grid with 3s on the edges and 0 in the center. The output is:\n1 1 0\n1 0 1\n0 1 1\nSo the output has 1s on the edges and corners, but the center is 0. The input's 3 is transformed to 1? But the input's 3 is in the corners, and the output's 1s are in the corners. But the center is 0. So maybe the value is being adjusted based on some rule.\n\nExample 3:\nInput is a grid with 5s in the first column and 0s elsewhere. Output is:\n0 4 4\n0 0 4\n0 4 4\nSo the first column is 5, and the output has 0s in the first column, and 4s elsewhere. Wait, the input's 5 is in the first column, and the output's first column is 0. But the other columns have 4s. Maybe the value is being transformed based on some function. For example, 5 is transformed to 0, but 4 is 4? Not sure.\n\nExample 4:\nInput is 5s in the first row, then 0s and a 5 in the third column. The output is:\n0 0 0\n4 4 0\n4 4 4\nSo the first row is all 0s. The second row has 4s in the first two columns and 0 in third. Third row has 4s in first two and 4 in third. Hmm. Maybe the input's 5s are transformed to 0s, and other values are transformed to 4s? Not sure.\n\nLooking at example 5:\nInput is 8 in the center and corners. Output is 2s in the corners and edges, but the center is 0. So maybe the 8s are transformed to 2s, but the center is 0. Wait, in example 1, the input's center is 8, and output is 0. But in example 5, the input's center is 8 and output is 0. So maybe when a cell is 8, it's transformed to 0? But in example 5, the corners are 8 and the output has 2s there. So maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the value is being transformed based on some function. Let's think about example 1. The input is 8 in the center. The output is 0 in the center. So maybe 8 is mapped to 0. But in example 5, the input has 8 in the corners, and the output has 2s there. So that's conflicting. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nLooking at example 2, the input is 3 in the corners and 0 in the center. The output has 1s in the corners and 0 in the center. So 3 becomes 1. But example 3 has 5 in the first column, and the output is 0 in that column. So maybe 5 is mapped to 0, but 3 is mapped to 1. So maybe the transformation is based on the value's position and value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value's position in the grid. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is transformed based on some rule involving the original value and its position.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the sum of the original cell's value and some function of its position. Let me think.\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the outputs. For example, in example 1, the output is a grid where the center is 0, and the rest are 2. In example 5, the output is 2s in the corners and edges, but the center is 0. So maybe the output is a grid where the center is 0, and the rest are 2s. But that's not the case for example 2. In example 2, the output's center is 0, but the corners are 1s. So that's different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value. For example, if the original value is 8, then the output is 0. If it's 3, then 1. But how does that fit with the other examples?\n\nLooking at example 3: input is 5s in the first column. Output is 0s in that column and 4s elsewhere. So maybe the original value is 5, and the output is 0 for that cell, but others are 4. But why 4?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's position. For example, if the cell is in the center, then it's 0. But in example 1, the center is 8 and output is 0. In example 5, the center is 8 and output is 0. In example 2, the center is 0 and output is 0. So that's consistent. So maybe the center cell is always 0. But that's not the case for example 3, where the input's center is 0 and output is 0. So that's consistent.\n\nBut what about other cells? Let's think. For example, in example 1, the output has 2s in all cells except the center. In example 2, the output has 1s in the corners and edges, but the center is 0. So maybe the value of a cell in the output depends on its position and the original value.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 8, then the output is 0 for the center and 2 for others. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's position. For example, for cells that are in the same row or column as the center, but that's unclear.\n\nAnother approach: look for the pattern in the outputs. Let's see:\n\nExample 1: Output is a grid where all cells are 2 except the center, which is 0. So the output is a grid with 2s in the perimeter and 0 in the center.\n\nExample 2: Output is a grid with 1s in the corners and edges, and 0 in the center. So maybe the output is a grid where the corners and edges are 1s, and the center is 0.\n\nExample 3: Output is 0 in the first column, and 4s elsewhere. So maybe the first column is 0, and others are 4.\n\nExample 4: Output is 0 in the first row, and 4s in the second and third rows except for the third column.\n\nHmm. This seems inconsistent. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nWait, looking at example 1 and 5. Both have 8s in the input, but their outputs are different. In example 1, the output is 0 in the center and 2s elsewhere. In example 5, the output is 2s in the corners and edges, but the center is 0. So maybe the transformation is based on the original value and the position of the cell.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is determined by the original value and the cell's position. For example, if the original value is 8, then the output is 2 for cells that are not in the center, and 0 for the center. But example 5's input has 8 in the corners and edges, and output is 2s there. So that's possible.\n\nBut how to generalize this. Let's think of each cell's output value as a function of the original value and its position.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is based on the original value's position. For example, if the original value is in the center, output is 0. If it's in the corner, then output is 2 (for example 1 and 5). But in example 2, the original value is 3 in the corners, and output is 1. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value's value. For example, if the original value is 8, output is 2. If it's 3, output is 1. If it's 5, output is 0. But example 3's input is 5, and output is 0. But example 4's input is 5 in the first row, and output is 0 in that row. So maybe the original value is transformed to 0 if it's 5, but 3 is transformed to 1. But how to find the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value's value minus some function. For example, 8-6=2, 3-2=1, 5-5=0. But that's just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 1: input is 8, output is 0. So 8-8=0. But in example 5, input is 8, output is 2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the position. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. Otherwise, output is (original value - 6) if the original value is 8, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 3: input is 5, output is 0. So maybe 5 is mapped to 0. But example 4's input has 5 in the first row, output is 0 in that row. So maybe 5 is mapped to 0.\n\nBut example 2's input is 3, and output is 1. So 3-2=1. Example 1's input is 8, output is 0. So 8-8=0. Example 5's input is 8, output is 2. So 8-6=2. That doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value and the cell's position. For example, for cells not in the center, if the original value is 8, then output is 2. If original value is 3, output is 1. If original value is 5, output is 0. But how to find a general rule.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the position. For example, for cells that are not in the center, the output is (original value - 6) if the original value is 8, but that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being determined by the original value's value and whether it's in the center. For example, if the original value is 8, then output is 2 for non-center cells, 0 for center. But in example 5, the input has 8 in the corners, which are not center, and output is 2. So that fits. In example 1, the center is 8, output is 0. That fits. But example 2's input is 3 in the corners, output is 1. So that would fit if 3-2=1. But how to find the general rule.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output for a cell is (original value - 6) if the original value is 8 or 3, but that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as a function of the original value. For example, in example 1, input is 8, output is 0. In example 2, input is 3, output is 1. In example 3, input is 5, output is 0. In example 4, input is 5, output is 0. In example 5, input is 8, output is 2. In example 6, input is 8, output is 0. Wait, example 6's input is:\n\nInput:\n8 0 8\n0 8 0\n0 8 0\nOutput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n\nSo for the center cell (original value 8), output is 0. For the corners (original value 8), output is 0 (first row, first column is 0?), wait no. Let me check example 6's output:\n\nOutput is:\n0 2 0\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n\nSo the first row is 0, 2, 0. So the first cell is 0, which is the original value 8. So that's 0. The second cell is 2 (original value 0?), no. Wait the input for example 6 is:\n\nInput:\n8 0 8\n0 8 0\n0 8 0\n\nSo the first row is 8, 0, 8. The second row is 0, 8, 0. The third row is 0, 8, 0.\n\nThe output is:\n\n0 2 0\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n\nSo for the first row, first cell (original 8) is 0. Second cell (original 0) is 2. Third cell (original 8) is 0. So for original 0, output is 2. For original 8, output is 0. So maybe the output is 0 if the original is 8, and 2 if original is 0. But that's not consistent with other examples.\n\nIn example 1, the input is 8 in the center. Output is 0. In example 5, the input has 8 in the corners, and output is 2. Wait, example 5's output is:\n\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n0 2 2\n\nSo the corners are 2, but the center is 0. So for original 8 in the corners, the output is 2. But in example 6, the original 8 in the corners is output as 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nHmm. This is confusing. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's think about the output grids.\n\nLooking at example 1 and 5, the output has 2s in the corners and edges, except the center. But in example 6, the output has 0s in the corners and edges. So that's not consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 8, then the output is 0 if it's in the center, and 2 if it's on the edge. But example 6's input has 8 in the corners, which are edges. But in example 6's output, the corners are 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value's position and the value. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. For other cells, if the original value is 8, then output is 2. If the original value is 3, then output is 1. If the original value is 5, then output is 0. But how to generalize this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value and whether it's in the center. For example, if it's in the center, output is 0. Otherwise, output is (original value - 6) if the original value is 8, 3, or 5. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, think of the output as being a grid where certain patterns are generated. For example, in example 1, the output is a grid with 2s in the perimeter and 0 in the center. In example 2, the output is a grid with 1s in the perimeter and 0 in the center. In example 3, the output is 0 in the first column and 4s elsewhere. In example 4, the output is 0 in the first row and 4s elsewhere. In example 5, the output is 2s in the perimeter and 0 in the center. In example 6, the output is 0 in the corners and edges, and 2 in the center.\n\nWait, example 6's output is:\n\n0 2 0\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n\nSo the center is 0, and the edges are 2. So the output is a grid where the center is 0, and the edges are 2. But the corners are 0. So this is different from example 1 and 5.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not uniform. It depends on the original grid's values.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is based on the original grid's values and their positions. For example, for each cell, if the original value is 8, then the output is 0 if it's in the center, and 2 if it's on the edge. But in example 6, the original 8 is in the corners (edges), and the output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value's value and the number of adjacent cells with certain values. But that seems complicated.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell's value is the original value's value minus 6, but only if the original value is 8 or 3. For example, 8-6=2, 3-2=1. But in example 3, the original value is 5, and output is 0. So 5-5=0. So maybe the output is original value minus some value based on the original value.\n\nBut how to find the pattern. Let's see:\n\nExample 1: input is 8, output is 0. 8-8=0.\nExample 2: input is 3, output is 1. 3-2=1.\nExample 3: input is 5, output is 0. 5-5=0.\nExample 4: input is 5, output is 0. 5-5=0.\nExample 5: input is 8, output is 2. 8-6=2.\nExample 6: input is 8, output is 0. 8-8=0.\n\nThis seems inconsistent. But perhaps there's a pattern based on the original value and its position. For example, if the cell is in the center, subtract 8. If it's in the edge, subtract 6. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value's value and the position. For example, if the original value is 8, then the output is 0 for the center, and 2 for the edges. If the original value is 3, then output is 1 for the edges. If the original value is 5, output is 0 for the first column.\n\nBut this seems too arbitrary. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nLet me think about the output for example 1 and 5. In both cases, the output has 2s in the edges and corners, and 0 in the center. But in example 6, the output has 0s in the corners and edges, and 2 in the center. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell's value is 2 if the original value is 8 and it's not in the center, 0 if it's in the center. But example 6's input has 8 in the corners (edges), but the output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the position. For example, if the original value is 8, then the output is 0 if it's in the center, and 2 if it's in the corners. But in example 6, the original 8 is in the corners, and the output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern that applies to all examples.\n\nLooking at example 1 and 5, the output is a grid with 2s in the perimeter and 0 in the center. Example 2's output is 1s in the perimeter and 0 in the center. Example 3's output is 0 in the first column and 4s elsewhere. Example 4's output is 0 in the first row and 4s elsewhere. Example 6's output is 0 in the corners and edges, and 2 in the center.\n\nHmm. This suggests that the output depends on the original grid's values. For example, if the original grid has a certain value, the output is a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a grid where each cell's value is determined by the original value and the position. For example:\n\nIf the cell is in the center, output is 0.\n\nFor other cells:\n\nIf the original value is 8, output is 2.\n\nIf the original value is 3, output is 1.\n\nIf the original value is 5, output is 0.\n\nBut this doesn't explain example 6's output. In example 6, the original value is 8 in the corners, and the output is 0.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value's value and the cell's position. For example, for cells not in the center:\n\nIf the original value is 8, then output is 2 if it's in the corners, 0 if it's in the edges.\n\nBut this is getting too complicated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original value's value and whether it's in a certain position. For example, if the original value is 8, then the output is 0 for the center and 2 for the edges. But in example 6, the original value is 8 in the corners, which are edges, but the output is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the number of times it appears in the grid. But that's not helpful.\n\nMaybe it's better to think of the output as a grid where each cell's value is determined by the original value's value and the position. For example, for each cell, if it's in the center, output is 0. Otherwise, if the original value is 8, output is 2. If the original value is 3, output is 1. If the original value is 5, output is 0. But this is not consistent with example 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value minus 6, but only for certain values. For example, 8-6=2, 3-2=1, 5-5=0. But why those numbers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the cell's position. For example, for cells not in the center:\n\nIf the original value is 8, output is 2.\n\nIf the original value is 3, output is 1.\n\nIf the original value is 5, output is 0.\n\nBut how to handle other values.\n\nIn example 4, the input has 5 in the first row, and output is 0 in that row. So 5 is mapped to 0. But in example 3, the input has 5 in the first column, and output is 0 in that column. So maybe 5 is mapped to 0.\n\nBut example 2's input has 3 in the corners, and output is 1 in those positions. So 3 is mapped to 1.\n\nSo maybe the output is determined by the original value's value, with certain mappings:\n\n8 \u2192 2 (if not in center)\n\n3 \u2192 1 (if not in center)\n\n5 \u2192 0 (if not in center)\n\nBut what about other values? For example, in example 4, the input has 5 in the first row, output is 0 in that row. So perhaps for 5, output is 0.\n\nBut how to explain example 6's output. In example 6, the input has 8 in the corners, which are not in the center, but the output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value's value and the position. For example, if the original value is 8 and the cell is in the center, output is 0. If the original value is 8 and the cell is not in the center, output is 2. But in example 6, the original value is 8 in the corners (not center), and the output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should think of the output as being determined by the original value's value and the position, but with some other rules.\n\nLooking at example 6's output:\n\nInput:\n8 0 8\n0 8 0\n0 8 0\n\nOutput:\n0 2 0\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n\nSo for the first row, the first cell is 8 \u2192 0. The second cell is 0 \u2192 2. The third cell is 8 \u2192 0.\n\nIn the second row, first cell is 0 \u2192 2, center is 8 \u2192 0, third cell is 0 \u2192 2.\n\nThird row: first cell is 0 \u2192 2, center is 8 \u2192 0, third cell is 0 \u2192 2.\n\nSo the output seems to be 0 for cells with original value 8, and 2 for cells with original value 0. But in example 1, the input is 8 in the center and 0 elsewhere. The output is 0 in the center and 2 elsewhere. So that fits. In example 5, the input has 8 in the corners and edges, and output is 2 in the corners and edges, but the center is 0. Wait, no. Example 5's output is:\n\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n0 2 2\n\nSo the center is 0, and the corners are 2. But the input has 8 in the corners and edges. So for the corners (original 8), output is 2. For the edges (original 8), output is 0? Wait, no. Let me check:\n\nIn example 5's input:\n\nRow 0: 0 8 0 \u2192 so the middle cell is 8.\n\nRow 1: 0 8 0 \u2192 middle cell is 8.\n\nRow 2: 8 0 0 \u2192 first cell is 8.\n\nSo the output is:\n\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n0 2 2\n\nSo the first row's first cell is 0 (original 0?), no. Wait the input for example 5 is:\n\nInput:\n0 8 0\n0 8 0\n8 0 0\n\nSo the first row is 0, 8, 0. So the first cell is 0, which is in the top-left corner. The output is 2 in that position. The second cell is 8 (middle of the top row), output is 0. The third cell is 0, output is 2. So for the original value 0, output is 2. For the original value 8, output is 0 if it's in the center, and 2 if it's in the corners?\n\nBut that doesn't fit with example 6. In example 6, the original value is 8 in the corners, and the output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not consistent. Maybe the output is determined by the original value's value and whether it's in the center or not. For example:\n\nIf the original value is 8 and it's in the center, output is 0.\n\nIf the original value is 8 and it's not in the center, output is 2.\n\nBut in example 6, the original value is 8 in the corners (not center), but the output is 0. So that's conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value's value and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. If the cell is in the corner, output is 2 if original value is 8, 0 if original value is 0. But this is getting too arbitrary.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that fits as many examples as possible.\n\nLet me think about the output for each example:\n\nExample 1:\n\nInput: 8 in center, 0 elsewhere.\n\nOutput: 0 in center, 2 elsewhere.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: 3 in corners, 0 in center.\n\nOutput: 1 in corners, 0 in center.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: 5 in first column, 0 elsewhere.\n\nOutput: 0 in first column, 4 elsewhere.\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: 5 in first row, 0 elsewhere.\n\nOutput: 0 in first row, 4 elsewhere.\n\nExample 5:\n\nInput: 8 in corners and edges, 0 in center.\n\nOutput: 2 in corners and edges, 0 in center.\n\nExample 6:\n\nInput: 8 in corners and edges, 0 in center.\n\nOutput: 0 in corners and edges, 2 in center.\n\nWait, in example 6's output, the center is 2. So this is different from other examples.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not consistent. But maybe there's a pattern that for certain values, the output is based on the original value's value and the position.\n\nAnother idea: the output is determined by the original value's value and the number of 8s in the grid. But that's not helpful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is based on the original value's value and the cell's position. For example:\n\n- If the cell is in the center, output is 0.\n- For other cells:\n   - If the original value is 8, output is 2.\n   - If the original value is 3, output is 1.\n   - If the original value is 5, output is 0.\n   - If the original value is 0, output is 2.\n   - If the original value is 4, output is 4.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's see:\n\nExample 1: input is 8 in center \u2192 output is 0. Other cells are 0 \u2192 output is 2. So that fits.\n\nExample 2: input is 3 in corners \u2192 output is 1. Center is 0 \u2192 output is 0. So that fits.\n\nExample 3: input is 5 in first column \u2192 output is 0. Other cells are 0 \u2192 output is 2. But the output is 0 in first column and 4 elsewhere. So this doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value minus 6 for certain values. For example:\n\n8 \u2192 2 (8-6=2)\n\n3 \u2192 1 (3-2=1)\n\n5 \u2192 0 (5-5=0)\n\n0 \u2192 2 (0+2=2)\n\nBut how to determine this.\n\nIn example 3, input is 5, output is 0. So 5-5=0.\n\nIn example 4, input is 5, output is 0. So same as example 3.\n\nIn example 2, input is 3, output is 1. So 3-2=1.\n\nIn example 1, input is 8, output is 0. So 8-8=0.\n\nIn example 5, input is 8, output is 2. So 8-6=2.\n\nIn example 6, input is 8, output is 0. So 8-8=0.\n\nThis suggests that the output is original value minus some value, but the subtracted value depends on the original value. For example:\n\nIf the original value is 8, subtract 8 if it's in the center, subtract 6 if it's in the edge. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, the output is determined by the original value and the position. For example:\n\nFor cells not in the center:\n\n- If original value is 8 \u2192 2\n- If original value is 3 \u2192 1\n- If original value is 5 \u2192 0\n- If original value is 0 \u2192 2\n\nBut this doesn't explain example 6's output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is determined by the original value and the cell's position. For example, if the cell is in the center, output is 0. Otherwise, if the original value is 8, output is 2 if it's in the corners, 0 if it's in the edges. But this is not consistent with example 6.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make an educated guess based on the examples that seem to fit.\n\nLooking at the examples, it seems that the output is determined by the original value's value and the position. For example, if the original value is 8, the output is 0 if it's in the center, 2 if it's in the corners. For 3, output is 1 if it's in the corners. For 5, output is 0 if it's in the first column or row.\n\nBut how to generalize this.\n\nMaybe the output is based on the original value's value and the position. For example:\n\n- If the cell is in the center, output is 0.\n- For other cells:\n   - If the original value is 8, output is 2.\n   - If the original value is 3, output is 1.\n   - If the original value is 5, output is 0.\n   - If the original value is 0, output is 2.\n\nBut this would explain example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but not example 6. In example 6, the original value is 8 in the corners, which would be output as 2. But the output is 0. So this is conflicting.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the cell's position. For example, for cells not in the center:\n\n- If the original value is 8, output is 2 if it's in the corners, 0 if it's in the edges.\n- If the original value is 3, output is 1 if it's in the corners.\n- If the original value is 5, output is 0 if it's in the first column or row.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the examples, I'll try to write a function that for each cell:\n\n- If it's the center, output is 0.\n- Otherwise, if the original value is 8, output is 2.\n- If the original value is 3, output is 1.\n- If the original value is 5, output is 0.\n- If the original value is 0, output is 2.\n\nBut this may not work for all examples, but let's see.\n\nFor example 1: input is 8 in center \u2192 output 0. Other cells are 0 \u2192 output 2. Which matches.\n\nExample 2: input is 3 in corners \u2192 output 1. Center is 0 \u2192 output 0. Which matches.\n\nExample 3: input is 5 in first column \u2192 output 0. Other cells are 0 \u2192 output 2. But example 3's output is 0 in first column and 4 elsewhere. So this doesn't match.\n\nHmm. This suggests that this approach is incorrect.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is based on the original value and the cell's position. For example:\n\nFor cells not in the center:\n\n- If the original value is 8, output is 2 if it's in the corners, 0 if it's in the edges.\n- If the original value is 3, output is 1 if it's in the corners.\n- If the original value is 5, output is 0 if it's in the first column or row.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the cell's position. For example, for each cell:\n\noutput = (original value - 6) if original value is 8 or 3, else 0 if original value is 5, else 2 if original value is 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nIn example 1, original value is 8 \u2192 8-6=2. But the output is 0. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the position. For example, for each cell:\n\nif it's in the center, output is 0.\n\nelse:\n\nif original value is 8 \u2192 2\n\nif original value is 3 \u2192 1\n\nif original value is 5 \u2192 0\n\nelse \u2192 2\n\nBut this would explain example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but not example 6.\n\nIn example 6, the original value is 8 in the corners (not center), so output is 2. But the output is 0. So this is conflicting.\n\nBut maybe the example 6 is an exception, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the cell's position, but for cells in the center, it's 0, and for others, it's 2 if the original value is 8, 1 if it's 3, 0 if it's 5, and 2 if it's 0.\n\nBut example 6's output for the corners (original 8) is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAt this point, I think I need to make a decision based on the examples I can fit.\n\nLet me try to code a function that for each cell:\n\n- If it's the center, output is 0.\n- Else, if the original value is 8, output is 2.\n- If original value is 3, output is 1.\n- If original value is 5, output is 0.\n- Else, output is 2.\n\nThis would handle example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but not example 6.\n\nBut let's see what the output for example 6 would be.\n\nExample 6's input:\n\n8 0 8\n0 8 0\n0 8 0\n\nSo for each cell:\n\nCenter is 8 \u2192 output 0.\n\nOther cells:\n\nFirst row: 8 \u2192 2, 0 \u2192 2, 8 \u2192 2.\n\nSecond row: 0 \u2192 2, 8 \u2192 0, 0 \u2192 2.\n\nThird row: 0 \u2192 2, 8 \u2192 0, 0 \u2192 2.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n2 2 2\n2 0 2\n2 2 2\n\nBut the actual output for example 6 is:\n\n0 2 0\n2 0 2\n2 0 2\n\nSo this is different. So this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the position. For example, for cells not in the center:\n\nif original value is 8, output is 2 if it's in the corners, 0 if it's in the edges.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value's value and the cell's position. For example:\n\nFor cells not in the center:\n\n- If the cell is in the corner, output is 2 if original value is 8, 1 if original value is 3, 0 if original value is 5, 2 if original value is 0.\n\n- If the cell is in the edge (not corner), output is 0 if original value is 8, 1 if original value is 3, 0 if original value is 5, 2 if original value is 0.\n\nBut this would explain example 6.\n\nIn example 6, the input is 8 in the corners (which are corners), so output is 2. But the actual output is 0. So this is not matching.\n\nThis is very confusing. Given the time I've spent, I think I need to make a best guess based on the examples that seem to fit.\n\nPerhaps the output is determined by the original value's value and the cell's position. For example:\n\nFor each cell:\n\nIf it's in the center, output is 0.\n\nOtherwise, if the original value is 8, output is 2 if it's in the corners, 0 if it's in the edges.\n\nIf the original value is 3, output is 1 if it's in the corners, 0 if it's in the edges.\n\nIf the original value is 5, output is 0 if it's in the first column or row, 2 otherwise.\n\nBut this is getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is based on the original value and the cell's position. For example, the output is 2 if the original value is 8 and it's in the corners, 0 if it's in the edges. For other values, it's based on their value.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed with the following approach:\n\nFor each cell:\n\n- If it's the center, output is 0.\n\n- Else, if the original value is 8, output is 2.\n\n- Else, if the original value is 3, output is 1.\n\n- Else, if the original value is 5, output is 0.\n\n- Else, output is 2.\n\nThis would handle examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, but not 6. But perhaps the test input is designed to fit this.\n\nLet me check the test input.\n\nTest Input:\n3 0 0\n3 3 3\n0 0 3\n\nSo the input grid is:\n\nRow 0: 3 0 0\n\nRow 1: 3 3 3\n\nRow 2: 0 0 3\n\nAccording to the above rules:\n\nCenter is (1,1) which is 3 \u2192 output 1.\n\nOther cells:\n\nFor cells not in center:\n\n- Row 0, col 0: 3 \u2192 output 1.\n\n- Row 0, col 1: 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n- Row 0, col 2: 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nRow 1, col 0: 3 \u2192 output 1.\n\nRow 1, col 1: 3 \u2192 output 1.\n\nRow 1, col 2: 3 \u2192 output 1.\n\nRow 2, col 0: 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nRow 2, col 1: 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nRow 2, col 2: 3 \u2192 output 1.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n1 2 2\n\n1 1 1\n\n2 2 1\n\nBut I don't know what the actual output is. However, this is the best I can do based on the patterns observed.\n\nSo the Python function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[0]*3 for _ in range(3)]\n    for i in range(3):\n        for j in range(3):\n            if i == 1 and j == 1:\n                transformed[i][j] = 0\n            else:\n                val = grid[i][j]\n                if val == 8:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n                elif val == 3:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 1\n                elif val == 5:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 0\n                else:\n                    transformed[i][j] = 2\n    return transformed\n\nBut this may not handle all cases correctly, but it's based on the patterns observed.\n\nHowever, in example 6, this would produce:\n\nFor the input:\n\n8 0 8\n\n0 8 0\n\n0 8 0\n\nThe center is 8 \u2192 output 0.\n\nOther cells:\n\nFor example, (0,0) is 8 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(0,1) is 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(0,2) is 8 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(1,0) is 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(1,1) is 8 \u2192 output 0.\n\n(1,2) is 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(2,0) is 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\n(2,1) is 8 \u2192 output 0.\n\n(2,2) is 0 \u2192 output 2.\n\nSo the output would be:\n\n2 2 2\n\n2 0 2\n\n2 2 2\n\nBut the actual output for example 6 is:\n\n0 2 0\n\n2 0 2\n\n2 0 2\n\nSo this is different. Hence, this approach is incorrect.\n\nBut given the time, I'll proceed with this code, even though it may not handle all examples correctly.\n"
