The input grids contain the number `5` at specific positions.\n2. The output grids have a pattern of `1`s surrounding the `5`s, and the `5`s themselves are replaced by their respective values.\n3. The pattern appears to be expanding the `5`s into a square or rectangular shape with `1`s, centered around the `5`.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe transformation involves:\n- Identifying the positions of `5`s in the input grid.\n- Expanding these `5`s into a square or rectangular shape with `1`s.\n- Keeping the original `5`s in their positions.\n\n### Python Function:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find the positions of all '5's in the grid\n    positions_of_5 = [(i, j) for i in range(9) for j in range(9) if grid[i][j] == 5]\n    \n    # Create a new grid initialized with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0] * 9 for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Function to expand a '5' into a square\n    def expand_5(x, y):\n        for i in range(max(0, x-1), min(9, x+2)):\n            for j in range(max(0, y-1), min(9, y+2)):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    # Apply the expansion to all '5's\n    for x, y in positions_of_5:\n        expand_5(x, y)\n    \n    # Place the original '5's back in their positions\n    for x, y in positions_of_5:\n        transformed_grid[x][y] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find the positions of all '5's in the grid\n    positions_of_5 = [(i, j) for i in range(9) for j in range(9) if grid[i][j] == 5]\n    \n    # Create a new grid initialized with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0] * 9 for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Function to expand a '5' into a square\n    def expand_5(x, y):\n        for i in range(max(0, x-1), min(9, x+2)):\n            for j in range(max(0, y-1), min(9, y+2)):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    # Apply the expansion to all '5's\n    for x, y in positions_of_5:\n        expand_5(x, y)\n    \n    # Place the original '5's back in their positions\n    for x, y in positions_of_5:\n        transformed_grid[x][y] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The input grids contain the number `5` at specific positions.\n2. The output grids have a pattern of `1`s surrounding the `5`s, and the `5`s themselves are replaced by their respective values.\n3. The pattern appears to be expanding the `5`s into a square or rectangular shape with `1`s, centered around the `5`.\n\n### Hypothesis:\nThe transformation involves:\n- Identifying the positions of `5`s in the input grid.\n- Expanding these `5`s into a square or rectangular shape with `1`s.\n- Keeping the original `5`s in their positions.\n\n### Python Function:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find the positions of all '5's in the grid\n    positions_of_5 = [(i, j) for i in range(9) for j in range(9) if grid[i][j] == 5]\n    \n    # Create a new grid initialized with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0] * 9 for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Function to expand a '5' into a square\n    def expand_5(x, y):\n        for i in range(max(0, x-1), min(9, x+2)):\n            for j in range(max(0, y-1), min(9, y+2)):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    # Apply the expansion to all '5's\n    for x, y in positions_of_5:\n        expand_5(x, y)\n    \n    # Place the original '5's back in their positions\n    for x, y in positions_of_5:\n        transformed_grid[x][y] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Find the positions of all '5's in the grid\n    positions_of_5 = [(i, j) for i in range(9) for j in range(9) if grid[i][j] == 5]\n    \n    # Create a new grid initialized with zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0] * 9 for _ in range(9)]\n    \n    # Function to expand a '5' into a square\n    def expand_5(x, y):\n        for i in range(max(0, x-1), min(9, x+2)):\n            for j in range(max(0, y-1), min(9, y+2)):\n                transformed_grid[i][j] = 1\n    \n    # Apply the expansion to all '5's\n    for x, y in positions_of_5:\n        expand_5(x, y)\n    \n    # Place the original '5's back in their positions\n    for x, y in positions_of_5:\n        transformed_grid[x][y] = 5\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
