              "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to identify patterns and create a transformation function.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe that:\n1. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with other values in a pattern\n2. There's a pattern of \"blocks\" or \"regions\" that get transformed\n3. The transformation seems to be based on the position of the value in the grid\n\nFrom the examples, I notice that:\n- Values of 2 in certain positions get replaced with 8 or 4\n- Values of 0 in certain positions get replaced with 0 or other values\n- The transformation seems to be based on the position of the value in the grid\n\nBased on this, I'll implement a transformation that replaces values in certain positions with other values based on their position.\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation pattern\n    # This is a simple pattern that replaces certain values based on their position\n    # This is a hypothesis based on the examples\n    for i in range(7):\n        for j in range(7):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 8 in certain positions\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Keep 0 in certain positions\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Define the transformation pattern\n    # This is a simple pattern that replaces certain values based on their position\n    # This is a hypothesis based on the examples\n    for i in range(7):\n        for j in range(7):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 8 in certain positions\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 8\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 2\n            elif grid[i][j] == 0:\n                # Keep 0 in certain positions\n                if (i + j) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n                else:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 0\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
