          "content": "After analyzing the training examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with others, particularly 4 \u2192 3, 8 \u2192 8 (unchanged), 2 \u2192 3, and 0 \u2192 0 (unchanged).\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain values are replaced based on their position and context.\n3. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"expansion\" or \"spread\" of values, particularly in the middle of the grid.\n4. The transformation also seems to involve some kind of \"border\" or \"edge\" behavior, where certain values are preserved or modified based on their position relative to the edges.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing 4 with 3 in certain positions\n- Replacing 2 with 3 in certain positions\n- Preserving 8 in all positions\n- Preserving 0 in all positions\n- Expanding certain values in the middle of the grid\n\nHere is my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace 4 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 3 in certain positions\n                if i >= 5 and i <= 25 and j >= 5 and j <= 25:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n                if i >= 5 and i <= 25 and j >= 5 and j <= 25:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace 4 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 3 in certain positions\n                if i >= 5 and i <= 25 and j >= 5 and j <= 25:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n                if i >= 5 and i <= 25 and j >= 5 and j <= 25:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

The transformation seems to involve replacing certain values with others, particularly 4 \u2192 3, 8 \u2192 8 (unchanged), 2 \u2192 3, and 0 \u2192 0 (unchanged).\n2. There appears to be a pattern where certain values are replaced based on their position and context.\n3. The transformation seems to involve some kind of \"expansion\" or \"spread\" of values, particularly in the middle of the grid.\n4. The transformation also seems to involve some kind of \"border\" or \"edge\" behavior, where certain values are preserved or modified based on their position relative to the edges.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves:\n- Replacing 4 with 3 in certain positions\n- Replacing 2 with 3 in certain positions\n- Preserving 8 in all positions\n- Preserving 0 in all positions\n- Expanding certain values in the middle of the grid\n\nHere is my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace 4 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 3 in certain positions\n                if i >= 5 and i <= 25 and j >= 5 and j <= 25:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n                if i >= 5 and i <= 25 and j >= 5 and j <= 25:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Replace 4 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 4:\n                # Replace 4 with 3 in certain positions\n                if i >= 5 and i <= 25 and j >= 5 and j <= 25:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n    for i in range(30):\n        for j in range(30):\n            if grid[i][j] == 2:\n                # Replace 2 with 3 in certain positions\n                if i >= 5 and i <= 25 and j >= 5 and j <= 25:\n                    transformed_grid[i][j] = 3\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
