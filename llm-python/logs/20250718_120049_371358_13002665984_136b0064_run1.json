          "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput is a 7x15 grid (since each line has 15 numbers), and the output is a 7x7 grid. So the transformation is reducing the grid size from 7 rows by 15 columns to 7 rows by 7 columns. But how?\n\nWait, the input for each example seems to be a 7x15 grid. The output is 7x7. So each row in the input is 15 elements, and the output is 7 elements per row. So maybe each output row is derived from some subset of the input columns?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nLet me take the first row of input: 1 1 0 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The output first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. Hmm. The output has 7 elements. Let me check where the 5 comes from. In the input row, the 12th element is 5. So maybe the output is taking specific positions from the input columns. For example, the first output row's 4th element is 5, which is the 12th column in the input. But how does that fit into the pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in the first output row, the 4th element is 5, which is in the input's 12th column. But how do the positions map?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of transformation based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cells in certain positions.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1:\n\nThe output has 7 rows. Let's look at the first output row: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the 4th position. In the input row, the 12th element is 5. So maybe the output is taking the 4th element of the output row as the value from the input's 12th column. But how does that fit into the other rows?\n\nLooking at the second output row: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The first three elements are 0, then 1, 1, 1. In the input's second row, the elements are 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The 4th element is 0, but the output's fourth element is 1. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong positions. Alternatively, perhaps the output is derived from the input's columns in a certain way. For example, maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input, but that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where certain positions in the input are being selected. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cells in specific positions, like the 4th column, 5th, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in example 1, the output's first row has 5 in the 4th position. Looking at the input's first row, the 12th element is 5. But 12 is 15 columns (original input is 15 columns per row). So maybe the output's 4th column is derived from the input's 12th column. But then, how does that fit into the other positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in the first output row, the 4th element is 5, which is in the input's 12th column. But 12th column is the 12th element in the input row. But the output is 7 columns, so maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input. For example, maybe the output is taking columns 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of pattern where the value in the output grid is determined by the input grid's values in certain positions. For example, maybe the output grid is constructed by taking certain positions from the input, but how?\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output:\n\nLet me try to see for the first output row. The output is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the 4th column. In the input's first row, the 12th element is 5. So perhaps the output's 4th column is the 12th column of the input. Then, for the second output row: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 1s are in columns 4,5,6. Looking at the input's second row, the elements are 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 4th element is 0, but the output's 4th element is 1. That doesn't match. Hmm. Maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where the value in the output grid is determined by the input's values in certain positions. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the sum of certain input cells, or the maximum, or some other operation.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the first row has 5 in the 4th column. The input's first row has 5 in the 12th column. The output's 4th column is 5. Maybe there's a mapping between the output's column index and the input's column index. For example, 4th column in output maps to 12th column in input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the input's columns in a certain order. For example, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is from the input's 12th column. Then, the next output row's 4th column is 1. In the input's second row, the 4th element is 0, but the output's 4th element is 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions in the input grid. For example, in example 1, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the 4th position. Maybe that's the value from the input's 12th column, but how does that fit into the rest?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain values from the input's columns. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each row is derived from a specific column in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where the value in the output is determined by the input's values in certain positions. For example, in the first output row, the 4th element is 5, which is in the input's 12th column. Then, for the second output row, the 4th element is 1, which is in the input's 4th column (the input's second row's 4th element is 0, but that's not matching). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input's rows. For example, in example 1, the output's first row has 5 in the 4th column, which is the 12th column of the input. The input's first row is 15 elements. Let's think about the positions. The output has 7 columns. Maybe the output's columns correspond to certain positions in the input's columns. For example, maybe the output's first column is derived from the input's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. columns? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in the first output row, the 5 is in the 4th column of the output. Let's see the input's first row. The 12th column is 5. The output's 4th column is 5. Then, perhaps the output's column index is mapped to the input's column index in some way. For example, 4th column in output corresponds to 12th column in input. Then, maybe the output's column index is (input column index + 8) mod something? Or maybe it's a fixed mapping. For example, 4th column in output is 12th in input. Then, 5th column in output is 13th in input, etc. But that's just a guess.\n\nBut how would that work for the second output row? The second output row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 4th, 5th, 6th columns are 1, 1, 1. Looking at the input's second row: 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The 4th element is 0, 5th is 2, 6th is 0. But the output's 4th, 5th, 6th columns are 1,1,1. That doesn't match. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where the values are taken from certain positions in the input. For example, in example 1, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is from the input's 12th column. Then, in the second row, the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 1s are from the input's 4th, 5th, 6th columns? But the input's second row's 4th column is 0, 5th is 2, 6th is 0. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the maximum value in certain regions of the input. For example, in example 1's first row, the 5 is the maximum in some region. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. Let's take the first output row: 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The 5 is in the second column. In the input's first row, the 5 is in the 5th column (input row is 2 0 2 0 6 0 6 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 0). So the 5 is in the 9th column (since the first row is 15 elements). So the output's second column is 5. So maybe the output's column index is mapped to the input's column index in a way. For example, the output's second column is the 9th column of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the 4th column of the output. The input's first row has 5 in the 12th column. Then, the output's 4th column is the 12th column of the input. Then, for the second output row, the 4th column is 1. Looking at the input's second row, the 4th column is 0, but the output's 4th column is 1. Not matching. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where certain cells are filled with values from the input's cells. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell in a certain position. For example, if the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i, j + some offset). But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a grid where each row is derived from a specific column in the input. For example, the first output row is derived from the 12th column of the input. The second output row is derived from the 4th column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell in a certain position. For example, in example 1, the first output row has 5 in the 4th column. The input's first row has 5 in the 12th column. So maybe the output's column is (input column + 8) mod 15? For example, 12 - 8 = 4. So 4th column in output is 12th in input. Then for the second output row, the 4th column is 1, which is in the input's 4th column (input's second row's 4th element is 0, but that's not matching). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value from the input's columns in a certain pattern. For example, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the 4th column. The input's first row has 5 in the 12th column. Then, the 4th column of the output is the 12th column of the input. Then, the 5th column of the output is the 13th column of the input, and so on. But how does that fit with the other rows?\n\nLooking at example 1's second output row: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 4th, 5th, 6th columns are 1,1,1. So maybe the input's second row's columns 4,5,6 are 0, 2, 0. But the output's 4th,5th,6th columns are 1,1,1. So that doesn't match. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain values from the input's rows. For example, in example 1, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the input's first row's 12th column. The output's second row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 1s are in the input's second row's 4th, 5th, 6th columns. But the input's second row's 4th column is 0, so that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the maximum value in certain regions. For example, the first output row's 4th column is 5, which is the maximum in some region. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation based on the positions of the numbers. For example, if a number is in a certain position in the input, it's copied to the output. But how?\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. Let's take the first output row: 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The 5 is in the 5th column. In the input's first row, the 15th element is 0, but the 5th element is 2. Wait, the input's first row is 2 0 2 0 6 0 6 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So the 11th element is 5. So the output's 5th column is 5. So that's the 11th column of the input. So maybe the output's column is mapped to the input's column in a certain way. For example, output's 5th column is input's 11th column. So 5th column in output is 11th column in input. Then, for example 1's first row, output's 4th column is 12th column in input. For example 3's first row, output's 5th column is 11th column in input. So maybe there's a pattern here. Let's see:\n\nExample 1's first output row: 4th column is 12th input column.\n\nExample 3's first output row: 5th column is 11th input column.\n\nHmm. Not sure. Maybe there's a pattern where the output's column index is input's column index minus some value. For example, 12 - 4 = 8. 11 -5=6. That doesn't seem consistent. Alternatively, maybe the output's column index is related to the input's column index in a way that depends on the row. For example, for row 0, the output's columns are derived from input columns 12, 13, 14, etc. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, for each row in the output, the value is determined by the input's row and column. For example, the output's row i is derived from the input's row i, and the column j is derived from some function of j.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value from the input's column 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. But for example 1's first output row, the 4th column is 5, which is the 12th input column. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input's columns. For example, the output is a grid where each row is the input's row's elements from certain columns. For example, the first output row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the input's 12th column. So maybe the output is taking columns 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input's columns that are in certain positions. For example, in example 1, the first output row's 4th column is 5, which is in the input's 12th column. Then, for the second output row's 4th column is 1, which is in the input's 4th column. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, in the input's second row, the 4th element is 0, but the output's 4th element is 1. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value from the input's column in a certain way. For example, the output's column j is the input's column (some function of j). For example, for j=0, input column is 12; j=1, input column is 13; j=2, input column is 14; j=3, input column is 4; j=4, input column is 5; j=5, input column is 6; j=6, input column is 7. That seems arbitrary, but maybe that's the case.\n\nBut how would that work for example 1's first output row: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 4th column is 5, which is input column 12. Then, the 3rd column is 0, which would be input column 14. Looking at the input's first row, the 14th element is 0. So that's correct. The first column is 0, which is input column 12? No, the first column of output is 0, which would be input column 12? That doesn't fit. Wait, the first column of output is 0, which is input column 12? Or maybe the first column of output is input column 12, the second is 13, third is 14, fourth is 4, fifth is 5, sixth is 6, seventh is 7. That seems arbitrary, but maybe that's the case.\n\nBut how would that work for the second output row? Let's take the second output row: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The fourth column is 1. If the fourth column is input column 4, then in the input's second row, the fourth element is 0, but the output is 1. That doesn't fit. So this approach is not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from certain positions in the input's columns, but based on some pattern. For example, in example 1, the first output row's 4th column is 5, which is from the input's 12th column. The 12th column is the 12th element of the input's row. Then, the output's 4th column is 5. Maybe the output's column is determined by the input's column index in a certain way. For example, the output's column j is the input's column (15 - j - 1) ? Let's see. For example, j=3 (fourth column), 15 - 3 -1 = 11. But input's first row's 11th element is 0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in reverse order. For example, the output's first column is the input's 15th column, second is 14th, etc. But for example 1's first output row, the first column is 0, which is input's 15th column (input's first row's 15th element is 0). The second column is 0 (input's 14th element is 0), third is 0 (input's 13th is 5?), no, the input's first row is [1,1,0,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. So the 13th element is 0, 14th is 0, 15th is 0. So the first output row would be 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. But that doesn't fit. Because if the output is taking the 15th, 14th, 13th, 12th, 11th, 10th, 9th columns of the input, then for the first output row, the values would be 0 (15th), 0 (14th), 0 (13th), 5 (12th), 0 (11th), 0 (10th), 0 (9th). Which matches the first output row: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. Oh! That seems to fit. \n\nSo for the first output row, the output is taking the input's columns 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9. Wait, but that would be 7 columns. So the output row is the input's columns 9 to 15, but in reverse order. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0, then the values are:\n\noutput[0][0] = input[0][15-0-1] = input[0][14] (since 15-0-1=14?), but that's not matching. Wait, maybe the output's columns are the input's columns in reverse order. For example, the output's first column is the input's 15th column, second is input's 14th, third is input's 13th, fourth is input's 12th, fifth is input's 11th, sixth is input's 10th, seventh is input's 9th. \n\nSo for the first output row:\n\ninput's columns 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9.\n\nLooking at the input's first row:\n\ncolumns 9: 0 (input[0][9] is 0?), let's check:\n\nThe first row of input is:\n\n1 1 0 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0.\n\nSo indexes are 0 to 14. Let's list them:\n\nindex 0: 1\n\nindex 1: 1\n\nindex 2: 0\n\nindex 3: 0\n\nindex 4: 2\n\nindex 5: 0\n\nindex 6: 2\n\nindex 7: 4\n\nindex 8: 0\n\nindex 9: 0\n\nindex 10: 0\n\nindex 11: 5\n\nindex 12: 0\n\nindex 13: 0\n\nindex 14: 0\n\nSo for the output's first row, the values would be:\n\noutput[0][0] = input[0][14] = 0\n\noutput[0][1] = input[0][13] = 0\n\noutput[0][2] = input[0][12] = 0\n\noutput[0][3] = input[0][11] = 5\n\noutput[0][4] = input[0][10] = 0\n\noutput[0][5] = input[0][9] = 0\n\noutput[0][6] = input[0][8] = 0\n\nWhich gives the output row [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], which matches example 1's first output row. \n\nThat seems to work! Let's check the second output row of example 1. The output row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0.\n\nThe input's second row is:\n\n1 0 1 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nSo the input's columns 14,13,12,11,10,9,8:\n\ninput[1][14] = 0\n\ninput[1][13] = 0\n\ninput[1][12] = 0\n\ninput[1][11] = 0\n\ninput[1][10] = 0\n\ninput[1][9] = 0\n\ninput[1][8] = 0\n\nBut the output row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. That doesn't match. Wait, that's a problem. So this approach works for the first row but not for the second. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the pattern. Maybe the output's columns are not simply the input's columns in reverse order. Let's check example 1's second output row. The output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. Let's see what's happening here.\n\nLooking at the input's second row: [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nIf the output's second row is derived from the input's columns 14,13,12,11,10,9,8, then the values would be 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. But the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So that doesn't fit. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at the output of example 1's second row. The output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 1s are in columns 3,4,5 of the output. So maybe the input's columns 4,5,6,7, etc. are being taken. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input, but for each row, the columns taken are different. For example, for the first row, columns 9-15 are taken in reverse order. For the second row, columns 4-10 are taken in reverse order. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input, but based on the row index. For example, for row i, the output's columns are taken from the input's columns starting at some position based on i. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nFirst output row: columns 9-15 (input's columns 9 to 15, reversed).\n\nSecond output row: columns 4-10 (input's columns 4 to 10, reversed?).\n\nLet's check. For the second output row, the values are 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. If the input's columns 4 to 10 are taken in reverse order, that would be columns 10,9,8,7,6,5,4.\n\nLooking at the input's second row:\n\ncolumns 4 is 2, 5 is 0, 6 is 2, 7 is 4, 8 is 0, 9 is 0, 10 is 0.\n\nSo reversed columns 4-10 would be 0 (10), 0 (9), 0 (8), 4 (7), 2 (6), 0 (5), 2 (4). So the output would be [0,0,0,4,2,0,2]. But the actual output is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input. For example, for the second output row, the 1s are in columns 3-5. Looking at the input's second row, maybe the values in columns 4,5,6 are 0, 2, 0. But the output's 3-5 columns are 1,1,1. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at other examples to find a pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. Let's take the first output row: 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The 5 is in the second column. In the input's first row, the 5 is in the 9th column (input row is 2 0 2 0 6 0 6 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 0). So the 9th column is 5. If the output's second column is the input's 9th column, then for the first output row, the columns are 0 (input's 15th), 5 (input's 9th), 0 (input's 8th?), etc. But that doesn't fit with the previous pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input, but for each row, the columns are different. For example, the first row takes columns 9-15, the second row takes columns 4-10, the third row takes columns 3-9, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain pattern, but the pattern varies per row. For example, for each row, the output is derived from a certain range of columns in the input. For example, for row i, the output is derived from input columns (i + 4) to (i + 10), but this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns that are in certain positions based on the row. For example, for row 0, the output is derived from columns 9-15. For row 1, from columns 4-10. For row 2, from columns 3-9. For row 3, from columns 3-9. For row 4, from columns 5-11. For row 5, from columns 5-11. For row 6, from columns 5-11. But this is just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: columns 9-15 (input's columns 9-15, reversed).\n\nRow 1: columns 4-10 (input's columns 4-10, reversed).\n\nRow 2: columns 3-9 (input's columns 3-9, reversed).\n\nRow 3: columns 3-9 (input's columns 3-9, reversed).\n\nRow 4: columns 5-11 (input's columns 5-11, reversed).\n\nRow 5: columns 5-11 (input's columns 5-11, reversed).\n\nRow 6: columns 5-11 (input's columns 5-11, reversed).\n\nBut how would that fit with the output rows?\n\nFor example, row 1's output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. Let's see if that's derived from input's columns 4-10 in reverse order.\n\nInput's row 1 is [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nColumns 4-10 are: 2 (index 4), 0 (5), 2 (6), 4 (7), 0 (8), 0 (9), 0 (10). Reversed, that would be 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2. So the output row would be [0,0,0,4,2,0,2], but the actual output is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. This is not working. Maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain values from the input, but not the entire column. For example, for each output cell, it's the value of the input's cell in a certain position, but the position depends on the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value from the input's cell in a certain position, but that position is determined by the output's position. For example, for output cell (i,j), it's the input's cell (i, j + some offset).\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cell (i, j) where j is in a certain range, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the output of example 1 and see what's happening in the other rows.\n\nFor example 1's second output row: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 1s are in columns 3,4,5. Let's look at the input's second row. The input's second row is [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So columns 3 is 0, 4 is 2, 5 is 0. So where do the 1s come from?\n\nMaybe the 1s are from the input's cells in certain positions. For example, maybe the output's 3rd column is 1, which is from the input's 2nd row, 2nd column (value 1). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value from the input's cell in a certain pattern, like the value is the maximum of certain cells in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value from the input's cell in a certain position, but the position depends on the row and column. For example, for the output's row i, column j, the input's cell is at row i, column (some function of j).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain way, but the pattern varies for each row. For example, the first row takes columns 9-15, the second row takes columns 4-10, the third row takes columns 3-9, the fourth row takes columns 3-9, the fifth row takes columns 5-11, etc. But how does that fit with the output?\n\nLet's try for example 1's second output row. If the input's columns 4-10 are taken in reverse order, the output would be 0,0,0,4,2,0,2. But the actual output is 0,0,0,1,1,1,0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the pattern is not based on columns, but on some other transformation. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell in a certain position, but the position is determined by some rule.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first output row has 5 in the 4th column. The input's first row has 5 in the 12th column. So 4th column of output is 12th column of input. For the second output row, the 4th column is 1, which is in the input's second row's 4th column? No, input's second row's 4th column is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value from the input's cell in a certain position, but the position is determined by the output's position. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i, j + 8). Let's check for example 1's first output row. j=3 (4th column), input's j=3+8=11. Input's first row, column 11 is 5. Which matches. For j=4, input's column 12 is 0. But the output's j=4 is 0. Which matches. So for the first output row, this seems to work.\n\nFor the second output row, j=3: input's column 3+8=11. Input's second row, column 11 is 0. But the output's j=3 is 1. So that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, maybe the offset is different. For example, for the first row, the offset is 8, but for other rows, it's different. For example, for the second row, the offset is 4. So for j=3, input's column 3 + 4 =7. Input's second row, column 7 is 4. But the output's j=3 is 1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the offset is 8 for the first row, but for other rows, it's 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the offset is 8 for the first row, but for other rows, it's 4. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cell at (i, j + 8) for the first row, and for other rows, it's (i, j + 4). Let's see for example 1's second output row. j=3: 3 +4=7. Input's second row's column 7 is 4. But the output is 1. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. Let's take the first output row: 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The 5 is in the 5th column of the output. In the input's first row, the 11th column is 5. So input's column 11 is 5. So for output's 5th column, it's input's 11th column. So 5th column in output is 11th in input. So for the first output row, the output's column j is input's column (j + 6). Because 5 +6 =11. For j=0, input's column 0+6=6. But in the first output row, j=0 is 0, which is input's column 6. Let's check:\n\nInput's first row: columns 0-14. For j=0 in output, input's column 6 is 2. But the output's j=0 is 0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's column j is input's column (15 - j - 1) for the first row. For j=0, 15-0-1=14. input's column 14 is 0. Which matches the first output row's j=0. For j=1, 15-1-1=13: input's column 13 is 0. Output's j=1 is 0. For j=2: 15-2-1=12: input's column 12 is 0. Output's j=2 is 0. For j=3: 15-3-1=11: input's column 11 is 5. Output's j=3 is 5. Wait, but the first output row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So j=3 is 5. So that fits. For j=4: 15-4-1=10: input's column 10 is 0. Output's j=4 is 0. For j=5: 15-5-1=9: input's column 9 is 0. Output's j=5 is 0. For j=6: 15-6-1=8: input's column 8 is 0. Output's j=6 is 0. So this fits the first output row.\n\nSo for the first output row, the output's column j is input's column (15 - j - 1) = 14 - j. So for j=0 to 6, the output's column j is input's column 14-j.\n\nThis seems to work for the first output row of example 1. Let's check the second output row of example 1. The second output row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. Let's see if this pattern holds. For j=0, input's column 14-0=14: input's second row's column 14 is 0. Output's j=0 is 0. For j=1: input's column 13: 0. Output's j=1 is 0. For j=2: input's column 12: 0. Output's j=2 is 0. For j=3: input's column 11: 0. Output's j=3 is 1. So this doesn't fit. So the pattern works for the first row but not for the second.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a different pattern for other rows. For example, for the second output row, maybe the input's column is 15 - j - 1 - some value. Or maybe the pattern varies per row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's column 14 - j for the first row, but for other rows, it's different. For example, for the second row, it's taking input's column 10 - j. Let's see:\n\nFor j=3, input's column 10-3=7. Input's second row's column 7 is 4. Output's j=3 is 1. No match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for the second row, the input's column is 10 - j. For j=3, 10-3=7. Input's column 7 is 4. Output's j=3 is 1. Not matching.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe the pattern is different for each row. For example, the first row takes columns 14-j, the second row takes columns 10-j, the third row takes columns 9-j, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's column (15 - j - 1) for the first row, but for other rows, it's taking a different column. For example, for the second row, it's taking the input's column (15 - j - 1 - 4). But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain way, but for each row, the starting column is different. For example, the first row starts at column 9, the second row starts at column 4, the third row starts at column 3, etc. But how?\n\nFor example, in example 1's first output row, the starting column is 9, and the columns taken are 9,10,11,12,13,14,15 (but that's 7 columns). Wait, but the input has 15 columns. So for the first row, the output is taking columns 9-15 (7 columns), but in reverse order. For the second row, it's taking columns 4-10 (7 columns), in reverse order. For the third row, columns 3-9, in reverse order. For the fourth row, same as third. For the fifth row, columns 5-11, in reverse order. For the sixth row, same as fifth. For the seventh row, same as fifth.\n\nLet's check for example 1's second output row. The input's second row is [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Columns 4-10 are: 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. Reversed, this is 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2. But the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this doesn't match. So this approach is not working.\n\nBut what if the output is not taking the entire column range, but only certain parts? For example, for the second output row, the 1s are in columns 3-5. Let's see if there's a pattern there. Maybe the 1s are from the input's cells where the value is 1. For example, in the input's second row, the 1s are at columns 0, 2. So maybe the output is taking those values, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells where the value is non-zero and placing them in the output. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the output of example 1's third row: 0 0 0 0 0 6 0. The 6 is in the 6th column of the output. In the input's third row, the input is 0 1 0 0 2 2 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 6th column of the input is 2. But the output's 6th column is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in certain positions, but the value is the sum of certain cells. For example, the output's cell is the sum of the input's cells in certain positions. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in certain positions and then applying some transformation like taking the maximum, minimum, or average. For example, in the first output row, the 5 is the maximum in some region.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nLet me try to think of another approach. Since the output is 7x7, and the input is 7x15, maybe each output row is derived from a specific subset of the input's columns. For example, each output row is derived from a specific range of the input's columns, and the range varies per row. For example, the first row takes columns 9-15 (7 columns), the second row takes columns 4-10, the third row takes columns 3-9, the fourth row takes columns 3-9, the fifth row takes columns 5-11, the sixth row takes columns 5-11, the seventh row takes columns 5-11.\n\nLet's check this for example 1's second output row. The input's second row is [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Columns 4-10 are 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. Reversed, this gives 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2. But the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe the output is not taking the entire range, but only certain parts. For example, for the second output row, the 1s are in columns 3-5, which are 0, 2, 0. So where do the 1s come from? Maybe it's the input's cells in certain positions, like the input's row i, column j, where j is in a certain range, and the value is taken from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain way, but the value is not directly taken from the input, but transformed. For example, the output's cell is the input's cell if it's non-zero, or zero otherwise. But that doesn't fit with the first example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cell at (i, j + 8) for the first row, but for other rows, it's different. For example, for the first row, j + 8, for the second row, j + 4, etc. Let's try:\n\nFor example 1's second output row, j=3: 3 + 4 =7. Input's second row, column 7 is 4. Output's j=3 is 1. Not matching.\n\nThis is not working. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me look at the test input and see if I can find any patterns. The test input is 7 rows of 15 elements each. The output is 7x7. So the same pattern as the training examples.\n\nBut without knowing the correct output, it's hard to find the pattern. Maybe the pattern is that each output cell is the input's cell at (i, j + 8) for the first row, but for other rows, it's different. Or maybe it's a different offset.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain way, but the pattern is that for each row, the output is derived from the input's columns in a certain range, and the range is determined by the row's index. For example, for row i, the output is derived from input's columns (i + 4) to (i + 10), but this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain way, but the pattern is that for each output row, the columns are taken from the input's columns that are in certain positions. For example, for row 0, columns 9-15; for row 1, columns 4-10; for row 2, columns 3-9; for row 3, columns 3-9; for row 4, columns 5-11; for row 5, columns 5-11; for row 6, columns 5-11.\n\nLet's try this for example 1's second output row. Columns 4-10 in input's second row are 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. Reversed, this gives 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2. But the actual output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this doesn't match. But maybe the values are being transformed in some way, like taking the maximum of certain values or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in the specified range, but replacing certain values. For example, in the second output row, the input's columns 4-10 are 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. But the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So perhaps the 2 and 4 are being replaced with 1. But why?\n\nThis is not helpful. I'm not seeing the pattern. Maybe I should try to think of the output as a grid where each cell is the input's cell at a certain position, but the position is determined by the row and column.\n\nFor example, for output cell (i,j), it's the input's cell (i, j + 8) for the first row, and (i, j + 4) for other rows. Let's try this for example 1's second output row. For j=3, input's column 3 +4 =7. Input's second row, column 7 is 4. Output's j=3 is 1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the input's cell (i, j + 8) for the first row, and (i, j + 6) for other rows. For j=3, 3+6=9. Input's second row, column 9 is 0. Output's j=3 is 1. No.\n\nThis is not working. I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think of the output as a grid where each cell is the input's cell at (i, j + 8) for the first row, and for other rows, it's (i, j + 4). But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find the pattern, perhaps I should try to write a function that takes the input and for each output row, takes the input's columns in a certain way, like for the first row, columns 9-15, for the second row, columns 4-10, etc., and see if that fits any of the examples.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the first output row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0, which is input's columns 9-15 reversed. The second output row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0, which would be input's columns 4-10 reversed. But the input's second row's columns 4-10 are 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. Reversed, it's 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2. But the actual output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this doesn't match. So this approach is not correct.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each output row, the columns are taken from the input's columns in a certain way, but the values are transformed. For example, the output is taking the input's columns, but replacing certain values with 1 or 0. But this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the first example, the first output row is derived from input's columns 9-15 reversed. The second output row might be derived from input's columns 4-10, but with some transformation. For example, maybe the values are taken from the input's columns 4-10, but only if they are non-zero, and 0 otherwise. But in the second output row, the input's columns 4-10 are 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. So if we take non-zero values, it would be 2, 2, 4, but that doesn't fit the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain way, but the values are replaced with 1 if they are 2 or higher, and 0 otherwise. For the second output row, input's columns 4-10 are 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. Replaced with 1 for 2 or higher, it would be 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0. But the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain way, but the values are replaced with 1 if they are 1 or higher, and 0 otherwise. For the second output row, input's columns 4-10 are 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. Replaced with 1 for 2 or higher, it would be 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0. Still not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Given that, I'll have to make a guess based on the first example's first row, and assume that for each output row, the columns are taken from the input's columns in a certain range, and the range is determined by the row index.\n\nFor example, for row i, the output is derived from input's columns (i + 4) to (i + 10), but this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's try to write a function that for each output row, takes the input's columns from a certain range and reverses them.\n\nFor example, for row 0, columns 9-15 (7 columns), reversed.\n\nFor row 1, columns 4-10, reversed.\n\nFor row 2, columns 3-9, reversed.\n\nFor row 3, columns 3-9, reversed.\n\nFor row 4, columns 5-11, reversed.\n\nFor row 5, columns 5-11, reversed.\n\nFor row 6, columns 5-11, reversed.\n\nThis is based on the first example. Let's see if this works for example 1's second output row. For row 1, columns 4-10 are 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. Reversed, it's 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2. But the actual output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this doesn't match. But maybe the values are being transformed in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the values are being replaced with 1 if they are 2 or higher, and 0 otherwise. For the reversed columns, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2 would become 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1. But the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this is close but not quite.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this approach, assuming that the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain range and reversing them, and then replacing values with 1 if they are 2 or higher, and 0 otherwise.\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's try to write the code.\n\nFor each row i in 0-6:\n\n- Determine the range of input columns to take.\n\n- Take those columns, reverse them.\n\n- Replace each value with 1 if it's 2 or higher, else 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nFor example 1's second output row:\n\nInput's columns 4-10 are [2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0]. Reversed: [0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2]. Replace with 1 if >=2: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]. But the actual output is [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]. So this is close but not exactly.\n\nMaybe the replacement is 1 if the value is 1 or higher, else 0. For the reversed columns [0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2], this would be [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], which is still not matching.\n\nBut the actual output is [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]. So the last element is 0, but according to this, it would be 1. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is 1 if the value is 1 or higher, and 0 otherwise. For the reversed columns [0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2], this would be [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], but the actual output is [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]. So this is not matching.\n\nThis is not working. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the initial approach of taking the input's columns in a certain range and reversing them, and assume that the transformation is that.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row i in 0-6:\n\n- Determine the starting column for the input.\n\n- Take the input's columns from start to start+6 (since 7 columns).\n\n- Reverse the list.\n\n- Assign to the output row.\n\nBut how to determine the start column for each row?\n\nBased on example 1:\n\nRow 0: start = 9\n\nRow 1: start = 4\n\nRow 2: start = 3\n\nRow 3: start = 3\n\nRow 4: start = 5\n\nRow 5: start = 5\n\nRow 6: start = 5\n\nSo for row i, the start column is:\n\ni=0: 9\n\ni=1: 4\n\ni=2: 3\n\ni=3: 3\n\ni=4: 5\n\ni=5: 5\n\ni=6: 5\n\nThis seems arbitrary, but it's based on the first example.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*7 for _ in range(7)]\n    for i in range(7):\n        if i == 0:\n            start_col = 9\n        elif i == 1:\n            start_col = 4\n        elif i == 2 or i == 3:\n            start_col = 3\n        elif i == 4 or i == 5 or i == 6:\n            start_col = 5\n        # take columns from start_col to start_col + 6 (inclusive), then reverse\n        input_cols = grid[i][start_col:start_col+7]\n        output_row = input_cols[::-1]\n        for j in range(7):\n            output[i][j] = output_row[j]\n    return output\n\nBut this is based on the first example, and may not work for other examples. For example, in example 2, let's check.\n\nExample 2's input is a 7x15 grid. Let's take the first output row: 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. According to the code, for i=0, start_col=9. The input's first row is:\n\n2 0 2 0 6 0 6 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nColumns 9-15 are [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Reversed, it's [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]. But the actual output is [0,5,0,0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't match. So the code is not correct.\n\nBut in example 2's first output row, the 5 is in the second column. So according to the code, it should be in the 7th column of the reversed list. But the code would have it in the 7th position, which is the first element of the reversed list.\n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nGiven that, I'm not able to find the correct pattern. But I need to write a function. Based on the first example's first row, the code takes columns 9-15 and reverses them. For the first example's second row, it's not working, but perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 4-10, but for the first example's second row, the values are transformed in some way. For example, the 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0 are replaced with 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, but the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm forced to make an educated guess. Based on the first example, the first output row is derived from input's columns 9-15 reversed. For other rows, perhaps the pattern is similar, but with different starting columns. So I'll proceed with this approach, even if it doesn't work for all examples.\n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*7 for _ in range(7)]\n    for i in range(7):\n        if i == 0:\n            start = 9\n        elif i == 1:\n            start = 4\n        elif i == 2 or i == 3:\n            start = 3\n        elif i == 4 or i == 5 or i == 6:\n            start = 5\n        # take columns from start to start+6 (7 columns)\n        input_cols = grid[i][start:start+7]\n        output_row = input_cols[::-1]\n        for j in range(7):\n            output[i][j] = output_row[j]\n    return output\n\nBut this may not work for all examples, but it's the best I can do based on the first example.\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, let's try to figure out the pattern here. I need to look at the training examples and see what's happening between the input and output grids. \n\nLooking at Example 1:\n\nInput is a 7x15 grid (since each line has 15 numbers), and the output is a 7x7 grid. So the transformation is reducing the grid size from 7 rows by 15 columns to 7 rows by 7 columns. But how?\n\nWait, the input for each example seems to be a 7x15 grid. The output is 7x7. So each row in the input is 15 elements, and the output is 7 elements per row. So maybe each output row is derived from some subset of the input columns?\n\nLooking at Example 1's input and output:\n\nLet me take the first row of input: 1 1 0 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The output first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. Hmm. The output has 7 elements. Let me check where the 5 comes from. In the input row, the 12th element is 5. So maybe the output is taking specific positions from the input columns. For example, the first output row's 4th element is 5, which is the 12th column in the input. But how does that fit into the pattern?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in the first output row, the 4th element is 5, which is in the input's 12th column. But how do the positions map?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of transformation based on the positions of certain numbers. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cells in certain positions.\n\nLooking at the output of example 1:\n\nThe output has 7 rows. Let's look at the first output row: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the 4th position. In the input row, the 12th element is 5. So maybe the output is taking the 4th element of the output row as the value from the input's 12th column. But how does that fit into the other rows?\n\nLooking at the second output row: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The first three elements are 0, then 1, 1, 1. In the input's second row, the elements are 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The 4th element is 0, but the output's fourth element is 1. Wait, maybe I'm looking at the wrong positions. Alternatively, perhaps the output is derived from the input's columns in a certain way. For example, maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input, but that seems unclear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where certain positions in the input are being selected. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by the input's cells in specific positions, like the 4th column, 5th, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in example 1, the output's first row has 5 in the 4th position. Looking at the input's first row, the 12th element is 5. But 12 is 15 columns (original input is 15 columns per row). So maybe the output's 4th column is derived from the input's 12th column. But then, how does that fit into the other positions?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in the first output row, the 4th element is 5, which is in the input's 12th column. But 12th column is the 12th element in the input row. But the output is 7 columns, so maybe the output is taking certain columns from the input. For example, maybe the output is taking columns 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, etc. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by some kind of pattern where the value in the output grid is determined by the input grid's values in certain positions. For example, maybe the output grid is constructed by taking certain positions from the input, but how?\n\nLooking at example 1's input and output:\n\nLet me try to see for the first output row. The output is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the 4th column. In the input's first row, the 12th element is 5. So perhaps the output's 4th column is the 12th column of the input. Then, for the second output row: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 1s are in columns 4,5,6. Looking at the input's second row, the elements are 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 4th element is 0, but the output's 4th element is 1. That doesn't match. Hmm. Maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation where the value in the output grid is determined by the input's values in certain positions. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the sum of certain input cells, or the maximum, or some other operation.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of example 1, the first row has 5 in the 4th column. The input's first row has 5 in the 12th column. The output's 4th column is 5. Maybe there's a mapping between the output's column index and the input's column index. For example, 4th column in output maps to 12th column in input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking the input's columns in a certain order. For example, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is from the input's 12th column. Then, the next output row's 4th column is 1. In the input's second row, the 4th element is 0, but the output's 4th element is 1. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions in the input grid. For example, in example 1, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the 4th position. Maybe that's the value from the input's 12th column, but how does that fit into the rest?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain values from the input's columns. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each row is derived from a specific column in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where the value in the output is determined by the input's values in certain positions. For example, in the first output row, the 4th element is 5, which is in the input's 12th column. Then, for the second output row, the 4th element is 1, which is in the input's 4th column (the input's second row's 4th element is 0, but that's not matching). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input's rows. For example, in example 1, the output's first row has 5 in the 4th column, which is the 12th column of the input. The input's first row is 15 elements. Let's think about the positions. The output has 7 columns. Maybe the output's columns correspond to certain positions in the input's columns. For example, maybe the output's first column is derived from the input's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc. columns? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in the first output row, the 5 is in the 4th column of the output. Let's see the input's first row. The 12th column is 5. The output's 4th column is 5. Then, perhaps the output's column index is mapped to the input's column index in some way. For example, 4th column in output corresponds to 12th column in input. Then, maybe the output's column index is (input column index + 8) mod something? Or maybe it's a fixed mapping. For example, 4th column in output is 12th in input. Then, 5th column in output is 13th in input, etc. But that's just a guess.\n\nBut how would that work for the second output row? The second output row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 4th, 5th, 6th columns are 1, 1, 1. Looking at the input's second row: 1 0 1 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The 4th element is 0, 5th is 2, 6th is 0. But the output's 4th, 5th, 6th columns are 1,1,1. That doesn't match. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where the values are taken from certain positions in the input. For example, in example 1, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is from the input's 12th column. Then, in the second row, the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 1s are from the input's 4th, 5th, 6th columns? But the input's second row's 4th column is 0, 5th is 2, 6th is 0. Not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the maximum value in certain regions of the input. For example, in example 1's first row, the 5 is the maximum in some region. But that's not clear.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. Let's take the first output row: 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The 5 is in the second column. In the input's first row, the 5 is in the 5th column (input row is 2 0 2 0 6 0 6 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 0). So the 5 is in the 9th column (since the first row is 15 elements). So the output's second column is 5. So maybe the output's column index is mapped to the input's column index in a way. For example, the output's second column is the 9th column of the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is constructed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the 4th column of the output. The input's first row has 5 in the 12th column. Then, the output's 4th column is the 12th column of the input. Then, for the second output row, the 4th column is 1. Looking at the input's second row, the 4th column is 0, but the output's 4th column is 1. Not matching. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of pattern where certain cells are filled with values from the input's cells. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell in a certain position. For example, if the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i, j + some offset). But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is a grid where each row is derived from a specific column in the input. For example, the first output row is derived from the 12th column of the input. The second output row is derived from the 4th column. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value from the input's cell in a certain position. For example, in example 1, the first output row has 5 in the 4th column. The input's first row has 5 in the 12th column. So maybe the output's column is (input column + 8) mod 15? For example, 12 - 8 = 4. So 4th column in output is 12th in input. Then for the second output row, the 4th column is 1, which is in the input's 4th column (input's second row's 4th element is 0, but that's not matching). Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value from the input's columns in a certain pattern. For example, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the 4th column. The input's first row has 5 in the 12th column. Then, the 4th column of the output is the 12th column of the input. Then, the 5th column of the output is the 13th column of the input, and so on. But how does that fit with the other rows?\n\nLooking at example 1's second output row: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 4th, 5th, 6th columns are 1,1,1. So maybe the input's second row's columns 4,5,6 are 0, 2, 0. But the output's 4th,5th,6th columns are 1,1,1. So that doesn't match. So maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain values from the input's rows. For example, in example 1, the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the input's first row's 12th column. The output's second row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 1s are in the input's second row's 4th, 5th, 6th columns. But the input's second row's 4th column is 0, so that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the maximum value in certain regions. For example, the first output row's 4th column is 5, which is the maximum in some region. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by some kind of transformation based on the positions of the numbers. For example, if a number is in a certain position in the input, it's copied to the output. But how?\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. Let's take the first output row: 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The 5 is in the 5th column. In the input's first row, the 15th element is 0, but the 5th element is 2. Wait, the input's first row is 2 0 2 0 6 0 6 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So the 11th element is 5. So the output's 5th column is 5. So that's the 11th column of the input. So maybe the output's column is mapped to the input's column in a certain way. For example, output's 5th column is input's 11th column. So 5th column in output is 11th column in input. Then, for example 1's first row, output's 4th column is 12th column in input. For example 3's first row, output's 5th column is 11th column in input. So maybe there's a pattern here. Let's see:\n\nExample 1's first output row: 4th column is 12th input column.\n\nExample 3's first output row: 5th column is 11th input column.\n\nHmm. Not sure. Maybe there's a pattern where the output's column index is input's column index minus some value. For example, 12 - 4 = 8. 11 -5=6. That doesn't seem consistent. Alternatively, maybe the output's column index is related to the input's column index in a way that depends on the row. For example, for row 0, the output's columns are derived from input columns 12, 13, 14, etc. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input. For example, for each row in the output, the value is determined by the input's row and column. For example, the output's row i is derived from the input's row i, and the column j is derived from some function of j.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value from the input's column 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. But for example 1's first output row, the 4th column is 5, which is the 12th input column. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain positions from the input's columns. For example, the output is a grid where each row is the input's row's elements from certain columns. For example, the first output row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 5 is in the input's 12th column. So maybe the output is taking columns 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, but that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from the input's columns that are in certain positions. For example, in example 1, the first output row's 4th column is 5, which is in the input's 12th column. Then, for the second output row's 4th column is 1, which is in the input's 4th column. But that doesn't make sense. Wait, in the input's second row, the 4th element is 0, but the output's 4th element is 1. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value from the input's column in a certain way. For example, the output's column j is the input's column (some function of j). For example, for j=0, input column is 12; j=1, input column is 13; j=2, input column is 14; j=3, input column is 4; j=4, input column is 5; j=5, input column is 6; j=6, input column is 7. That seems arbitrary, but maybe that's the case.\n\nBut how would that work for example 1's first output row: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. The 4th column is 5, which is input column 12. Then, the 3rd column is 0, which would be input column 14. Looking at the input's first row, the 14th element is 0. So that's correct. The first column is 0, which is input column 12? No, the first column of output is 0, which would be input column 12? That doesn't fit. Wait, the first column of output is 0, which is input column 12? Or maybe the first column of output is input column 12, the second is 13, third is 14, fourth is 4, fifth is 5, sixth is 6, seventh is 7. That seems arbitrary, but maybe that's the case.\n\nBut how would that work for the second output row? Let's take the second output row: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The fourth column is 1. If the fourth column is input column 4, then in the input's second row, the fourth element is 0, but the output is 1. That doesn't fit. So this approach is not working.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the values from certain positions in the input's columns, but based on some pattern. For example, in example 1, the first output row's 4th column is 5, which is from the input's 12th column. The 12th column is the 12th element of the input's row. Then, the output's 4th column is 5. Maybe the output's column is determined by the input's column index in a certain way. For example, the output's column j is the input's column (15 - j - 1) ? Let's see. For example, j=3 (fourth column), 15 - 3 -1 = 11. But input's first row's 11th element is 0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in reverse order. For example, the output's first column is the input's 15th column, second is 14th, etc. But for example 1's first output row, the first column is 0, which is input's 15th column (input's first row's 15th element is 0). The second column is 0 (input's 14th element is 0), third is 0 (input's 13th is 5?), no, the input's first row is [1,1,0,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,5,0,0,0]. So the 13th element is 0, 14th is 0, 15th is 0. So the first output row would be 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. But that doesn't fit. Because if the output is taking the 15th, 14th, 13th, 12th, 11th, 10th, 9th columns of the input, then for the first output row, the values would be 0 (15th), 0 (14th), 0 (13th), 5 (12th), 0 (11th), 0 (10th), 0 (9th). Which matches the first output row: 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. Oh! That seems to fit. \n\nSo for the first output row, the output is taking the input's columns 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9. Wait, but that would be 7 columns. So the output row is the input's columns 9 to 15, but in reverse order. Wait, let's see:\n\nIf the output's first row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0, then the values are:\n\noutput[0][0] = input[0][15-0-1] = input[0][14] (since 15-0-1=14?), but that's not matching. Wait, maybe the output's columns are the input's columns in reverse order. For example, the output's first column is the input's 15th column, second is input's 14th, third is input's 13th, fourth is input's 12th, fifth is input's 11th, sixth is input's 10th, seventh is input's 9th. \n\nSo for the first output row:\n\ninput's columns 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9.\n\nLooking at the input's first row:\n\ncolumns 9: 0 (input[0][9] is 0?), let's check:\n\nThe first row of input is:\n\n1 1 0 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0.\n\nSo indexes are 0 to 14. Let's list them:\n\nindex 0: 1\n\nindex 1: 1\n\nindex 2: 0\n\nindex 3: 0\n\nindex 4: 2\n\nindex 5: 0\n\nindex 6: 2\n\nindex 7: 4\n\nindex 8: 0\n\nindex 9: 0\n\nindex 10: 0\n\nindex 11: 5\n\nindex 12: 0\n\nindex 13: 0\n\nindex 14: 0\n\nSo for the output's first row, the values would be:\n\noutput[0][0] = input[0][14] = 0\n\noutput[0][1] = input[0][13] = 0\n\noutput[0][2] = input[0][12] = 0\n\noutput[0][3] = input[0][11] = 5\n\noutput[0][4] = input[0][10] = 0\n\noutput[0][5] = input[0][9] = 0\n\noutput[0][6] = input[0][8] = 0\n\nWhich gives the output row [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0], which matches example 1's first output row. \n\nThat seems to work! Let's check the second output row of example 1. The output row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0.\n\nThe input's second row is:\n\n1 0 1 0 2 0 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nSo the input's columns 14,13,12,11,10,9,8:\n\ninput[1][14] = 0\n\ninput[1][13] = 0\n\ninput[1][12] = 0\n\ninput[1][11] = 0\n\ninput[1][10] = 0\n\ninput[1][9] = 0\n\ninput[1][8] = 0\n\nBut the output row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. That doesn't match. Wait, that's a problem. So this approach works for the first row but not for the second. So what's wrong here?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the pattern. Maybe the output's columns are not simply the input's columns in reverse order. Let's check example 1's second output row. The output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. Let's see what's happening here.\n\nLooking at the input's second row: [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nIf the output's second row is derived from the input's columns 14,13,12,11,10,9,8, then the values would be 0,0,0,0,0,0,0. But the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So that doesn't fit. So this approach is not correct.\n\nHmm. Maybe there's another pattern. Let's look at the output of example 1's second row. The output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 1s are in columns 3,4,5 of the output. So maybe the input's columns 4,5,6,7, etc. are being taken. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input, but for each row, the columns taken are different. For example, for the first row, columns 9-15 are taken in reverse order. For the second row, columns 4-10 are taken in reverse order. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input, but based on the row index. For example, for row i, the output's columns are taken from the input's columns starting at some position based on i. But how?\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nFirst output row: columns 9-15 (input's columns 9 to 15, reversed).\n\nSecond output row: columns 4-10 (input's columns 4 to 10, reversed?).\n\nLet's check. For the second output row, the values are 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. If the input's columns 4 to 10 are taken in reverse order, that would be columns 10,9,8,7,6,5,4.\n\nLooking at the input's second row:\n\ncolumns 4 is 2, 5 is 0, 6 is 2, 7 is 4, 8 is 0, 9 is 0, 10 is 0.\n\nSo reversed columns 4-10 would be 0 (10), 0 (9), 0 (8), 4 (7), 2 (6), 0 (5), 2 (4). So the output would be [0,0,0,4,2,0,2]. But the actual output is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is taking certain positions from the input. For example, for the second output row, the 1s are in columns 3-5. Looking at the input's second row, maybe the values in columns 4,5,6 are 0, 2, 0. But the output's 3-5 columns are 1,1,1. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look at other examples to find a pattern.\n\nLooking at example 2's input and output. Let's take the first output row: 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. The 5 is in the second column. In the input's first row, the 5 is in the 9th column (input row is 2 0 2 0 6 0 6 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 0). So the 9th column is 5. If the output's second column is the input's 9th column, then for the first output row, the columns are 0 (input's 15th), 5 (input's 9th), 0 (input's 8th?), etc. But that doesn't fit with the previous pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain columns from the input, but for each row, the columns are different. For example, the first row takes columns 9-15, the second row takes columns 4-10, the third row takes columns 3-9, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain pattern, but the pattern varies per row. For example, for each row, the output is derived from a certain range of columns in the input. For example, for row i, the output is derived from input columns (i + 4) to (i + 10), but this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns that are in certain positions based on the row. For example, for row 0, the output is derived from columns 9-15. For row 1, from columns 4-10. For row 2, from columns 3-9. For row 3, from columns 3-9. For row 4, from columns 5-11. For row 5, from columns 5-11. For row 6, from columns 5-11. But this is just a guess.\n\nLooking at example 1's output:\n\nRow 0: columns 9-15 (input's columns 9-15, reversed).\n\nRow 1: columns 4-10 (input's columns 4-10, reversed).\n\nRow 2: columns 3-9 (input's columns 3-9, reversed).\n\nRow 3: columns 3-9 (input's columns 3-9, reversed).\n\nRow 4: columns 5-11 (input's columns 5-11, reversed).\n\nRow 5: columns 5-11 (input's columns 5-11, reversed).\n\nRow 6: columns 5-11 (input's columns 5-11, reversed).\n\nBut how would that fit with the output rows?\n\nFor example, row 1's output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. Let's see if that's derived from input's columns 4-10 in reverse order.\n\nInput's row 1 is [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0].\n\nColumns 4-10 are: 2 (index 4), 0 (5), 2 (6), 4 (7), 0 (8), 0 (9), 0 (10). Reversed, that would be 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2. So the output row would be [0,0,0,4,2,0,2], but the actual output is [0,0,0,1,1,1,0]. Not matching.\n\nHmm. This is not working. Maybe the pattern is different.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking certain values from the input, but not the entire column. For example, for each output cell, it's the value of the input's cell in a certain position, but the position depends on the row and column.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value from the input's cell in a certain position, but that position is determined by the output's position. For example, for output cell (i,j), it's the input's cell (i, j + some offset).\n\nBut how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cell (i, j) where j is in a certain range, but that's not clear.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the output of example 1 and see what's happening in the other rows.\n\nFor example 1's second output row: 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. The 1s are in columns 3,4,5. Let's look at the input's second row. The input's second row is [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So columns 3 is 0, 4 is 2, 5 is 0. So where do the 1s come from?\n\nMaybe the 1s are from the input's cells in certain positions. For example, maybe the output's 3rd column is 1, which is from the input's 2nd row, 2nd column (value 1). But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value from the input's cell in a certain pattern, like the value is the maximum of certain cells in the input. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value from the input's cell in a certain position, but the position depends on the row and column. For example, for the output's row i, column j, the input's cell is at row i, column (some function of j).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain way, but the pattern varies for each row. For example, the first row takes columns 9-15, the second row takes columns 4-10, the third row takes columns 3-9, the fourth row takes columns 3-9, the fifth row takes columns 5-11, etc. But how does that fit with the output?\n\nLet's try for example 1's second output row. If the input's columns 4-10 are taken in reverse order, the output would be 0,0,0,4,2,0,2. But the actual output is 0,0,0,1,1,1,0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nMaybe the pattern is not based on columns, but on some other transformation. For example, the output is a grid where each cell is the value of the input's cell in a certain position, but the position is determined by some rule.\n\nLooking at example 1's output, the first output row has 5 in the 4th column. The input's first row has 5 in the 12th column. So 4th column of output is 12th column of input. For the second output row, the 4th column is 1, which is in the input's second row's 4th column? No, input's second row's 4th column is 0. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the value from the input's cell in a certain position, but the position is determined by the output's position. For example, the output's cell (i,j) is the input's cell (i, j + 8). Let's check for example 1's first output row. j=3 (4th column), input's j=3+8=11. Input's first row, column 11 is 5. Which matches. For j=4, input's column 12 is 0. But the output's j=4 is 0. Which matches. So for the first output row, this seems to work.\n\nFor the second output row, j=3: input's column 3+8=11. Input's second row, column 11 is 0. But the output's j=3 is 1. So that doesn't match. Hmm.\n\nBut wait, maybe the offset is different. For example, for the first row, the offset is 8, but for other rows, it's different. For example, for the second row, the offset is 4. So for j=3, input's column 3 + 4 =7. Input's second row, column 7 is 4. But the output's j=3 is 1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the offset is 8 for the first row, but for other rows, it's 4. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the offset is 8 for the first row, but for other rows, it's 4. But that's arbitrary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cell at (i, j + 8) for the first row, and for other rows, it's (i, j + 4). Let's see for example 1's second output row. j=3: 3 +4=7. Input's second row's column 7 is 4. But the output is 1. Not matching.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should try to find another pattern.\n\nLooking at example 3's input and output. Let's take the first output row: 0 0 0 0 5 0 0. The 5 is in the 5th column of the output. In the input's first row, the 11th column is 5. So input's column 11 is 5. So for output's 5th column, it's input's 11th column. So 5th column in output is 11th in input. So for the first output row, the output's column j is input's column (j + 6). Because 5 +6 =11. For j=0, input's column 0+6=6. But in the first output row, j=0 is 0, which is input's column 6. Let's check:\n\nInput's first row: columns 0-14. For j=0 in output, input's column 6 is 2. But the output's j=0 is 0. So that doesn't fit. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output's column j is input's column (15 - j - 1) for the first row. For j=0, 15-0-1=14. input's column 14 is 0. Which matches the first output row's j=0. For j=1, 15-1-1=13: input's column 13 is 0. Output's j=1 is 0. For j=2: 15-2-1=12: input's column 12 is 0. Output's j=2 is 0. For j=3: 15-3-1=11: input's column 11 is 5. Output's j=3 is 5. Wait, but the first output row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0. So j=3 is 5. So that fits. For j=4: 15-4-1=10: input's column 10 is 0. Output's j=4 is 0. For j=5: 15-5-1=9: input's column 9 is 0. Output's j=5 is 0. For j=6: 15-6-1=8: input's column 8 is 0. Output's j=6 is 0. So this fits the first output row.\n\nSo for the first output row, the output's column j is input's column (15 - j - 1) = 14 - j. So for j=0 to 6, the output's column j is input's column 14-j.\n\nThis seems to work for the first output row of example 1. Let's check the second output row of example 1. The second output row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. Let's see if this pattern holds. For j=0, input's column 14-0=14: input's second row's column 14 is 0. Output's j=0 is 0. For j=1: input's column 13: 0. Output's j=1 is 0. For j=2: input's column 12: 0. Output's j=2 is 0. For j=3: input's column 11: 0. Output's j=3 is 1. So this doesn't fit. So the pattern works for the first row but not for the second.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a different pattern for other rows. For example, for the second output row, maybe the input's column is 15 - j - 1 - some value. Or maybe the pattern varies per row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's column 14 - j for the first row, but for other rows, it's different. For example, for the second row, it's taking input's column 10 - j. Let's see:\n\nFor j=3, input's column 10-3=7. Input's second row's column 7 is 4. Output's j=3 is 1. No match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe for the second row, the input's column is 10 - j. For j=3, 10-3=7. Input's column 7 is 4. Output's j=3 is 1. Not matching.\n\nThis is not working. Maybe the pattern is different for each row. For example, the first row takes columns 14-j, the second row takes columns 10-j, the third row takes columns 9-j, etc. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's column (15 - j - 1) for the first row, but for other rows, it's taking a different column. For example, for the second row, it's taking the input's column (15 - j - 1 - 4). But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain way, but for each row, the starting column is different. For example, the first row starts at column 9, the second row starts at column 4, the third row starts at column 3, etc. But how?\n\nFor example, in example 1's first output row, the starting column is 9, and the columns taken are 9,10,11,12,13,14,15 (but that's 7 columns). Wait, but the input has 15 columns. So for the first row, the output is taking columns 9-15 (7 columns), but in reverse order. For the second row, it's taking columns 4-10 (7 columns), in reverse order. For the third row, columns 3-9, in reverse order. For the fourth row, same as third. For the fifth row, columns 5-11, in reverse order. For the sixth row, same as fifth. For the seventh row, same as fifth.\n\nLet's check for example 1's second output row. The input's second row is [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Columns 4-10 are: 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. Reversed, this is 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2. But the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this doesn't match. So this approach is not working.\n\nBut what if the output is not taking the entire column range, but only certain parts? For example, for the second output row, the 1s are in columns 3-5. Let's see if there's a pattern there. Maybe the 1s are from the input's cells where the value is 1. For example, in the input's second row, the 1s are at columns 0, 2. So maybe the output is taking those values, but that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells where the value is non-zero and placing them in the output. But this seems too vague.\n\nAnother approach: let's look at the output of example 1's third row: 0 0 0 0 0 6 0. The 6 is in the 6th column of the output. In the input's third row, the input is 0 1 0 0 2 2 2 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. So the 6th column of the input is 2. But the output's 6th column is 6. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in certain positions, but the value is the sum of certain cells. For example, the output's cell is the sum of the input's cells in certain positions. But this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cells in certain positions and then applying some transformation like taking the maximum, minimum, or average. For example, in the first output row, the 5 is the maximum in some region.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see the pattern.\n\nLet me try to think of another approach. Since the output is 7x7, and the input is 7x15, maybe each output row is derived from a specific subset of the input's columns. For example, each output row is derived from a specific range of the input's columns, and the range varies per row. For example, the first row takes columns 9-15 (7 columns), the second row takes columns 4-10, the third row takes columns 3-9, the fourth row takes columns 3-9, the fifth row takes columns 5-11, the sixth row takes columns 5-11, the seventh row takes columns 5-11.\n\nLet's check this for example 1's second output row. The input's second row is [1,0,1,0,2,0,2,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Columns 4-10 are 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. Reversed, this gives 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2. But the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe the output is not taking the entire range, but only certain parts. For example, for the second output row, the 1s are in columns 3-5, which are 0, 2, 0. So where do the 1s come from? Maybe it's the input's cells in certain positions, like the input's row i, column j, where j is in a certain range, and the value is taken from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain way, but the value is not directly taken from the input, but transformed. For example, the output's cell is the input's cell if it's non-zero, or zero otherwise. But that doesn't fit with the first example.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's cell at (i, j + 8) for the first row, but for other rows, it's different. For example, for the first row, j + 8, for the second row, j + 4, etc. Let's try:\n\nFor example 1's second output row, j=3: 3 + 4 =7. Input's second row, column 7 is 4. Output's j=3 is 1. Not matching.\n\nThis is not working. I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for a different approach.\n\nLet me look at the test input and see if I can find any patterns. The test input is 7 rows of 15 elements each. The output is 7x7. So the same pattern as the training examples.\n\nBut without knowing the correct output, it's hard to find the pattern. Maybe the pattern is that each output cell is the input's cell at (i, j + 8) for the first row, but for other rows, it's different. Or maybe it's a different offset.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain way, but the pattern is that for each row, the output is derived from the input's columns in a certain range, and the range is determined by the row's index. For example, for row i, the output is derived from input's columns (i + 4) to (i + 10), but this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain way, but the pattern is that for each output row, the columns are taken from the input's columns that are in certain positions. For example, for row 0, columns 9-15; for row 1, columns 4-10; for row 2, columns 3-9; for row 3, columns 3-9; for row 4, columns 5-11; for row 5, columns 5-11; for row 6, columns 5-11.\n\nLet's try this for example 1's second output row. Columns 4-10 in input's second row are 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. Reversed, this gives 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2. But the actual output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this doesn't match. But maybe the values are being transformed in some way, like taking the maximum of certain values or something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in the specified range, but replacing certain values. For example, in the second output row, the input's columns 4-10 are 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. But the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So perhaps the 2 and 4 are being replaced with 1. But why?\n\nThis is not helpful. I'm not seeing the pattern. Maybe I should try to think of the output as a grid where each cell is the input's cell at a certain position, but the position is determined by the row and column.\n\nFor example, for output cell (i,j), it's the input's cell (i, j + 8) for the first row, and (i, j + 4) for other rows. Let's try this for example 1's second output row. For j=3, input's column 3 +4 =7. Input's second row, column 7 is 4. Output's j=3 is 1. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's the input's cell (i, j + 8) for the first row, and (i, j + 6) for other rows. For j=3, 3+6=9. Input's second row, column 9 is 0. Output's j=3 is 1. No.\n\nThis is not working. I'm stuck. Maybe I should try to think of the output as a grid where each cell is the input's cell at (i, j + 8) for the first row, and for other rows, it's (i, j + 4). But this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find the pattern, perhaps I should try to write a function that takes the input and for each output row, takes the input's columns in a certain way, like for the first row, columns 9-15, for the second row, columns 4-10, etc., and see if that fits any of the examples.\n\nFor example, in example 1, the first output row is 0 0 0 5 0 0 0, which is input's columns 9-15 reversed. The second output row is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0, which would be input's columns 4-10 reversed. But the input's second row's columns 4-10 are 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. Reversed, it's 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2. But the actual output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this doesn't match. So this approach is not correct.\n\nMaybe the pattern is that for each output row, the columns are taken from the input's columns in a certain way, but the values are transformed. For example, the output is taking the input's columns, but replacing certain values with 1 or 0. But this is too vague.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and not finding a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Based on the first example, the first output row is derived from input's columns 9-15 reversed. The second output row might be derived from input's columns 4-10, but with some transformation. For example, maybe the values are taken from the input's columns 4-10, but only if they are non-zero, and 0 otherwise. But in the second output row, the input's columns 4-10 are 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. So if we take non-zero values, it would be 2, 2, 4, but that doesn't fit the output.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain way, but the values are replaced with 1 if they are 2 or higher, and 0 otherwise. For the second output row, input's columns 4-10 are 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. Replaced with 1 for 2 or higher, it would be 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0. But the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain way, but the values are replaced with 1 if they are 1 or higher, and 0 otherwise. For the second output row, input's columns 4-10 are 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. Replaced with 1 for 2 or higher, it would be 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0. Still not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm not able to find a clear pattern. Given that, I'll have to make a guess based on the first example's first row, and assume that for each output row, the columns are taken from the input's columns in a certain range, and the range is determined by the row index.\n\nFor example, for row i, the output is derived from input's columns (i + 4) to (i + 10), but this is just a guess.\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's try to write a function that for each output row, takes the input's columns from a certain range and reverses them.\n\nFor example, for row 0, columns 9-15 (7 columns), reversed.\n\nFor row 1, columns 4-10, reversed.\n\nFor row 2, columns 3-9, reversed.\n\nFor row 3, columns 3-9, reversed.\n\nFor row 4, columns 5-11, reversed.\n\nFor row 5, columns 5-11, reversed.\n\nFor row 6, columns 5-11, reversed.\n\nThis is based on the first example. Let's see if this works for example 1's second output row. For row 1, columns 4-10 are 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0. Reversed, it's 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2. But the actual output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this doesn't match. But maybe the values are being transformed in some way.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the values are being replaced with 1 if they are 2 or higher, and 0 otherwise. For the reversed columns, 0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2 would become 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1. But the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this is close but not quite.\n\nBut this is just a guess. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with this approach, assuming that the output is generated by taking the input's columns in a certain range and reversing them, and then replacing values with 1 if they are 2 or higher, and 0 otherwise.\n\nBut how to implement this? Let's try to write the code.\n\nFor each row i in 0-6:\n\n- Determine the range of input columns to take.\n\n- Take those columns, reverse them.\n\n- Replace each value with 1 if it's 2 or higher, else 0.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nFor example 1's second output row:\n\nInput's columns 4-10 are [2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0]. Reversed: [0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2]. Replace with 1 if >=2: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]. But the actual output is [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]. So this is close but not exactly.\n\nMaybe the replacement is 1 if the value is 1 or higher, else 0. For the reversed columns [0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2], this would be [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], which is still not matching.\n\nBut the actual output is [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]. So the last element is 0, but according to this, it would be 1. So this is not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the replacement is 1 if the value is 1 or higher, and 0 otherwise. For the reversed columns [0, 0, 0, 4, 2, 0, 2], this would be [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], but the actual output is [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0]. So this is not matching.\n\nThis is not working. Given the time I've spent, I'll proceed with the initial approach of taking the input's columns in a certain range and reversing them, and assume that the transformation is that.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nFor each row i in 0-6:\n\n- Determine the starting column for the input.\n\n- Take the input's columns from start to start+6 (since 7 columns).\n\n- Reverse the list.\n\n- Assign to the output row.\n\nBut how to determine the start column for each row?\n\nBased on example 1:\n\nRow 0: start = 9\n\nRow 1: start = 4\n\nRow 2: start = 3\n\nRow 3: start = 3\n\nRow 4: start = 5\n\nRow 5: start = 5\n\nRow 6: start = 5\n\nSo for row i, the start column is:\n\ni=0: 9\n\ni=1: 4\n\ni=2: 3\n\ni=3: 3\n\ni=4: 5\n\ni=5: 5\n\ni=6: 5\n\nThis seems arbitrary, but it's based on the first example.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*7 for _ in range(7)]\n    for i in range(7):\n        if i == 0:\n            start_col = 9\n        elif i == 1:\n            start_col = 4\n        elif i == 2 or i == 3:\n            start_col = 3\n        elif i == 4 or i == 5 or i == 6:\n            start_col = 5\n        # take columns from start_col to start_col + 6 (inclusive), then reverse\n        input_cols = grid[i][start_col:start_col+7]\n        output_row = input_cols[::-1]\n        for j in range(7):\n            output[i][j] = output_row[j]\n    return output\n\nBut this is based on the first example, and may not work for other examples. For example, in example 2, let's check.\n\nExample 2's input is a 7x15 grid. Let's take the first output row: 0 5 0 0 0 0 0. According to the code, for i=0, start_col=9. The input's first row is:\n\n2 0 2 0 6 0 6 4 0 5 0 0 0 0 0.\n\nColumns 9-15 are [5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Reversed, it's [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 5]. But the actual output is [0,5,0,0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't match. So the code is not correct.\n\nBut in example 2's first output row, the 5 is in the second column. So according to the code, it should be in the 7th column of the reversed list. But the code would have it in the 7th position, which is the first element of the reversed list.\n\nThis suggests that the code is not correct.\n\nGiven that, I'm not able to find the correct pattern. But I need to write a function. Based on the first example's first row, the code takes columns 9-15 and reverses them. For the first example's second row, it's not working, but perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nMaybe the output is generated by taking the input's columns 4-10, but for the first example's second row, the values are transformed in some way. For example, the 2, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0 are replaced with 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, but the output is 0 0 0 1 1 1 0. So this is not matching.\n\nAt this point, I'm forced to make an educated guess. Based on the first example, the first output row is derived from input's columns 9-15 reversed. For other rows, perhaps the pattern is similar, but with different starting columns. So I'll proceed with this approach, even if it doesn't work for all examples.\n\nThe code would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    output = [[0]*7 for _ in range(7)]\n    for i in range(7):\n        if i == 0:\n            start = 9\n        elif i == 1:\n            start = 4\n        elif i == 2 or i == 3:\n            start = 3\n        elif i == 4 or i == 5 or i == 6:\n            start = 5\n        # take columns from start to start+6 (7 columns)\n        input_cols = grid[i][start:start+7]\n        output_row = input_cols[::-1]\n        for j in range(7):\n            output[i][j] = output_row[j]\n    return output\n\nBut this may not work for all examples, but it's the best I can do based on the first example.\n"
