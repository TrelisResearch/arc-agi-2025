          "Analyzing the training examples and the pattern of transformations:\n\n- In Example 1, the transformation appears to involve emphasizing the vertical line (column) containing the maximum value (initially an orange \"8\", then a brighter blue \"8\") and creating some symmetrical or centered pattern.\n- In Example 2, the pattern seems to focus on highlighting the \"7\" symbols with thickened lines or borders (like doubling the \"7\"s into blocks or outlining them).\n- In Example 3, the pattern highlights the \"3\" shapes with colorful lines, expanding their appearance vertically, especially emphasizing the middle \"3\" with a thick line.\n- The common factor seems to be highlighting and expanding particular shapes or colors, often with a vertical line or \"bar\" extending through and emphasizing the shape.\n\nLooking at the test input:\n\n- It contains scattered \"6\"s, some \"1\"s, and little other structure.\n- Based on the previous patterns, I hypothesize that the transformation might involve highlighting the most prominent shape(s) and possibly extending or emphasizing certain points (e.g., the \"6\"s or \"1\"s).\n\nSince the previous examples emphasized certain shapes by enlarging or highlighting them with vertical lines or borders, the most consistent general pattern seems to be:\n\n- Find prominent features or shapes.\n- Highlight or expand those features along a vertical line (column).\n\n**Implementation insights:**\n\n- For this specific grid, the \"6\"s and \"1\"s may be the features of interest.\n- An approach: Locate \"6\"s and \"1\"s, then highlight their columns, possibly by drawing vertical lines or thickening the columns at those positions.\n- Always produce a 20x20 output (pad if necessary).\n\n**Proposed transformation:**\n\n- For each \"shape\" of interest (\"1\" and \"6\" in this context), create vertical lines at their columns.\n- Use a distinctive value for emphasis; for example, set the entire column to value \"8\" or \"9\" depending on the pattern.\n\nI will implement a solution that:\n\n- Finds all columns containing \"6\" or \"1\"\n- Replaces that entire column with a specific value (say 8 or 9)\n- Keeps other parts unchanged\n\nThis matches the pattern of highlighting features with vertical emphasis seen in the examples.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    import numpy as np\n    # Convert to numpy array for easy manipulation\n    arr = np.array(grid)\n    # Initialize output as a copy of input\n    output = arr.copy()\n\n    # Identify columns containing the interest shapes (\"1\" and \"6\")\n    cols_with_shapes = set()\n    for r in range(arr.shape[0]):\n        for c in range(arr.shape[1]):\n            if arr[r, c] in [1, 6]:\n                cols_with_shapes.add(c)\n\n    # Highlight these columns by setting entire column to a specific value, e.g., 9\n    for c in cols_with_shapes:\n        output[:, c] = 9\n\n    # Ensure output is 20x20 (pad if needed)\n    # Though input is expected to be 20x20, just in case:\n    if output.shape != (20, 20):\n        padded = np.zeros((20, 20), dtype=int)\n        padded[:output.shape[0], :output.shape[1]] = output\n        output = padded\n\n    # Convert back to list of lists\n    transformed_grid = output.tolist()\n    return transformed_grid\n```"
