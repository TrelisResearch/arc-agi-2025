          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids into the output grids for the given examples. Let me start by looking at the first example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 15x7 grid (since each line has 15 numbers, but the output is 6x7). Wait, the output is 6x7. So the input is 15 rows, each with 7 columns? Wait, no, the input for example 1 is given as 15 lines, each with 13 numbers? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nEach line seems to have 13 numbers. Wait, the input for example 1 is 15 rows, each with 13 numbers. The output is 6 rows, each with 7 numbers. So the transformation is from 15x13 to 6x7. Hmm, but how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the output must be a 6x7 grid. So the input is a grid that's possibly larger, and the output is a 6x7 grid. But how to map the input to the output?\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output. Let me look at the input lines:\n\nInput lines for example 1:\n\nThe first line is 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 that's 13 numbers. Then the output is 6 lines of 7 numbers each.\n\nSo the input is a 15x13 grid, and the output is 6x7. How to map these?\n\nLooking at the output for example 1:\n\nThe output is:\n\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 0 0 7 5\n4 2 0 0 0 8 0\n9 1 9 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 4\n\nSo each output line is 7 elements. How do these relate to the input?\n\nLooking at the input lines, perhaps the output is derived by taking certain columns or rows from the input? Or maybe some pattern of selecting cells based on some criteria.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a compressed version of the input. Let me think about the first example.\n\nLooking at the input's first line: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's first line is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, where does 4 come from? Maybe the first line of the output is taking certain elements from the input's first line. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the output is derived by some transformation that involves grouping cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in the first example, the output has 6 rows. Let me check the input's rows. The input has 15 rows. How to select 6 rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking specific columns from the input. Let's see: the output has 7 columns. The input has 13 columns. Maybe the output is formed by selecting certain columns from the input. For example, in the first example's output, the first line is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Looking at the input's first line, maybe the first element is 5, but the output's first element is 4. That doesn't match. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for example 1. The output is 6 rows. Let me check the input's rows. The input has 15 rows. Maybe the output is formed by taking every other row or some specific rows. For example, rows 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11? Let me check. For example, the first output line is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Looking at the input's first line, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions in the input's rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by some transformation that involves the positions of the numbers. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by some function of the input's cells.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first output line is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The input's first line has 5,3,0,8,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. The first output line's first element is 4. Where does that 4 come from? Maybe looking at the input's row 0, column 0, but that's 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking the first column of the input's rows. Let me check. For example, in the first output line, the first element is 4. Looking at the input's rows, maybe the first row's first column is 5, but that's not 4. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the output has 7 columns, and the input has 13. Maybe the output is formed by taking columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12? Let me check for the first output line. The first output line's first element is 4. Looking at the input's first line, columns 0 is 5, 2 is 0, 4 is 0, 6 is 6, 8 is 0, 10 is 0, 12 is 0. So that's 5,0,0,6,0,0,0. Not matching 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first column of the input's rows, but only certain rows. For example, in the first output line, maybe it's taking the first column of row 0, but that's 5. Not matching 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by some pattern of selecting cells. For example, the output's first row is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Let's see if that's the first column of the input's row 0, but that's 5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain cells from the input's rows. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells where the input has certain values, like non-zero values. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the second output line is 0 0 6 0 0 7 5. Let me check the input's row 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 4. So the input's row 1 has 0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,4. The output's second line is 0 0 6 0 0 7 5. Where do these numbers come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in the first output line, the first element is 4. Looking at the input's row 0, maybe the value is 4 in a certain position. But I don't see that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by some transformation that involves the positions of the numbers. For example, the output is a compressed version of the input's grid. For example, the output's first row is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Maybe this corresponds to the first row of the input's grid, but with some values replaced or transformed.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first output line is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Let's check the input's row 0: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's first line is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. So maybe the 4 comes from the input's row 0, column 1 (3)? No. Or maybe from row 0, column 3 (8)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the first output line's first element is 4. Maybe this is the value of the input's row 0, column 0, but that's 5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first column of the input's rows. But that's not matching.\n\nThis seems really challenging. Let me look at the second example. Maybe there's a pattern there.\n\nIn example 2, the input is a 12x24 grid (since each line has 24 numbers?), and the output is 8x7. Wait, the output for example 2 is 8 rows of 7 numbers each. Let's check the input for example 2:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\n0 3 0 9 0 0 0 9 5 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 4 0 8 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 9 0 3 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 8 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 7 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 4 0 7 9 8\n0 0 7 0 2 0 1 5 3 0 6 5 2 5 0 0 1 1 5 0 0 0 0\n9 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 7\n8 0 4 0 2 0 9 5 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n1 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 6 4 4 8 0 0 0 0\n8 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 4 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 4 2 7 0 9 1 6\n0 4 4 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 0 8 0 3 0 6 0\n0 7 0 0 0 8 0 3 7 0 9 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 5 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 4 0 4 6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 4\n6 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 0 0 4\n0 0 3 7 9 0 3 0 0 0 6 4 0 0 3 0 0 8 0 7 0 5 4\n0 7 3 0 0 0 3 0 2 8 0 4 4 0 3 4 0 3 0 0 8 0 4\n0 8 3 0 9 0 3 0 3 3 0 4 0 0 3 7 7 5 0 0 1 0 4\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 6 5 0 0 4 3 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 4\n0 9 2 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 9 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n0 5 8 0 0 0 1 0 6 0 9 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 4\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\nThe output is:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0\n0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 7 0 5\n4 0 3 4 0 3 0 0 8 0\n0 0 3 7 7 5 0 0 1 0\n3 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n\nWait, the output for example 2 is 8 rows of 7 numbers each. Wait, the output given is 8 rows, but the user shows the output as 8 rows. Let me check the output:\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 that's 10 numbers. Wait, no, the output is supposed to be 6x7? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait the problem says that the output must be 6x7. But in example 2, the output is 8x7. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no, the problem says that the output must be 6x7. But the examples may have different outputs. Wait, no, the problem says that the output must be 6x7. But in example 2, the output is 8 rows of 7 elements each. That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"Your transformation must always produce a 6\u00d77 output grid.\" So regardless of the input, the output must be 6 rows, 7 columns each. But the examples given have outputs that are different. For example, example 1's output is 6 rows, 7 columns. Example 2's output is 8 rows, 7 columns. That's a contradiction. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nIn example 2, the output is:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 this is 10 elements, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the output for example 2 again.\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 that's 10 elements. But that can't be. Wait, maybe the output is written as 8 rows, each with 7 elements. Let me check the example again. The user provided the output as:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0\n0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 7 0 5\n4 0 3 4 0 3 0 0 8 0\n0 0 3 7 7 5 0 0 1 0\n3 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n\nWait, each line here has 10 elements. That's not possible. Wait, maybe there's a formatting error. Let me count the elements in the output for example 2. The first line is \"6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0\" \u2192 that's 10 numbers. But the output is supposed to be 6x7. This suggests that there's a mistake in the example. But that's impossible. Wait, perhaps the output is 8x7, but the problem says that the output must be 6x7. So there's a contradiction. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples. Maybe the examples are not following the 6x7 output, but the test input is. But the problem says that the output must be 6x7. So perhaps the examples are wrong? Or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: the user says that the output must be 6x7. But the examples given in the problem have outputs that are different. For example, example 1's output is 6x7. Let me check:\n\nIn example 1's output, the first line is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements. The second line is 0 0 6 0 0 7 5 \u2192 7 elements. The third line is 4 2 0 0 0 8 0 \u2192 7 elements. The fourth line is 9 1 9 6 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements. The fifth line is 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 \u2192 7 elements. The sixth line is 0 0 0 0 4 0 4 \u2192 7 elements. So that's 6 rows, each with 7 elements. That matches the required output.\n\nIn example 2's output, the first line is \"6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0\" which is 10 elements. But that's not possible. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in formatting. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the example 2's output:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0\n0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 7 0 5\n4 0 3 4 0 3 0 0 8 0\n0 0 3 7 7 5 0 0 1 0\n3 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n\nWait, each line has 10 elements. That's not possible. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. Maybe the output is supposed to be 8x7, but the problem says that the output must be 6x7. This is confusing. But according to the problem statement, the output must be 6x7. So perhaps the examples are not correct, or I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the output is 6x7, but the user made a formatting error. For example, perhaps the output for example 2 is 8 lines, but the actual output is 6x7. But that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are not correct, but the problem says that the output must be 6x7. So I need to focus on the test input and the training examples. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for example 2 is 8 rows of 7 elements. But that's conflicting with the problem's requirement. This is confusing. But perhaps the examples are not following the 6x7 output, but the test input is. However, the problem says that the output must be 6x7. So I have to ignore the examples' outputs and focus on the transformation that produces a 6x7 grid.\n\nBut this is very confusing. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says that the output must be 6x7. So regardless of the examples, the transformation must produce a 6x7 grid. So the examples may have errors, or perhaps the examples are correct but the output is 6x7. For example, in example 2's output, maybe the lines are not correctly formatted. For example, the first line may be 6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 but that's 10 elements. But if it's 6x7, then each line must have 7 elements. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the examples. For example, maybe the output for example 2 is 8x7, but the problem says that the output must be 6x7. This is conflicting. But since the problem says that the output must be 6x7, I have to proceed under that assumption.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the examples are not correct, or I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input and output for the examples are not in the correct format. For example, in example 1, the input is 15 rows, each with 13 elements. The output is 6 rows, each with 7 elements. So the transformation is from 15x13 to 6x7. How to map that?\n\nMaybe the output is derived by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the first output line is derived from the first row of the input, but with some processing. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking the first 6 rows of the input, but that's not possible because the input has 15 rows. Or maybe taking certain columns from the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, for the first output line, the first element is 4, which is in the input's row 0, column 1. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first column of the input's rows. But for example, the first output line's first element is 4. Looking at the input's first row, column 0 is 5, but that's not 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by some pattern of selecting cells based on their positions. For example, the output's first row is the first row of the input, but with some values replaced. Or maybe the output is a compressed version of the input's grid.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's input and output:\n\nInput's first row: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 13 elements.\n\nOutput's first row: 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 from the input's first row. Let's see:\n\nInput row 0: columns 0-12 are 5,3,0,8,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nColumns 0,2,4,6,8,10,12 \u2192 values are 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 \u2192 which is 5,0,0,0,0,0,0. But the output's first row is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first row of the input, but only certain columns. But again, it's unclear.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is derived by taking the input's rows and columns in a certain way. For example, the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input, and then taking certain columns. But the input has 15 rows, so that's possible. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first row of the input, but only certain columns. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first column of the input's rows, but only certain rows. For example, the first output row is the first column of rows 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Let me check.\n\nFor example, in example 1's output, the first row is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Let's see what the first column of the input's rows would be. The input's rows are:\n\nRow 0: 5,3,0,8,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 first column is 5.\n\nRow 1: 0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,4 \u2192 first column is 0.\n\nRow 2: 0,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,9,0 \u2192 first column is 0.\n\nRow 3: 7,8,0,0,6,0,0,7,5,8,4,8,3 \u2192 first column is 7.\n\nRow 4: 2,8,4,2,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0 \u2192 first column is 2.\n\nRow 5: 0,8,9,1,9,6,0,0,0,8,0,0,7 \u2192 first column is 0.\n\nRow 6: 1,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0 \u2192 first column is 1.\n\nRow 7: 0,8,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,8,0,0,0 \u2192 first column is 0.\n\nRow 8: 0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0 \u2192 first column is 0.\n\nRow 9: 0,0,0,0,0,7,8,0,6,0,0,0,3 \u2192 first column is 0.\n\nRow 10: 5,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 first column is 5.\n\nRow 11: 0,0,9,4,0,0,6,0,7,7,7,7,7 \u2192 first column is 0.\n\nRow 12: 0,0,2,2,4,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,7 \u2192 first column is 0.\n\nRow 13: 8,8,0,3,0,0,0,1,7,0,8,4,7 \u2192 first column is 8.\n\nRow 14: 7,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,7,0,6,8,7 \u2192 first column is 7.\n\nSo if we take the first column of rows 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, we get 5,7,0,0,0,0. But the first output row is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first column of certain rows and then applying some transformation. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the output is formed by selecting the first 6 rows of the input and taking certain columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input, and for each row, taking certain columns. For example, for each row in the output, it's a combination of columns from the input's rows.\n\nBut this is very vague. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLet me think about the output for example 1. The output is 6 rows, each with 7 elements. Let me look at the first output row: [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The second output row: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 5]. The third: [4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]. The fourth: [9, 1, 9, 6, 0, 0, 0]. The fifth: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]. The sixth: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4].\n\nLooking at these, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input's rows. For example, the first output row's first element is 4, which might be the value in the input's row 0, column 1 (3)? No. Or perhaps it's derived from a combination of values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first column of the input's rows where the value is non-zero. For example, in the first output row, the first element is 4. Maybe it's the first non-zero value in the input's row 0, but that's 5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input and then applying some transformation. For example, the first output row is derived from the input's row 0, but with some values replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a certain way, like selecting every other row or column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input, and for each row, taking certain columns. For example, for the first output row, take columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. Let's try that for the first input row:\n\nInput row 0: [5,3,0,8,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 0,2,4,6,8,10,12 \u2192 values are 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. But the output's first row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking certain columns. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first column of the input's row 0, but that's 5. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at example 3.\n\nIn example 3, the input is a 12x24 grid, and the output is 4x5. Wait, the output is 4 rows of 5 elements each. But the problem says that the output must be 6x7. So this is conflicting. But perhaps the examples are not correct, or I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for example 3 is 4x5, but the problem says that the output must be 6x7. This is confusing. But the problem says that the output must be 6x7, so I have to ignore the examples and focus on the transformation that produces a 6x7 grid.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to take certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking certain columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and taking the first 7 columns. But that would give 6x7, which is what is required.\n\nWait, in example 1, the input has 15 rows, and the output is 6 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns. Let's check.\n\nFor example, the first output row is the first row of the input, but the input's first row has 13 elements. Taking the first 7 columns would give [5,3,0,8,0,6,0]. But the output's first row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first column of the input's row 0, but that's 5, not 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a certain way, like selecting every other row or column. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is derived by some pattern of selecting cells based on their values. For example, the output is formed by taking all cells in the input that are non-zero, and arranging them in a certain way. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns, but with some transformation. For example, replacing certain values.\n\nBut without seeing the pattern, this is hard.\n\nMaybe I should think about the test input. The test input is a 24x7 grid (since each line has 7 elements?), but I'm not sure. Wait, the test input is given as:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 2 4 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 4 0 4\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 5 4 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 7 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 3 0 3 0 0 9 0\n6 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 5 0 2 7 0\n7 0 0 8 3 0 0 3 0 3 9 0 0 0 6 7 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 7 0 0 8 8 7 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 3 4 0 0 2 0 1\n7 0 0 0 9 0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 8 0 0 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3 0 2 3 0 3 3 0 0 2\n0 0 7 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 1 0 3 0 0 7 0 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 3 4 0 0 6 0 8\n0 0 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 3 0 9 9 0 0 9\n5 0 1 0 0 0 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 3 0 0 7 0 5 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 6\n4 0 0 0 7 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 5 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7\n9 0 1 0 0 0 8 0 0 1 0 0 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 8 0 7\n2 0 0 0 6 2 8 0 0 9 0 0 0 8 5 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7\n8 0 1 0 8 0 8 0 7 0 0 6 0 8 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 2 7\n5 0 0 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 0 5 6 8 4 0 8 0 5 7 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 0 4 0 8 0 9 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 2\n8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 2 0 2 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 0 0 5 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 0 9 6 0 5 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 7 0 1 5 3 0 0 6\n5 0 0 0 8 8 0 9 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n\nEach line has 25 elements. So the input is 24 rows, each with 25 columns. The output must be 6x7. So how to transform this.\n\nBut without knowing the pattern, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I should think of the output as being derived from the input's rows and columns in a certain way.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first column of the input's rows 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Let's try that.\n\nFor example, in example 1's output, the first row is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Let's see if that can be derived from the input's rows.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns, but with some transformation. For example, replacing certain values.\n\nBut without knowing the pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nMaybe the pattern is to take the first 6 rows of the input and then take the first 7 columns. But in example 1, the input's first row has 13 columns. Taking the first 7 columns would give 5,3,0,8,0,6,0. But the output's first row is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking certain columns. For example, columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. Let's try for example 1's first row: 5,0,0,0,0,0,0. But the output's first row is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns, but with some values replaced. For example, replacing non-zero values with zero. But that's not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at the output for example 1. The first output row is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The second is 0 0 6 0 0 7 5. The third is 4 2 0 0 0 8 0. The fourth is 9 1 9 6 0 0 0. The fifth is 0 0 0 0 8 0 0. The sixth is 0 0 0 0 4 0 4.\n\nLooking at these, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input's rows. For example, the first output row might be formed by taking the first column of certain rows. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a certain way, like taking the first 6 rows and then taking the first 7 columns, but with some transformation. For example, taking the first 6 rows and then taking the first 7 columns, but replacing certain values with 0 or other values.\n\nBut without knowing the pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nMaybe I should think about the output as being a compressed version of the input. For example, each output cell is determined by some function of the input cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns, but only for certain rows. For example, the first output row is from the first row of the input, but with some transformation.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nPerhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns, but with some transformation. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first column of the input's first row, but that's 5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking certain columns. For example, columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. But that gives 7 columns. For example, in example 1's first row, this would be 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. But the output's first row is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns, but with some values replaced. For example, if a cell is non-zero, it is replaced with 4, or some other value. But this is just guessing.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns, but with some transformation. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first column of the input's first row, but that's 5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first column of the input's row 0, the second column of row 1, etc. But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns, but with some values replaced. For example, replacing all non-zero values with zero, but that doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll have to write a function that takes the first 6 rows of the input and takes the first 7 columns, but this is just a guess. However, this may not fit the examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nBut in example 1, the input has 15 rows. Taking the first 6 rows would give 6 rows. Each row has 13 columns. Taking the first 7 columns would give 6x7 grid. Let's see what that would look like for example 1.\n\nFor example, the first output row would be the first row of the input's first 6 rows, taking first 7 columns: 5,3,0,8,0,6,0. But the actual output's first row is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe the transformation is to take certain columns from the input's rows. For example, columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. Let's see for the first row of example 1: 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. But the output's first row is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. So this is close, but not matching.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to take these columns and replace certain values. For example, if a value is non-zero, replace it with 4. But that's just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and taking the first 7 columns, but replacing all non-zero values with 0. But that would not match the example's output.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to proceed with the assumption that the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and taking certain columns. For example, columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. This would give 6x7 grid. Even if it doesn't match the examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take first 6 rows\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(6):\n        row = grid[i]\n        # Take columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12\n        new_row = [row[j] for j in [0,2,4,6,8,10,12]]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's check for example 1's first row. The first row of the input is [5,3,0,8,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Taking columns 0,2,4,6,8,10,12 gives [5,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But the output's first row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe the transformation is to take certain columns and replace some values. For example, if the value is 5, replace it with 4. But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and taking the first 7 columns, but with some transformation. For example, replacing the first value with 4, but that's not general.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll proceed with this approach, even if it's not correct for the examples. The user may have a different pattern, but this is the best I can do.\n"

Let me start by looking at the first example.\n\nIn Example 1, the input is a 15x7 grid (since each line has 15 numbers, but the output is 6x7). Wait, the output is 6x7. So the input is 15 rows, each with 7 columns? Wait, no, the input for example 1 is given as 15 lines, each with 13 numbers? Wait, let me check:\n\nLooking at Example 1's input:\n\nEach line seems to have 13 numbers. Wait, the input for example 1 is 15 rows, each with 13 numbers. The output is 6 rows, each with 7 numbers. So the transformation is from 15x13 to 6x7. Hmm, but how?\n\nWait, the problem says that the output must be a 6x7 grid. So the input is a grid that's possibly larger, and the output is a 6x7 grid. But how to map the input to the output?\n\nLooking at the first example's input and output. Let me look at the input lines:\n\nInput lines for example 1:\n\nThe first line is 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 that's 13 numbers. Then the output is 6 lines of 7 numbers each.\n\nSo the input is a 15x13 grid, and the output is 6x7. How to map these?\n\nLooking at the output for example 1:\n\nThe output is:\n\n4 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 0 0 7 5\n4 2 0 0 0 8 0\n9 1 9 6 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0\n0 0 0 0 4 0 4\n\nSo each output line is 7 elements. How do these relate to the input?\n\nLooking at the input lines, perhaps the output is derived by taking certain columns or rows from the input? Or maybe some pattern of selecting cells based on some criteria.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is a compressed version of the input. Let me think about the first example.\n\nLooking at the input's first line: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's first line is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Wait, where does 4 come from? Maybe the first line of the output is taking certain elements from the input's first line. But that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the output is derived by some transformation that involves grouping cells.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking certain positions from the input. For example, in the first example, the output has 6 rows. Let me check the input's rows. The input has 15 rows. How to select 6 rows?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking specific columns from the input. Let's see: the output has 7 columns. The input has 13 columns. Maybe the output is formed by selecting certain columns from the input. For example, in the first example's output, the first line is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Looking at the input's first line, maybe the first element is 5, but the output's first element is 4. That doesn't match. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAnother approach: looking at the output for example 1. The output is 6 rows. Let me check the input's rows. The input has 15 rows. Maybe the output is formed by taking every other row or some specific rows. For example, rows 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11? Let me check. For example, the first output line is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Looking at the input's first line, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions in the input's rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by some transformation that involves the positions of the numbers. For example, maybe the output is a grid where each cell is determined by some function of the input's cells.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first output line is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The input's first line has 5,3,0,8,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0. The first output line's first element is 4. Where does that 4 come from? Maybe looking at the input's row 0, column 0, but that's 5. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking the first column of the input's rows. Let me check. For example, in the first output line, the first element is 4. Looking at the input's rows, maybe the first row's first column is 5, but that's not 4. So that's not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the output has 7 columns, and the input has 13. Maybe the output is formed by taking columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12? Let me check for the first output line. The first output line's first element is 4. Looking at the input's first line, columns 0 is 5, 2 is 0, 4 is 0, 6 is 6, 8 is 0, 10 is 0, 12 is 0. So that's 5,0,0,6,0,0,0. Not matching 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that's not it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first column of the input's rows, but only certain rows. For example, in the first output line, maybe it's taking the first column of row 0, but that's 5. Not matching 4.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by some pattern of selecting cells. For example, the output's first row is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Let's see if that's the first column of the input's row 0, but that's 5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain cells from the input's rows. For example, maybe the output is formed by taking the cells where the input has certain values, like non-zero values. But that's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the second output line is 0 0 6 0 0 7 5. Let me check the input's row 1: 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 4. So the input's row 1 has 0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,4. The output's second line is 0 0 6 0 0 7 5. Where do these numbers come from?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, in the first output line, the first element is 4. Looking at the input's row 0, maybe the value is 4 in a certain position. But I don't see that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by some transformation that involves the positions of the numbers. For example, the output is a compressed version of the input's grid. For example, the output's first row is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Maybe this corresponds to the first row of the input's grid, but with some values replaced or transformed.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output for example 1, the first output line is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Let's check the input's row 0: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0. The output's first line is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. So maybe the 4 comes from the input's row 0, column 1 (3)? No. Or maybe from row 0, column 3 (8)? Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, the first output line's first element is 4. Maybe this is the value of the input's row 0, column 0, but that's 5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first column of the input's rows. But that's not matching.\n\nThis seems really challenging. Let me look at the second example. Maybe there's a pattern there.\n\nIn example 2, the input is a 12x24 grid (since each line has 24 numbers?), and the output is 8x7. Wait, the output for example 2 is 8 rows of 7 numbers each. Let's check the input for example 2:\n\nThe input is given as:\n\n0 3 0 9 0 0 0 9 5 0 4 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 4 0 8 0\n0 3 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 9 0 3 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 2\n0 0 8 0 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 7 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 0 0 4 0 7 9 8\n0 0 7 0 2 0 1 5 3 0 6 5 2 5 0 0 1 1 5 0 0 0 0\n9 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 7\n8 0 4 0 2 0 9 5 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 9\n1 0 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 0 0 6 4 4 8 0 0 0 0\n8 0 0 0 2 0 0 1 4 0 0 8 2 0 0 0 4 2 7 0 9 1 6\n0 4 4 8 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 2 0 8 0 3 0 6 0\n0 7 0 0 0 8 0 3 7 0 9 0 0 3 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 2 5 0 0 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 4 0 4 6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 4\n6 0 3 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 0 0 4\n0 0 3 7 9 0 3 0 0 0 6 4 0 0 3 0 0 8 0 7 0 5 4\n0 7 3 0 0 0 3 0 2 8 0 4 4 0 3 4 0 3 0 0 8 0 4\n0 8 3 0 9 0 3 0 3 3 0 4 0 0 3 7 7 5 0 0 1 0 4\n0 0 3 3 3 3 3 6 5 0 0 4 3 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0 4\n0 9 2 0 0 2 3 0 0 0 9 4 0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0 4\n0 5 8 0 0 0 1 0 6 0 9 4 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 4\n9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4\n\nThe output is:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0\n0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 7 0 5\n4 0 3 4 0 3 0 0 8 0\n0 0 3 7 7 5 0 0 1 0\n3 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n\nWait, the output for example 2 is 8 rows of 7 numbers each. Wait, the output given is 8 rows, but the user shows the output as 8 rows. Let me check the output:\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 that's 10 numbers. Wait, no, the output is supposed to be 6x7? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding. Wait the problem says that the output must be 6x7. But in example 2, the output is 8x7. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, no, the problem says that the output must be 6x7. But the examples may have different outputs. Wait, no, the problem says that the output must be 6x7. But in example 2, the output is 8 rows of 7 elements each. That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says: \"Your transformation must always produce a 6\u00d77 output grid.\" So regardless of the input, the output must be 6 rows, 7 columns each. But the examples given have outputs that are different. For example, example 1's output is 6 rows, 7 columns. Example 2's output is 8 rows, 7 columns. That's a contradiction. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, looking back:\n\nIn example 2, the output is:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 this is 10 elements, but that's not possible. Wait, maybe I'm miscounting. Let me check the output for example 2 again.\n\nThe output for example 2 is:\n\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 that's 10 elements. But that can't be. Wait, maybe the output is written as 8 rows, each with 7 elements. Let me check the example again. The user provided the output as:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0\n0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 7 0 5\n4 0 3 4 0 3 0 0 8 0\n0 0 3 7 7 5 0 0 1 0\n3 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n\nWait, each line here has 10 elements. That's not possible. Wait, maybe there's a formatting error. Let me count the elements in the output for example 2. The first line is \"6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0\" \u2192 that's 10 numbers. But the output is supposed to be 6x7. This suggests that there's a mistake in the example. But that's impossible. Wait, perhaps the output is 8x7, but the problem says that the output must be 6x7. So there's a contradiction. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the examples. Maybe the examples are not following the 6x7 output, but the test input is. But the problem says that the output must be 6x7. So perhaps the examples are wrong? Or maybe I'm miscounting.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: the user says that the output must be 6x7. But the examples given in the problem have outputs that are different. For example, example 1's output is 6x7. Let me check:\n\nIn example 1's output, the first line is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements. The second line is 0 0 6 0 0 7 5 \u2192 7 elements. The third line is 4 2 0 0 0 8 0 \u2192 7 elements. The fourth line is 9 1 9 6 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements. The fifth line is 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 \u2192 7 elements. The sixth line is 0 0 0 0 4 0 4 \u2192 7 elements. So that's 6 rows, each with 7 elements. That matches the required output.\n\nIn example 2's output, the first line is \"6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0\" which is 10 elements. But that's not possible. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in formatting. Let me recheck the problem statement.\n\nLooking back at the example 2's output:\n\nOutput:\n6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0\n0 0 6 0 6 0 4 0 0 0\n0 0 3 0 0 8 0 7 0 5\n4 0 3 4 0 3 0 0 8 0\n0 0 3 7 7 5 0 0 1 0\n3 0 0 0 0 9 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 5 0 0 0 0 0 0\n3 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 0 0\n\nWait, each line has 10 elements. That's not possible. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting. Maybe the output is supposed to be 8x7, but the problem says that the output must be 6x7. This is confusing. But according to the problem statement, the output must be 6x7. So perhaps the examples are not correct, or I'm misunderstanding the problem. Alternatively, maybe the output is 6x7, but the user made a formatting error. For example, perhaps the output for example 2 is 8 lines, but the actual output is 6x7. But that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the examples are not correct, but the problem says that the output must be 6x7. So I need to focus on the test input and the training examples. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for example 2 is 8 rows of 7 elements. But that's conflicting with the problem's requirement. This is confusing. But perhaps the examples are not following the 6x7 output, but the test input is. However, the problem says that the output must be 6x7. So I have to ignore the examples' outputs and focus on the transformation that produces a 6x7 grid.\n\nBut this is very confusing. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem says that the output must be 6x7. So regardless of the examples, the transformation must produce a 6x7 grid. So the examples may have errors, or perhaps the examples are correct but the output is 6x7. For example, in example 2's output, maybe the lines are not correctly formatted. For example, the first line may be 6 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 6 0 \u2192 but that's 10 elements. But if it's 6x7, then each line must have 7 elements. So perhaps the user made a mistake in formatting the examples. For example, maybe the output for example 2 is 8x7, but the problem says that the output must be 6x7. This is conflicting. But since the problem says that the output must be 6x7, I have to proceed under that assumption.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the examples are not correct, or I'm missing something. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the input and output for the examples are not in the correct format. For example, in example 1, the input is 15 rows, each with 13 elements. The output is 6 rows, each with 7 elements. So the transformation is from 15x13 to 6x7. How to map that?\n\nMaybe the output is derived by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the first output line is derived from the first row of the input, but with some processing. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is derived by taking the first 6 rows of the input, but that's not possible because the input has 15 rows. Or maybe taking certain columns from the input.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input. For example, for the first output line, the first element is 4, which is in the input's row 0, column 1. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first column of the input's rows. But for example, the first output line's first element is 4. Looking at the input's first row, column 0 is 5, but that's not 4. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by some pattern of selecting cells based on their positions. For example, the output's first row is the first row of the input, but with some values replaced. Or maybe the output is a compressed version of the input's grid.\n\nAlternatively, looking at example 1's input and output:\n\nInput's first row: 5 3 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 13 elements.\n\nOutput's first row: 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u2192 7 elements.\n\nMaybe the output is formed by taking certain columns from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 from the input's first row. Let's see:\n\nInput row 0: columns 0-12 are 5,3,0,8,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0.\n\nColumns 0,2,4,6,8,10,12 \u2192 values are 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 \u2192 which is 5,0,0,0,0,0,0. But the output's first row is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first row of the input, but only certain columns. But again, it's unclear.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the output is derived by taking the input's rows and columns in a certain way. For example, the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input, and then taking certain columns. But the input has 15 rows, so that's possible. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first row of the input, but only certain columns. But again, not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first column of the input's rows, but only certain rows. For example, the first output row is the first column of rows 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Let me check.\n\nFor example, in example 1's output, the first row is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Let's see what the first column of the input's rows would be. The input's rows are:\n\nRow 0: 5,3,0,8,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 first column is 5.\n\nRow 1: 0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,4 \u2192 first column is 0.\n\nRow 2: 0,8,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,8,0,9,0 \u2192 first column is 0.\n\nRow 3: 7,8,0,0,6,0,0,7,5,8,4,8,3 \u2192 first column is 7.\n\nRow 4: 2,8,4,2,0,0,0,8,0,8,0,0,0 \u2192 first column is 2.\n\nRow 5: 0,8,9,1,9,6,0,0,0,8,0,0,7 \u2192 first column is 0.\n\nRow 6: 1,8,0,0,0,0,8,0,0,8,0,0,0 \u2192 first column is 1.\n\nRow 7: 0,8,0,0,0,0,4,0,4,8,0,0,0 \u2192 first column is 0.\n\nRow 8: 0,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,8,0,0,0 \u2192 first column is 0.\n\nRow 9: 0,0,0,0,0,7,8,0,6,0,0,0,3 \u2192 first column is 0.\n\nRow 10: 5,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0 \u2192 first column is 5.\n\nRow 11: 0,0,9,4,0,0,6,0,7,7,7,7,7 \u2192 first column is 0.\n\nRow 12: 0,0,2,2,4,0,0,0,7,0,0,0,7 \u2192 first column is 0.\n\nRow 13: 8,8,0,3,0,0,0,1,7,0,8,4,7 \u2192 first column is 8.\n\nRow 14: 7,0,0,0,0,5,0,5,7,0,6,8,7 \u2192 first column is 7.\n\nSo if we take the first column of rows 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, we get 5,7,0,0,0,0. But the first output row is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first column of certain rows and then applying some transformation. But this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the output is formed by selecting the first 6 rows of the input and taking certain columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input, and for each row, taking certain columns. For example, for each row in the output, it's a combination of columns from the input's rows.\n\nBut this is very vague. I'm not making progress. Maybe I should look for another pattern.\n\nLet me think about the output for example 1. The output is 6 rows, each with 7 elements. Let me look at the first output row: [4, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The second output row: [0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 7, 5]. The third: [4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0]. The fourth: [9, 1, 9, 6, 0, 0, 0]. The fifth: [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0]. The sixth: [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 0, 4].\n\nLooking at these, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input's rows. For example, the first output row's first element is 4, which might be the value in the input's row 0, column 1 (3)? No. Or perhaps it's derived from a combination of values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first column of the input's rows where the value is non-zero. For example, in the first output row, the first element is 4. Maybe it's the first non-zero value in the input's row 0, but that's 5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows from the input and then applying some transformation. For example, the first output row is derived from the input's row 0, but with some values replaced.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a certain way, like selecting every other row or column.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input, and for each row, taking certain columns. For example, for the first output row, take columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. Let's try that for the first input row:\n\nInput row 0: [5,3,0,8,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] \u2192 columns 0,2,4,6,8,10,12 \u2192 values are 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. But the output's first row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking certain columns. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first column of the input's row 0, but that's 5. Not matching.\n\nThis is really challenging. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at example 3.\n\nIn example 3, the input is a 12x24 grid, and the output is 4x5. Wait, the output is 4 rows of 5 elements each. But the problem says that the output must be 6x7. So this is conflicting. But perhaps the examples are not correct, or I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output for example 3 is 4x5, but the problem says that the output must be 6x7. This is confusing. But the problem says that the output must be 6x7, so I have to ignore the examples and focus on the transformation that produces a 6x7 grid.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to take certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking certain columns. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and taking the first 7 columns. But that would give 6x7, which is what is required.\n\nWait, in example 1, the input has 15 rows, and the output is 6 rows. So perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns. Let's check.\n\nFor example, the first output row is the first row of the input, but the input's first row has 13 elements. Taking the first 7 columns would give [5,3,0,8,0,6,0]. But the output's first row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first column of the input's row 0, but that's 5, not 4.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a certain way, like selecting every other row or column. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the output is derived by some pattern of selecting cells based on their values. For example, the output is formed by taking all cells in the input that are non-zero, and arranging them in a certain way. But that's not clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns, but with some transformation. For example, replacing certain values.\n\nBut without seeing the pattern, this is hard.\n\nMaybe I should think about the test input. The test input is a 24x7 grid (since each line has 7 elements?), but I'm not sure. Wait, the test input is given as:\n\nTest Input:\n0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 0 2 4 0 0 0 9 0\n0 0 3 3 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 4 0 4\n0 0 0 2 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 6 0\n0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 5 4 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 7 0\n0 0 0 0 8 0 0 3 0 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 6 7 3 0 3 0 0 9 0\n6 3 0 0 0 0 0 3 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 5 0 2 7 0\n7 0 0 8 3 0 0 3 0 3 9 0 0 0 6 7 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0\n5 7 0 0 8 8 7 3 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 3 4 0 0 2 0 1\n7 0 0 0 9 0 0 3 0 1 0 0 0 8 0 0 4 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 6 0 0 0 3 0 2 3 0 3 3 0 0 2\n0 0 7 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 1 0 3 0 0 7 0 7 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 1 3 4 0 0 6 0 8\n0 0 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 2 0 0 3 0 9 9 0 0 9\n5 0 1 0 0 0 4 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0 0 0 1 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 3 0 0 7 0 5 0 3 0 0 0 0\n0 5 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 0 0 2 0 3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 6\n4 0 0 0 7 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 5 0 0 7 7 7 7 7 7\n9 0 1 0 0 0 8 0 0 1 0 0 5 8 8 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 8 0 7\n2 0 0 0 6 2 8 0 0 9 0 0 0 8 5 0 0 0 0 7 0 0 0 0 7\n8 0 1 0 8 0 8 0 7 0 0 6 0 8 0 0 0 0 7 7 0 0 0 2 7\n5 0 0 0 3 0 8 0 0 0 0 5 6 8 4 0 8 0 5 7 7 7 7 7 7\n0 0 0 0 4 0 8 0 9 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 8 0 0 2\n8 0 0 0 0 0 8 0 0 2 0 2 0 8 0 6 0 0 0 3 0 3 0 8 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 0 0 3 0 0 5 1 0 0 0 0\n0 0 6 0 9 6 0 5 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 7 0 1 5 3 0 0 6\n5 0 0 0 8 8 0 9 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 9 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0\n\nEach line has 25 elements. So the input is 24 rows, each with 25 columns. The output must be 6x7. So how to transform this.\n\nBut without knowing the pattern, it's hard to proceed. Maybe I should think of the output as being derived from the input's rows and columns in a certain way.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first column of the input's rows 0, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. Let's try that.\n\nFor example, in example 1's output, the first row is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. Let's see if that can be derived from the input's rows.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns, but with some transformation. For example, replacing certain values.\n\nBut without knowing the pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nMaybe the pattern is to take the first 6 rows of the input and then take the first 7 columns. But in example 1, the input's first row has 13 columns. Taking the first 7 columns would give 5,3,0,8,0,6,0. But the output's first row is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking certain columns. For example, columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. Let's try for example 1's first row: 5,0,0,0,0,0,0. But the output's first row is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. So that doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns, but with some values replaced. For example, replacing non-zero values with zero. But that's not clear.\n\nAt this point, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for other patterns. Let's look at the output for example 1. The first output row is 4 0 0 0 0 0 0. The second is 0 0 6 0 0 7 5. The third is 4 2 0 0 0 8 0. The fourth is 9 1 9 6 0 0 0. The fifth is 0 0 0 0 8 0 0. The sixth is 0 0 0 0 4 0 4.\n\nLooking at these, perhaps the output is formed by taking certain positions from the input's rows. For example, the first output row might be formed by taking the first column of certain rows. But I'm not seeing it.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the output is formed by taking the input's rows and columns in a certain way, like taking the first 6 rows and then taking the first 7 columns, but with some transformation. For example, taking the first 6 rows and then taking the first 7 columns, but replacing certain values with 0 or other values.\n\nBut without knowing the pattern, it's hard to proceed.\n\nMaybe I should think about the output as being a compressed version of the input. For example, each output cell is determined by some function of the input cells.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns, but only for certain rows. For example, the first output row is from the first row of the input, but with some transformation.\n\nBut I'm not making progress. Given the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nPerhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns, but with some transformation. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first column of the input's first row, but that's 5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking certain columns. For example, columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. But that gives 7 columns. For example, in example 1's first row, this would be 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. But the output's first row is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. So this doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns, but with some values replaced. For example, if a cell is non-zero, it is replaced with 4, or some other value. But this is just guessing.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns, but with some transformation. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first column of the input's first row, but that's 5. Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking certain rows and columns from the input. For example, the first output row is formed by taking the first column of the input's row 0, the second column of row 1, etc. But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and then taking the first 7 columns, but with some values replaced. For example, replacing all non-zero values with zero, but that doesn't fit.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll have to write a function that takes the first 6 rows of the input and takes the first 7 columns, but this is just a guess. However, this may not fit the examples, but it's the best I can do.\n\nBut in example 1, the input has 15 rows. Taking the first 6 rows would give 6 rows. Each row has 13 columns. Taking the first 7 columns would give 6x7 grid. Let's see what that would look like for example 1.\n\nFor example, the first output row would be the first row of the input's first 6 rows, taking first 7 columns: 5,3,0,8,0,6,0. But the actual output's first row is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe the transformation is to take certain columns from the input's rows. For example, columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. Let's see for the first row of example 1: 5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0. But the output's first row is 4,0,0,0,0,0,0. So this is close, but not matching.\n\nMaybe the transformation is to take these columns and replace certain values. For example, if a value is non-zero, replace it with 4. But that's just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and taking the first 7 columns, but replacing all non-zero values with 0. But that would not match the example's output.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to proceed with the assumption that the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and taking certain columns. For example, columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. This would give 6x7 grid. Even if it doesn't match the examples, it's the best I can do.\n\nSo the function would be:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Take first 6 rows\n    transformed = []\n    for i in range(6):\n        row = grid[i]\n        # Take columns 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12\n        new_row = [row[j] for j in [0,2,4,6,8,10,12]]\n        transformed.append(new_row)\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. Let's check for example 1's first row. The first row of the input is [5,3,0,8,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. Taking columns 0,2,4,6,8,10,12 gives [5,0,0,0,0,0,0]. But the output's first row is [4,0,0,0,0,0,0]. So this doesn't match.\n\nBut maybe the transformation is to take certain columns and replace some values. For example, if the value is 5, replace it with 4. But this is just guessing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the output is formed by taking the first 6 rows of the input and taking the first 7 columns, but with some transformation. For example, replacing the first value with 4, but that's not general.\n\nGiven the time I've spent and the lack of clear patterns, I'll proceed with this approach, even if it's not correct for the examples. The user may have a different pattern, but this is the best I can do.\n"
