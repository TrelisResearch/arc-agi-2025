The non-zero values seem to form a sort of \"staircase\" pattern that fills from the bottom up.\n\nFrom the examples, I observe that:\n1. The top 2 rows of the output are all zeros\n2.

This pattern continues, with each row adding one more non-zero value in the first few columns\n5. The non-zero values seem to start from the bottom and move up\n\nBased on this pattern, I'll implement a transformation that:\n- Sets the top 2 rows to all zeros\n- For rows 2 to 9, fills the first `row` columns with non-zero values (starting from 1) and the rest with zeros\n\nHere's the Python function that implements this pattern:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 output grid initialized to zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Fill the pattern we observed from the training examples\n    for row in range(2, 10):  # Rows 2 to 9 (0-indexed)\n        for col in range(row):  # Fill first 'row' columns\n            transformed_grid[row][col] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a 10x10 output grid initialized to zeros\n    transformed_grid = [[0 for _ in range(10)] for _ in range(10)]\n    \n    # Fill the pattern we observed from the training examples\n    for row in range(2, 10):  # Rows 2 to 9 (0-indexed)\n        for col in range(row):  # Fill first 'row' columns\n            transformed_grid[row][col] = 1\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",
