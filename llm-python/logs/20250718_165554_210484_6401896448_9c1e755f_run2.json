          "content": "I'll analyze the training examples to find patterns that map input grids to output grids.\n\nLooking at the examples, I observe the following patterns:\n\n1. The transformation seems to involve propagating values from certain positions to their neighbors\n2. Values in the input grid often get expanded or spread out in the output grid\n3. There's a pattern of spreading values from specific positions to their adjacent cells\n4. The transformation seems to involve some form of \"infection\" or propagation of values from certain cells to their neighbors\n\nBased on these observations, I'll implement a transformation that spreads values from certain positions to their neighbors, with some rules about how far they spread and what values they take.\n\nHere's my hypothesis for the transformation:\n\n- For each cell with a value > 0, we spread that value to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right)\n- The spread stops when we reach a cell with value 0 or when we've spread the value to all adjacent cells\n- The spread follows a specific pattern that seems to be similar to a wave propagation\n\nNow, I'll implement this in Python:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Create a queue to hold positions to process\n    from collections import deque\n    queue = deque()\n    \n    # Find all positions with value > 0\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] > 0:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Directions: up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    \n    # Process each position in the queue\n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.popleft()\n        value = grid[x][y]\n        \n        # Check all four directions\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            \n            # Check if the new position is within bounds\n            if 0 <= nx < 10 and 0 <= ny < 10:\n                # If the new position is 0, set it to the value and add to queue\n                if transformed_grid[nx][ny] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[nx][ny] = value\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n                # If the new position is not 0, do nothing\n                # If the new position is the same value, do nothing\n                # If the new position is a different value, do nothing\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Create a queue to hold positions to process\n    from collections import deque\n    queue = deque()\n    \n    # Find all positions with value > 0\n    for i in range(10):\n        for j in range(10):\n            if grid[i][j] > 0:\n                queue.append((i, j))\n    \n    # Directions: up, down, left, right\n    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]\n    \n    # Process each position in the queue\n    while queue:\n        x, y = queue.popleft()\n        value = grid[x][y]\n        \n        # Check all four directions\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            \n            # Check if the new position is within bounds\n            if 0 <= nx < 10 and 0 <= ny < 10:\n                # If the new position is 0, set it to the value and add to queue\n                if transformed_grid[nx][ny] == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[nx][ny] = value\n                    queue.append((nx, ny))\n                # If the new position is not 0, do nothing\n                # If the new position is the same value, do nothing\n                # If the new position is a different value, do nothing\n    \n    return transformed_grid\n```",

Values in the input grid are being transformed based on their position and value.\n2. There seems to be a pattern where certain values are being replaced or expanded based on their position in the grid.\n3. In Example 1, the value 5 is being expanded to 5, 6, 9 in a specific pattern.\n4. In Example 2, values are being transformed based on their position and value, with some values being replaced by others.\n5. In Example 3, values are being expanded in a pattern where certain values are repeated in a specific way.\n6. In Example 4, values are being transformed based on their position and value, with some values being replaced by others in a specific pattern.\n\nBased on these observations, I hypothesize that the transformation involves expanding certain values in a specific pattern, and replacing other values based on their position and value.\n\nHere's my implementation of this transformation:\n\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a copy of the grid to avoid modifying the original\n    transformed_grid = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    # Iterate through each
