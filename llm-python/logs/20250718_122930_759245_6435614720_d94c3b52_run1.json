          "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids to the output grids in the examples provided. Let me start by looking at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output grids have some differences. For instance, in the first input row, all are 0s, and the output is the same. But in other rows, there are changes. For example, in the second input row, there are 1s and 8s. The output has 1s and 7s and 8s. Wait, in the output, some 8s are replaced with 7s. Hmm. Also, in the third input row, there's an 8 in the middle, and in the output, it's replaced with 0s and 1s. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are transformed based on their position or surrounding values.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has 1s and 8s, and the output has 7s and 8s. For example, in the second input row, there's a 1 followed by 0s and then 1s. The output has 1s, 8s, and 7s. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their position or neighboring cells.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that in the output grids, there are 7s and 8s where there were 8s in the input. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 8s and 7s. Maybe 8s are being replaced with 7s in some cases, but not all. Or perhaps there's a pattern where 8s are converted to 7s when they are in certain regions.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output, in the second row, the input has 8s in positions 9-11. The output has 8s there, but also some 7s. For example, in the output row 2, the 8s are in positions 9-11, but there are 7s in positions 12 and 13. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced based on their neighbors or their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For instance, in the input, 8s might be replaced with 7s if they are in certain areas. But how to determine that?\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the positions where numbers change. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 8s and 7s. Maybe 8s are converted to 7s when they are surrounded by certain numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 8s in the input. For example, in the input, whenever there's an 8, it's replaced with a 7 or 8 depending on some condition. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, in row 2, the input has 8s in positions 9-11. The output has 8s there, but also 7s in positions 12 and 13. Wait, maybe the 8s are being replaced with 7s in certain positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing 8s with 7s in certain regions. For instance, maybe when an 8 is in a certain area of the grid, it's converted to 7. But how to determine that area?\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has 8s in certain positions. The output has 8s and 7s. For example, in the input's row 10, there's an 8 in position 6, and in the output, it's replaced with 7. So maybe the 8s are being replaced with 7s when they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 8s in the input. For example, any 8 in the input is replaced with 7 if it's in a certain region, or if it's surrounded by certain numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing 8s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in the output grids, the 8s in the input are replaced with 7s in some cases and remain 8s in others. Maybe the 8s are replaced with 7s when they are in certain positions relative to other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of adjacent 1s. For example, if an 8 is surrounded by 1s, it's replaced with 7. But how to verify this?\n\nAnother observation: in the output grids, there are 7s in positions where the input had 8s. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in positions 9-11 of row 2. The output has 8s in those positions, but also 7s in positions 12 and 13. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me check.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output for row 2:\n\nOriginal input row 2: 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 8 8 8 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n\nOutput row 2: 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 8 8 8 0 7 0 7 0 8 8 8 0 0 1 0 0\n\nSo in the input, positions 9-11 (indices 9,10,11) are 8,8,8. In the output, they are 8,8,8. Then positions 12 is 0, but in the output, position 12 is 7. Wait, maybe the 7s are appearing in positions that were previously 0s? Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the 7s are replacing 8s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 8s with 7s when they are in certain positions. For example, in the input, the 8s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, and the output replaces them with 7s in some cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing 8s with 7s in certain regions. For example, if the 8 is in a certain area of the grid, like in the middle of a block, it's converted to 7.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 8s are converted to 7s. For example, in Example 1, the output has 7s in positions (row 2, column 13) and (row 2, column 14). Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me check again.\n\nIn the output row 2 of Example 1:\n\nThe input row 2 has 8s in positions 9-11. The output row 2 has 8s in those positions. Then, in the output, position 12 is 7. Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Let me recheck the input and output.\n\nOriginal input row 2 for Example 1:\n\n0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 8 8 8 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n\nOutput row 2:\n\n0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 8 8 8 0 7 0 7 0 8 8 8 0 0 1 0 0\n\nSo the input has 8 in position 9 (index 9?), and the output has 8 in position 9. Then, position 12 (index 12?) in the input is 0. In the output, position 12 is 7. So that's a change from 0 to 7. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 1s in the input. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 1, then it's converted to 7. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 1, the 7s seem to appear in positions that are adjacent to 1s. For example, in row 2, position 13 is 7. The input had a 1 in position 13. Wait, the input's row 2, position 13 is 1. The output's row 2, position 13 is 7. So maybe when a cell is adjacent to a 1, it's converted to 7. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing 0s with 7s if they are in certain positions. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the number of 1s in the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell has a certain number of 1s around it, it's converted to 7. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the 7s are in positions where the input had 0s. For example, in row 2, position 13 is 7 in the output, but in the input it was 1. Wait, no. The input row 2, position 13 is 1. The output is 7. So that's a change from 1 to 7. That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in certain positions. But why?\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is replacing certain numbers with others based on their position in the grid. For example, in the input, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is not part of the training examples. The test input has 0s and 1s and 8s. The output would be generated by the same transformation. But since I can't see the output, I need to focus on the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 8s in the input. For example, when there's an 8 in the input, it's replaced with 7 if it's in a certain region. But how to determine that region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 8s in the input, and replacing them with 7s in certain positions. For example, in the input, the 8s are in certain positions, and the output replaces them with 7s in some cases.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the 8s in the input are replaced with 7s in some positions. For example, in the third row of the input, there's an 8 in position 9. The output has 8 in position 9, but then 0s and 1s. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me check the third row of Example 1:\n\nInput row 3: 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 8 0 8 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n\nOutput row 3: 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 8 0 8 0 0 7 0 0 8 0 8 0 1 1 1 0\n\nSo the input has 8 in position 9 (index 9?), and the output has 8 there. Then, in position 14 (input is 1, output is 7). So again, the 7 is replacing a 1.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the transformation is not based on the value of the cell itself, but on the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 1s, it's replaced with 7. Or if a cell is in a certain pattern, it's replaced with 7.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the transformation changes values. For example, in Example 1's output, the 7s appear in positions that are adjacent to 1s. For example, in row 2, position 13 is 7, and the input has a 1 in that position. Wait, no. The input row 2 has a 1 in position 13. The output has 7 in that position. So maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in certain cases. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in the output, the 7s appear in positions where the input had 1s. But that's not always the case. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 7 in position 13 of row 2, which was a 1 in the input. So maybe that's a pattern.\n\nBut then, in other cases, like in Example 1's row 3, the input has a 1 in position 14 (input row 3, position 14 is 1). The output has 7 in that position. So that seems to fit. So maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in certain positions.\n\nBut why would that be the case? Maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s where they are part of a certain pattern. For example, if a 1 is part of a group of 1s that are in a certain shape, it's replaced with 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 8s. For example, when there's an 8 in the input, it's replaced with 7 in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 1 and has a 8 in a certain direction, it's replaced with 7.\n\nThis is getting a bit too vague. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the positions where the 7s appear in the outputs.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 7s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in row 2, the 7s are in positions 13 and 14. In row 3, the 7 is in position 14. In row 4, the 7s are in positions 13 and 14. In row 5, no 7s. In row 6, there is a 7 in position 13. In row 7, there are 7s in positions 12, 13, 14. Hmm, this seems to form a pattern where the 7s are in certain regions of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 7s are replacing 1s in certain regions. For example, in the input, the 1s are in certain areas, and the output replaces them with 7s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in certain positions, and 8s with 7s in others. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother observation: the output grids have 7s in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the 7s seem to appear in a vertical line in certain rows. Maybe the 7s are replacing 1s in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 8s in the input. For example, whenever there is an 8 in the input, it's replaced with 7 in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 1s in the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell has a certain number of 1s around it, it's replaced with 7.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's look at Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 1s and 8s. The output has 7s and 8s. For example, in the second input row of Example 2:\n\nInput row 2: 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 8 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n\nOutput row 2: 0 1 0 1 0 0 8 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 8 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n\nSo the input has 1s in positions 8-10 (indices 8,9,10?), and the output has 8 in position 6 (index 6?), 7s in positions 9-11, and 8 in position 14.\n\nHmm. This is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output grids, the 7s seem to appear where there are 8s in the input. For example, in Example 1's output, the 8s in the input are sometimes replaced with 7s. But in other cases, they remain 8s. So maybe the transformation is replacing 8s with 7s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 8s with 7s when they are in certain regions. For example, if the 8 is in a certain area of the grid, like the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 8 and has a 1 in a certain direction, it's replaced with 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 8s in the input. For example, when there's an 8 in the input, it's replaced with 7 if it's in a certain pattern.\n\nBut this is all guesswork. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that can explain the examples.\n\nAnother observation: in the output grids, the 7s seem to appear in positions that are adjacent to 8s in the input. For example, in Example 1's output, the 7s are in positions that are adjacent to 8s. For example, in row 2, the 8s are in positions 9-11, and the 7s are in positions 12-14. So maybe the 7s are replacing the 0s that are adjacent to the 8s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's output, there are 7s where the input had 0s. But in other cases, like the input's row 2, position 13 is 1, which becomes 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is 1 and has an 8 in the neighboring cells, it's replaced with 7.\n\nBut how to implement this. Maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s if they are adjacent to 8s.\n\nLet me check Example 1's row 2. The input has 8s in positions 9-11. The cell at position 12 (input is 0) becomes 7 in the output. So if that's because it's adjacent to an 8, then maybe that's the pattern. But why is the cell at position 12 (input is 0) replaced with 7?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 7s if they are adjacent to 8s. But in Example 1's row 2, the cell at position 12 is adjacent to the 8 in position 11. So that cell becomes 7. Similarly, in row 2, position 13 is 1, which becomes 7. But that's adjacent to the 8 in position 11? Or maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s if they are in certain positions. For example, in the output, the 7s appear in positions that are part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 1 and has a 8 in the cell to the right, it's replaced with 7.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of a different approach. Since the output grid must be 17x25, and the input is also 17x25, perhaps the transformation is based on some rule that applies to each cell.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation might be based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 1, and the cell to the right is 8, then it becomes 7. But how to verify this.\n\nLooking at Example 1's row 2, input has 8 in position 9, and the cell to the right is 8 (position 10). The cell at position 11 is 8. The cell at position 12 is 0, which becomes 7 in the output. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 8s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's output, the 8s are replaced with 7s in some positions. But how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the sum of its neighbors. For example, if the sum of the neighbors is greater than a certain value, the cell is replaced with 7.\n\nBut without knowing the exact rule, this is hard.\n\nAnother approach: think of the examples as transformations that replace certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 7s in some of those positions. Maybe the transformation is replacing 8s with 7s in certain regions.\n\nBut how to determine which regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 8s in the input. For example, any cell that is 8 in the input is replaced with 7 if it is in a certain region. But how to determine that region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the value of the cell in a certain direction. For example, if the cell is 1 and the cell to the left is 8, it becomes 7.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be implemented, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLooking at the examples, the output seems to replace 1s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's row 2, the input has 1s in positions 1 and 3, and the output has 1s there. But in other positions, like position 13, the input has 1 and the output has 7.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in certain positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the number of 1s in the row. For example, if a row has a certain number of 1s, then replace some of them with 7s.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is replacing 8s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in the input, 8s are replaced with 7s in certain positions. But how.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 7s in some of those positions. For example, in row 2 of Example 1, the input has 8s in positions 9-11, and the output has 8s there. But in other rows, like row 3, the input has 8s in positions 9 and 11, and the output has 8s there. But in other positions, like position 14, the input has 1 and the output has 7.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the positions where the 7s appear.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 7s appear in positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, in row 2, the 7s are in columns 13 and 14. In row 3, the 7 is in column 14. In row 4, the 7s are in columns 13 and 14. In row 6, the 7 is in column 13. In row 7, the 7s are in columns 12, 13, 14. This seems to form a vertical line of 7s in the middle of the grid.\n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing certain cells in the middle of the grid with 7s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in the middle of the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with 7.\n\nBut how to determine the middle.\n\nThe grid is 17 rows and 25 columns. The middle column would be around column 12 or 13. For example, in Example 1's output, the 7s are in columns 13 and 14, which are near the middle.\n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in certain columns. For example, columns 13 and 14.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row number. For example, if the row is even, replace certain cells with 7s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that can be implemented. For example, replacing 1s with 7s in certain positions.\n\nLooking at the examples, in the output, the 7s appear in certain positions. For example, in row 2 of Example 1, the 7s are in columns 13 and 14. In row 3, it's column 14. In row 4, columns 13 and 14. In row 6, column 13. In row 7, columns 12, 13, 14.\n\nThis suggests that the 7s are in columns 12-14 for certain rows. Maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in those columns.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in columns 13 and 14, but only in certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even and the column is between 12 and 14, replace 1s with 7s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should write a function that replaces 1s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in columns 12-14 for certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 1 and has an 8 in the cell to the left, it becomes 7.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the transformation changes the value from 1 to 7. For example, in Example 1's row 2, position 13 is 1 in the input and 7 in the output. In row 3, position 14 is 1 in the input and 7 in the output. In row 4, position 13 and 14 are 0 in the input and 7 in the output. In row 6, position 13 is 1 in the input and 7 in the output. In row 7, positions 12, 13, 14 are 1 in the input and 7 in the output.\n\nThis suggests that in these positions, the transformation is replacing 1s or 0s with 7s. But why.\n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in certain columns. For example, columns 13 and 14. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in columns 13 and 14 for rows where the row is even or odd.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time, I think the best approach is to implement a transformation that replaces 1s with 7s in certain positions, like columns 12-14 for certain rows. For example, in rows where the row number is even, replace 1s with 7s in columns 12-14.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in columns 12-14 for all rows. But in Example 1's row 2, the input has 1 in column 13, which is replaced with 7. In row 3, input has 1 in column 14, replaced with 7. In row 4, input has 0 in column 13, replaced with 7. This suggests that the transformation is not based on the value of the cell, but on the position.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is replacing certain cells in columns 12-14 with 7s, regardless of their value. But that would mean that in the input, those cells are replaced with 7s. But in Example 1's row 2, the input has 0 in column 13, which becomes 7 in the output. So that would be a possible pattern.\n\nBut why would that be the case? Maybe the transformation is replacing all cells in columns 12-14 with 7s. But that would not fit the examples, since in Example 1's row 2, the input has 8s in columns 9-11, and 0 in column 12, which becomes 7. But the output has 8s in column 9-11, and 7 in column 12.\n\nBut if the transformation is to replace all cells in columns 12-14 with 7s, then that would be the case. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing certain cells in columns 12-14 with 7s based on the surrounding cells. For example, if the cell is in columns 12-14, it's replaced with 7.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that the output grids have 7s in columns 12-14 for certain rows, perhaps the transformation is to replace all cells in those columns with 7s. But that would not fit the examples. For example, in Example 1's row 2, the input has 0 in column 12, which becomes 7. In row 3, the input has 0 in column 12, which becomes 8. Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1's row 3, the input is:\n\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 8 0 8 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n\nSo the input has 8 in column 11 (index 11?), and 8 in column 12 (index 12). The output row 3 is:\n\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 8 0 8 0 0 7 0 0 8 0 8 0 1 1 1 0\n\nSo column 12 (index 12) is 8 in the input and 8 in the output. So that doesn't fit the idea of replacing those columns with 7s.\n\nHmm, this is not working.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation might be based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if the cell is 1 and has an 8 in the cell to the left, it becomes 7. Or something like that.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to make an educated guess and write a function that replaces 1s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in columns 12-14 for certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 8s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in the input, 8s are replaced with 7s if they are in certain rows or columns.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 8s with 7s in certain positions, and 1s with 7s in other positions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 1s with 7s in certain columns. For example, columns 12-14. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1's row 2, the input has 1 in column 13 (index 13?), which becomes 7. In row 3, input has 1 in column 14, which becomes 7. In row 4, input has 0 in column 13, which becomes 7. So this suggests that columns 12-14 are being replaced with 7s.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all cells in columns 12-14 with 7s. Let's see.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's row 2, the input has 0 in column 12, which becomes 7. In row 3, input has 0 in column 12, which becomes 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not based on the column.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if the cell is 1 and has an 8 in the cell to the left, it becomes 7.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the cell to the right. For example, if the cell is 1 and the cell to the right is 8, replace with 7.\n\nBut again, this is a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to implement a function that replaces 1s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in columns 12-14 for rows 2-16 (assuming rows are 0-based).\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in certain positions, like in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in positions where the row is even and the column is between 12-14.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I need to write code, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell in the grid, if it's a 1 and the column is between 12-14, replace it with 7. Also, replace 8s with 7s in certain positions.\n\nBut this is not based on any clear pattern, but it's a possible hypothesis.\n\nSo, the code would look something like:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[cell for cell in row] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(17):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 1 and (12 <= j <= 14):\n                transformed[i][j] = 7\n            elif transformed[i][j] == 8 and (12 <= j <= 14):\n                transformed[i][j] = 7\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, this might not work for all examples. For example, in Example 1's row 2, the input has 1 in column 13, which is replaced with 7. In row 3, the input has 1 in column 14, replaced with 7. In row 4, the input has 0 in column 13, replaced with 7. But in row 3, the input has 8 in column 12, which is replaced with 7. But in the output, it's 8. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in certain positions based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is 1 and has an 8 in the cell to the left, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in certain patterns. For example, in the middle of the grid.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make a guess and write a function that replaces 1s with 7s in certain positions, even if it's not perfect.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in certain rows and columns. For example, in rows 1-16 (assuming 0-based), columns 12-14.\n\nBut again, this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in certain rows. For example, rows where the row number is even.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 1s with 7s in certain positions based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the examples, in the output, the 7s seem to appear in the middle columns (12-14) for certain rows. So maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in columns 12-14 for certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the rows with 7s in columns 12-14 are rows 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\n\nMaybe it's rows where the row number is even or odd.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in columns 12-14 for all rows.\n\nBut in Example 1's row 3, the input has 8 in column 12, which becomes 8 in the output. So this would not work.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in certain positions, and 8s with 7s in other positions, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 8s with 7s in certain positions, and 1s with 7s in others.\n\nBut without more information, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 8s with 7s in certain positions, and 1s with 7s in others.\n\nBut this is not based on any clear pattern.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 1s with 7s in certain columns, like columns 12-14, and 8s with 7s in certain columns.\n\nBut this is a shot in the dark.\n\nFinal answer:\n"

              "reasoning_content": "Okay, I need to figure out the pattern that transforms the input grids to the output grids in the examples provided. Let me start by looking at the examples carefully.\n\nLooking at Example 1, the input and output grids have some differences. For instance, in the first input row, all are 0s, and the output is the same. But in other rows, there are changes. For example, in the second input row, there are 1s and 8s. The output has 1s and 7s and 8s. Wait, in the output, some 8s are replaced with 7s. Hmm. Also, in the third input row, there's an 8 in the middle, and in the output, it's replaced with 0s and 1s. Wait, maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are transformed based on their position or surrounding values.\n\nLooking at Example 2, the input has 1s and 8s, and the output has 7s and 8s. For example, in the second input row, there's a 1 followed by 0s and then 1s. The output has 1s, 8s, and 7s. Maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their position or neighboring cells.\n\nAnother thing I notice is that in the output grids, there are 7s and 8s where there were 8s in the input. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 8s and 7s. Maybe 8s are being replaced with 7s in some cases, but not all. Or perhaps there's a pattern where 8s are converted to 7s when they are in certain regions.\n\nWait, looking at Example 1's output, in the second row, the input has 8s in positions 9-11. The output has 8s there, but also some 7s. For example, in the output row 2, the 8s are in positions 9-11, but there are 7s in positions 12 and 13. Maybe there's a pattern where certain numbers are replaced based on their neighbors or their position in the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing certain numbers with others based on their position. For instance, in the input, 8s might be replaced with 7s if they are in certain areas. But how to determine that?\n\nAnother approach: look for patterns in the positions where numbers change. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 8s and 7s. Maybe 8s are converted to 7s when they are surrounded by certain numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 8s in the input. For example, in the input, whenever there's an 8, it's replaced with a 7 or 8 depending on some condition. But how?\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, in row 2, the input has 8s in positions 9-11. The output has 8s there, but also 7s in positions 12 and 13. Wait, maybe the 8s are being replaced with 7s in certain positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing 8s with 7s in certain regions. For instance, maybe when an 8 is in a certain area of the grid, it's converted to 7. But how to determine that area?\n\nLooking at Example 3, the input has 8s in certain positions. The output has 8s and 7s. For example, in the input's row 10, there's an 8 in position 6, and in the output, it's replaced with 7. So maybe the 8s are being replaced with 7s when they are in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 8s in the input. For example, any 8 in the input is replaced with 7 if it's in a certain region, or if it's surrounded by certain numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing 8s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in the output grids, the 8s in the input are replaced with 7s in some cases and remain 8s in others. Maybe the 8s are replaced with 7s when they are in certain positions relative to other numbers.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of adjacent 1s. For example, if an 8 is surrounded by 1s, it's replaced with 7. But how to verify this?\n\nAnother observation: in the output grids, there are 7s in positions where the input had 8s. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in positions 9-11 of row 2. The output has 8s in those positions, but also 7s in positions 12 and 13. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me check.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output for row 2:\n\nOriginal input row 2: 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 8 8 8 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n\nOutput row 2: 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 8 8 8 0 7 0 7 0 8 8 8 0 0 1 0 0\n\nSo in the input, positions 9-11 (indices 9,10,11) are 8,8,8. In the output, they are 8,8,8. Then positions 12 is 0, but in the output, position 12 is 7. Wait, maybe the 7s are appearing in positions that were previously 0s? Or maybe not. Alternatively, maybe the 7s are replacing 8s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 8s with 7s when they are in certain positions. For example, in the input, the 8s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern, and the output replaces them with 7s in some cases.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation involves replacing 8s with 7s in certain regions. For example, if the 8 is in a certain area of the grid, like in the middle of a block, it's converted to 7.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where 8s are converted to 7s. For example, in Example 1, the output has 7s in positions (row 2, column 13) and (row 2, column 14). Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me check again.\n\nIn the output row 2 of Example 1:\n\nThe input row 2 has 8s in positions 9-11. The output row 2 has 8s in those positions. Then, in the output, position 12 is 7. Wait, maybe that's a mistake. Let me recheck the input and output.\n\nOriginal input row 2 for Example 1:\n\n0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 8 8 8 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 0\n\nOutput row 2:\n\n0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 8 8 8 0 7 0 7 0 8 8 8 0 0 1 0 0\n\nSo the input has 8 in position 9 (index 9?), and the output has 8 in position 9. Then, position 12 (index 12?) in the input is 0. In the output, position 12 is 7. So that's a change from 0 to 7. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 1s in the input. For example, if a cell is adjacent to a 1, then it's converted to 7. But that's just a guess.\n\nAnother observation: in the output of Example 1, the 7s seem to appear in positions that are adjacent to 1s. For example, in row 2, position 13 is 7. The input had a 1 in position 13. Wait, the input's row 2, position 13 is 1. The output's row 2, position 13 is 7. So maybe when a cell is adjacent to a 1, it's converted to 7. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation involves replacing 0s with 7s if they are in certain positions. But that doesn't fit the examples.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the number of 1s in the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell has a certain number of 1s around it, it's converted to 7. But this is getting complicated.\n\nAlternatively, looking at the output of Example 1, the 7s are in positions where the input had 0s. For example, in row 2, position 13 is 7 in the output, but in the input it was 1. Wait, no. The input row 2, position 13 is 1. The output is 7. So that's a change from 1 to 7. That's confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in certain positions. But why?\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the transformation is replacing certain numbers with others based on their position in the grid. For example, in the input, if a cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value.\n\nLooking at the test input, which is not part of the training examples. The test input has 0s and 1s and 8s. The output would be generated by the same transformation. But since I can't see the output, I need to focus on the training examples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 8s in the input. For example, when there's an 8 in the input, it's replaced with 7 if it's in a certain region. But how to determine that region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 8s in the input, and replacing them with 7s in certain positions. For example, in the input, the 8s are in certain positions, and the output replaces them with 7s in some cases.\n\nLooking at Example 1's output, the 8s in the input are replaced with 7s in some positions. For example, in the third row of the input, there's an 8 in position 9. The output has 8 in position 9, but then 0s and 1s. Wait, maybe that's not the case. Let me check the third row of Example 1:\n\nInput row 3: 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 8 0 8 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n\nOutput row 3: 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 8 0 8 0 0 7 0 0 8 0 8 0 1 1 1 0\n\nSo the input has 8 in position 9 (index 9?), and the output has 8 there. Then, in position 14 (input is 1, output is 7). So again, the 7 is replacing a 1.\n\nHmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the transformation is not based on the value of the cell itself, but on the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is surrounded by 1s, it's replaced with 7. Or if a cell is in a certain pattern, it's replaced with 7.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the transformation changes values. For example, in Example 1's output, the 7s appear in positions that are adjacent to 1s. For example, in row 2, position 13 is 7, and the input has a 1 in that position. Wait, no. The input row 2 has a 1 in position 13. The output has 7 in that position. So maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in certain cases. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in the output, the 7s appear in positions where the input had 1s. But that's not always the case. For example, in Example 1, the output has a 7 in position 13 of row 2, which was a 1 in the input. So maybe that's a pattern.\n\nBut then, in other cases, like in Example 1's row 3, the input has a 1 in position 14 (input row 3, position 14 is 1). The output has 7 in that position. So that seems to fit. So maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in certain positions.\n\nBut why would that be the case? Maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s where they are part of a certain pattern. For example, if a 1 is part of a group of 1s that are in a certain shape, it's replaced with 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 8s. For example, when there's an 8 in the input, it's replaced with 7 in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 1 and has a 8 in a certain direction, it's replaced with 7.\n\nThis is getting a bit too vague. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the positions where the 7s appear in the outputs.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 7s are in positions that are part of a certain pattern. For example, in row 2, the 7s are in positions 13 and 14. In row 3, the 7 is in position 14. In row 4, the 7s are in positions 13 and 14. In row 5, no 7s. In row 6, there is a 7 in position 13. In row 7, there are 7s in positions 12, 13, 14. Hmm, this seems to form a pattern where the 7s are in certain regions of the grid.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the 7s are replacing 1s in certain regions. For example, in the input, the 1s are in certain areas, and the output replaces them with 7s. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in certain positions, and 8s with 7s in others. But how to determine that.\n\nAnother observation: the output grids have 7s in positions that are part of a certain shape. For example, in Example 1, the 7s seem to appear in a vertical line in certain rows. Maybe the 7s are replacing 1s in certain regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 8s in the input. For example, whenever there is an 8 in the input, it's replaced with 7 in certain positions. But how?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the number of 1s in the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell has a certain number of 1s around it, it's replaced with 7.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to see. Let's look at Example 2.\n\nIn Example 2, the input has 1s and 8s. The output has 7s and 8s. For example, in the second input row of Example 2:\n\nInput row 2: 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 8 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n\nOutput row 2: 0 1 0 1 0 0 8 0 0 7 7 7 0 0 8 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n\nSo the input has 1s in positions 8-10 (indices 8,9,10?), and the output has 8 in position 6 (index 6?), 7s in positions 9-11, and 8 in position 14.\n\nHmm. This is getting too complicated. Maybe there's a different approach.\n\nAnother idea: looking at the output grids, the 7s seem to appear where there are 8s in the input. For example, in Example 1's output, the 8s in the input are sometimes replaced with 7s. But in other cases, they remain 8s. So maybe the transformation is replacing 8s with 7s in certain positions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 8s with 7s when they are in certain regions. For example, if the 8 is in a certain area of the grid, like the middle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with a certain value. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 8 and has a 1 in a certain direction, it's replaced with 7.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 8s in the input. For example, when there's an 8 in the input, it's replaced with 7 if it's in a certain pattern.\n\nBut this is all guesswork. Maybe I should try to find a pattern that can explain the examples.\n\nAnother observation: in the output grids, the 7s seem to appear in positions that are adjacent to 8s in the input. For example, in Example 1's output, the 7s are in positions that are adjacent to 8s. For example, in row 2, the 8s are in positions 9-11, and the 7s are in positions 12-14. So maybe the 7s are replacing the 0s that are adjacent to the 8s. But that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's output, there are 7s where the input had 0s. But in other cases, like the input's row 2, position 13 is 1, which becomes 7. So that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the surrounding cells. For example, if a cell is 1 and has an 8 in the neighboring cells, it's replaced with 7.\n\nBut how to implement this. Maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s if they are adjacent to 8s.\n\nLet me check Example 1's row 2. The input has 8s in positions 9-11. The cell at position 12 (input is 0) becomes 7 in the output. So if that's because it's adjacent to an 8, then maybe that's the pattern. But why is the cell at position 12 (input is 0) replaced with 7?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 0s with 7s if they are adjacent to 8s. But in Example 1's row 2, the cell at position 12 is adjacent to the 8 in position 11. So that cell becomes 7. Similarly, in row 2, position 13 is 1, which becomes 7. But that's adjacent to the 8 in position 11? Or maybe not.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s if they are in certain positions. For example, in the output, the 7s appear in positions that are part of a certain pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 1 and has a 8 in the cell to the right, it's replaced with 7.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe I should think of a different approach. Since the output grid must be 17x25, and the input is also 17x25, perhaps the transformation is based on some rule that applies to each cell.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation might be based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 1, and the cell to the right is 8, then it becomes 7. But how to verify this.\n\nLooking at Example 1's row 2, input has 8 in position 9, and the cell to the right is 8 (position 10). The cell at position 11 is 8. The cell at position 12 is 0, which becomes 7 in the output. So maybe that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 8s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's output, the 8s are replaced with 7s in some positions. But how.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the sum of its neighbors. For example, if the sum of the neighbors is greater than a certain value, the cell is replaced with 7.\n\nBut without knowing the exact rule, this is hard.\n\nAnother approach: think of the examples as transformations that replace certain patterns. For example, in Example 1, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 7s in some of those positions. Maybe the transformation is replacing 8s with 7s in certain regions.\n\nBut how to determine which regions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the presence of 8s in the input. For example, any cell that is 8 in the input is replaced with 7 if it is in a certain region. But how to determine that region.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the position of the cell in the grid. For example, if the cell is in a certain row or column, it's replaced with 7.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the value of the cell in a certain direction. For example, if the cell is 1 and the cell to the left is 8, it becomes 7.\n\nBut again, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should look for a pattern that can be implemented, even if it's not perfect.\n\nLooking at the examples, the output seems to replace 1s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in Example 1's row 2, the input has 1s in positions 1 and 3, and the output has 1s there. But in other positions, like position 13, the input has 1 and the output has 7.\n\nSo maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in certain positions. But why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the transformation is based on the number of 1s in the row. For example, if a row has a certain number of 1s, then replace some of them with 7s.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is replacing 8s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in the input, 8s are replaced with 7s in certain positions. But how.\n\nIn Example 1, the input has 8s in certain positions, and the output has 7s in some of those positions. For example, in row 2 of Example 1, the input has 8s in positions 9-11, and the output has 8s there. But in other rows, like row 3, the input has 8s in positions 9 and 11, and the output has 8s there. But in other positions, like position 14, the input has 1 and the output has 7.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern in the positions where the 7s appear.\n\nIn Example 1's output, the 7s appear in positions that are in the middle of the grid. For example, in row 2, the 7s are in columns 13 and 14. In row 3, the 7 is in column 14. In row 4, the 7s are in columns 13 and 14. In row 6, the 7 is in column 13. In row 7, the 7s are in columns 12, 13, 14. This seems to form a vertical line of 7s in the middle of the grid.\n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing certain cells in the middle of the grid with 7s. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in the middle of the grid. For example, if the cell is in the middle of the grid, it's replaced with 7.\n\nBut how to determine the middle.\n\nThe grid is 17 rows and 25 columns. The middle column would be around column 12 or 13. For example, in Example 1's output, the 7s are in columns 13 and 14, which are near the middle.\n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in certain columns. For example, columns 13 and 14.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row number. For example, if the row is even, replace certain cells with 7s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, perhaps I should try to find a pattern that can be implemented. For example, replacing 1s with 7s in certain positions.\n\nLooking at the examples, in the output, the 7s appear in certain positions. For example, in row 2 of Example 1, the 7s are in columns 13 and 14. In row 3, it's column 14. In row 4, columns 13 and 14. In row 6, column 13. In row 7, columns 12, 13, 14.\n\nThis suggests that the 7s are in columns 12-14 for certain rows. Maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in those columns.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in columns 13 and 14, but only in certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the row and column indices. For example, if the row is even and the column is between 12 and 14, replace 1s with 7s.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps I should write a function that replaces 1s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in columns 12-14 for certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if a cell is 1 and has an 8 in the cell to the left, it becomes 7.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAnother approach: look for the positions where the transformation changes the value from 1 to 7. For example, in Example 1's row 2, position 13 is 1 in the input and 7 in the output. In row 3, position 14 is 1 in the input and 7 in the output. In row 4, position 13 and 14 are 0 in the input and 7 in the output. In row 6, position 13 is 1 in the input and 7 in the output. In row 7, positions 12, 13, 14 are 1 in the input and 7 in the output.\n\nThis suggests that in these positions, the transformation is replacing 1s or 0s with 7s. But why.\n\nMaybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in certain columns. For example, columns 13 and 14. But how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in columns 13 and 14 for rows where the row is even or odd.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time, I think the best approach is to implement a transformation that replaces 1s with 7s in certain positions, like columns 12-14 for certain rows. For example, in rows where the row number is even, replace 1s with 7s in columns 12-14.\n\nBut how to verify this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing 1s with 7s in columns 12-14 for all rows. But in Example 1's row 2, the input has 1 in column 13, which is replaced with 7. In row 3, input has 1 in column 14, replaced with 7. In row 4, input has 0 in column 13, replaced with 7. This suggests that the transformation is not based on the value of the cell, but on the position.\n\nSo perhaps the transformation is replacing certain cells in columns 12-14 with 7s, regardless of their value. But that would mean that in the input, those cells are replaced with 7s. But in Example 1's row 2, the input has 0 in column 13, which becomes 7 in the output. So that would be a possible pattern.\n\nBut why would that be the case? Maybe the transformation is replacing all cells in columns 12-14 with 7s. But that would not fit the examples, since in Example 1's row 2, the input has 8s in columns 9-11, and 0 in column 12, which becomes 7. But the output has 8s in column 9-11, and 7 in column 12.\n\nBut if the transformation is to replace all cells in columns 12-14 with 7s, then that would be the case. But why?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is replacing certain cells in columns 12-14 with 7s based on the surrounding cells. For example, if the cell is in columns 12-14, it's replaced with 7.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that the output grids have 7s in columns 12-14 for certain rows, perhaps the transformation is to replace all cells in those columns with 7s. But that would not fit the examples. For example, in Example 1's row 2, the input has 0 in column 12, which becomes 7. In row 3, the input has 0 in column 12, which becomes 8. Wait, no. Let me check.\n\nIn Example 1's row 3, the input is:\n\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 8 0 8 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0\n\nSo the input has 8 in column 11 (index 11?), and 8 in column 12 (index 12). The output row 3 is:\n\n0 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 8 0 8 0 0 7 0 0 8 0 8 0 1 1 1 0\n\nSo column 12 (index 12) is 8 in the input and 8 in the output. So that doesn't fit the idea of replacing those columns with 7s.\n\nHmm, this is not working.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation might be based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if the cell is 1 and has an 8 in the cell to the left, it becomes 7. Or something like that.\n\nBut without more examples, it's hard to say.\n\nGiven the time, I think I need to make an educated guess and write a function that replaces 1s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in columns 12-14 for certain rows.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 8s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in the input, 8s are replaced with 7s if they are in certain rows or columns.\n\nBut how.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 8s with 7s in certain positions, and 1s with 7s in other positions.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 1s with 7s in certain columns. For example, columns 12-14. Let's see.\n\nIn Example 1's row 2, the input has 1 in column 13 (index 13?), which becomes 7. In row 3, input has 1 in column 14, which becomes 7. In row 4, input has 0 in column 13, which becomes 7. So this suggests that columns 12-14 are being replaced with 7s.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace all cells in columns 12-14 with 7s. Let's see.\n\nFor example, in Example 1's row 2, the input has 0 in column 12, which becomes 7. In row 3, input has 0 in column 12, which becomes 8. So that doesn't fit.\n\nThis suggests that the transformation is not based on the column.\n\nAnother idea: the transformation is based on the value of the cell and its neighbors. For example, if the cell is 1 and has an 8 in the cell to the left, it becomes 7.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is based on the value of the cell and the cell to the right. For example, if the cell is 1 and the cell to the right is 8, replace with 7.\n\nBut again, this is a guess.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll try to implement a function that replaces 1s with 7s in certain positions. For example, in columns 12-14 for rows 2-16 (assuming rows are 0-based).\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in certain positions, like in the middle of the grid.\n\nBut how to determine that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in positions where the row is even and the column is between 12-14.\n\nBut this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that I need to write code, I'll proceed with the following approach: for each cell in the grid, if it's a 1 and the column is between 12-14, replace it with 7. Also, replace 8s with 7s in certain positions.\n\nBut this is not based on any clear pattern, but it's a possible hypothesis.\n\nSo, the code would look something like:\n\ndef transform(grid):\n    transformed = [[cell for cell in row] for row in grid]\n    for i in range(17):\n        for j in range(25):\n            if transformed[i][j] == 1 and (12 <= j <= 14):\n                transformed[i][j] = 7\n            elif transformed[i][j] == 8 and (12 <= j <= 14):\n                transformed[i][j] = 7\n    return transformed\n\nBut this is just a guess. However, this might not work for all examples. For example, in Example 1's row 2, the input has 1 in column 13, which is replaced with 7. In row 3, the input has 1 in column 14, replaced with 7. In row 4, the input has 0 in column 13, replaced with 7. But in row 3, the input has 8 in column 12, which is replaced with 7. But in the output, it's 8. So this hypothesis is incorrect.\n\nSo this approach is not working.\n\nAnother idea: maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in certain positions based on their neighbors. For example, if a cell is 1 and has an 8 in the cell to the left, replace with 7.\n\nBut how to implement this.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in certain patterns. For example, in the middle of the grid.\n\nGiven that I'm stuck, I'll have to make a guess and write a function that replaces 1s with 7s in certain positions, even if it's not perfect.\n\nPerhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in certain rows and columns. For example, in rows 1-16 (assuming 0-based), columns 12-14.\n\nBut again, this is a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in certain rows. For example, rows where the row number is even.\n\nBut I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 1s with 7s in certain positions based on the examples.\n\nLooking at the examples, in the output, the 7s seem to appear in the middle columns (12-14) for certain rows. So maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in columns 12-14 for certain rows.\n\nBut how to determine which rows.\n\nIn Example 1, the rows with 7s in columns 12-14 are rows 2, 3, 4, 6, 7.\n\nMaybe it's rows where the row number is even or odd.\n\nBut this is not clear.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in columns 12-14 for all rows.\n\nBut in Example 1's row 3, the input has 8 in column 12, which becomes 8 in the output. So this would not work.\n\nGiven that I'm not able to find a clear pattern, I'll have to make an educated guess. Perhaps the transformation is to replace 1s with 7s in certain positions, and 8s with 7s in other positions, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the transformation is to replace 8s with 7s in certain positions, and 1s with 7s in others.\n\nBut without more information, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 8s with 7s in certain positions, and 1s with 7s in others.\n\nBut this is not based on any clear pattern.\n\nGiven the time, I'll proceed to write a function that replaces 1s with 7s in certain columns, like columns 12-14, and 8s with 7s in certain columns.\n\nBut this is a shot in the dark.\n\nFinal answer:\n"
