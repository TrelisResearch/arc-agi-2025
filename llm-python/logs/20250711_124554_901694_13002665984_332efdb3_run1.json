          "Observations from training examples:\n\n- All inputs are grids full of 0.\n- All outputs have the same dimensions as the input.\n- The output grid consists of mostly 1s (blue cells), except some 0s (black cells).\n- The output forms a pattern of:\n  - A full frame (border) of 1s.\n  - Inside the frame, rows alternate:\n    - Odd rows (1-based) are all 1s (a line of 1s).\n    - Even rows have a pattern: cells alternate 1 and 0, starting with 0 at column 1 (0-based indexing)\n- Specifically, for columns inside the frame:\n  - The cells at even columns (0-based indexing) inside those even rows are set to 0.\n  - The rest remain 1.\n  \nHence the overall rules are:\n\n- Frame (first and last row and column) = 1\n- Inside frame:\n  - Odd rows = all 1\n  - Even rows = 1 at odd columns, 0 at even columns\n  \nNote:\n\n- The input size varies but the output keeps the input size.\n- The output has this alternating checkerboard pattern inside the frame.\n\nThe function must always produce a 7x7 output grid regardless of input size. So this means we ignore the input size and create a 7x7 grid with the pattern above.\n\n---\n\nPlan for code:\n\n1. Create a 7x7 grid of 1s.\n2. For every cell inside the frame (rows 1..5, cols 1..5):\n   - If row is even (0-based) and column is even (0-based), set cell to 0.\n   - Else leave 1.\n\nNote on indexing:\n\n- Row and col 0 and 6 (0-based) are frames=1\n- Rows 1..5 and cols 1..5 apply the pattern.\n\nUsing zero-based row and column indices:\n\n- Frame: row in {0,6} or col in {0,6}\n- Inside frame: rows 1 to 5, cols 1 to 5\n- Inside frame row numbers (1-based for easier comparison with examples):\n\n  odd rows (1,3,5): all 1s  \n  even rows (2,4): cells alternate 1 and 0 starting with 0 at col 1\n\nConverting to zero-based inside frame rows:\n\n- row=1 -> odd row, all 1  \n- row=2 -> even row, pattern 0 1 0 1 0 at columns 1..5 (col 1 zero-based inside frame at col=1), so col even = 0 cell.\n\nWait we need a consistent formula.\n\nActually in the examples 0-based indexing:\n\n- Rows 0 and 6: frame 1\n- Rows 1,3,5: all 1 inside frame\n- Rows 2,4: cells inside frame: columns with even index inside frame are 0, odd index inside frame cells are 1\n\nTherefore:\n\nInside frame at rows 2 or 4 (0-based):\n\n- For cols in 1..5:\n  - if (col - 1) % 2 == 0: set 0,\n  - else 1\n\nRest cells 1.\n\n---\n\nFinal implementation idea:\n\n- Create 7x7 grid full of 1\n- For rows 1..5:\n  - if row in [2,4]:\n    - for cols 1..5:\n      - if (col-1)%2 == 0: set 0\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create a fixed 7x7 output grid of all 1s\n    transformed_grid = [[1 for _ in range(7)] for __ in range(7)]\n    # Rows 1..5 inclusive, cols 1..5 inclusive are inside the frame\n    for r in range(1, 6):\n        if r in [2,4]:  # zero-based, these rows have zeros at even columns inside frame\n            for c in range(1, 6):\n                if (c - 1) % 2 == 0:\n                    transformed_grid[r][c] = 0\n    return transformed_grid\n```\n"
