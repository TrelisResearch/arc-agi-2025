Outputs are grids of the same size as input, where:\n   - The entire grid is filled with 1s as a base.\n   - On this base, some 0s are placed in a checkerboard pattern on every second row and column.\n   - More specifically:\n       - All odd rows (1-based indexing) have 0 at all even columns, and 1 otherwise.\n       - All even rows are all 1s.\n   - Or in 0-based indexing:\n       - Rows with odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) have zeros on even columns (0, 2, 4, ...).\n       - Rows with even indices are entirely ones.\n\n3. This pattern holds for various input sizes (5x5, 7x7, 9x9).\n\n4. The transformation is independent of input content except for the dimension. The input is always zero-filled; the output is a checkerboard frame built on 1s with zero \"holes.\"\n\n5. The problem states the output must always be 7x7, regardless of input size. Therefore, the transformation must produce a 7x7 pattern as per the described rules.\n\n**Summary:**\n\n- Output grid size = 7x7 regardless of input.\n- Output grid filled with 1s.\n- For rows with odd indices (1,3,5), positions at even columns (0,2,4,6) are 0s.\n- All other positions are 1.\n\nHere is the Python function implementing this logic:\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # We always produce a 7x7 output\n    rows, cols = 7, 7\n    output = [[1 for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]\n    for r in range(rows):\n        # For odd rows (1-based indexing odd means r%2==1 in 0-based)\n        if r % 2 == 1:\n            for c in range(cols):\n                # At even columns, place 0\n                if c % 2 == 0:\n                    output[r][c] = 0\n    return output\n```"
