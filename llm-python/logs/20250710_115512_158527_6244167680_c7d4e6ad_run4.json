          "Let's analyze the patterns carefully:\n\n**Observations from the training examples:**\n\n1. Each example has 10x10 grids.\n2. The vertical strip at the left side contains colored blocks of distinct colors stacked vertically.\n3. The gray shapes inside the grid represent the \"main figure\".\n4. In the output:\n   - The left vertical colored strip remains mostly unchanged.\n   - The gray shape is replaced by a shape of the *color taken from the left strip* but applied differently.\n   - In the first example, the gray shape inside becomes colored with the **color of the leftmost vertical color strip** in each horizontal segment that corresponds.\n     - Basically gray blocks on the right are replaced with the color of the vertical block on the left at the same row.\n   - In the second example, similarly, gray cells take the color of the vertical left strip in their row.\n5. So the pattern is: \n   - For any non-0 cell inside the shape area (which is gray, color 5 in the original input), replace that cell color with the color from the leftmost nonzero cell in the same row (the vertical strip).\n   - The vertical strip itself is preserved as is.\n   - All 0's remain 0.\n\n**From the visual pattern:**\n\n- The vertical strips contain nonzero colors.\n- The gray shape in input (color 5) is replaced with the color of the left strip cell on the corresponding row.\n- The vertical strip colors do not change.\n- Areas that were other colors stay same except the gray shape replaced with left strip color on that row.\n\n**Summarizing the transformation:**\n\n- For each cell in the row:\n  - If the cell is part of the shape (probably color 5, gray), replace it with the left strip color in the same row (the first non-zero color in that row from the left strip).\n  - Else keep it as is.\n- The left strip column acts as a \"color key\" for each row and recolors the gray shape accordingly.\n\nWe will implement this logic now.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create output grid initialized as input copy\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    for r in range(10):\n        # Find the left strip color in the row (assumed to be first nonzero in columns 0 to 3)\n        # According to training, the left strip is in col 0 only actually.\n        left_color = 0\n        for c in range(4):\n            if grid[r][c] != 0:\n                left_color = grid[r][c]\n                break\n        \n        # Recolor cells in the row:\n        # The shape to be recolored seems to be color 5 (gray)\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                # Replace gray by left_color\n                transformed[r][c] = left_color\n            else:\n                # Keep original color\n                transformed[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n            \n    return transformed\n```\n"

              "Let's analyze the patterns carefully:\n\n**Observations from the training examples:**\n\n1. Each example has 10x10 grids.\n2. The vertical strip at the left side contains colored blocks of distinct colors stacked vertically.\n3. The gray shapes inside the grid represent the \"main figure\".\n4. In the output:\n   - The left vertical colored strip remains mostly unchanged.\n   - The gray shape is replaced by a shape of the *color taken from the left strip* but applied differently.\n   - In the first example, the gray shape inside becomes colored with the **color of the leftmost vertical color strip** in each horizontal segment that corresponds.\n     - Basically gray blocks on the right are replaced with the color of the vertical block on the left at the same row.\n   - In the second example, similarly, gray cells take the color of the vertical left strip in their row.\n5. So the pattern is: \n   - For any non-0 cell inside the shape area (which is gray, color 5 in the original input), replace that cell color with the color from the leftmost nonzero cell in the same row (the vertical strip).\n   - The vertical strip itself is preserved as is.\n   - All 0's remain 0.\n\n**From the visual pattern:**\n\n- The vertical strips contain nonzero colors.\n- The gray shape in input (color 5) is replaced with the color of the left strip cell on the corresponding row.\n- The vertical strip colors do not change.\n- Areas that were other colors stay same except the gray shape replaced with left strip color on that row.\n\n**Summarizing the transformation:**\n\n- For each cell in the row:\n  - If the cell is part of the shape (probably color 5, gray), replace it with the left strip color in the same row (the first non-zero color in that row from the left strip).\n  - Else keep it as is.\n- The left strip column acts as a \"color key\" for each row and recolors the gray shape accordingly.\n\nWe will implement this logic now.\n\n---\n\nFinal answer:\n```python\ndef transform(grid):\n    # Create output grid initialized as input copy\n    transformed = [row[:] for row in grid]\n    \n    for r in range(10):\n        # Find the left strip color in the row (assumed to be first nonzero in columns 0 to 3)\n        # According to training, the left strip is in col 0 only actually.\n        left_color = 0\n        for c in range(4):\n            if grid[r][c] != 0:\n                left_color = grid[r][c]\n                break\n        \n        # Recolor cells in the row:\n        # The shape to be recolored seems to be color 5 (gray)\n        for c in range(10):\n            if grid[r][c] == 5:\n                # Replace gray by left_color\n                transformed[r][c] = left_color\n            else:\n                # Keep original color\n                transformed[r][c] = grid[r][c]\n            \n    return transformed\n```\n"
